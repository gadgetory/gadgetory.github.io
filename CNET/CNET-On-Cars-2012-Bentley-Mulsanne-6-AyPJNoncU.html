the LeMond racecourse kind of a cheeky
thing for a car that is some 16 feet
long
some three tons of girth some 700
foot-pounds of torque this in many ways
is the ultimate Bentley and ours says
some of the most trick tech you'll find
in any backseat on earth let's drive
this 2012 Mulsanne and check the tap
now the ball Zen is a far less known
Bentley compared to the Continental GT
which is in every rap video and CEOs
driveway from coast to coast and around
the globe this guy's a rarer bird but
has some similar athletic lines
including this very coupe like D pillar
back here and also this kind of powerful
hunched line back here which is a
Bentley signature they call it the power
line or something spa tables and
thousands of yards away by its very
evocative giant dual headlights reaching
back to the look of Bentley's in ws days
and the fenders and quarter panels with
all these complicated creases and shapes
are largely one-piece they do some nice
aluminum forming on this car
McLean's can be used as a car you drive
but they can also be a car in which you
are driven that's where the backseat
comes in phenomenal let's go to what you
may think is your usual picnic table
even Jaguars have these but it's not
just a picnic table that is powered but
if you push this button on the corner we
have the optional integrated iPad with
the wireless keyboard pretty slick and
of course the iPad here is 3G so it's
got its own connection but that's part
of a theme where this is primarily
clever fitment more than technology now
the other interesting piece of
technology in this car lives in the
center console we don't have all the
goodies but we do have our own climate
system our own reclining massage seats
and you can get a cooler back here
basically a champagne fridge with a
frosted glass front door that has the
bottles canted in such a way that a
partly consumed bottle won't spill CHP
is going to love that and you've also
got a remote here so you can run the
front head unit I can change the
channels I can change the volume I can
drive the first row people nuts and this
isn't even all the toys folks if you get
the theater option you end up with a
15.6 inch center display that shows up
here and all that ties into the cars
system and to a Mac Mini they mount in
the trunk and it's connected wirelessly
and if that's not enough everywhere you
look here and in the front nice cast
metal polished ashtrays this is another
world
before we examine the usual technology
in this Bentley let's examine the
tactile technology as they like to say
everything that looks like something in
this car is what it looks like leather
obviously is leather polish steel this
is actually polished steel these look
like glass covers on some of these
buttons they're cold they are glass and
even these little poles here for the
vents they feel it they're pulling some
kind of a valve back there to open the
air but they're actually not
they're just electric switches but they
dip into them to feel like they're
pulling a valve in an older car now we
get to the real hardcore tech by pushing
the screen button and double-oh-seven
esque you get a peekaboo screen many of
you will recognize that as a slightly
older outtie interface 8-inch screen
non-touch you've got a knob to turn here
you got a little mushroom button in the
middle you can move around it's just a
little bit too fussy for my taste
for buttons around here that correspond
to four menus in the corner of the
screen and then of course your dedicated
buttons around it all the major media
sources though are without apology
you've got everything you'd want in this
car bluetooth streaming am/fm with HD
radio switchable satellite radio over
here you've got your option for let's
see a six disc CD two SD cards and then
if you want to hook up other options
here in this nicely lacquered lined tray
you've got one of these little pigtails
it goes to the Audi media interface and
this one for examples for iOS devices
older iOS devices of course plays DVDs
as well when you're parked and you've
got good meta tag information while
streaming at least on my Android 4.0.4
device on our day of shooting we have
the optional name audio system high-end
English stuff gives us 20 speakers
around the cabin 2200 watts of power
however the problem with high-end audio
systems that really are high resolution
is they make low res sources sound even
crappier I'm looking at you satellite
radio rear camera is good nothing
cutting edge here though it gives you
some trajectory it gives you distance
and you can also change it up to be for
either alignment of parking oh by the
way check out the TAC notice anything
odd about it the redline 4500 rpm what
is
the UPS truck that's the kind of grunt
they've built into that motor
it's not about thrashing it it's about
low-end torque from the get
and nestled here in the bow of our bowls
and is one hell of an engine 6.75 litre
twin-turbo v8 doing 505 horsepower and
752 foot-pounds of torque that's enough
for three normal cars you've got to have
that though because this guy weighs damn
near 6000 pounds yet it gets to 60 in a
spritely 5.1 seconds
the downside is the mpg 11:18 there is a
gas guzzler tax as you might imagine and
I think we're averaging about seven in
the real world another interesting note
about these these guys are all
hand-built old Steve Brown put this one
together hopefully he had a fireproof
apron because when this car is running
you can't touch anything north of the
doors if you hit a pedestrian I'm not
sure you're going to kill them or cook
them oh by the way this car has cylinder
deactivation it can shut a few of them
down when cruising to save gas imagine
what it would consume if it didn't it's
a nice place to be
driving this car is not so much driving
even when you are at the wheel as much
as it is being transported you're so
separate from the world on the road
which has its ups and down it has
massive power of course but you've got
to unbury yourself from so many gears in
this automatic even when it's in sport
mode like I have it now it always feels
pretty not ready to run and this car
porpoise is quite a bit as you get the
power on forever the hood is rearing up
and dropping down which is kind of a
real old-school thing that said it feels
light on its feet for the kind of car
that it is now what this car is really
about is about changing the very nature
about getting from here to there the way
you know it in other cars is completely
different in this car you almost arrived
energized from the experience of driving
and I'm not make
and I must also say Bentley has done a
really nice job of making a cohesive
design language across this cabin
there's a consistency of quality feel
throughout for this price there better
be so in sum it's a car that transports
you more than being about driving it
doesn't do a whole lot for me as a
driver's car that's asking a lot of it
this car wants to be used as a motor car
not a sports car okay we're gonna price
this guy you better sit down base is 345
320 gas guzzler tax 3700 destination 25
95 to get the iPads on those powered
picnic tables with keyboards and a
wireless hotspot as well add thirty
three six or really go CNET style and
step it up to what they call the theater
spec that includes a whole ipad package
but also the big drop down center screen
with that champagne fridge a 64 gig iPod
Touch and a Mac Mini in the trunk that
lives in its own electric power drawer
wireless keyboard and mouse that raises
the option total to fifty eight thousand
dollars and now you're somewhere north
of 409
