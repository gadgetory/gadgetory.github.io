of iOS 7 with enhancements for both
iPhone and iPad let's start with the
phone now in iOS 8 we've refined
Notification Center but what I really
love our new interactive notifications
so now if you get a message like this
just pull down and you can reply right
where you are you don't have to leave
the app you're in and this works for all
kinds of notifications if you get a
calendar event for instance just pull
down and respond and it works on the
lock screen so you can just swipe across
in the lock screen you get those action
buttons tap and you've dealt with it
right there now in iOS 7 we gave you
quick double path access to get at your
most recent apps well now you can also
use that same double tap to get at the
people you communicate with most
frequently it's really handy if I tap on
one I've controls here to give them a
phone call mess I message them or even
FaceTime right here with just a double
tap on the home button so let's talk
about spotlight now of course spotlights
super convenient way to search in your
device you just pull down when on your
home screen and you can execute these
searches and find things like launching
apps or find an email message but now
with those same things we showed you in
Yosemite with spotlight suggestions you
can get it so much more you can search
for apps and find matches of apps that
you don't yet have on the App Store you
can search for points of interest and
get Wikipedia entries and directions you
can search for news search for
restaurants songs not just in your own
library but also on iTunes and when you
search for a movie you can get results
both for theaters nearby as well as
content available for streaming and when
you search inside of safari in addition
to your great google search suggestions
you can also get a suggest
at a glance for the answer you're
looking for right from spotlight
suggestions so that is the new spotlight
next the keyboard and the technology we
call quick type 0 so prior to iPhone
this was the state-of-the-art in
smartphone typing but iphone changed all
of that with the introduction of touch
and we've been able to do so much more
like access to special characters are
alternate character sets special
keyboard layouts even handwriting and
dictation but underlying it all have
been the language models under
autocorrect well now in iOS 8 quick type
supports predictive typing suggestions
so as you type you get suggestions for
the next words you might want to type
and you can tap things out faster than
ever before and it's incredibly smart so
its context sensitive for instance in
messages if someone asks you do you want
to go for dinner or a movie it's going
to suggest dinner or a movie and it's
personalized it learns how you type to
different people in different apps so
maybe you're communicating with a
co-worker and it's going to say well the
meeting was canceled rescheduled move
these are kind of formal terms but now
if you're communicating with someone
else where you have a different
communication style you might get the
meeting was epic awesome or a snoozer
because it learns how you type and when
it does it does so in a way that's
always protecting your privacy all that
learning is done local to the device and
none of your keystrokes leave the device
now quick type has great language models
but all of these lands
next of course continuity you get all
the great continuity features so now on
your iPad you can pick up where you left
off on your iPhone you can set up an
instant hot spot with no configuration
on your iPad you can receive your
messages on your iPad and when you
receive a call from someone going like
this you can pick it up right on your
iPad it's really great and that's
continuity next up messages so messages
is the most frequently used app on iOS
and an iOS 8 it's better than ever so
when it comes to group messaging we have
some great enhancements you can now name
your threads you can add or remove
people from a conversation underway and
if you've ever been on one of those
noisy threads that just keeps buzzing in
your pocket what you can do not disturb
on a per thread level and you can choose
when to leave the thread this is pretty
important
now you also can share your location
with people in a conversation and if
they've shared their location with you
you can see it from right within side
messages and you also have a really
great at a glance view of all of the
pictures and attachments that are shared
on any thread but one feature that I
really love is our new tap to talk you
just hold your finger down on the
microphone button and then you can just
swipe up when your finger when you're
done talking and send what you said and
it's really great for video messaging as
well jaws we've got a serious situation
developing back here I can't control
this dealer work right I got to do
something I'm not just gonna need your
eyes more time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
