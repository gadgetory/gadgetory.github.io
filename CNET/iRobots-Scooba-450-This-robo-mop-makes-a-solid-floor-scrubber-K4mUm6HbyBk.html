robot floor cleaners here at CNN
appliances but we haven't taken a look
at the heavy duty robot cleaners that
take it up a notch I'm Megan Willerton
for CNET appliances and this is the
iRobot Scooba 450 so one thing that
separates this floor cleaner from the
others we've seen is that it doesn't
have reusable or disposable pads this
one also comes with a water reservoir
but not just one water reservoir it has
one for dirty water and one for clean
water so you don't get them mixed
together and then recycled back onto
your floors one thing I really love
about this robot mop is that it does
everything for you from sweeping to
drying first it sweeps the floors and
puts down a layer of cleaning solution
then it scrubs the floors and then it
dries them for you one thing that's
handy is that you can program the space
that you want to clean so it can do a
150 square foot space takes about 20
minutes or a 300 square foot space it
takes about 40 minutes but that's also
kind of limiting it's not a very large
space another limitation is that the
battery only lasts for 40 minutes so you
can only do one 40 minute 300 square
foot cycle before it needs to be charged
again so if you had a thousand square
foot space of hardwood floors that you
needed to clean before company came over
later that night you might want to just
do it yourself it would probably take
less time I tested this on hardwood
vinyl and tile floors and it did a very
good job overall it did struggle however
on corners the rounded shape and the
lack of a side brush really gave it a
bit of a problem one thing that I
thought was impressive is that it
cleaned up mud that had been sitting on
the hardwood floor for about 24 hours it
also handled the marinara sauce and the
canola oil very well
it did struggle a little bit with the
marinara on vinyl floor because it
stained it a little bit so while it did
better overall than a lot of the other
mopping robots they aren't really
designed for the same purpose the other
ones are more for light maintenance
cleaning and this one is for more
heavy-duty scrubbing so it may not seem
like a fair comparison but if I were
choosing between the two I would
probably pick this one because it can
handle everything from light maintenance
work on up to more heavy duty stains and
spills so while I really like the six
hundred dollar robot floor cleaner I
think there's some room for improvement
I really wish it could automatically
return to a dock I really wish that you
could program
schedule so that it could run while
you're at work or sleeping and I really
wish the battery lasted longer thanks
for watching I'm Megan Willerton for C
net and this has been a review of the
iRobot Scooba 450</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
