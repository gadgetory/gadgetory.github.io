spree I'm Richard Carey and this is your
cnet update the social media giants are
finding new ways to get you to spend
money first off Facebook is rolling out
a buy tickets option so it's easy for
you to buy tickets to an event right on
facebook it's going to be an option for
all event page owners and the buttons
will take you to a third-party website
right now there's not much to the button
except that it's a new way to get your
attention Facebook is taking baby steps
as it does more and more with commerce
twitter is also experimenting with
shopping twitter has a new partnership
with american express that it's card
holders make certain purchases just by
tweeting a special hashtag first users
have to add twitter info to their amex
card account then the American Express
Twitter account will tweet out these
discount deals and if you'll want one of
them you have to reply with a special
hashtag American Express thin sends a
reply back with a confirming hashtag and
if you confirm within 15 minutes the
transaction is complete and the item is
mailed to the address on file of course
even though you'll be getting something
on sale you'll be telling the whole
world what you're purchasing so I hope
you don't mind giving up your privacy or
hope the person you're given a gift for
doesn't use Twitter so Apple's CEO Tim
Cook he is really not a fan of OLED
displays while Cook was speaking at an
investor conference he said the color
saturation of OLED displays were quote
awful yeah he didn't hold back on that
one he added that you just can't trust
the color accuracy of oulad of course
apples biggest rival Samsung uses OLED
in the latest galaxy smartphones cook
went on to say that he doesn't want to
get into a battle over size of screens
or prices but rather experiences like
the quality of the display and in-home
theater news an Intel executive
confirmed that in tow we'll be unveiling
an internet-based TV service and box
later this year until will provide the
hardware and the services direct to
consumers and this box will have a
camera to detect who is in front of the
TV so we'll have to keep an eye out for
that we've seen plenty of apps that
share short video clips but there's a
new one that's doing audio talk bits is
like a Twitter for people who want to
talk
set of type your message is limited to
15 seconds and you have that voice
message shared into a channel channels
are themed around different locations so
you can be given a message about what's
going on in your city town or ask a
question to locals about places to visit
it's free and available for iOS and
Android but it's still very new so it'll
take some time to build a network of
engaged users for now you could just
have fun making shout outs to the early
adopters or maybe you can describe your
lunch to this guy that's your tech news
update you can find more details on
these stories at cnet com / update from
our studios in New York I'm Bridget
