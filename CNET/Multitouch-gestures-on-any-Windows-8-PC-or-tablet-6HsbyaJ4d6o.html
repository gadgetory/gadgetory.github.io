look at the Logitech touchpad t650 this
is something you're seeing a little bit
more of these days a standalone touchpad
that connected pretty much any Windows
PC especially useful with windows 8
because Windows 8 is very touchscreen
driven as in the case of a hybrid style
to have it like this but in this
particular case we don't have a touchpad
or a pointing stick or anything doesn't
come with a mouse so you would want to
pair something like let's say an
external mouse or a touchpad to a
product like this or you can set it up
with a desktop or even a laptop if you
dock your laptop to like an extra screen
and you have an external keyboard so you
use this instead of a mouse so you have
a more sort of seamless transition
between your laptop and between using
kind of the dots set up the 650 connects
via one of these little USB RF adapters
it's not bluetooth logitech says that
this connection is actually faster more
responsive than bluetooth you know I've
used the Apple Magic Trackpad that has
bluetooth certainly seems fine I do
appreciate the really big surface area
here and it uses all the standard
Windows 8 gestures like swiping it from
the side for the charms bar and there
are a few of their own gestures in here
that sort of approximate what you'd get
on the macbook but don't quite equal it
I'm especially a big fan of on a macbook
swiping up and down with three fingers
to go into that expose view you still
really can't do that in Windows whether
you have this touchpad or a different
touchpad but this is one of the only
really high quality glass top standalone
touchpad as you can get it's about
eighty dollars a little bit on the
expensive side especially compared to
just your run-of-the-mill wireless mouse
but I think a lot of people are moving
in this direction even if they're not
laptop users certainly feels a lot more
natural when you're navigating windows 8
then trying to do it with a mouse which
is just a real headache i'm dan ackerman
and that is the logitech touchpad t650</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
