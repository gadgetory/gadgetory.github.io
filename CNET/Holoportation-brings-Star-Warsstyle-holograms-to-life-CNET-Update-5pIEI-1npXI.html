travel to a galaxy far far our way to
chat live with a hologram I'm Bridget
Carey this is your CNET update Microsoft
created a new type of live 3d capture
technology so you can transport yourself
as a hologram in someone else's room
and chat with them in real time even if
you're thousands of miles away but to
see the hologram in person you're going
to need to wear a hololens headset which
is not available yet to the public we
saw teases of this technology before but
now Microsoft has given it a name hollow
partition and the company published this
demonstration video showing that it
takes several special cameras positioned
around the room to capture your image
which is then reconstructed compressed
and transmitted to another user this
interaction can also be replayed later
to make it feel like you're reliving a
memory or you can shrink it down to fit
on top of a table very similar to the
technology from Star Wars I'm looking
forward to when we don't need to wear a
hololens to see the images and can just
project them from our droids we may hear
more about this in hololens from
Microsoft on Wednesday during its annual
build conference for developers if you
look at Microsoft's schedule of events
for programmers it seems that the big
themes are around the cloud and Internet
of Things which is just tech jargon for
having more devices in your home
connected to the Internet CNET will be
blogging live from the Wednesday keynote
which Microsoft is also streaming live
starting at 8:30 a.m. Pacific 11:30 a.m.
Eastern microsoft's hololens is not
exactly virtual reality it's more like
mixed reality but get ready for a busy
few days of virtual reality discussion
the oculus rift is now beginning to
arrive this week for those that
pre-order the VR headset you're gonna
want to check out CNET's review of the
oculus rift which is far from a
traditional product review and HTC vive
VR headset is going to arrive next week
on April 5th there's also news relating
to Sony's upcoming PlayStation VR The
Wall Street Journal reports that Sony is
planning to sell a more powerful version
of the
ps4 console to handle virtual reality
with a boost to graphics and processing
power but Sony has not officially made
any such announcement yet this comes
from unnamed sources that does it for
this tech news roundup and there's
always more to explore it's cnet.com
from our studios in New York I'm Bridget
Carey I don't think I'm supposed to walk
with this on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
