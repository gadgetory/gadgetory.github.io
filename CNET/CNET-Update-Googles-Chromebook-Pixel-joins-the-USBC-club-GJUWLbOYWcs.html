Bridget Carey and this is your scene
that updated Apple's new MacBook isn't
the only shiny new laptop in town using
a USB type-c connector port Google's new
Chromebook pixel has not one but two of
these fast charging ports one on each
side unlike the new macbook it still has
two standard USB slots and also has an
SD memory card slot you're going to be
seeing us bc in more computers as the
year goes on because it allows for
faster power and data transfer for
example the Chromebook can get two hours
of juice within 15 minutes of charging
the 13-inch Chromebook pixel design is
the same as last year's model but it got
a speed boost with more RAM and a faster
processor and a lower price it starts at
one thousand dollars if you're not
familiar with Chromebooks these do not
run Android or Windows this is the
Chrome operating system and only
programs built for chrome work on it but
that may not be an issue if you do most
of your work on the web and now chrome
can open and edit Microsoft Office
documents in Google News across the pond
google has opened its first retail store
in London well to be more specific it's
really a shop inside of another shop
Google's store sits inside the location
of currys pc world following in the
footsteps of Apple and Microsoft Google

Android and Chrome products there are
plans to have regular classes and events

meanwhile in the world of Apple force
touch may be coming to the next iPhone
no not that force touch although that
would be cool this is the feature on the
new Apple watch where you just have to
press harder on the screen to trigger
different actions than a normal tap it
can sense how much pressure your finger
applies force touch is also in the
trackpad of the new MacBook and the Wall
