at Aoife in Berlin to take a look at the
Acer Liquid s2 now the first thing
you'll notice about this smartphone is
that it's huge this is a 6-inch screen
and you really feel it when it's in your
hands this is a very big smartphone and
it feels quite chunky as well that's not
necessarily a bad thing I like this
design across the back it's looking
quite rosy and red here and around the
sides these smooth edges make it quite
comfortable to hold so it does feel
weighty but I do quite like the design
apart from the big screen the other cool
feature about the s2 is its camera this
is a 13 megapixel camera and here's the
cool bit it shoots video in 4k now what
that means is that the video you shoot
will have loads more pixels than a Full
HD video
we don't really know without testing it
how good that video will look it's going
to be much more detailed that's for sure
but we don't know if it will actually
result in a bump in picture quality so
that's something we're going to be
looking for in the full review it's
powered by Android 4.2 jelly bean and
it's also got a 2.2 gigahertz quad-core
processor on the inside now that's quite
a lot of power and you can feel it when
you swipe around this phone feels very
slick to use the liquid s2 is going to
be on sale in the last three months of
this year so we don't have long to wait
to find out if it's really any good
big fines are certainly becoming a trend
but is it one that you approve of please
let me know I'm Luke Westray for CNET
