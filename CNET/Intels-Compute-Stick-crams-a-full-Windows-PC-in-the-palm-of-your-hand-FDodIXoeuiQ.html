checking out the Intel compute stick now
this is a full Windows 8 PC crammed into
a device that fits right in the palm of
your hand and it cost about 150 bucks
compute stick is only a little bigger
than a chromecast plugs into your TV or
monitor via an HDMI port and runs on
tablet hardware it's packin a quad-core
1.3 gigahertz Intel Atom processor 2
gigs of RAM and has 32 gigs of storage
space there's also a micro SD card slot
that will support up to 128 gig cards
this USB port on the side here lets you
plug in external storage and Wi-Fi
connectivity is built-in so is bluetooth
so you can pay your peripherals too so
the stick is definitely not a powerhouse
but streaming HD video or music while
you're wandering around the web works
great and most importantly it can run
Minecraft and fairly well that alone
just about makes it product of the year
for me but I'm gonna go ahead and
reserve judgment till we're finished
testing now the stick runs Windows 8.1
with Bing don't be alarmed to full
version of windows that microsoft offers
the device manufacturers at a deep
discount being is the default search
engine system-wide when you first run it
but there's nothing really stopping you
from just changing that once you're up
and running you'll need to keep the
compute stick plugged in via 2 micro USB
port there really isn't any way around
that but one tug from a curious cat
means you're going to lose any files you
haven't saved recently that's not a
deal-breaker for me but it's definitely
something you need to be aware of and
that's the compute stick it's not going
to be for everyone but if you're looking
to roll your own Smart TV or just want
to make your next hotel stay a little
more bearable
and don't mind bringing your own
bluetooth keyboard and mouse this could
be a good fit especially for 150 bucks
it'll be available at the end of April
I'm Nate Ralph thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
