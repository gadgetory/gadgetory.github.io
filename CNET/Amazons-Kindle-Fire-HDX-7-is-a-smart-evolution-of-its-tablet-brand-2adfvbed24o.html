flagship tablet it costs two hundred and
twenty nine dollars for 16 gigabytes of
storage 269 for 32 gigabytes and there's
a 64 gigabyte option for 309 dollars the
HDX is smaller thinner and lighter than
the company's previous 7-inch er and has
a 1920 by 1200 resolution screen both
the power button and volume rocker have
been moved to the back and while the
buttons are easier to find and press
compare it to the previous fire having
them on the back takes a little getting
used to
sometimes when I'm holding the tablet
it's easy to forget whether it's the
power or volume that's on the right or
left side I do think it's really
comfortable to hold in one hand though
it's well balanced light without feeling
to aerate there's a microUSB port and a
headphone jack but the micro HDMI port
from the previous fire is gone there's a
front-facing camera but no back camera
the new version of the fire OS is more a
refinement over last year's than
something completely new the Carousel
returns but swiping up from the home
screen now brings up an array of your
installed apps and thanks to the high
resolution all menu items can now fit on
the screen at once the web experience
has finally been fixed now feels fast
without the bugs and sluggishness that
plagued previous iterations also email
and calendar apps have received some
small but useful interface improvements
managing your storage is now a lot
easier as items can be found by typed
and delete it on the fly and while we're
on the subject 16 gigabytes of storage
about 10 gigabytes effectively is fast
becoming too small if you want to store
HD content the 1080p version of The
Avengers would not fit on the tablet
even with no additional apps or content
installed I instead have to settle for
the 720p or standard def versions Mayday
is Amazon's new customer service feature
for Kindle Fire owned
if you're having trouble with something
tap the Mayday button and within 15
seconds police that's Amazon's goal a
real-time video chat window but customer
service rep will appear the rep can't
see you but they can take control of the
system they can also draw on it in order
to illustrate how to do whatever it is
you need to do it's a pretty cool
feature but we'll have to see how well
that 15-second response time holds up
when thousands are tapping the button
daily x-ray for music lets you sing
along accurately to your favorite songs
an x-ray trivia is a pretty effective
way to learn more about your favorite
movies or TV shows it seems Amazon
finally got the horsepower to interface
overhead balance just about right thanks
to the new Snapdragon 800 processor
pages and menus are accessed near
immediately gaming performance hits
about Nvidia shield level maybe a bit
lower but definitely Trump's the new
Nexus 7 in frame rate I think we can
safely say that Kindle Fire HDX 7 is a
good tablet with definite improvements
in performance and design made a is an
intriguing a potentially useful feature
but will require a lot more field
testing before we can give a final
judgment call there are plenty of other
small tweaks and changes I haven't even
mentioned and we're still waiting for a
few new features to be ready like
Goodreads and a video fling feature
before we can give them a fair
assessment
however keep checking out my full review
at cnet.com to see how things continue
to evolve I'm Eric Franklin and this has
been a first look at the Amazon Kindle
Fire HDX 7
