are on a new category of televisions the
ultra thin right now we're actually
looking at a four millimeter thin bezel
and it's actually one of the lightest to
the TV only weighs about sixteen and a
half pounds this 55 inch television from
LG is expected to hit retail stores in
the second half of 2012 it falls into
the category of 0 led the 0 standing for
organic for its green
environmentally-friendly properties what
we're doing with organic LED is the
screen itself is actually creating its
own light energy which costs a lost
blessed as far as energy consumption
goes all other major television makers
seem to be following the thin trend for
example Samsung thinner is in and it
actually is less than point 3 inches
deep Sony to with her high resolution
crystal LED screen we don't know when it
will be a product yet but it's
definitely shows people where Sony's
going when it comes to television
initial public reaction seems favorable
like whoa just like mind blown like I
want that absolutely amazing I've never
seen anything like it I love it here's
the next generation of TVs thin enough
and light enough that you can pick them
up and move them room to room these are
just prototypes from sharp but the
company says to expect them in living
rooms sometime in the near future love
to have a 40-inch in my bedroom and then
take it out to a workout room or then
move it to a kitchen or even take it
outdoors during a barbecue now that's a
trend we can grab onto in Las Vegas I'm
