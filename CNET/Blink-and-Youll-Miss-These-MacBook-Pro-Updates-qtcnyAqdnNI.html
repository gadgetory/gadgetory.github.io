if you splurge someone if Apple's very
expensive high-end 15-inch MacBook Pro
laptops when they got a big redesign
last year you're not going to feel
especially put out that they're already
getting updated
that's because almost everything here is
the same same aluminum body which is
still thinner and lighter than the older
MacBook Pros same great Retina
resolution display inside you do get
some important new parts including 7th
generation Core iSeries Intel CPUs and
new AMD Radeon graphics now up to the
Radeon pro 555 and 560 it's not a gaming
machine but you can do some pretty good
gaming on it if you have a much older
MacBook or even waiting for newer parts
that's great however if one or more of
the quirky features of the redesigned
MacBook Pro kept you away before then
this set of revisions isn't going to do
anything much to change your mind it's
still got the same touch bar control
strip instead of a function key row some
people love it some people don't use it
at all
I think the fingerprint reader works
great and there are a handful of
controls like brightness and volumes
that I use a lot but not all the time
you still only get four USB C port so
get ready to buy some adapters or extra
cables someday USB C will be the
universal standard but we're not there
yet the flatter than ever keyboard is
also a sticking point for some shoppers
it does take a little getting used to
but I think it's more than made up for
by the gigantic touchpad which may be
the best one I've ever used bonus fact
it's literally bigger than an iPhone
