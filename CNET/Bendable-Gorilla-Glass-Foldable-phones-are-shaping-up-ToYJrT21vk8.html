shape the way we interact with
technology for decades it's the window
covering many of the screens we look at
on a daily basis and it's the armor that
protects our phones from these types of
falls a thick knowledge II has evolved
the glass has had to evolve right
alongside with it and though the use
cases may have changed the one thing
that remains the same is that the
display is still one of the first things
that users are interacting with so today
we're here to see how the glass itself
is helping shape the next generation of
devices we took a trip to Corning's
headquarters in New York to find out
what the makers of Gorilla Glass are
cooking up next glass is made up of two
basic ingredients sand and a whole lot
of heat but add anything else to the mix
and you're left with a totally different
type of glass in fact even changing the
baking temperature or the cooling time
can drastically alter its properties if
you think about all the dimensions of
glass its optics its chemical
composition its physical properties its
electromagnetic properties we're
learning how to control all those in
incredibly precise ways this is
Corning's Test Kitchen where new glass
recipes are baked at temperatures of
over 1,000 degrees Celsius hotter than
molten lava their latest recipe
ultra-thin bendable glass as the
foldable phone space heats up with
companies like Samsung and royal
entering the market corning continues to
push the envelope on how much glass can
bend to go to type and radius you have
to go to a glass that's much much
thinner than what you have today and
some of the glasses we have in our
laboratory is thinner than a human hair
we got an early look at Corning's
ultra-thin bendable glass and though we
weren't allowed to film it this is
Corning's footage of what it actually
looks like it's not their first bendable
glass but it's a lot thinner and a lot
more flexible than the willow glass they
introduced a few years back it bends to
a five millimeter radius and the texture
feels more like thin plastic than a
sheet of glass this glass is still in
development which means you won't find
it on any foldable devices yet but
Corning is ready to start working with
its customers to implement it into
future designs the foldable opportunity
is a little bit of a moving target now
because a use case isn't quite clear how
people are gonna use these devices and
the form factors are still evolving
whether it's gonna be in fold or out
fold or trifold or small radius or large
radius but the future of glass is not
just about foldables and it stretches
well beyond phones in fact glass may be
taking the driver's seat when it comes
to automotive design Courtney has also
been working on curved dashboard
displays textured glass that can mimic
different car surfaces and
anti-reflective glass that will reduce
glare and make fingerprints disappear
inside the car many surfaces almost all
the surfaces inside that vehicle have
shaped how form except for this display
and so what designers are looking to do
is to be able to bend those displays
around the user the driver around the
passengers with Corning's new glass
everything from the car windows to the
car consoles can become usable displays
that seamlessly blend right into the
interior of the car manufacturers like
BMW Ford and Porsche have already
started using some of their glass in
newer car models with more to come in
2019
and Corning's just scratching the
surface when it comes to the
possibilities of glass in new
technologies so far scientists have
incorporated about 50 elements from the
periodic table into silica but
essentially the entire periodic table is
is available and I really think that
we're just getting started and to think
about the potential of using the
periodic table think about holding the
oxford english dictionary in your hands
and how many words you can make with
only 26 letters</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
