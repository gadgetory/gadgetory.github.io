CES 2011 we are taking a first look at
the vizio Lea phone now this is an
android phone and it's the first entrant
into the mobile space by vizio which you
normally think of for TVs it's running a
pretty standard version of android
except they have their own Vizio skin on
it now the reason that vizio wants to
get into the mobile space is because
they want your phone to work with your
tablet which will also work with your TV
so they are announcing new TVs and new
tablets that will work with this phone a
couple of cool things about this phone
is it's got this IR blaster in the front
here so this phone will essentially be
able to be a universal remote control
because they are also releasing an app
that will control not only your tablet
but your TV and ninety percent of the
other consumer electronics on the market
we don't have a price we don't have a
release date and we don't have a carrier
for this phone yet but I'm told will
find that out in the summer of 2011
which is when it comes out so you can't
get too excited about this phone just
yet you have to just do with this first
look and then we'll wait for all that
information I'm Natali Morris for cnet
and you're taking a first look at the
vizio via phone on our coverage at CES
