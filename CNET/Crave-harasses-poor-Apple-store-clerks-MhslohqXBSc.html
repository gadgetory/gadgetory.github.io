podcast I'm Veronica Belmont
and I'm James Kim and this is where we
discuss review ponder all the cool
things that we've seen on the crave blog
yeah and you can find that at crave
cnet.com so what's floating your boat
well everyone knew about the lg
chocolate phone that was a big new
verizon phone that came out a while back
it's a candy bar chocolate but it's not
yeah it's not really brown it's dark
it's black yes but now in Korea at least
they have a stainless steel one it's
made of a very thin stainless steel
casing as a two megapixel camera phone
but I don't know if it's got to come out
here anytime soon you know you just have
to stick with the black and possibly the
white chocolate Koreans you know always
getting a first get everything first
anyway
speaking of phones have you seen the new
Miami Ink versions of the radio no I
have no idea that they came yeah yeah
there was one of the postings and it's
just this you know razor is the most
popular phone in the world you know and
you get get them in all the different
flavors and colors including the Dolce
and Gabanna which is so yeah I did it
out of the box a person very hot yeah
it's terrible
the box is cool you open it up one sign
though yeah it slides out like this and
it comes with a little dongle but we
anyway Miami Ink yes you can get these
tattoo and glaze and razors based on the
show yes cool show and these are gonna
be available I think October 30th
there's a lot of good stuff coming out
in October apparently we were supposed
to get the Mac version of the swing box
software I love and if you're not
familiar with Slingbox it takes your
your TV signal and sends it to your
laptop or your video capable cell phone
and so but Mac users didn't have any
software that was compliant with it
right they announced it I think CES or
near there and then it's been taking a
long time they also announced I think
Symbian OS so bright ability and also
Sony's version of the sling came out
first and also and one other thing I
like about the sling box is the fact
that and I've done this is that you can
control your TiVo or your DVR from far
so you can watch the stuff that it's
recorded and also programming for later
that would be amazing because I TiVo
everything now
only show that I watch live is lost so
speaking of Mac iPod rumors what's up
with that yeah again else is new right
so there's been I phone rumors coming
out our ears for the past couple months
and now they're getting back to the
rumors of the video iPod and that would
actually be not just a video iPod um
yeah they're like a touchscreen
widescreen version of the iPod yeah
everyone's talking about that coming on
after the holidays but it would be a
real surprise attack by by not several
some comments are saying that like Steve
Jobs is actually very confident and
doesn't care about the Zune and is kind
of dissing the Zune because it yeah he's
been saying a lot of bad stuff about
this area I think a lot of it just had
to do with timing and sort of delays and
now it's ready and but who knows it is a
rumor so speaking of iPods in its fifth
year anniversary mm-hmm where's the
shuffle where is the show I sort of put
I posted this they said October which is
a very vague okay it's like halfway
through out to that so I'd say for me a
mid month is about October so now it's
delayed right I guess so if everyone's
been waiting for these shuffles gonna
order it pre-order from the different
different places but uh no indication of
ship data of color call the store every
reviewer as soon as it comes in they're
probably not that James came again
anything cares a little bit on life did
you see that a top nine solar gadgets
unusual so well there's that I do too
you know it's just like it's a
futuristic and one of the one of the
things on there was a to $2,900
do-it-yourself car buy golf cart yes so
it's like a low-power
emission in this vehicle yeah sort of
scoots around your neighborhood but it's
like got this old-school panel and it
looks like it's from like the 1930s or
something everybody definitely check
that I was in Catalina down in Southern
California and the whole island is just
golf carts
everyone gets around buy golf carts
because the roads are really small and
so that would be very Indian place yes
definitely check that out also from CES
is coming up o CS 2007 a great time I'm
Nick hardly a lot of work a lot of party
actually looking back at CES 2006 the
winner of Best in Show where where is it
now it's the creatives and vision M yeah
I think it was deserving it was
definitely a great product for the time
I mean it's still a great product yes
get me wrong but it hasn't captured the
market share of the iPod at all and
there's been products that have come out
since then like the Toshiba Giga BTS
that really kind of step it up a notch
in terms of quality and saying I guess
if you happen to upload the new or
install the new firmware update you
won't have FM recording yeah they took
it out without that more update that's
crazy huh so anyway so if you have any
products that you crave send us an email
like Kraven cnet.com send us photos or
maybe a link to a video that you really
like we may put it on our show we would
love that see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
