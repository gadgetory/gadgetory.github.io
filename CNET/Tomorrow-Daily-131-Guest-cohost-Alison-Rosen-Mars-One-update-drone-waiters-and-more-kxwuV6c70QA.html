to Mars to live and die cool that
doesn't sound that cool it's a bird it's
a plane it's a pizza flying at your head
delivered via drone in Singapore and the
shower of the future is finally here and
it's it's not really what you think it
is it's tomorrow daily
oh you're dancing I was dancing with you
is your infectious oh hey everyone
welcome to tomorrow daily your source of
future tech and robots and science and
all kinds of great crap i'm kailyn
onimous and today ashley is not here so
we have a special guest my new best
friend Alison Rosen hello everyone I'm
very excited to be here I've never felt
like I'm gonna clap right here I've
never felt more lame about my name than
sitting next to kale anonymous oh I want
to be a lafours can I be Alison
anonymous you can pick ya you're gonna
be Alison mystery okay that's pretty
good Alison mystery yeah you're like in
a band now we're in the the ? like the
john and jane doe's so uh so obviously
ashley isn't here she's back home
nursing her dogs who are who are a
little ill uh I feel I don't want to
bring the show down about that I'm Jane
if you follow on Twitter just say like i
love your dogs and i love you or
something like that but allison is here
just join us easy tag Doug love um but I
yeah so you're here joining us can you
tell us just a quick little bit about
yourself and then we'll plug all your
stuff at the end um I am very excited to
be here and I hosts a podcast called
Alison Rosen is your new best friend and
I hope you'll all go listen and I
realize that you said we plug it at the
end but I'm plugging it now what am i
doing oops well we're gonna have to
delete this segment or this whole
episode anyway so we got a lot of great
new stories for you some very
opinionated about me tell so let's get
started
so if you've ever wanted to go to Mars
now is your chance to get sent there to
go and just hang out on Mars and then
just straight up just die on Mars so
basically what's going on is mars-1 has
this whole contest in which you can
apply to go to Mars be one of one of a
few contestants to go to Mars and on a
one-way trip to this sad sad little
planet uh so be at you there yeah cannot
get you back there just like good luck
suckers so basically that this is
actually been in the news for a while
but the story today is that it's closer
to happening there on stage three of
this Mars one has narrowed down to 100
contestants from 200,000 people that
applied these crazy people that are
actually inexperienced they don't
actually they're not like astronauts
crazy that 200,000 people are signing up
for a mission that's essentially a snot
not to bring everyone down like you said
earlier essentially a suicide mission
you probably will die unless of course
that's really cool that you got to see
Mars before you died but it's
questionable how long you'll get to
enjoy it if you're a youtuber you get to
go first rats so there's that I think
that's the appeal but uh I don't know as
crazy as they sound I would do it but
let's keep going really uh yeah i'll get
to that bad but let's let's hear about
these maniacs that one of the 100
contestants there's contestants from all
over the world now here's the most crazy
contestant his name is m 1 KO and he
says he wore that in the 90s you want to
earn em 1 KO he says he's actually a
Martian he's 100,000 years old and he
wants to go on the trip so that he can
show people around Mars so you can see
where these contestants are going
they're not like looking for like strong
buff dudes like punch holes in Mars or
whatever I think strong buff toes do so
in this trailer we can see a little bit
more of it it looks very reality TV show
is right and that's because it kind of
is so there's your catch we're not
trying to further humanity
as they say they are these 100 people
will come 100 people will compete to be
one of 24 people sent to Mars they'll be
challenged to simulations teamwork and
survival this Mars show is coming soon
for us to watch so obviously it's a show
will they go well they actually go I
don't think so you don't you don't know
no way they still they need funding like
that's one of the things they're working
on is actually getting funding they're
actually trying to get advertisers so
maybe like the spaceship will have like
a formula one thing right Donald's and
starbucks on the side so i mean i guess
if they get people watching this i'll
totally watch this without you oh I
would definitely watch it wouldn't go I
would not know there some I remember
there was a story that came out that
said that the first person will be will
like the first people will begin dying
within sixty six days it's you the
people hope that they'll get to live out
thousands of days however in reality
apparently you're some people are going
to only last a couple months because it
has to do with like they're gonna be
basically living in a biodome like the
polish or vehicle and it'll be very
humid so bad news for people with hair
that frizz is and then like based on the
oxygen and nitrogen levels there won't
be enough oxygen for this is a real
bummer yeah but you know go to also
reveal Arians it how do you get all of
your resources like you're gonna need
water and and you're gonna also they're
gonna get cabin fever and you know it
we're gonna have a lot it look like
great big brother on Mars that's I'm
actually that excites me I don't board
naked and afraid I don't think so too
scared on Mars are they giving any kind
of timeline for when they hope this
could happen uh they're not really but
they're about to accept applications for
another round so I mean it looks like
they're already excited to do it um but
there aren't like there's fifty four
year olds that are gonna potentially go
so like it's nice it's not like they're
really looking hard for can like people
to send their what makes sense to me
would be if you're sort of at the end of
your life or you know that you're not
gonna have a super long life what a cool
way to go out yeah yeah just just like I
do I don't Mars listen they're just
getting sent ya if she
makes it because I mean that's a trip so
long our children watching the show or
your children's children I want to i'm
more into waiting until like the second
and third wave of going to Mars oh when
there's a return you know you can fly
direct Mars to earth earth to mars you
know a round-trip kind of action yeah
I'm and when the kinks have been worked
out I don't need to be an Olympian early
adopter no it's not a good idea it's
never a good idea I don't think so wait
till I get the kinks out people are
falling out of air locks I got to know
that's that's a smart decision but that
brings us to our question to you this is
our TD of the day that's the TV what is
it what's it 880 Mars one because this
is the Mars one project TD Mars one how
would you win the chance to go to Mars
if you were a Mars one finalist so how
would you impress them because we're
going from 100 to 24 those people get
sent so how do you get to the 24th what
do you think how would you impress with
your like fiery personality probably
really excited it's a reality show
they're going to be looking for their
Omarosa type for their puck type
throughout old school reality show
reference yeah that's like a youngin
real world bro who are the current
villains of reality shows uh Kim
Kardashian yeah they're gonna be looking
for they're like oh she's tells it like
it is you know you never know what she's
gonna say next you want SAS on Mars
that's cool right on as well I don't you
want to be like the guy that's like
analyst he's everyone's dumb I'm way
cool all right I understand didn't come
to Mars to make friends yeah that person
all right cool I would just be like
really into digging I'd be like look I'm
gonna dig through this planet and you're
gonna want me there because you want to
see there's water underneath right I'm
just gonna dig all the time like I
brought my shovel collection my cowl
collection I've made these shovel hand
things I'm going to dig through the
planets okay so tell us a TD Mars one
how you would I get picked to go to Mars
and die and then if we like your tweet
will send you to Mars right yeah yeah no
matter what age and if you're an alien
we're gonna you're gonna you're not
going to be here anymore you die so all
right so tell us about the story of
Hawaiian front flying Rupp like drones
investors
yes waiter drones this is a very
familiar very cool thing a restaurant in
downtown singapore is employing flying
drones as its wait staff or rather to
augment its waitstaff the drones help
eliminate the need for the wait staff to
weave through the busy dining area as
the drones will carry the food and drink
from the kitchen over the heads of
customers once the drone gets to the
table then a human wait staff member
will still be needed to deliver the
items from the drone to the customer and
presumably offer them a napkin when the
drone suppose the food all over their
head now the drones don't require humans
to navigate their fully automated and
the restaurant itself will be outfitted
with infrared sensors each drone can
carry about 4.4 pounds of food and drink
which is approximately like two pints of
beer a pizza and two glasses of wine all
that although okay all of that
everyone's heats and beer shalini okay
yeah at once and here's something the
drones won't be putting humans out of
work because the restaurant says that
this will free up the wait staff to
interact with customers and enhance the
dining experience I don't know about you
but for me what enhances a dining
experience is not having a lot of
interaction with the waiter yeah maybe
that will you be alone I want to eat
some food I was about to say that okay
yay I now made a new friend like no no
no one needs the chatty waiter okay so
I'm like a good few more things um
they're expecting the live debut to
happen by the end of the year the
project costs about it's in the low
seven figures in singapore dollars which
1 million singapore dollars is about
800,000 US dollars so maybe it's about a
breezy so very expensive yes and this
does solve a problem happening in
Singapore which is it apparently young
Singaporeans shun jobs in the service
industry because of the low wages and
the perceived lower social status so you
know if this were to happen here you
might think hey this is putting people
at a job despite what they're saying
about you still need the human waiters
you know that there are going to be in a
fewer fewer wait staff jobs in a
restaurant that is employing drones so
if that were to happen here you might
say well this is putting people out of
work but in Singapore it's solving the
problem which is that they need more
they need more people in the service
sector so will that in
ice more kids to want to like work in
the you know service industry I mean
when you can play with rubato hang out
with robots so are you impressed with
this do you think this is a good step I
think it's pretty cool good I I just
can't help but imagine though that it's
gonna hit someone in the head like
happened at TGI Fridays in New York or
that all of a sudden you're not report
when you go to TGI Fridays that's right
that's actually if it's your birthday at
TGI Fridays they tie a bunch of balloons
on you and then hit you in the head with
a drone okay true yeah that's awesome
that chuck e cheese to do you know I
just I guys you know see the picture of
the drone flying through the room with
the liquid on it and I just imagined it
spilling yeah so it's like a drunk guy
though exactly the big thing to me I
mean beyond the fact that even when it's
still like you said when it flies up the
table some a waiter starts to take it
from that and put it on there how long
will that really be necessary though
because you could just you know if if it
could just lower you could just pick it
up yourself and that'd be even cooler
because you'd have like direct droning
if the gyroscope is good though cuz like
if I take one beer off and it like loses
its right oh that's true but more
importantly the drones noise like it's
gonna be flying around and you're gonna
be like trying to eat you know yeah what
your eyes that's perfect if you don't
want to be like be broken up with just
keep going in the juicer okay cool well
I guess I you know I don't know if I'd
you or whatever Wow drones wedding
singer owns they're going everywhere you
are and where you're eating okay so let
me tell you about so we talked about
going to Mars we talked about drones
coming out all up in your business now I
talk about technology call and coming
all up in your shower because now we
have the shower of the future and that's
actually the name of the product which
is pretty pretty grandiose their company
company orbital systems in Sweden so
this doesn't use any lasers or
anti-gravity it just reuses your water
over and over and over so the ideal and
the idea and the goal here is that space
has limited water so in the future space
like you go into space you're not going
to have an unlimited source of water and
also
earth it's also good to kind of conserve
water there too so here's how it works
you want to be clean before you die on
Mars well he left it a clean corpse oh
that's okay so here's how it works it's
got five liters in the system which
pumps water then it comes down onto you
and then on the bottom it has a filter
system with a microcapsule and a nano
capsule the microcapsules for skin and
hair the Nano is for germs metal and oil
all of that is pumped right back onto
you five liters right like it filters
skin flakes or things like that and
germs out of the water is off yeah so
it's not it's not that bad apparently
it's so clean it's better than your tap
water oh wow so I mean that's that's
pretty good so how much is this gonna
cost you uh Allison asked me I was out
of late yeah I did I said it so quick
how much was how much is it gonna cost
you something from the 1930s gonna cross
so it's a 3200 euro or okay 3700
american dollars so but for those lot
yeah but why not as much as you'd think
if you are a bazillionaire yeah you view
jay-z jay-z is like I haha that's easy
for something called the shower of the
future it's really somewhat affordable
yeah i mean i don't really see a whole
lot of future tech going up in here but
it is it is pretty cool well i think
they're just saying in the future one
will shower you know yeah you gotta say
yes honey i think is cool about this is
that a lot of people use those low-flow
water efficient words coming out of my
mouth in the wrong order it was a little
later yeah exactly or no water toilets
are right right but with this i think
you can have is you can use as much
water as you want to pick up 30 minutes
exactly with like a lot of water
pressure yeah and one family can use the
same water oh my god just that it sounds
terrible but it's actually really like
you know green so that's like what
happens if you're the kind of person two
peas in the shower and I was just about
to say that I'm glad you got okay this
is perfect this is working great so they
didn't address i even it sits in capital
letters it says urinating of it okay
that is a tablet they tackled urination
and apparently the system is worked out
its got like sensors
it has too many chemicals in it it won't
filter it'll just take that water aside
and unlike just get rid of it so like
shampoo it'll all right name so it
doesn't it can't filter it that well so
you're just you can go it'll just go
somewhere else so I'm glad you asked
that again this is too they're saying
that the cost will pay for itself
because you're going to be saving money
from from water what not filters are $25
just thought I'd throw that in there
which is like the same as a Brita filter
yeah it's not bad filter it's not was
complaining about it wasn't like all the
filters are $25 Hackett yeah I actually
really like this yeah yeah what--right
yeah i mean if i could afford it you see
what it looks like it's really cool
looking and a week right there's a
couple different options right yeah
about whether you like install the
filter thing in the floor right
something called a cabin yes yeah it's
either way it's like four thousand
dollars but yeah it's only a few options
yeah look at this thing I think it's
neat did you get this yeah I like it uh
yeah I I'm not gonna move into a place
right Nina install it you know sure i'll
just do it i'll just keep the shower
that's going right actually I just fill
up a bath water like a bath tub and then
I just jump into it like and for like a
month and just clean off so that's my
thing how gross is it by the end uh you
can't see through it and you can just so
we can put heavy pretty gross what have
you things on the surface and it's just
like is there um alright so we're going
to talk more about my gross bathtub but
we'll get back to you after this break
with another round of back at our
hackett so don't click away it's
tomorrow daily
the rubber ducky drowned that's when I
no attempt to put the water so oh hey
guys welcome back to tomorrow daily
we've got a couple more things to tackle
including back at our hackett which
should be exciting to hear whether or
not whether or not you want to see this
product that's pretty crazy so let's do
back in haggett
I was just following your lead I'm not I
can't see I don't know what I'm not
looking at I'm definitely let me know
what's safe i love that i got to use
that more you don't know what to do and
now here's the breakdance segment of the
show okay alright so today I'm back at
our hackett we have a portable your own
transportation device I don't know if
you like hovering around but this isn't
their Board of who doesn't it doesn't
I've never met a person this is airborne
and basically airboard is your own
little personal transportation device
that works off of you lifting up into
the air via these propellers that you
know push you off off the ground into
the air so let me tell you a couple of
breakdowns of the technology here I'm
already told ya it's got forces or
propellers run by an Intel processor
built in gyroscope electric-powered and
it's controlled by you leaning so it's
not like there's a remote control it's
just like I wanna go left you lean a
little bit left I'll go forward a little
bit forward so you know you use that
talking technology on segways yeah I
could go wrong you could fall you can
it's even like you can fold it up and I
guess carry it I don't know yeah like
put it in the trunk your car yeah if you
need to hover and drive hold on I got a
hover at the park yeah it's so there you
go this it's got a so they're saying can
be used in extreme conditions so they're
like if you're a marine and you want to
hover around in the snow or something
you can use this it also has an app so
you can remote control the vehicle so if
you're not like hey buddy you're you
know here you go it's they're saying
they're going to try and ship it out in
2016 uh they're not doing so well they
only have a hundred sixty dollars and
they started on februari nine and how
much did I've missed that I didn't miss
how much they they need right it was
obviously the tens of thousands if not
hundreds but 160 bucks right now to 2016
so what do you think would you back it
or hack it I would back it oh really I
would okay this is really cool I'm
wondering how high can you go though do
you know because I'm a person it's only
like off like a foot or two off the
ground it's just it's just a little bit
not it's not gonna like you're gonna do
that you're gonna get above I want
why oh um I think that'd be gay I think
that it would mean was I helped CC r so
somebody would step in and be like hey
yeah hey only things serving food can go
this yeah yeah you gotta be able to hit
people that I still think this is cool
because it is still in the realm of
flying like I'm the kind of person where
some of what superpower would you want I
would want to fly now people have told
me no you should want to teleport I have
friends who feel very strongly that
teleportation is the best superpower
because what you can do anything with it
and if you want to fly you just like
teleport teleport teleport teleport mmm
I think that's so fun he's so much work
yeah you know you get what you trade
yeah um I think this is cool I think if
here's the downside though I don't want
to have to dodge people hovering towards
me on the sidewalk yeah you can't trust
people no not with this sort of like
unmanned like this technology especially
if they're going to control it remotely
like I don't know if you ski or
snowboard but I haven't done any of that
in years but my experience of being a
skier is constantly being in threat of
being run over by someone on a snowboard
and I don't want this just to be like
this urban version of a snowboard yeah
cuz people will crash into you and it's
a huge thing to its wide not like a
little tiny like skit it's not like a
hoverboard right yeah I think it's cool
though wouldn't it be fun I would still
want to try it at least I want hover
technology i I'm hacking this really
yeah I don't we don't hack a lot on here
it's mostly back it but uh yeah i don't
know like it's it's cool and all but it
just it doesn't they haven't given a
price point and it it doesn't seem like
the fault i don't know it just doesn't
make sense I'd rather just like learn to
skateboard or go and fall on my face
then get this board like a Segway I
don't know hovering is just that it just
doesn't seem it seems wide and it just
kind of seems like unnecessary that it
would be like a Harvey achill it doesn't
have a wheel I get what you're saying
the other point makes sense that what
benefit does it give you the fact that
you're a foot above yeah err I've been
above the ground I get what but the same
is Ross dream whether meaning like a
personal said that a you can they're
like they're like hey extra bonus if
your marine
and you're like in Afghanistan or
whatever hover around Oh Lexi you don't
hit any mines or anything I didn't think
about that you can hover over the
explosives yeah that's pretty Graham
nice nice well I mean you found a
solution to a problem that's true you
should back it you should help them out
okay all right so so so there you go
back it all right nice all right so so
now we're going to move on to some of
the feedback from you guys we're going
to move on to your user feedback I like
that pretty good ok cool nope there you
go there you go yeah all right uh so we
asked about wait what was it otd torrent
and we've got some responses here this
is about you know what people thought
about that bittorrent is going to now
have some different productions yeah and
content on their thing so Lane wrote to
us and Lane said my problem with YouTube
and bittorrent is that I watch a lot of
my content as podcasts including
tomorrow daily hey you're from that's a
podcast oh yeah podcast that's not yeah
no no I mean all so that's that's your
day or now podcast land is where I hail
fraud castle and gum ha Castlemaine
robson up ooh that's not scared uh
Matthew says I would like to see
bittorrent bring back ER because who
doesn't miss TVs country count County
General oh ok sorry I've done never
watched ER that Larry Clooney vehicle
yes I Noah Wyle ok but I didn't watch
and julianna margulies I think ok yeah
from Good Wife but I didn't watch er
yeah but maybe I bittorrent it I don't
know yeah so what I mean like was there
any content you would want to see
bittorrent take on because I said that
they need to take on other people's eye
peas so a lot of that mean so you know
there's a lot of fan films based on
comics video games and stuff like that
so take all of that sort of content make
series of it so that people like they're
like oh my god I've always wanted to see
a bioshock many 6s oh yeah so than that
people can do that it would draw people
to bittorrent because indie stuff isn't
always gonna draw people right
anything you'd like to steal yours I
want to see that because I think I was
telling you before my husband is super
into playing bioshock but if it was like
a series then I would be into watching
him oh that's the missing link yeah okay
I know your kind of dead but you should
think about doing that to kiss what is
to cash okay makes bioshock okay so it's
kind of a sensitive subject to soon all
right so that moves that moves us on to
our last piece of user feedback which is
the photog refer of the day alright so
this is where yeah it's a cool word yeah
copyright you can't use on your podcast
okay so basically something I was going
to just you just change your name of
your podcast so basically someone sent
us a photo and they have a little story
about it so today James sent us a photo
here's James's photo oh wow that's
really cool James took this with the
galaxy s4 James says I took these photos
with my samsung galaxy s4 what made
these photos even more interesting was
that they were tornado warnings and
watches in the surrounding area these
look like cloud tornadoes enjoy well you
scared us James does a really cool yeah
like it's kind of like a like a backlit
type thing mm-hmm very cool oh yeah see
who's got the like like the wiz right
the wind thing in there I don't we know
are you a meteorologist yeah the wind
thing and then dig the heavy hands in
the air and then your wetness wetness
