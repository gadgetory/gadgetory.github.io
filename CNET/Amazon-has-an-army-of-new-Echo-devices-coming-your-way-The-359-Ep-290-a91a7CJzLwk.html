Studios in New York City it's episode
290 of the 359 podcast starting late
today because we have a lot of coverage
about Amazon my name is BVG and in the
house I've got Alfred Inge and our very
own Amazon guru Ben Fox Ruben oh thank
you very much so yeah there was a ton of
Amazon news that the company dropped on
us at a Seattle product launch event
today we're gonna get through as much as
we can on it on the podcast I can also
can't wait to have an echo in every
drawer right and we'll also try to get
to like the Twitter news that they're
experimenting with 280 characters
instead of 140 apparently everybody on
Twitter is getting really excited about
that news too as always sending your
questions and comments BBG we'll get to
as many as you can at the end of the
show without further ado let's do the
podcast starting the recording of the
audio podcast and we'll be back to take
your questions and comments in the chat
in 3 minutes and 59 seconds from 3 to
welcome to the 359 I'm dead Fox ribbon
I'm Alfred Aang so Amazon had a big
product launch event today where they
basically announced everything in the
kitchen sink related to the Amazon echo
which is their Smart speaker line
powered by the Alexa voice assistant is
uh is this exciting or even keep up how
many products that they announced I
don't even I'm not even sure but it may
have been well over five or six specific
echo products there was a new Amazon
echo which is a little bit slimmer and
he's going to include like a shell so it
looks a little bit nicer they renamed
the original echo the echo plus that's
going to have some better sound and have
an integrated smart home hub inside it's
also the echo spot what what is that
that's like an echo dot with you know
the screen so is it like begs the
question why are they doing this and is
it too many echo products there I feel
like they gremlins to this where you
know a general gremlins there was just
the one normal gremlin and
and gremlins too they're like alright
now we got like lightning gremlin now we
got a girl like killer gremlin and we've
got smart gremlin gremlin yeah and now
that's what I feel like with the new
like echo lines now it's like all right
now we got phone echo and now we're
screening act yea echo connect we didn't
even mention that that one's $35 it's
going to come out later this year and
it'll allow you to make phone calls
including to 9-1-1 also as part of the
announcement today they mentioned that
you'll be able to make phone calls to
the us/mexico in canada for free using
your echo devices not including 9-1-1 so
again there's going to be a little bit
of consumer confusion when it comes to
these devices as to what you use them
for where you use them all that stuff
not to mention that you know they've
already opened up the Alexa capabilities
because because of the software you know
other hardware makers so now it's just
Alexa on this and Alex on the singing
fish that people have on their walls ass
yes yes and there's so much of it out
there now there is it's also worth
mentioning the fact that there were also
two other echo devices that already got
announced earlier this year the echo
show which has a touchscreen and allows
you to make video calls there's also the
echo look which provides you fashion
advice it has like a camera on it and
you like take like full-body selfies
isn't there also the the - thing that
like the thing you put on your fridge
that you have to wand yeah that that I
think was an update of an existing
product but they added Alexa into yeah
so what is this like is do they
seriously expect people to like buy all
these like different echo products for
their home or is it more of like does
this fit your need okay then you can get
that or like so our colleague Reich
Crist is there definitely encourage you
to check out his Twitter feed and you
know to read up on his upcoming stories
on all this stuff he talked to some
Amazon folks and preliminary obviously
there's a lot to chew over here but
they're saying that it's all about
choice providing people with all sorts
of different options for different
usages different price points all sorts
of stuff like that I would probably
argue that the most successful Amazon
products in general and the most
successful echo products have been their
least expensive one the echo dot you
you could see it right there on the
electronics product page the echo dot is
number two and number five on the
electronics product page on Amazon so
that's proof positive right there that
that's the one that's really selling
whether some of these other ones are
also going to make some serious headway
we'll see and you have been diligently
paying attention to the echos page they
know that there hasn't been a new one on
Amazon in several months right the the
original echo had been out of stock for
a lot of time is this worth the wait for
the new echo I mean like it goes it went
down in price from like one hundred and
eighty dollars to a hundred dollars so
obviously if you were one of the last
people to get an echo for a hundred and
eighty dollars I obviously feel bad for
you the echo plus is a hundred and fifty
dollars so they're also they're trying
to compete on price and plenty of other
things as you know Apple Google Samsung
are all pushing into the smart home
market so either way we kind of ran at a
time here but if you want to read more
about this stuff there's plenty on CNET
on it Ben Fox Ruben I'm out for hang
thanks for watching thanks for listening
I lost track of time there didn't ya I
was talking as fast as I could I'm just
shows where it's been like we've got
over like a whole minute that's about
average you know what I didn't even
mention the echo buttons which were like
probably the most confusing of all the
products these are basically Bluetooth
connected buttons that you press you can
connect to Alexa to do like three-card
Monte like the variety of J's like all
sorts of different games and stuff so
and it's like 2 for 20 dollars so
they're they're definitely chumming the
water with so many different kinds of
products this is this is Amazon in a
nutshell I guess is that they're just
they're doing all kinds of
experimentation to try to figure out
what exactly people are interested in
they still sell the Amazon tap by camera
echo and bottle holder back right guitar
but like the Amazon tap from the
third-party research that I've seen
really does
sell all that well it's there on the go
echo and for the longest time you had to
press a button on the side to actually
ping Alexa the voice assistant so it
kind of was like totally did like self
defeating in like why you would do voice
computing in the first place but they
still sell that and as they continue to
expand at some point one would expect
them to at least slim down the product
line instead they've expanded it
enormous Lee this year and it just feels
like so much junk ok so that's I'm it
would be very interesting to see I I
don't want to like make that type of
like strong statement quite yet because
like will like the echo dot when that
came out that became a huge hit so maybe
one of these to have it be cheaper and
be able to plug in with like on an aux
cord on like better speakers or anything
to be small and discreet yeah that made
a lot of sense there's things like the
echo buttons I'd be surprised of that
like sold at all right or if they're
like even use the stocking stock or like
if you if you have an echo like I can't
imagine any family out there thing I
wish I could play Trivial Pursuit with
these buttons there's like an Amazon
skull that's right up there with Apple
sheet Bowl and I'm not trying to come
down on anybody for that it's just that
if you're invested you're invested like
the loyalty clause is what wins out in
this am i right I don't think Amazon has
that audience I think they wanted I
think that's why they're working towards
here and and I think you're onto
something in that the more smart homes
of the future that are enabled with echo
devices as opposed to Apple devices or
Google devices that's a big win for
Amazon and that I would probably argue
as a central reason why they're doing
this if you get hooked into Amazon Prime
and the echo universe whether it's from
the echo spot or the echo connect or
whatever it is and maybe they don't even
know or the echo II baton yay Brian
we're gonna go featuring Dante from the
Devil May Cry series via Columbus but
like the more people the more folks that
they're more D to convince you know and
like they look at these as like these
different gateways into the world of
Amazon remember now hopes that they can
convince
and echo for all right so speaking of
these product lines let's go over a few
like let's just kind of revisit what
we've come from in the last three years
and where we're going so let me just get
the original echo out here
oh god no wait that's my copy but it
does look a lot like it sounds big
here's cylindrical oh there it is you
just carry that around
yeah there's lots convenient and at the
point of these things so you know this
is this is big its bulky it's heavy
I chose with it I've routinely described
it as a Pringles can shaped object and
it's not super attractive and it's also
a three year old model almost three
years old they first introduced it in
November 2014 so this is the first
really big design change that they had
with these and what they did was they
shrank it down they made it look a
little bit prettier where you could add
shells to it like would my gals like a
shell like a Google home exactly or like
a home pod if you had a clock Shalit
makes it look I will say it's
interesting that they timed this a week
before Google event totally intentional
yeah one of the things that Google is
expected to announce next week is a
Google home Mini for what was it like 50
bucks I think isn't like a metal that
will directly compete with the echo died
but you're not gonna buy a Google home
Mini if you have echo buttons yeah
because you love your echo buttons look
I love this home assistant but how do I
play three-card Monte with it alright so
in a world premiere first we actually
have a beta release of the new echo they
send it along to us as an exclusive
preview have that figured we should take
a look at this and compare contrast with
the original echo so I mean the height
of different comedy over here you're
doing an amazing difference the
difference in height is daunting I think
that's a huge win for them also I really
like that new texture it feels kind of
like a chamois cloth from the studio
that you use to clean camera lenses
sometimes you could unplug it and then
animal blue
ring around the top her in chief honey
boo ya mode she actually tweeted out a
really good point just basically ask
them with the cloth around it how
frequently can you wash it yeah
oh is that a joke on like the Levi's yes
okay yeah yeah so if you're out of the
loop so Levi and Google teamed up for
this like smart coat this like smart
jacket that has like Bluetooth stuff
seemed into it so you can compress on it
to like control your music and whatnot
course you can only wash it like ten
times and it's three hundred and fifty
dollar price you can wash it at all cuz
it's woven into the seams so it's yeah
so yeah do not throw your new echo into
the wash not yet anyway
all right echo goggles the guy goes do
nothing oh so that's the other thing is
that Financial Times earlier this year
or sorry earlier this month said that
Amazon is working on a pair of smart
classes that were Alexa enabled so you
you would just like walk around town and
be like Alexa what's well I don't know
like what's my news briefing or what's
the next thing on my schedule what am I
looking at you I don't know probably
nothing I mean like it's like with you
know glasses with no lenses I suppose I
just want to look like Geordi running
around yeah here at City but you know I
think that staring at people no I'm not
staring I'm getting my my stocks there
there's at least proof from that rumor
that there will definitely be more echo
products I mean like they're not gonna
stop with just that so don't answer
right now but by the end of the show we
need to theorize where they're gonna
shove echo next the echo house I mean
like it's inevitable right bye yeah yeah
you have like a modular house they plop
it down in on your you know in your your
parcel that you just purchase then the
whole thing is echo integrated that's it
alright it is time for us to finally get
to the questions oh I thought some of
those may have been questions anyways
thanks everybody for watching we're just
having our fun here Matthew - your ask
the - are the Alexa buttons related to
the - buttons good question I don't
think so these are mostly they seem to
be like just for you know they do have a
button thing going on
no they do have a button thing going on
this one is much more specific that it
looks like for playing games you'd be
really stupid if they restricted it just
to like playing games related to your
echo but I don't run the team there so I
don't know what they're what decisions
are making with that what else would you
use it for though you press the one I
mean you buy like it you could program
it that's like a - button kind of thing
you could like the days are way cheaper
or anything like that yeah well it
wouldn't be twenty dollars is my point
if they were like speakers I guess I
don't know that wouldn't just seemed
like kind of a fun little throwaway idea
for for them they priced them really
lower yeah and dollars apiece and I I
think that they're trying to get more
game skills going and if you introduce
the this one if that's a sorry how to
make the algorithm smarter and more
human instead get it to be more playful
yeah I mean that'll teach Alexa to be
more like us I guess so maybe not with
the button specifically but you know
with each iteration I feel like the
buttons would be like a really
passive-aggressive gift to give to
somebody when like they don't have an
echo or if they have a Google what what
you don't have an echo I didn't know
sorry more question yes terrible people
itself is an entire show did Amazon
explain this is from Michael Brown
what's up Michael Brown hey Michael did
Amazon explain why someone would upgrade
their current echo no they didn't I
don't where I was at the event I wasn't
there but we were you know in
conversation the whole time and there
didn't seem to be much mentioned at all
about that they added a lot of
additional functionality to existing
echo products that would cut down the
need to buy a new echo so that's that's
a really good question what exactly
would the purpose of upgrading to a new
one yeah we've talked about this in a
previous like livestream or podcast
where I feel like a lot of these like
home assistants are gonna fall victim a
tablet syndrome yeah where people will
get tablets and they'll be fine with
them for like a really long time to the
point where they why do I even need to
upgrade this like every three four years
yeah one of the guys I interview
that was like one of the earliest
engineers that joined the echo team at
Amazon says that he told me that he had
to pre-launch builds of the echo at his
house that he never upgraded because
they didn't really change it out of the
launch and you know it's it's not like a
phone where it's a very it provides all
these new hardware I mean that's it on
that's good on Amazon and you know
Google to do that with their voice
assistance I really hope you know
there's no like planned obsolescence on
any of these like products hopefully not
I I mean the whole point with this like
this thing is not really the product per
se the product is Alexa the product is
Google assistant or Bixby or Siri yeah
and it is especially within the world of
the echos where you're creating all
these different shaped houses for Alexa
as opposed and by the way sorry if I'm
triggering a bunch of different that
goes right now but it's it's you're
you're just providing different places
for you to ping Galax as opposed to
having like new or exciting looking
hardware obviously they have a reason
for wanting to make it to look better
because you can make it look better than
this but Alexa is the product did you
look at handle on this yeah okay I don't
look good I thought that was known
Amazon put the candle inna I thought
that was part of their new ambience as
the product launch wanted lighter euro
integrated echo candle echo candle and
you know you get the Ouija board out and
you know you ask Alexa but not an echo
skill for Ouija yet maybe there is I
mean there are 20,000 skills so maybe
they're actually all echoes are
currently summoning ghosts we just don't
know it yet
and then the buttons would move to the
letters huh oh that would be a fun game
that would be you can have that for free
Jeff let's get do a couple more
questions before a call today Parker
asks can the echo buttons connect to a
speaker and playing music the echo
buttons I think are really just for like
were limited
super limited just for like gaming
skills and unit tasker's as it were
right and I think that people have used
- buttons for different things like
they've hacked - buttons so I would
some people to one a hack echo buttons
but it'll be interesting to see what
they actually do with them because they
do seem pretty limited I won't say if
they can connect two speakers to play
music I'd buy like 20 of them like so
they're just basically $10 echo dots
yeah you're suggesting yeah they're not
speakers the best I could tell is it's
like had an op sport that could connect
to them they probably won't but if they
could mmm I would buy like 20 of them
yeah
shout out to Jeff er we haven't seen him
in a while and he's back on the back on
the chat man and he's saying I want my
entire house to just be an Alexa box
that I walk into mm-hmm yeah yes and
then the theories is that says it's
already a horror movie
there's several times my mom goes evil I
think that was in mr. robot season two
where somebody's smart home gets taken
over that's like the first episode yeah
like they you use like you're in the
shower and the smart home like turns it
up like two super hot water and yeah
she's cool and yeah the alarm system
goes off and she can't shut it or
anything like that yeah yes so sure as
we keep integrating this stuff into our
lives we'll see if it goes haywire and
ruins everything but hopefully that
doesn't happen and hopefully people
still realize that you can unplug this
stuff the the echo stuff pretty easily
and then not have it run operate your
life let's do a quick run down back
through the the product line as a
refresher as to what is coming and why
they're coming and then Derek wants to
know if you had one if you could have
one in your house which one would you
take okay so probably the biggest
takeaways today are the newly designed
and shorter echo that's gonna cost a
hundred dollars if you buy three at the
same time it's $50 off so good about 250
right 250 total there's also the echo
plus that's with the same original
design but it's going to have better
sound and smart home hub built in that I
already say it was 150 bucks there's
also the echo spot
which is 130 dollars that's basically an
echo dot with like visit like a little
video yeah like a it's like tilt it up
and there's a screen yeah a little a
little small display included there's a
new fire TV device for $69 so and I
think that includes 4k they announced
like a ton of stuff today they also
announced like a BMW partnership where
they're going to integrate Alexa into
BMW cars by 2018 and then there's an eco
connect there's the echo connect which
can make phone calls that one's $35 he's
smart landline phone yeah
so which one which one would I like to
have I mean one of the ones that I don't
have that I'd be really interested in is
the echo show that ones two hundred and
thirty dollars you could make calls to
other echo shows I think now you can
make phone calls to everybody with it
so it's got like a large display so you
could almost say like it's a mounted
tablet but at the same time it provides
a lot more you don't think that the show
is obsolete now with the spot around
though weird speaker and it has a screen
and it's not this bulky like little but
it's a tiny screen how is that screen
all that means of all the products that
they announced if anything I would want
the spot because it would replace like
all the clocks and not clots but it
looked like the alarm clock no time do
the video calls and stuff it's valuable
but when they demonstrated the show
originally I like the idea that they
were showing it being and using the
kitchen and showing you how to do
cooking videos recipes he's going
through that with the spot means you can
if you have any ridiculous vision but
yeah it would be much more synchronous
to you on the show like a magnifying
glass or something remember the old game
boys when they had magnifying lens on it
[Laughter]
but yeah I think going forward we might
see like an Alexa wearable or something
like that whether it is glass like the
smart glasses or a watch Amazon is
obviously finding different ways to get
into phones to where like they integrate
Alexa into other manufacturers phones
so that's that's another thing to expect
going forward and they're already doing
a lot of that you know through either
with you know mobile phones or
automotive there are more than a few
people James favor included who are
excited about echo functionality in the
car mmm where do we think that's gonna
go uh I saw a very early demo from Ford
at CES in January and it was it was
buggy and it was a little clunky you had
to ask Samantha which was the Ford voice
assistant to ping Alexa so it was it was
still pretty complicated and didn't work
all the time so it was like Samantha
asked Alexa what the weather is I'm like
what like that doesn't work very clunky
yeah so I think that it's gonna take a
while to really fully integrate more
properly into cars but with more cars
coming out like with newer models coming
out you probably get much better
functionality where you can get like
direction and weather and being able to
make phone calls to people a lot of that
stuff does exist for certain vehicles
now but it might be easier to get it to
more people by having an Alexa
integration there was a kind of like a
demo on how to get your own Alexa
integrated car where like somebody he he
put like a dot and like the cup holder
in his car and his he had one of those
cars that has its own like Wi-Fi like he
put like they pay like a monthly data
plan for that and they're basically
saying like oh this is my way of getting
Alexa in the car mm-hmm and by
physically putting her in there yeah and
like to mention area yeah and then like
like it was pretty cool but then there
was a interesting point brought up in
the article where was like it's really
annoying when my kids like don't like
the music that I'm listening to and they
can just so you can turn it off yeah I
mean that just got me anything you know
like road trips if like friends would be
terrible with that because it's like
next song next up well maybe I I the art
of the Ox table man I think that the the
software could be made good enough where
it would only respond to your voice
potentially I mean like the Google home
or it doesn't yeah where where it has
multi user functionality I think Amazon
is eventually going to get there they
just haven't quite yet so yeah alright
we're almost at a time but this one got
my attention
s s s I think the name was do you expect
better Alexa integration - home theater
asking your dot to turn on a VR TV etc
now they're already starting that kind
of work towards that with the fire TV
and a fire TV stick but yeah that would
be that that's isn't that the dream in
all of this is to make the other
electronic entertainment aspects of your
home living yeah just at the the grace
of your voice yeah great question and
there are certain of those capabilities
already out there but probably not as
awesome as people are really hoping and
not as seamless which David Katz Myer
was here because he would probably be
able to answer this a lot more easily
Amazon has been making it easier and
easier to be able to control your home
entertainment using the Alexa ecosystem
but I think there's still I'm surprised
the the new fire stick is not like Alexa
enabled we were actually expecting that
yeah
we were expecting a fire TV box that was
essentially a tiny yeah
echo died that also helped that would
that would have made a lot of sense
maybe that one's coming I mean like that
one came from a F TV what makes more
sense than buttons
yeah the funds I mean like that was one
of like many things but you know yeah
the buttons don't do much yeah let me
know if you buy buttons so let's get our
predictions out there imagine soggy
already pitched in predictions for the
echo phone forthcoming and then he was
gently reminded that the last Amazon
phone venture did not go so hot it
totally flamed out yeah yeah it was
pretty icy there are rumors that out
there are rumors that Amazon was working
on a new phone I talked to David limp a
couple months ago
who's the Amazon head of devices and he
was like super squirrely about it it's
like no comment like don't want to talk
about it no like not gonna say much
about that now where do we need echo in
your life though Ben where do I need it
in my life yeah that I don't that they
don't have I actually like having it in
my house I think it works quite well as
I've enjoyed mine but where do you need
it now I
at this point it works very well as a
smart home give me a shower no this is
not what this discussion is about where
does they go net where do they go next
because they are going somewhere else
next its its automotive they already
said that and also mobile phones through
other manufac
we need a shower echo where it's like
waterproof and it runs on batteries and
then you can put it in your shower like
I have a shower radio right now but it'd
be awesome happily serious answer out of
you I was accepted I was expecting far
worse that's that's actually pretty
solid like that would that would work I
was thinking about replacing my shower
radio with do that with an Amazon tap
already if you like encased it in some
sort of like plastic or whatever you
could probably do it and there I mean
like there are all kinds of there's not
really smart home tech for the shower
we're like I could be like turn on hot
water and you know like echo shower yeah
it'd be awesome it's like the showerhead
is an echo maker no maker really
intuitive so that all you have to do is
tell her what mood you're in like I had
a long day like draw your own therapy or
it's just like and it automatically
orders new like soap or like shampoo
when you're like running low or if you
said buttons or if you said you had a
long day not only does it draw you a
bath but it was you it orders you a
pizza Darkon no Alexa if she was in the
shower and then I'm hungover and it's
just ice cold then like it made you eggs
just like eggs downstairs yeah echo
shower bed on it right I wouldn't be
that surprised if they came out with
like a watch I guess but I don't really
think that they're going into phones
anytime soon they really got burned I
think I think they need to put it in the
public transit wouldn't that be great
just having her readily available to
everybody play Metallica look I I for
one you've heard me rant before I think
it's far too peaceful on the morning
commute
I think it would be fantastic to have a
soothing voice to ride along with you
sure sure
but yeah anyway there are all kinds of
different places that it could be going
but it seems very clear that they're
very very focused on smart home because
they know that's a huge market right now
and there's a lot of competition coming
so on the train it just like Alexa what
time is it just yell out Showtime and
starts breakdancing Aries have no idea
what we're talking about look it up it
won't be hard to find alright that's a
perfect place to cut it out for the day
that was a good show thanks everybody
yeah thanks great questions everybody
always fun to talk about this stuff
anyway the 359 is available on iTunes
tune in stitcher SoundCloud feed Berg
Google Play Music and of course
