I'm Richard carrion Cena calm and it's
time to get loaded google music has
arrived and it's coming out swinging at
iTunes okay so here's the breakdown of
how it works you can buy music from
google music from three of the four
major music labels it will be in the
android store you can upload up to
20,000 songs in your personal library to
google's online servers for free so you
can access your music from any computer
or android-based device like a phone or
tablet Google will recommend songs based
on what you and your friends like a
friend can let you listen to a song or
album they own so there's also this
feature for independent musicians called
artist hub bands distribute their own
music and set their own song prices they
just have to pay Google $25 to create a
page and google keeps thirty percent of
the sales from the songs and to lure you
in there's some exclusive music on there
like six never released concerts from
the Rolling Stones a Coldplay concert
and Busta Rhymes has a single available
for free t-mobile customers can have
whatever they buy in google music
builder ectly to their tmobile account
and they get extra perks like today
there's free music from maroon 5 Drake
and Busta Rhymes to show disapproval of
the anti-piracy bill being heard in
Congress several websites are
symbolically blacking out their front
pages or throwing up pop-ups on the
screen the reason being these companies
say the bill called the Stop Online
Piracy Act would allow for Congress to
censor the Internet so sites like tumblr
or blacking out all their texts and
others put up fake banners blocking
access to the site so it would show what
it would be like if the internet was
censored and thereby encouraging
visitors to contact their
representatives but some sites like
Boing Boing how to take it down because
some users couldn't bypass the block
banner and actually use the Site when
you see the salvation army bell ringers
in front of stores is holiday you don't
need to put cash in their buckets you
can give them your card the charity is
using square the mobile payment card
swiper that attaches to mobile devices
the Salvation Army is testing this new
technology because it says many people
just don't carry cash anymore AOL
instant messenger yes that's right we're
talk about AOL is getting a refresh the
biggest revamp it is done in years to
add more pizzazz to the fading service
it will show web-based photos and video
in the chat window and sync your
conversations across various devices and
that buddy list it's now your aim
friends listed in order by who you most
recently chatted with Amos been
struggling to stay relevant as more
people use facebook and google mail for
chatting and currently aim is in third
place behind yahoo messenger and windows
live messenger comscore estimates aims
visitors dropped sixty-five percent the
past year it had about 4.9 million users
last month those are your headlines for
today I'm Bridget Carey for cnet.com and
you've just been loaded goodbye finals
