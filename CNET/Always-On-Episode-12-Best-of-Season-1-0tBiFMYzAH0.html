agreeing to lie i did not know that no
shocked that girl can cuss sorry please
cut that clearly we have a lot of fun
making this show I hope you can tell by
your blooper reel and I hope you have as
much fun watching it as we have making
it now one of our big controversies in
season one was the great unboxing
scandal of 2012 I'm not even sure if
it's resolved yet because there's still
debate over whether to have the box on
set all I know is there's a big cult
following on YouTube for these unboxing
videos and a lot of you want to see
every piece of styrofoam every
peripheral that comes in the box and
every piece of plastic wrap literature
we can possibly pull out of there
already well be careful what you wish
for the biggest box that i have opened
here it always on was the personal rover
box and although our editor made it look
like a seamless kind of unboxing the
reality was very different like ruptured
disc different gr eight hundred be PR
800 be pra under be inside is the
personal rover electric scooter PR 800
be now that's heavy
this thing smells like plastic just hope
you're happy now unboxing people
unboxing literalists I can do it sweet
Jesus hmm Jesus ah whenever you ride the
personal transportation vehicle you risk
death or serious injury from loss of
control collision sir well it looks like
this thing just goes in here I don't
even think this thing Oh what that's not
oh oh oh I get it sorry it's like are
you gonna go skiing or something like
that like some like skiing skittering
like you can take your date on this
thing as well when you go oh I love that
come on you cannot love that smell it
smells just like a go-kart I love that
this actually maybe just this by itself
is a little tiny bit of a CrossFit
workout it doesn't go so I had pretty
much given up on this thing until Brett
the intern discovered a secret power
button on the side of the personal rover
that is not in the manual and not in the
YouTube video but now we've gotten it
moving so I'm gonna just try to drive it
to the elevator so that we can drive it
around outside a little bit hi first
that for real it's the personal rover
electric scooter how do you go backwards
no reverse are you doing so I'm just
gonna hit the wall or nothing your lunch
oh yeah
no no no I ok
it's the personal rover
I'm just testing it I think it's a death
trap don't buy it but we're having a lot
of fun today you want to try it out yeah
totally we should probable I ability
release for this or whatever do you want
to try it it's called the personal rover
she didn't want to drive it though
you'll drive it hi how's it going would
you like to try my personal river
he didn't want any instructions
there you go
I gotta say I was so ready to unleash a
hurricane of snark on the personal rover
and that everyone loved it the entire
scene at office like 50 people on the
street we're having a blast with it the
company told us they sold three of them
right after our segment aired who knew
now here it always on we have a lot of
interviews that have to get cut for time
and at e3 I met this wonderful
professional gaming couple T squared and
mrs. violence and we were only focused
on the future of gaming but they had so
much to say so now you get to see the
full interview so I'm here at e3 with
Kelly Kelly otherwise known as mrs.
violence or as i like to call her mrs.
awesome also tom taylor t squared
keeping it simple you guys are actually
pro gamers what are your games of choice
mine right now is call of duty and if
not any specific holla judy just call it
unique okay i specialize in all shooters
but halo is my game so i'm super excited
that halo 4 is here oh yeah so how close
is hey look for like when you say here
it's here I mean it's arrived we played
three of the new maps I've seen a lot of
the campaign and the multiplayer and
they've done a lot of things halo reach
didn't have the best sales and call of
duty her game is kind of taking over so
I think halo 4 is gonna be that go to
shooter when it comes to console gaming
do you think you would ever switch are
you gonna be call of duty forever uh I
could do both i mean i've started in
halo grew up watching this guy play and
he was a big inspiration and then
college dude he just kind of took over
because it's that military based shooter
and I really kind of like that nitty
gritty dirty game and I just grew away
from Halo but I could go right back into
it without a doubt plus I got him as a
trainer easy nice I like it teamwork
teamwork among do you ever you so you
don't compete against each other because
you're in different games well
that's actually not true we competed
against each other in battlefield 3 4 50
grand we were in the finals on the
controller and she ended up luckily
beating me know she totally whooped me
she's awesome at military base shooters
she's one of the best girl FPS is out
there so we also you know spent a lot of
time together we've been together for a
year now and it's you know a couple of
that games the other stays together so
we have a lot of fun we're pretty
competitively you getting totally
darling yeah I mean look how cute they
are so like how how badass are you like
what are you know what are your ranking
in the world of gamers well I'm pretty
much one of the top female FPS gamers
I've placed extremely high on the major
league gaming circuit top 20 a couple
times and I pro coached top five teams
as well as you know just you know
starting off really young and starting
to make money at a very young age so
that's kind of like my dominant state I
guess I've been considered one of the
best table players of all time I'm not
trying to be cocky I haven't I don't say
that that's other people say mom and I
feel extremely grateful and blessed to
have this is my job because we love
gaming so much and just coming to e3 is
a blessing so it's just the most
whatever so two full-time jobs motivated
yeah that's job doing that my job's like
okay and that's pretty good so I want to
talk about some of the gear that you
guys use but first you know we're doing
a piece for our show on kind of a future
of gaming you know this III has been
less about Hardware more about software
what do you think is coming in the
future do you think we're gonna get to
like you know the post console world
cloud gaming like you know what's the
future of this industry I really think
that it's only gonna be going further
further further even with eSports it's
only gonna grow grow grow but stuff like
watch dogs sleeping dogs Sasson screed
these games are all stepping up their
graphics and gameplay so I only see
consoles actually growing I only see you
know maybe next year new consoles coming
out as well as pc titles you know you
got crysis 3 that's also insanely pc
title
insane graphics so I really think that
hardware and software are all just going
to grow they're like selfish in a year
driving I want to add something because
everyone's always you know like 10 years
ago virtual reality virtuality we have
the kinect now the kinect is awesome i
love it i love the wii as well but when
it comes to you know competitive gaming
when it comes to shooting games I don't
want to go around and go and do virtual
reality if I wanted that would go do in
real life as well as like playing
basketball I'm gonna go outside and
maybe get a tan and set so I don't want
to see it cannot get to too crazy but I
think that it does have the potential
we'll see maybe when the next generation
systems comes out because you want it
you know what to get to that point where
you're wearing the goggles you're
totally immersed and I don't want to
howl like a jacket that I can feel like
the bullets hitting me and it hurts like
reloading I sit on my butt and play with
you I kind of love that I kind of love
that all right now I know that every
profession when you take it seriously on
specialized gear yes and I know you guys
are out to show optics these are gutters
there are special glasses that help you
pretty much see and they take a lot of
eye strain off your eyes I can't play
without them anymore just due to the
fact that I get migraines and from
looking at an LCD screen for up to like
nine hours a day and it just really can
take all that straight away also you
know can prevent wrinkles in your eyes
so ladies they are making you know
computer ones you work on a computer all
day same thing same effect so help with
that thing i get this super dry eyes
like when i play here as long as I'm not
blinking ever takes all the dryness out
all the red strain everything also I
think what happens is the reason the
glasses are so well designed as it takes
a lot of the airflow that comes in which
is they're drying your eyes out so
that's what they're designed for rob's
wraps all the way around your eyes also
extremely flexible frame that really
helps when we use our headsets yes
which is there a professional gaming
company they just came out with the
major league gaming sites I'm mouse is
amazing it's not your ordinary Mouse it
actually has a menu on the back it's not
plugged in right now so you can't
officially see it but you can change all
of your settings from there and also
what we're talking about with the
Gunners is they're designed for headsets
so you know you know when you put on a
headset and you're wearing glasses you
could feel a little crammed up these go
these glasses and headphones go hand in
hand and this is their Siberia v2
probably the most comfortable headset
I've ever wore the strap right here
makes it feel like complete air not only
that it's just a really high-end headset
and the quality is amazing so I've gone
through testing out Astro sennheisers
and nothing compares it easy and it's
obviously a headset with a mic so that
you can do yes a retractable mic so you
don't have to go and you know nerd out
super hardcore and look like an air
traffic control pilot when you're you
know sitting and sitting in the airplane
to you listen to music they thought of
everything and then I'm holding these
lovely pink ones which actually these
are these are my new favorite pair
steelseries is actually doing cute
little donation towards every purchase
has like twenty percent towards breast
cancer so that's awesome that they're
doing that and they brought the whole
limited edition back just to do that
that you know give away in charity so
really really really like these super
comfortable super light extremely
durable you can like it's awesome they
don't bring headphones when you're
playing can't go and you know just
listen through to the TV because what if
someone else is blaring music it's
obviously really loud at e3 you want to
get into the zone you want to immerse
yourself and when you put on these
headphones and you put on these classes
you know it's time to play and that's
the best part about if you like suited
up yeah it actually almost fixes your
posture to which is a little scientific
thing in the background
alright so where you guys off to from e3
what's next MLG anaheim is this weekend
so i'll be covering a lot of League of
Legends for Riot Games and GameSpot it's
going to be a great event for me yeah we
just actually this is going to be

eSports stuff for gamespot we're here

tunnels future tech segment is like this

and did i mention that season two is
premiering next week I thought maybe I
did just checking
even with a few weeks off the email has
been rolling in you guys are the best
let's start off with this one from NAB's
hey Molly do you think Kathryn is my
type should i buy her an iphone 4s or
samsung galaxy s3 love the show keep
talking about the tech NAB's I don't I
mean I feel really embarrassed here
NAB's did we meet at a party you me and
Kathryn and I just don't remember
because how rude maybe it's just yeah
you know what I'm just going to assume
that it's crazy male and also NAB's if
you don't know Kathryn well enough to
know if she's an iOS or an Android girl
you have a lot more research to do pay
attention boys it's all about the
details let's keep the male go and this
one is from Simon who says can I please
get some cnet TV stickers I love the
show keep it up also what do you do with
all the technology review and destroy on
all your shows please respond thank you
so much oh man if I had a nickel for all
the sticker requests I have gotten here
at cnet TV I could afford to buy some
stickers actually we have some stickers
on the way and possibly some giveaway
plans for all those gadgets so keep
tuned to season two when will give you
all the details moving on an awesome
two-parter from Nathan the other day
while I was mowing the lawn I was
pondering things you could torture test
then it popped into my head Molly would
just love to torture the Google Nexus Q
so please please PLEASE torture it you
could go bowling with it drop it down
stairs put lipstick on it my cousin
wanted to do that for some reason whoa
something my friends dog tried to eat
his so maybe it attracts dogs to it like
a beacon of fun and then Nathan sends a
follow up wait back up the truck to
finish what I said about my dog trying
to eat the Google Nexus Q it did survive
also Sharon was rather reckless with
those scissors making the sim card
that's right i'm watching you Sharon she
really should be more careful as for you
Molly in response to the iphone 4s
torture test my brother let his go
through the wash and it actually
survived ok ok ok ok enough of my 1 30am
ran
and my dot dot dots you guys make me
feel like an old lady with all your
super late night emails i will say i
kind of want to get a t-shirt that says
beacon of fun on it that would be an
awesome t-shirt and i think if we wrap
the Nexus Q and bacon and then took it
to a dog park we would get slightly more
dramatic results I mean one dog not a
problem but 20 dogs now we're talking
next up an email from Leonardo hello
Molly I'm Brazil yam and I love your
show if this text have some mistakes
sorry but I hope you understand it I
would like to see new iphone 5 or 6 that
may be launched in September 12th fall
over from the last floor of empire state
building transamerica pyramid or
something like that or the windows phone
in the worst acid you could find there
would be great thanks Leonardo zampieri
PS if you read this please answer me I'd
love
Wow acid you really don't like that
Windows Phone at all I think there are
some inherent dangers and dropping a
phone off a really high building like
the pedestrians down below although Jim
lands owned our CBS I President did say
that he could get us up on the roof of
cnet so there could be some drama in
your future all right can we get to drop
it from higher how about the roof can
you get us on there if anybody here can
get us on the roof I think you're the
guy I can't let's do it next up an email
from Craig but before that I am still
waiting for you guys to send me some
video email I want to see those pretty
faces moving on to Craig he actually
took to the internet to find out how
well or not well I did on my half
marathon he says Molly not to sound
creepy but I had to look up your results
well done now it does sound a little
creepy but Craig is a longtime Twitter
buddy from my home state of Montana and
he followed that up with a nice review
of our fuel band and Fitbit test and he
suggested that I sign up for a half
marathon in Missoula in the coming
months which all sounds great however
Craig is a liar because I did not finish
very well in the marathon I was like 646
out of like 750 if you have to look it
up Greg you want to watch your pants
there buddy they're on fire this next
email is in response to the iphone 4s
cold test hey Molly I just watched your
iphone 4s torture test and was surprised
that you didn't know that low
temperatures drain batteries I'm a
filmmaker and that's one of the first
things you learn when you go filming and
sub-zero and byron's carry extra
batteries love your show though to
torturing stuff you love is hard to
watch Enoch nairobi kenya and now i know
they just didn't really let us out that
