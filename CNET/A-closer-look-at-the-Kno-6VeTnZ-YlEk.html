back with Barbara Habib and Osman the
other co-founder of no and we wanted to
get a little bit closer look at the
interface that we have a different
prototype unit where we can see what the
interface and experience looks like
beyond just opening a single textbook so
barbour why don't you show me what you
have so here we have the desktop this is
when the device opens this is what the
student sees this is what we call the
semester view this is fall 2010 the
student is taking student is taking four
or five classes you have your textbook
your notebook links to your websites
that you may may consider important for
that particular class so this is what we
call the the semester view then we also
have what we call my library and
students are able to figure out exactly
how they want to sort out their content
on this device you can look at all the
content you can look at you can look at
books notebooks darks media on the left
hand side what you have is what we call
the chalkboard and instead of just
dealing with their academic world this
is where they figure out okay what are
they going to do in the next two hours
how they're going to prepare for the
play player here so that they have to go
to what are they doing in the evening
and on top is the app store tab we're
firm believers that all the content is
not gonna come from a single source it's
going to come from multiple sources
including publishers educators
professors and we feel even students are
going to
the contributor contributing as
developers on our platform plus the web
obviously one of the big features is
full linux full web browser so it's it's
a browser-based operating system on top
of embedded Linux we're building on
nvidia's tegra t20 which is a
high-performance low-power platform we
do support flash because a lot of the
educational content is in flash and it's
a browser based OS a full internet
capability great well thanks for giving
us a good look at it thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
