hewlett-packard announced several new
thin and light laptops under the envy
brand some are officially called
ultrabooks equipped with Intel's latest
Ivy Bridge processors while less

college students the tech world is abuzz
over a photo taken with Google's Project
Glass prototype headset google vice
president sebastian throne grabbed his
son by the hand spun him around and took
a photo mid spin with the headset sure
it's not great quality but it shows this
first person point of view action shot

report from GFI software shows that
there's an increase of cyber attacks on
these growing networks people have their
guard down they don't think before they
click and they end up on malicious sites

support all three of Sprint's data
networks 3g wimax and 4g LTE it's called
the tri-five it goes on sale next week

hot spots at the end of the month and
virgin also just got its first 4g phone
the HTC evo v 4g the no-contract phone

sale at the end of May for three hundred
dollars and if you don't care about
these other phones and just want an
iPhone then head to target the store has
knocked fifty dollars off the price of
an iPhone and the sale lasts until the
end of June and you know if you're
trading your old phone at Target it
could even come out to be cheaper and

story out of jungle island it's an
animal attraction in my home

Orangatang are using an autism app on
the iPad to express what they want and
how they feel they also play games and
expand their vocabulary right now the
trainers have to hold the iPad or the
Ranga tang's might break it but the park
