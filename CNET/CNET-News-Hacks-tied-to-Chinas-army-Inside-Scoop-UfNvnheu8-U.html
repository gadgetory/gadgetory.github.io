scoop I'm car tsuboi and i'm joined by
cnet chief political correspondent
Declan McCullough thanks for joining us
Declan and today we are talking about a
new report coming out about over 140
companies that have supposedly been
attacked by someone within China why
don't you clarify a little bit well what
we knew going in and this has been the
case for years now Google was the first
major company to go public with this
about three years ago we knew that
they're a bunch of hackers in China
probably around Shanghai who were
responsible for a lot of these
intrusions but what we didn't know was
whether they're part of the Chinese
government or military and the report
that was released a day or so ago
provides pretty compelling evidence I
mean if this were a jury the jury would
have voted to convict that it's not not
just a group of hackers that are working
independently this is actually a part of
the Chinese army and they're the ones
who are behind oh these hundred plus
intrusions into largely US companies and
how are they doing this how are they
getting in well it's a combination of
sort of low skill and high skill attacks
what what they often do is they'll send
you email that purports to be from your
boss your manager your CEO saying here's
a new presentation here's a new press
release can you double click this and
let me know what you think well that
sounds pretty compelling especially if
it's it comes from a gmail address you
don't you may not know what your boss is
home gmail addresses if it looks
compelling you're probably just going to
click on it and then they get access to
your system from that that an entry
point or access point that they can then
leap frog into other systems I'm map out
the internal network i infect other
computers and it's very difficult to
protect against these it spits they're
called spearfishing it's very targeted
attacks against individuals I mean if
you get email from your mom or your
cousin you might actually open it
absolutely we know that more than 20
different industries have been attached
what do you think the purpose is what
kind of information are they collecting
oh we've known for a while that these
industries being attacked I mean there
was a flurry of articles last summer
saying that say the electric power grid
has been infiltrated
just kind of scary I really fail to
understand why any nuclear power point
house we connected to the internet but
putting that aside there's the
interesting thing is that if you have
control of some of these computers I
mean you can do malicious things you can
destroy data you can alter data which is
almost worse or you can try to take over
some of the control systems that might
control say water utilities or sewage
utilities or or so on but they have it
it's almost like they had order from
above or is it a code of ethics I don't
know but all they're doing is extracting
data it's espionage it's not sabotage
what is the position the US government
is taking on this the US government has
been I mean look the US government is
not entirely stupid they they do know
this is going on they've have it we've
we've known since a year or so that the
Air Force has a special office that has
been looking into this on the government
end but I mean that this is this is it's
not attacking us systems to destroy them
it's not really war in the traditional
sense it's espionage and espionage is
typically handled not by you know
invading other countries but by
diplomatic action so yesterday at the
State Department the spokesman said well
we're talking with its at the highest
levels on what what this means i don't
know there's a White House report due to
come out today talking about espionage
and theft of trade secrets China is
probably the biggest culprit in this
respect and so I think this is something
that's going to be handled at the
diplomatic level and probably not just
in the next year but over the next five
or ten years I would think so as well
both both parties are going to keep
continuing doing what they're doing and
will to see what the response is exactly
great thank you so much Declan
