CES 2013 we're taking a look at the dish
hopper with sling a very very exciting
update two dishes kangaroo flavored
hd/dvr so let's start off with just a
couple of hardware refinements this new
box has a faster processor so everything
should happen we're just a little bit
more snap to it and you get Wi-Fi as
well which means you don't have to
fiddle around hooking the box up to
cables as you may have guessed from the
name this has sling box built into it
and that means that you'll get all of
your live channels plus everything on
your DVR on your mobile devices phone
laptop tablet anywhere you have an
internet connection but what if you
don't have an internet connection I know
it's a troubling thought but a new
feature for this box called hopper
transfers means you'll be able to save
recorded shows onto your iPad for
offline viewing that's good news if
you've got a long flight coming up or a
lengthy car journey and you've got kids
in the back who you want to keep
entertained do keep an eye on file size
though because if you've got one of the
lower capacity iPads you could very
quickly fill it up once you start
transferring TV shows over
sticking with apps for a moment another
new treat for iPad owners is the dish
Explorer app now this is basically an
app that shows you what's on TV
and it's going to have a social element
as well so TV shows that are trending on
Twitter or Facebook are going to bubble
to the top it should give you
recommendations things you might want to
watch next it's coming out in the next
month it's going to be free for new dish
subscribers but if you're a current
customer there's a chance that you'll be
able to nab yourself a tasty upgrade
deal I'm the West wait to see net and
this is the dish hopper with sling
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
