like an iPhone I am Bridget Carey and
this is your scene that update samsung
galaxy phones come in many shapes and
sizes and all are encased in cheap
plastic that is until now Samsung
revealed the Galaxy alpha it's the first
galaxy phone with a metal frame it's not
all metal there is a soft back cover
with a textured design and it looks very
similar to the iPhones metal frame the
Alpha is clearly a step up in design but
when you look at the tech specs it's not
as good as the Galaxy s5 the Alpha
doesn't have the very best screen
resolution tech available and the camera
has fewer megapixels than the s5 there's
also no expandable microSD card slot now
it's still a powerful phone with lots of
features but you just have to wonder
what Samsung's game plan is here and why
they didn't just load it up with the
best tech this wasn't announced with
much fanfare in fact there was only a
press release we don't know yet where
this will be sold or how much it will
cost but it is scheduled to launch in
early September perhaps there is another
metal frame smartphone that will get
more love from Samsung three weeks from
now on September 3rd the company will be
having an event where it will likely
debut the extra large galaxy note 4 and
by the looks of some leaked images from
gsmarena it will also have metal around
the sides the online retail giant Amazon
is trying to expand its reach by tapping
into the offline world amazon created a
secure credit card reader for small
business owners it's called local
register and it's this small card swiper
device that connects into an audio jack
of a smartphone or tablet so stores can
process payments right from an app to
compete with square and PayPal amazon is
taking a smaller cut of the sales for
processing the transactions for those
that sign up before the end of October
Amazon will charge one point seventy
five percent per card swipe until 2016
and to compare paypal charges 2.7% and
square charges to point seventy five
percent now while that's great for
business owners sometimes the rest of us
just need a simple app to send money to
our friends like when you need to pay
someone back for lunch it's also handy
when you have roommates and you have to
keep track of who is paying their share
of the utility bill two apps that may
help our split wise and venmo split wise
lets you set up and track one time and
reoccurring payments for a group of
people and let you send reminders when
someone hasn't paid they can pay with
paypal or use venmo which is actually
its own app that connects to a checking
account that your tech news update for
