we're taking a first look at the
Magellan switch series GPS monitoring
devices now the switch series is right
here on my wrist the whole thing both
devices the switch and the switch up now
basically what this waterproof device
does is it monitors your GPS position
your altitude your speed and whatnot
basically to kind of give you an idea of
what you're doing how fast you're doing
it's great for things like running
walking and because it's waterproof you
can also use it for swimming it can be
paired with an A and T plus accessory
like a heartrate monitor or a bicycle
cadence monitor or a foot pot or a power
meter so you can get other information
to be logged along with your actual
position data and then later on you can
take the switch and pair it up with your
computer and upload all of that data to
active Magellan GPS comm to get a good
look at the path that you've taken
complete with GPS coordinates elevation
changes heart rate if it's present you
can see all of that right here on the
website the switch up is the step-up
model that's a little bit thicker but
that's because it includes a ambient
temperature meter for measuring the well
ambient temperature barometer for more
accurate measuring of the elevation and
a vibration meter so that you can feel
the notifications during those times
that you can't necessarily hear them
it also snaps off of its wristwatch case
so that you can snap it on to a tube
mount for mounting on things like a bike
now that said earlier the switch and
switch up can be paired via USB for
charging they get about eight hours of
battery life out of the box from a full
charge but the switch up can also be
paired with a battery booster that
boosted to 16 hours but if you're gonna
be plugging it up every day to upload
your run you're probably not gonna need
that much battery life now the switch up
is three hundred and forty nine dollars
from Magellan's webstore and the switch
the step-down model is two hundred and
seventy nine dollars
I've been Antoine good with cnet.com and
we've been taking a look at the Magellan
switch series switch and what</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
