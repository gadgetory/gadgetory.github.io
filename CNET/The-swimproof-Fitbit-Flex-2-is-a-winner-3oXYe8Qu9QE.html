fitness tracker that can measure steps
distance calories burned active minutes
and sleep it doesn't do as much as other
fit bits but I still really like it
here's why it's swim proof and that's a
big deal this is the first Fitbit you
don't have to take off when showering or
swimming it can also automatically track
workouts like walking running and biking
and it's the first that can even track
swimming I also like how its slim
discreet and lightweight half the time I
barely notice that's on my wrist you can
also pop the tracker right out of the
band and then pop it into a different
color plus there's also silver and gold
bangles and necklaces to choose from
this is the most stylish and versatile
Fitbit yet and while there are cheaper
trackers out there I still find the Flex
twos price pretty reasonable at only
$100 but here's where it falls short
there's no display so instead it uses
vibration and five tiny LED lights to
tell you how close you are to reaching
your step goal to remind you to move and
to alert you to incoming calls and text
but it can get confusing especially if
you forget what exactly each light means
I'm also not impressed with battery life
I got just under five days which is good
but given the lack of features I was
expecting a week or maybe more but
overall the Flex 2 is still a good
tracker for anyone who wants a simple
discreet and waterproof fitness tracker
plus the Fitbit app is one of our
favorites it's easy to use and there's a
good chance your friends are already
using it for more information on the
Fitbit flex - be sure to check out see
