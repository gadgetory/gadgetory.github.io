board and we've got all the details you
can now go to the land of westeros kind
of and I'll tell you how and a new art
installation is letting users manipulate
a robot arm to create furniture I'm
gonna have it make me an Iron Throne I'm
gonna have it to the robot tomorrow
daily
greetings citizen to the internet
welcome to tomorrow daily must keep talk
show one of these days I'm gonna get
knocked out in the known universe I'm
your host Ashley scouted join me as
always the man the myth the legend kill
anonymous I had an energy drink today I
can't tell I just can't not with you
this is going to be an action-packed
episode so if you're driving if you're
driving be very careful okay I may get
amped eject you may get so Jack that you
just like start swerving and in Craig
demolition derby people just don't do
that don't do that but you're gonna want
to but don't thanks for joining us today
we've got some weird wacky stories for
we do we do so let's hit the headlines
alright so most people know about
raspberry pie oh yeah cheap little bored
you can program all kinds of stuff with
it it's great any that people have done
with it there is now raspberry pi 2 so
we got it whoa board it's out it's
available as far as i know i've seen it
sold out in quite a few places even just
by this morning oh wow um but it's the
same price as the original Raspberry Pi
board but it's got some really
significant upgrades and I'm gonna go
over those with you right now it has got
a quad core processor it's six times
more powerful as the video says right
here it has a gig of ram so they are
they're doing quite well in upgrading
this little tiny this little tiny board
you know and also I thought this was
very interesting again same price as the
original but usually use linux to work
with raspberry pi but microsoft is now
going to be making windows 10 like a
version of Windows 10 to use with the
little tiny raspberry pi 2 yes so the
model oh my god that's that's fantastic
because I don't know anything about
linux oh yeah yes fantastic well and
also I really think this is a great move
by Microsoft because they're introducing
because a lot of people or a lot of
parents will buy a Raspberry Pi for like
their kid who might be into coding so to
get them into Microsoft's ecosystem
early is like a really good strategy for
them in the long run in terms of like
coders and engineers and stuff I think
it's a really good idea and obviously
that's going to be like a side benefit
but it's still a really clever way to
sort of get I younger
are people sort of aware of Windows a
little bit more in depth but it's going
to be a custom version of Windows 10
it's not going to be full windows 10
euro just boot up to the to the Start
menu oh it's somebody will figure it out
that it's going to be a developer
version that is specifically designed
for the Internet of Things for Internet
of Things development so they really
want people to do things like home
automation and you know just random
stuff like it so Internet of Things it
is connected they want you to be able to
use this sort of special version of
Windows 10 on Raspberry Pi 2 so this is
uh I think it's awesome amazing news I
think it's super cool like i'd say like
a 15-percent of the stories that we do
on this show in some way there's a
Raspberry Pi involved yeah Lamar's real
what do you believe there have been so
many crazy ambitious projects done with
raspberry Pi like there was a
supercomputer some people took 64
raspberry PI's and built a supercomputer
with that nothing I guess stamp them and
put them all together and also yeah this
was the other thing I liked is anything
that you made with the original
Raspberry Pi it's totally one hundred
sent compatible at the second board so
you can carry on your projects anything
that you're working on on the original
Raspberry Pi board you can bring that on
to raspberry pi 2 and yeah 35 bucks same
as same as same as the original
brilliant and the the version of Windows
10 is actually gonna be free so the
specialized raspberry pi 2 version
windows 10 will be free for anybody who
wants to develop so pretty awesome
what's the bad news there literally is
not a downside I didn't see one can we
just end the show right there I feel
like yeah it's the end guys that did be
back tomorrow with another with another
what is it talking talking weird
wonderful all right no but seriously
listen yeah okay pretty good I'm so
raspberry pi 2 there you go okay all
right tell me about Westeros okay so a
lot of people have seen Game of Thrones
and just love the beautiful world of
Westeros it's also very dangerous okay I
don't want to go there seems really
scary for a lady moving on ladies and
gentlemen behold Westeros in all of its
glory kind of cuz it was made in
Minecraft this is in Minecraft yes so
this is made of Minecraft it's a
recreation uh it includes place like
King's Landing the wall lots of other
cities look at
this video of King's Landing that is
insanity it is crazy i've got some stats
for you because okay to really get the
scale of this you see how beautiful and
big it is and uh but but the stats are
really works gonna drive it home secure
at the scale is 501 square miles that's
as big as Los Angeles okay um it's based
on the books it's based on the story
between books 1 &amp;amp; 2 it took hundreds of
people to like oh while to make over a
year to make this thing to actually make
it they used world painter which created
the basic terraforming of the world of
Game of Thrones okay and then they did a
couple more Tara forms and then they
went in and had to actually build in the
ville de structures as you can see if
you're watching this it's a time lapse
of people going in and piece by piece if
you slow it down you see people piece by
piece making them putting these down
block by block again I remind you that
this was mostly made off based off what
the descriptions in the books yeah not
so they use the the television series is
a little bit of a reference and if you
want to go watch the video it's actually
neram narrated by the the guy that plays
brand in the television series so it's
great it's pretty cool if you want to
see more you can go check out Westeros
crafts com they have faq so you can find
out more about it you can you can go and
look at the map that you can't download
the map yet and I can I help them build
if I'm really into Minecraft yes you can
you can donate you can help them build
uh I don't see any creepers or spiders
or anything I don't see any White
Walkers they're not real on the FAQ
there's there's a question that's like
control point can I go on their role
play I think alike well we're not your
dad's doing wait i doing that yeah hold
on you little nerd but it's it's pretty
cool we've seen a lot of impressive
scale things we've even seen people make
like cities from Westeros but not the
entire thing there's other places now
throw a lot of mine and they're saying
they're gonna get to them but right now
they're working on finishing it but over
a year to make this that is not a people
so I don't care what you think about
Minecraft or if you think people are
wasting their time seeing credible still
impressive that they put this much work
into it and it's pretty much the only
place that somebody's made
Westeros you can actually go into so
haterade or not it's still pretty
impressed I just feel like like I don't
play minecraft but i will say that i
love seeing what people make because it
reminds me of you know in the 90s when
people are making those crazy lego
sculptures but this enables people to
make Lego ask things like with blocks in
huge scales like you're saying yeah just
que los angeles sighs like I just los
angeles square feet wise believable that
is that is crazy and it's so impressive
and and so fun that people are so into
minecraft like i love their enthusiasm i
love their enthusiasm it's very cool
that they're they're fans of Game of
Thrones that much too so well that
brings us to our hashtag of the day no
it doesn't it does oh it's actually I
promise you it does our hashtag days TD
blocks and the question is what universe
of world would you want to be able to
wander around in rebuilt in Minecraft
okay you go first i think i would like
to either see the jet like the Jetsons
oh that's a really good choice like I'd
love to have the Jetsons in Minecraft
because it's so like low res and it's
all futuristic stuff I think that would
be really cool I think I'd be my first
choice and it's also very shiny world
where like not you know women are not
murdered constantly like in Game of
Thrones right girl about that all right
yeah or just people in general and
murdered constantly in Game of Thrones
so I feel like it'd be a little less
dangerous but i don't know i mean like
working at Spacely sprocket seems like
there's some OSHA hazards happening
there anyway where what about you
through deep uh futurama I would love to
see if you trauma God won't they'd have
to build the different planets you know
like the slur planet and then you know
like um area where the school yeah
omicron persei eight like just a whole
bunch of them it would be great I love
what would Sadler's homeworld I am all
of this happening there that sound good
to fly around a different planet get in
your minecraft uh you get in your yeah
grass planet express yeah your planet
express you'd fly around in your little
blocky planet express I like it I love
it there you go so tvblox tvblox tell us
what what place you'd like to see in
Minecraft and then go do it yeah then go
make it and then show it to us and
you're late
we're gonna feature you on the show
actually wouldn't mind see Rodgers I
wouldn't mind to see nuts which somebody
asked to have made notches new mansion
I'm she just bought that man he just
bought a mansion from jay-z and we're
gonna do some research we're gonna do
some research on that and see if we
can't find it this week maybe that could
be your into it I'm in two notches
notches minecraft house ok so this last
one I thought was super weird but also
kind of cool so I love this idea of art
installations involving robots and this
has been kind of a recurring theme you
know this is from design studio Crom why
Sir in Germany it is an interactive
installation called Robo chop this is a
very short video because it's a time
lapse but you can see this robot arm is
taking cubes outside of like a storage
unit and then I slicing them up and
putting it back in ok so the cool thing
about this is is all of those little
pieces of things all those cubes are
designed by people through an app so
this is awesome anybody online can use
one of the projects for robot arms
there's four different robot arms and
you can control its actions so you open
up the app and it shows you this 50
centimeter like styrofoam ish cubed foam
cube and you can work with it you can
manipulate it you can like do different
things to it in the app and then when
you're done carving out like your
sculpture or a piece of like little like
model furniture or whatever then it
uploads it to the cloud and then the
robot uses this crazy this like hot wire
cutting unit so you can see it's like
that sort of slingshot looking thing on
the bottom and it cuts up everything
into the exact shape that you want and
then after it's done it they pack it in
a box and they shipped to your house
will you get it yeah you actually get
the cube it's awesome Wow wait how big
was the q50 centimeters ok so it's
centimeters yeah that's the metrics is
cuz in Germany yeah so um we'll do the
math after will do the math after good
American stupid America um so yeah so
that's how you control it and they're
gonna let people next month from March
16 through 20th in Germany at sea bit
which is a trade show for technology in
Hanover they're going to do it's going
to be on display and people there are
going to be able to control the robot
and also people on the internet that
will be able to control to make it
DD we could try that's connected dude we
should try to you we should try to get
in and see if we can make a cube I don't
I'm sure they have like a limited amount
of foam cubes that the robot can make at
a certain amount of time but we can
always try to get in so but yeah it's
gonna be at sea bit and I just think
it's really awesome that like you're
gonna be able to control this you know
manipulate a phone cube and then some
robots gonna cut it up for you then ship
it to your house that's fantastic that's
so cool we need my edge of this robot
just making stuff well there's so much
negative space yeah we're trying to be
abstract because it was an artistic
story see like priests are gonna take
the one shot of kale yep see look at all
of that news on me I'm looking at all
the dreams that I look these are all
kales dreams right in here so anyway
enough of that distraction that's really
cool yeah it's awesome so there's but
there's an app for it so people can
download it yeah cute look up robo chop
on the Internet Robo chop design
installation or Robo chop robot arm and
you should be pretty fun pretty easily
find it cool um yeah that's it for our
headlines for today we're going to take
a quick break we'll be right back with a
with our new releases because it's
Tuesday and it's a very movie heavy week
and then we also have your user feedback
and our phone target for the day so
don't click away tomorrow daily
welcome back to the show your you we we
always want to like jump right in we
have to wait and we just get we're like
just frozen in anticipation of coming
back from break um k let's Tuesday it's
your favorite day of the week I know cuz
i get to see what all the new stuff that
i have this week yeah that is true it's
new releases so this is a pretty movie
heavy week there wasn't a lot of games
that i saw that i was just like oh my
gosh this is amazing yeah that's bummer
um but it's it's kind of that part that
time of year we're not a lot really
getting released so um but we picked
three movies that i thought were of
interest that you guys might be assured
of course raspberry pi 2 also available
this week so that's a new release but
movie wise Jupiter ascending coming out
this Friday in theater I can't wait to
see if this is good I there's a lot of
questions a lot of questions surrounding
this one kowski the cows keys have put
this together um this is a pretty pretty
epic in scale mm-hmm I guess mila kunis
plays a russian immigrant who has the
same sort of genetic makeup as like the
queen of the universe or something i had
something like that and it's a very it's
all very fascinating channing tatum is
sent to kill her and of course falls in
love with her and then they are you know
they don't even want to know any more
about it i won't tell you anymore this
is dr. Cornel just jump in figure it out
but it looks so it's like it looks very
grandiose and grandiose and and detailed
and Wachowskis of course who made the
whole matrix series and then also what
was that other movie they may raise them
didn't know yeah yeah yeah they made
Speed Racer to a lot of people love that
movie don't even love that my mom yeah
so there you go but yeah I'm in know I
it looks really good it seems like it's
a little the premise is a little
ridiculous but it also seems like it's
really good fun like a good fun popcorn
movie so I think I'm in on that yeah um
just do whatever you want I'll go see it
I know it's like just take my money also
coming out this weekend the spongebob
movie up I'll see that too
Tom Kenny I'm I totally dig this so
apparently Antonio Banderas plays like a
real life person not at not a cartoon
character on an animated character named
a burger beard I'll see it yeah so they
have to go they don't have their burgers
in bikini bottom they got to go and they
gotta get this book as far as I don't
know I'd I'm really terrible with the
whole spongebob lore but that's what it
appeared to be by the trailer now they
have to go to the land of humans and and
they it looks great I mean the animation
for them looks fantastic yeah they go to
cg as opposed to and the other ones yeah
it's pretty cool and it's one of those
live-action kind of cartoon mashups that
I think I'd actually like to see I would
enjoy as opposed to our field makes me
very sad I really hope that they are
eight because one thing that they had
with the original spongebob series was
the they had really good animation
timing yeah like everything was quick
and fast so hopefully they can pull that
off with this I mean that's ultimately
yeah ah yeah actually that's a big
question for you but I mean I don't care
are there reviews out for this uh yeah
people are saying it's good yeah I'd
like I've seen people say it's very
enjoyable and it's uh you know it still
holds the spirit of the series you know
to heart where you have the sort of
double layered jokes where kids think
it's really funny but then adults kind
of get the second meaning and it's even
funnier to them and I don't know it
looks really fun I alright I will go see
I do yep um and lastly coming out this
week I guess in a limited release but
because it's an indie film as the voices
with ryan reynolds and I find this
premise crazy but also very intriguing
to me so i guess ryan reynolds it has
some mental health issues and his dog
and his cat talked to him and he
actually voices both the dog in the cat
as well as like he plays him you know
his character oh I think I've heard
about this and the dog is like super
good and like tries to tell him to have
a good life and the cat tells him to
murder people of course he does a cat
because pastor evil um so yeah he like
ends up I think he and he's like a
serial killer like he's got like a
refrigerator filled with like women's
heads or something it's like crazy so it
but he voices both the cabinet on which
I thought was super fascinating
for saying you almost don't even
recognize his voice for either of them
what a strange weekend for movie what a
weird got the suit guy concept sci-fi
Meister basically sci-fi porn not much
it's important it's just like free games
i partially then all this like kitty
flashback yes 4g animated and this weird
indeed film with murder and cats and
dogs talking yeah very strong us know if
you're gonna see any of these in which
one you're gonna see cuz you're are you
gonna see all three god i want to see
all these I kind of do do I know so
that's those are our new releases this
week i'm i'm fascinated i'm in i feel
like i want to see all of them so there
you go uh but now as always every day is
time for your user feedback yesterday we
asked you guys use the hashtag TD teach
to tell us what fun thing you teach a
robot to do if you could teach it
anything right you said what'd you say I
said well I said something really lame
at first then I said surfing yes it had
too much fun yeah I said sunbathing I've
cap yeah so Caleb wrote and said robots
pouring wine as the dream come true
robots cooking food is the meaning of
life nice yeah i'm wearing wine though
that's not really a somali a tree that's
that's this but that's serving you
that's yeah for you yeah it's fun yeah
you didn't know success there Rick Rick
wrote a good one in and said picture
said T at robots on pogo sticks will it
be funny or scary I like that they're
good is that a futurama I think that's a
I love that's a futurama picture on the
on the right side I love on the left
it's a happy robot on a pogo stick and
on the right it's like evil murderous
robots I'm pogo sticks a fun fact about
futurama robots did you know that they
all have square pupils oh I didn't any
anybody anybody or character that's a
robot in the series has square people so
take a towel rewatch even when someone's
a human so when there was a Lucy Liu
episode where she was a robot she had
square people so interesting I didn't
know that that's a fun fact alright
that's it that's you know the show hey
guys we're gonna end the show twice
today early a Glen wrote in and said it
certainly would precede our annihilation
by the robots but it would be great to
teach them parkour I like that one as
good that would be terrified really
scary
Sofia cosmic discourse wrote in and said
I'd like a robot that fills in all
common fields of paper from legal
documents that's also not a fun thing
the robot fun for you not for the robot
but Joey wrote in and said robots don't
have emotion so it could not find it fun
well at least not yet so thanks a lot
touche Joey way to make us look like
dum-dums thanks Joey Joey just owned us
like no bar data from from Star Trek The
Next Generation yes I don't think he did
well thanks Joey fun unless there was
something wrong with his programming
thanks Joey that's the end of the show
thanks for joining us on forever uh
Stefan rodin also as a side bar and said
I suppose a recreation of Minecraft and
unreal 4 would look like this and sent
in this side it's just life is forest
with a minecraft pickaxe right in there
I those great um so that's where you
guys wrote in and of course our very
last piece of user feedback is our
photog refer of the day Depot Road in
that's a solid name that's a pretty
solid man Depot wrote in and said hi my
