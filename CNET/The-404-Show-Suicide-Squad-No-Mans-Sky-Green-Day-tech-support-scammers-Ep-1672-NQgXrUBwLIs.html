hey what's up what is going on it is
Friday August 12 2016 you are listening
to the 404 show coming to you from the
website cnet com / the dash 404
underscore websites how are you rest
fresh to I wanted to see how long you
can monologue for it just on your own I
could probably do it you think you could
do a full hour of just you talking if I
had somewhat of a great run down yeah
but even that I feel like you'd run
through each of the points so quickly
like an hour of straight-talking just
you think about it no one does that like
no one even if you're even though your
own radio show you got commercials like
that you got the whole thing and and if
it's like an emergency like a Tom Brokaw
an emergency happens you're cutting two
interviews your you've got like whatever
producers in your ear but just you
monologuing I mean unless you're calling
Quinn doing a Broadway show yeah that's
the right analogy I think no I don't
know I think you do I think like there
is a certain kind of gate you need to
have because right a more casual a
swinging gate right and and and you know
how you have to know how to use like
pauses effectively yeah and take beats
where it's can I try to do a brief pause
effective faucet yeah let me hear it so
today we're talking about suicide squad
and that's
I liked it that's a lot that was like
shockingly long okay I thought it I'd
like thought it I'll bet listeners find
that disarming and more engaging like
orally yeah maybe I feel like people
there will be at least one or two people
who think the podcast broke okay and and
but then they look down at their their
phones like all this 40 minutes left
right exactly and how long is he gonna
go for ya Yugi done it if you hadn't
talked I might have gone for another 30
seconds oh good who know it's god help
us we do have a lot to talk about today
we do um a lot happening in the world of
gaming and tech we'll get to some movie
stuff first thing I want to talk about
real quick is a biz news 'ok um so when
little Jeff was like 10 11 12 yeah he
was introduced to a band called green
day dookie uh yeah it was about that
time maybe a little before um when i was
10 i believe their their second record
kerplunk came out okay um and I got into
them through a for a family friend had a
mix CD or something like that and green
day was on it and it was welcome to
paradise it was like the older recording
of it sure and green to kind of like guy
got into that's how i got into green day
yeah and i was really a green day fanboy
for probably a decade sure uh from like
maybe the early 90s all the way probably
more two decades I mean it's american
idiot like american idiot was such a
strong record yeah um all things
considered anyway in the last five years
Green Day sort of taken a back seat they
haven't have they been putting out
albums yes so they put out a trio of
Records I want to say two years ago
maybe in 14 okay that was called like
uno dos and Trey okay like their drummer
tr√© that's funny is hilarious and I
don't know I I feel like they had sort
of been castrated a little bit right
like their music didn't really have the
energy and sort of speed and in turn
in two old dudes and moment I mean like
they're all in their early to mid 40s
yeah they have children or they have
wives if families to have that edge I
mean they'd last for very long time it's
hard to have that edge when again you
lose that like creative motivator for a
lot of people like it's like whoa I
whatever I take first class everywhere
it's fine right like what do I be Punk
about it anymore and you know that was
like their biggest criticism i guess uh
especially when they broke out on the
scene and like I want to say that was
like 90 for sure uh was like oh these
guys are posers there this is like a
pop-punk band which they are there pal
punk band sure um but like there was
also this attitude they used to have
that they kind of lost not to their own
fault yup they grew up a little bit and
that's what happens anyway the reason I
bring them up is because they released a
new song yesterday akka single akka
single what is that so when caen sets
were Baker which many years ago yeah and
singles would come out cassettes would
be sold with just the single no I
remember that and they called him it was
like a foot of tape anyway they come out
with this new song called bang bang and
when I played it for the first time it
was the first time I got that feeling of
what I used to get when I would pop in a
new green days when you feel wishes and
listening to green and we're not talking
about that we're talking about like when
that record insomniac came out to follow
up to Dookie sure which is a very good
record I realized it uh you just get the
feeling was like they're back exciting
back you're pumped about it this song's
fast okay it's loud yeah and I want to
play some of it forget free people I'm
gonna play some green day on the show
this is like something I feel like I
should have done many moons ago
seriously but here's their new song
that's called bang bang
I get my kicks rager
I got
yeah so weird it's kind of quick so yeah
it is yeah I like it a lot um it is
weird because it does sound like tonally
very much like how they sounded
originally course which is again weird
when you consider that they're 45 yeah i
mean this song would not have been on
american idiot now this song wouldn't
have been on anything that they've done
in in the last 10 years yes I mean like
the breakdowns good yeah
anyway yeah I don't think we could play
the whole thing or like YouTube like
trying to you know it's ceiling fan
we're in trouble but uh yeah man I don't
know meant to it yeah it's a it's a good
track um I mean it sounds like very much
like a green day oh for sure it does not
feel like they're dipping into new
waters and I don't think they ever will
there was a time when they did that yeah
but this is just for me this is like mid
90s green day you know what kind of cool
it's like when everyone freaked out
about the mini nes that Nintendo selling
doesn't it feel like that this is just
like this rust you don't think you
understand what I'm saying though no I'm
saying that this I think and it's a
little crass to think of it as like a
marketing tactic but like they know or
why stranger things is blowing up they
know nostalgia works okay Green de has
no one to impress like they don't need I
do I'm just I think they care that
people of that their music is popular I
think they do I don't think you're wrong
with that I think it's a mixture of a
lot of things right like when you are in
a band like this and especially you look
like bands like blink-182 kind of like
real their wave not to say that grande
like started pop punk music but they
definitely put a projected it into them
sure the limelight sure I'll help do
that so I don't know it's just I think
it's like a fun thing where it's like oh
yeah okay do something you guys did 20
years ago totally and that's what I'm
saying it's like a nostalgia move for
sure yeah definitely you're you're
absolutely right damn how about that
it's good man yeah I records called
revolution radio comes out in October
all threads so they're all still in it
they're all still in it and they do have
another they have like a fourth guy
who's been with them for like 15 years
is he play like the symbols now he plays
triangle okay no he uh he's like their
second guitar player um I actually think
he like just beat cancer a little
different too so that's all done great
story uh but yeah they uh they've been
touring with that guy and then I didn't
know this either but Billy Joe from
Green Day has been in a few movies has
he yeah and he just well he was in
american idiot on broadway for a while
oh I like performing yeah I saw him I
saw it he played the character or
characters yeah but
not like the main guy no he wasn't like
the the do you okay I see the play but
it's wasn't the best but like sure it
was weird like Tommy essentially maybe
that's I'm in the army that's what
they're trying to share I think so he
was in this movie called geezer where he
basically plays himself sure not but
like I wouldn't call Billie Joe
Armstrong washed up because he's I think
he's very much part of the the musical
zeitgeist yeah sure uh he plays someone
who's washed up and hasn't been in a his
punk band was great sort of late he's
been 10 years on hiatus so like a bird
man type thing exactly and writing
phenology fred armisen xin it i think
someone blares in it like this and he's
like the main character apparently they
sold it at Sundance so that's different
work can wear them on top it's crazy
anyway little green day update or 12
year old Jeff yay 12 year old Jeff
thanks you for four listen day on Friday
um so all right so we got some stuff
where do you want to go first here
because we've got we want to talk about
movies I want to talk about no man's sky
i bet on sky for a little bit i realize
not everyone um plays video games listen
to the podcast or most people maybe but
at the same time like you probably have
heard about it yeah it's it's been in
the sort of mind frame of a lot of
people for really two years because it's
had so much hype to it right if you've
heard absolutely nothing the logline
pitch of it is you're in a spaceship um
there are a quadrillion randomly
generated planets and animals and I
think it's a teen whatever quintillion
an astounding number generated by
algorithms made by these 10 15 people in
England and the idea is you fly around
the galaxy and you explore all these
random things and you take pictures of
things and and it's sort of for a long
time was this like mythical beast of a
video game which is the Jesus game it
was the Jesus game which is like this is
gonna be my hole I'm just gonna spend my
entire life going from planet to planet
and like what's here right yeah I won't
need to buy another game I won't ever
buy another because this will be it and
okay so so that's sort of the baseline
it came out this week um I started
playing it last week we got a bit of an
early copy
somehow and then but it came out this
week have you played it yeah I'm imply
play like 15 an hour okay so I I think
the general response is that most people
are oh well I wouldn't say most people
but a lot of people are unhappy because
it did not live up to the outrageously
stupid expectations that they might have
had for this all that yeah that goes
without saying later I it's amazing to
me that like at still still people yeah
put this emotional investment into
something they know nothing about really
well they and they put a monetary
investment so it's like of course and I
get it yeah right I get that um but like
people project like this game has been a
prime example of like how how vulnerable
people are to their own projections
about what games what they want games to
be exact and like what the what's in
your head and what's reality yeah and
this game is just it's just not what
everyone wants it to be what's and
what's so weird about it is the more so
I went in when I initially heard it I
was like wow that's cool but they
probably can't pull it off and then I
started seeing it at e3 s a few times so
I saw them like showing and early dinner
and I was like this doesn't look super
good like it ran really janky and it
looked kind of crummy and whatever yeah
so I so before the game came out I was
like my expectations were pretty low
actually you know I've played a lot of
those games like spore that we're
supposed to be life changing and ended
up coming out and sucking right and with
that mindset I actually ended up liking
it more a lot more than I thought I
would because they actually were able to
pull off i would say ninety-five percent
of the promises that they made about
this game were accomplished yeah it's a
question of how you mean but it's the
execution of that that people are not
super stoked on yeah but at least had
misconceptions about misconceptions
maybe and and and I'm not saying that
they pull up everything like there are
certain things they were I don't know
intentionally deceptive but certainly
weirdly cagey about multiplayer for a
very long time and still comin still
kind of our and there really isn't any
multiplayer really um but for the most
part they pulled everything off now what
people I don't know for sure what people
would have wanted necessarily I think
there are limitations in the store
a game they built so they built a game
that's generated by math right no one's
designing these levels they plug in an
algorithm they add a number variable
whatever however however works and the
math spits out a planet and animals and
weird stuff like that so like for me and
and we were talking about this yesterday
with alex from giant bomb like the
reason he loves this game so much is
because he just like seeing what happens
when the dice gets rolled yes and like
getting into a new planet is always you
know you kinda have an idea of like what
it's probably gonna look like at least
you have personally sort of understood
the gamut of assets that are yeah that
that this games drawing from and the
whole idea of like getting in there and
saying hey this is you know what exactly
are what's possible in this sort of game
you know once you wrap your head around
it it's tough to get super surprised
sure yeah i would say there's like what
let's say that there's like eight to ten
kinds of planets so whether that's a
jungle planet or grass planting rice or
whatever and then it's like is it acid
rain is it a fire why is it which comes
as well which doesn't super enemy I'll
change the visuals of it yeah and the
atmosphere changes color and stuff like
that so the so yeah I mean I've probably
put in 10 or 20 hours and at this point
like I'm not really running into planets
that look that dramatically different
right and I think that's the issue that
a lot of people have is that you lose
that sent the first five hours a game
are outrageous and like super amazing
yeah and that sort of wayne's very
quickly yeah and it's also an issue
because there's not like a lot to like
strive for I mean essentially all you're
doing is finding things that like make
your jetpack a little faster or make
your sprint a little longer or whatever
your ship a little bit faster so there
isn't necessarily that tug but i also
think what people underestimate is like
this was made by 15 yeah keep like let's
appreciate how amazing of an achievement
is crazy and the scale like the sense of
scale that they were able to pull off
like planets are the sizes of plan and
you feel small on a lot it like you're
like whoa there there's a giant like
rock formation frontman you feel tiny i
think people are a little pissed off at
the price tag
which is probably a legitimate maybe cuz
it's six hours which is like a full
price of games I I wouldn't say I think
it's certainly more worth more than 20
um but when you compare it to you know a
lot of well I don't know it's hard to
say because there's a lot of crappy
Triple A game yeah that aren't worth
sixty dollars orders um but the value
proposition aside I think the ring that
I have to tell people about this game is
that you're gonna spend a lot of time in
the menus yeah crafting shit yeah
getting stuff too like lineup be chasing
down ingredients yeah and resources and
like you know what for me chasing all
that stuff down and the monotony of and
repetition of that yeah is simply not
fun like I don't want to manage
inventory beyond a very sort of like
surface-level sort of thing yeah I I get
it like games have to have that in games
but like this game kind of like leans
into that show much for me now the
question I have for you is what would
like if they were let's say they removed
the inventory but let's say there's no
inventory issue right so ever there's
not a lot of game that is not a lot of
game that's exactly right and I so what
the why they from a design perspective
why the inventory is there and I realize
we're getting a little game nerdy for a
second it's too slow you down yeah to
make sure that you're not seeing 60
planets in an hour and then being like
oh those planets are kind of similar
right it maybe yeah so each planet feels
a little bit more unique for a little
bit longer so you have that five to ten
hours originality rather than one to two
hours and now it's so there's a reason
for it i'm not saying like I think the
UI has serious issues I think there's a
lot of issues for it there's a reason
they did them and they for what it's
worth they are planning a lot of free
significant updates and if you write and
that would be cool to scrap load of
money for sure and I'll be cool to see
like where they can and I want to do
based Hill thing and a bunch of the rock
and roll I say if you have the means try
it out if you don't want to spend six
dollars wait till they discount this
thing in a couple months in my 40 throw
in if i sell the cell the engine to Star
Wars and I'm like buying this game again
yeah hardwell I know that
how awesome would that be it would be
all right right I guess so this game too
I don't know green day green gauges have
a space opera with green day yeah um
yeah so that's no man's sky if you want
to read more about that we've gotta
impressions post on the site and some
gameplay stuff that i did got if you are
playing the game and you want some tips
like how to boost jump or how to
increase your inventory space really
fast yeah polygon youtube.com slash
polygon hi there you go to a bunch of
videos that are like guide videos there
you go the first and you can hear my
first real-time competition mid-air

man up Suicide Squad yeah Suicide Squad
got obliterated in reviews just tomorrow
Suicide Squad was taken out back and
beaten with a hose really crushed into
oblivion yet you people well you hbu
people know when I saw ya and and mass
like it made a ton of money on the first
it made well over 200 million dollars
yes right yes which is astounding amount
of money but this oh so okay what go on
I just want to say like the same thing
happen to Batman or Superman and you put
the drop off the drop-off was he was
like 17 I think you're gonna see the
exact same thing because even people
that are fans of comic books in DC it
seems like everyone is pissed off it got
a B+ on CinemaScore which is like an FML
is in humanity if see if Suicide Squad
did not get if it got more mediocre
reviews yeah as opposed to the abysmal
interviews it earned what do you think
it would change anything I think the
fall off would be less and I think there
would be maybe some more of a chance of
like blu-ray sales if that's even still
a thing um and but like at this point
like they'll cheer the fat they got a
huge opening weekend but like man fire
everybody at DC making these movies fire
Moulton at war nor in water at Warner um
that's what I mean uh whoever this guy
directors had a pretty good pedigree it
airs is very hit-or-miss he's had some
like he did fury right if you're it was
just a good Hippolyte he's also had some
like pretty thinkers bad movies and so
so there's a lot of weird things about
suicide squad I think the big weird
thing is that the first trailer came out
and the company that made that trailer
which is a company called trailer park
is like very known as made one of the
best trailer makers in the business you
know and it basically promised a movie
that was not in existence it promised a
fun silly over the top heroes villains
getting together fighting over Queen
music and when that trailer was cut it
didn't exist the movie didn't know that
that movie did not against the movie
that existed was dark it was from the
director of fury it was a bummer and I'm
not saying you can't make a dark
superhero movie look at dark knight by
clearly you can that's kind of like
lightning in a bottle right so the
trailer but the trailer promised
Deadpool essentially it was promising an
experience like Deadpool Deadpool Ian
and they even did reshoots because they
knew that that first shower was so
popular and the movie was nothing like
the more traditional approved the
trailer I mean no well so at that point
you're like oh we have this super
successful trailer that's going to
encourage a much people see our movie
we're gonna toss that out because or
maybe maybe they you know temper
expectations with it a little bit or
like get the messaging of what the thing
they created but I think they knew that
the thing they creative is not very good
and and they have as you said lightning
bottle with that trailer the enthusiasm
was over the roof why would you as a
money-making endeavor be like yeah I
know you guys are pumped for this but
it's actually this super dour blame not
funny experience that you're gonna say
they just thought that's not how people
work um they just need to at this point
they've had been a man of steel they've
had a Batman vs Superman they've had
this movie three movies that were
critically panned progressively more pan
with each movie coming out like you just
need to overhaul the entire organization
and I've heard of like a lot of things
structurally of like how Warner Brothers
works is like very it's just like
structurally not in a healthy place um
and this sort of exemplifies that I've
heard a lot of comparisons to like
Microsoft at certain points in brass
knobs career where it's like everyone
needs their hands on it everyone needs a
little bit of credit everyone needs to
like feel like they impacted it and the
end result is this hodgepodge of like
marketing schlock and like not fun drag
whereas like say what you will about
even the bad Marvel movies there at
least kind of entertaining like there's
not been a Marvel movie in the last 10
years that was like I'm completely bored
row I think you're wrong what was what
fan tastic for sorry sorry I should be
clear I mean the Disney Marvel knows
okay not the sony one not the Sony
because that would sony i think sony has
fantastic and spider-man in spider-man
yeah so I'm just talking about the
Disney are volson if it's fine so and I
kind of want to backpedal just a little
bit when I was like you people yeah I
mean you're so here's my thing right
like someone comes up to me and goes off
you can see Suicide Squad right and I'm
like no this really happened yeah okay
like it happened a bunch okay no I'm not
gonna see that why not that's totally up
your alley no no it's not like why you
don't even like I'm actually a little
surprised I could not give less of a
shit about finally because of the
pedigree of like what they've been doing
recently no no not at all like you
because I am very open about the fact
that I judge a lot of stuff by its cook
by its cover right
I've judge books by their sure right
fine I think you have to in this age of
over by the time rightly fun um my life
is x money times precious ya gotta pick
and choose what you can do you know what
I ain't gonna watch breaking bad I'm
probably never gonna see it I'm gonna
see it I'm not saying it's bad it's
saying at this point in my life yeah I
just don't think I can add that on I'm
doing too many other thing I understand
sure ok that's retire well sure act
audition when when Netflix 4000 is out
right so um I saw those trailers yeah
and like everyone's like super psyched
on this trailer I like the first hour
but I was a queen I Sauvage there's some
shit at it okay number one no dialogue
fine but then they're like new trailers
that came up maybe this is after the
Bohemian Rhapsody okay yeah harlequin
has a line we're bad guys it's what we
do red flag yeah that's that's right a
vigorous flag number two yeah jared leto
yeah Joker just visually has a joker
tattoo yeah what Joker as a joker tattoo
it's a Jagger or is a picture of the
Joker there is a lot of promotional
material out there again I have not seen
this movie I think that's abundantly
clear but when I saw the a few of the
production stills or some promotional
material share of the Joker oh it died
yeah a dude's got hahahaha tattooed all
over head and damaged in very fancy
script on his forehead right yeah like
the Joker would do yeah and he also has
in gothic writing on his abdomen yeah it
says Joker red flag too yeah that's a
problem Jeff no see yeah it's hard to
imagine the Joker sitting still and I
attach your chair right what like oh I
like the shading get out of here man
Joker should have nothing of coloring
this later and again like people are
gonna say Jeff you're projecting heath
ledger's joker you should you're
projecting a certain kind of Joker I've
read a lot of Batman graphic novels I've
done my research on what the Joker is
and
don't get me wrong I welcome other
variants and other interpretations of
what the the soul of of he of him yeah
or if you want to make a female do
whatever you want to do is ever cool I
don't know they should guess Harley
Quinn sure whatever you want to do is
cool but the essence of that character
and what they were clearly going for in
this this is not a joker yeah that would
tattoo haha it's hot topic Joker it's
hot topic Joker yeah a hundred percent
so get the hell out of here not seeing
your stupid movie um yeah those are all
completely valid things I saw a what I
was missing and what made me very
suspicious is that like none of the
trailers had like they would have liked
one-liners that you mentioned one of the
bad ones but they never had a scene and
I about a few a couple weeks before they
had one scene in like a business room
where they showed enchantress for the
first time right and it was just the
most stiff wooden like soulless crap and
I was like it felt like the first time I
saw a scene from Jurassic world I was
like nope not for me this is gonna be
bad and yeah bad I wish it worked out
because I of course who doesn't want
every movie to be good well but the
spirit and the spirit of it I like the
spirit of Suicide Squad I like the idea
of it I think it could be fun I think
with good writers it has potential I
don't know that DC's supervillain
catalog is that robust the necessary
support when you have a dude whose
probability is tying knots you might be
hitting a wall I think they could do
something with the Batman villains yeah
I think maybe you could do something
with a Batman villains but like I guess
these are supposed of them or some of
them sup 20 Yankees yeah yeah I don't
know it's undead shot awful and I guess
isn't that his name dead shot or dead
shot shatter shot bitch I think it was
Will Smith's character dead dead shot
dead shot is whatever she some fused
people dead he's a Batman villain yeah i
mean this crossover up were there were
they all Batman no no no no I I don't
think ya know it was like DC yeah it
kind
yeah you know the critic you remember
the critic the good show the cartoon of
Jon Lovitz John Levinson of course
there's a stinks yes and and there's a
moment does episode of The Critic where
Jon Lovitz has to teach English for cab
drivers because his show gets canceled
and he ends up broadcasting live on a
local cable access and he does this
whole monologue about if the movies
think if the movie stinks just don't go
people you know the movies thinks I know
oh just we have it fall off a cliff you
know what it's just just have it die
have it don't go next week if you've
heard bad things don't assume that
you're gonna like a thing like I truly
believe the the stoop d the stupidity of
crowds is such that people can't a they
sure she can't handle the fact that
something that they want to be good yes
actually ones it being shit sure they
come up with these asinine conspiracy
theories that the whole film press is
out to get DC stuff get your head out of
your goddamn ass right yeah um and then
and then you have like you know the the
idiocy of crabs words like well maybe
it's not that bad I need to see it for
myself which is fine like Duke you are
hey I know totally do friend friend you
are allowed to spend your money on
whatever you want you earned it you go
do it but don't be surprised when this
happens right it's like you go to the
restaurant the guy in front he orders
the soup he kills over and dies thought
maybe soups not that bad imma try it I
know strong stuffing no that's not the
case you are going to die as well and
that bullshit argument of like mobile
movie critics don't like popcorn films
that is going wrong you they love them
Deadpool is a popcorn film that was
critically reviewed and well-liked
movies got like ninety percent on rotten
tomatoes and so those exist there were
just way more bad popcorn films and
there are good ones um so you just be my
there's so much good stuff you could be
doing with your life don't waste it
watching this crap or if you're gonna
watch this crap watching on USA at 3pm
hey like guys look I'm not I'm not about
to stand on a soapbox and try and
dictate taste Yeah right that's not what
I'm trying you're sitting outside
sitting on it yeah i'm just trying to
i'm just giving out free advice you know
we kind of do it for a living so cream
should rise to the top don't give bad
things your money ah you know that's why
I added that's the attitude so I
meritocracy I had an interesting thing
happened the other day was in the car
driving a hockey was talking to my
buddies yeah the other they're a little
younger about probably eight years
younger than me ourselves if again and
we were talking about movies and I
forget that we got into it but we're
talking about sci-fi and I think we're
talking about maybe stranger things to
start and then we got to the point where
we were talking about science fiction
and I had asked them if they had seen
the fifth element okay and I got like a
whole face like didn't even know it
existed I'm not hundred a hundred
percent sure they didn't know it existed
but and I hope they're listening but uh
there was just now no we didn't see that
work that yeah what is that and I and I
think I definitely have to like go
through the cast with them right
although I was Bruce Willis and Chris
Tucker like who's Brij Mohan Singh
Kristen no they don't they know those
guys but like milla jovovich wasn't like
necessarily something of course Gary
Oldman ever knows Gilman and it got me
thinking like oh god it's not it's not
them it's me it's you you year old is
that what it is yeah it's a little guy
because I don't think I'm an old guy not
old year old no don't say that because
I'm old year old ok I got a couple years
I didn't realize 34 was like the cut off
uh it definitely made me feel old and
sort of like question like oh shit is
like that movie not as popular with a
generation behind me I'm gonna ask you a
question sure have you seen the movie
All the President's Men No
from sight All the President's Men was
like a movie that everyone watched in
the 70 or whenever came out was like all
right Evan either ad with keep going
down the list like I don't like that's
one last because I speak that might the
point I'm I'm uh eventually hoping to
arrive at you that I think it's
generational thing because like I also
think like if someone asked you are I
like have you guys you guys haven't seen
the Godfather like no of course we've
seen the gun but I would also say like I
was telling you before we started I
haven't seen Casablanca and there are
like that movies literally from the 40s
and but but i would say like with the
godfather the more time that goes on the
more likely that god father becomes
casablanca which is to say it becomes a
movie that like oh yeah i heard you're
supposed to watch it but i haven't
watched yet you know I mean yeah so
there's what likes it just is not enough
times past like fifth element isn't only
17 years old like it's not that old so
how I'm sorry no it's it's a 19 / they
won so they were six I guess it's fine
that's okay blatantly a blade runner
came out the year we were boy I was born
and I still made a busy but I would for
any one blade runner yeah I didn't see
Blaine right in his hole I would say
five years ago it's the first time I saw
it that's late that's really it for you
yeah so for RJ and and it's that that's
the situation which is like especially
now with like so much TV being good and
so much stuff and that's my point is
that there's content overload now when
you and I were 18 there wasn't yet so we
were able to nail it all down that's
completely right I think I think that
well not only nail it all down it's like
movies room I think a much bigger deal
than of course going to the going to
blockbuster go into the local store yeah
was a thing was an event and I'm not
saying like I'm I yearn for that I don't
I think it's way better now right but it
was also liked so much more of an
investment emotional choice you're
making a mental choices not just like oh
what's on netflix today Oh remember this
documentary it's way better now yeah
it's way better now but it's not as I
guess impact like I've have such clear
memories of going to see seven in the
theater yeah and 12 monkeys and like
that era of movies yeah whistle was the
last movie was so like they knew 12
monkeys
to a monkey's came out like right around
the same time that's so like that's just
a question of like a way where their
focus was I guess or like but it is a
little weird they've never heard fifth
element well maybe they heard of it but
like 5th at like nine oh yeah and if you
listen to the show let you know how
strongly we feel about this element what
was your first movie memory uh
ghostbusters 2 and back to the future
too okay I remember seeing back to the
future two in the theater and could not
understand how they had the trailer for
three yeah I was like and what the what
is this I feel like I asked my mom was
like what how they doing that you know
now she didn't know she like a second
this is from the future you I was like
you mean the past whoa um ghostbusters 2
for sure cuz I was 89 yeah uh and i
think in the first real this is an event
going to the oh and obviously the Ninja
Turtles movie yeah but the first thing
where I was like by myself seeing a
movie that made me feel scared and and
some things apart was dress / yeah you
were you went alone does he dress so
with a friend yeah yeah I guess so I was
probably like what was that 94 so I was
like 10 yeah when that came out so I I
had that I was my birthday uh-uh we had
a bunch of friends and one of my friends
cran crying down the aisle huh he's 93
yeah you know it's a scary movie ik i
was I 11 was I 11 once I'm up I was like
I I do want to say I think in the
engines 3 was the first movie I remember
seeing the theaters Louis crusade yeah
which is just like fantastic is your
movie that you've had that experiences
we're like you cannot believe someone
hasn't seen you know I don't do that
anymore there was a time I think you I
you can't tell me you've never seen back
to the future and I me not like have my
head spin there was a clear how old you
are no there was a time when I was like
that word feel like you haven't bought
you haven't Baba and it just like I get
it now there is just so much out there
yeah it's it and this Raymond amount of
time right
have no business saying that and it's
and honestly it gets me more excited
than shocked because it means like like
Alex she is a few years younger than me
and we've been able to watch all these
classic movies that I love from the 90s
that she's never seen before shawshank
usual suspects Jurassic Park she'd never
seen Jurassic Park until we watched it
like a month ago that's crazy right
that's weird weird that's dad is weird
so but that's the thing like she sounds
like she's close to the age of my
buddies yeah and like yeah I'm sure
they've seen Jurassic Park ninja and she
had an older sister which I think has a
little bit more of an impact because
you're like you do what they do and
they're her parents Tucker two movies a
lot but even then like they still missed
a lot of stuff not seeing Jurassic Park
is bizarre yeah having gone this long
even auntie it's on to it was on to you
like you just run into seeing that movie
blue we watch clue together it was great
by the way the reason clue I'm sorry
working on a history of clue video but
little preview of it of the board game
or the film both really I'm so good so
the reason good the reason clued the
film became a cult classic you know this
a tanked in the theaters it in depth the
alternate ending no so it tagged in the
theaters made very little money it would
be politically pant like that doesn't
make sense because it is i think it is a
pretty damned funny movie it is a
hilarious movie but i don't know i guess
then at that time forrest was not really
a top priority yeah um the reason it's a
cult classic is because when the came
out on VHS to get more blockbusters to
carry it they lower the price normally a
rental tape cost a hundred dollars for
for a rental place to get and it's a
high quality tape it require you know
you can watch it a bunch of times
without it breaking so they charged a
hundred dollars per tape but clue is
much cheaper because it was pan so a lot
of rental places got a bunch of copies
of clue because it was much cheaper and
therefore it was easy to rent so a lot
of people saw it and also it was cheaper
to like syndicating some interesting
yeah it's very good you haven't seen
clue go watch clue perfect perfect um
Tim Curry so damn close granite up so
yeah so yeah that's that's all we got to
say about that right now or movie
you ever see Forrest Gump no I've never
seen Forrest come have you not seen
forrest gump right that would be that I
would not want to motivate myself to
watch again no but it would be weird it
would be able to work Stacy had never
seen 12 monkeys we watch that together
couple months ago she loved it she had
also never seen usual suspects but she
did not like it as much and she figured
it out yeah which like by today's
standards you can figure that maybe out
real quick which is an interesting sort
of like social experiment one of the
first of those cotton when it came out
yeah nah twisty all right let's get into
the tech portion of the program there's
a lot happening if you care about
technology which cnet com / technology
is a destination for all your technology
needs we are a website about technology
and technology news and Pokemon go yep
so there's new MacBook Pros coming
everyone's kind of not given much craps
about the iphone 7 iphone 7 is going to
be announced on September seventh yeah
we'll be covering that so make sure you
keep it here for that but new macbook
pros are like four years overdue are
they the last update was 2012 no yeah
macbook pro no no no I'm look at that
refreshes that what do you set what I'm
saying is an update not like a mint a
major major overhaul I understand okay
right like a spec update one thing they
have not and they've added stuff like
forced touch and whatever all right yeah
but but like massive form factor chore
so the rumor about the new macbook pros
is that they're going to have which is
crazy they're going to have a
potentially as a rumor yeah i'm going to
have like a touch strip screen yeah that
would sit in between the top row of
numbers on the keyboard yeah and the
screen it simply replacing the function
keys right yeah kind of crazy I yeah it
seems unnecessary it does seem
unnecessary I don't know I mean it's
kind of cool that you could like it
could visually change based on what you
were doing but like Dean no you don't
you don't need that I'm like to me I'm
like no no route that battery right up
drain that's going to be need to do that
and
the thing last long yeah not to mention
the fact that like you know if you have
to look down to your keys like yeah you
feel like a dick ya doing that I don't
know is that the only aspect that
they're really revamping I'll be further
obviously they're gonna try and make it
thinner they're gonna try and cram
better graphic so what so what how does
that sound like a major update to you
form factors gonna change gonna be
thinner that's a thing do you that is a
different shell for this computer yeah
but like that much thinner USB 3.0 ports
okay don't just okay me yeah okay your
do you sound excited about it I don't
know I like Mac computers again but but
like I've been a little bit disappointed
in their in their last refreshes
especially the macbook which is the one
that like got rid of all the ports yeah
only have one port dude that coffee I
just don't get that compute I mean I get
it but like it seems so underpowered I
think it's gotta go I think it's got
like a 1.5 gigahertz processor and it
just like dude that's a facebook machine
yeah it's there just get a macbook air
macbook air is a great machine it is but
like MacBook Airs also severely outdated
in terms of the the build of the
computer like there's that huge ugly
bezel around the screen like a lot of
great screens now are our edge to edge
they look a lot slicker they gotta
update that but they can they can keep
the price down which is good i guess i
love the macbook air I know you do
that's why you have your macbook pro but
it the dongle thing it's just like I
know who I know we're in a weird spot
with laptops right now because you know
not only laptops but cell phones as well
we're about to run into it with 90 17
would Oh what about oh because it's not
going to have a headphone jack yeah but
what the hell I'm very upset about that
like I get it they're going to be able
to have a lightning port that goes to
headphone right is anything yes that
will be a thing but we usually get a
adapter for that bright you better come
with the damn phone you you are not you
are not about to sell me a phone but
even if it does I'm still
stop at that yeah because I don't wanna
dongle hanging out my probably not going
to be that bad like what's the
difference if it just extends the length
of your headphone jack like two inches
do you mean like it's just gonna scoop
out the bottom of it I guess it I don't
think it'll be that bad but don't you
for a second make me pay for that i'll
be like 15 i've had i've been using
headphones for 84 years and you're just
gonna take that poured out and not even
give me the adapter in the box it really
it really better be that much space that
the headphone aspect really take us of
that much bass I don't know I guess it
does it's okay I don't know they're
putting a speaker in its place just put
meant you preach to the choir man you
really thats of all the decisions that
are coming like I get excited about new
iPhones I really course it's a thing
it's an event but how do you not have a
headphone jack it's I use headphones
with my iPhone every single day every
day and needing to have an adapter bums
me out bums me out and bluetooth
headphones suck they're just not there
yet no I they would need to last a week
without charging just not there and
they're not there and they don't sound
that great no I've heard one or two that
are acceptable but I have those audio
files doors so I guess the question is
is any is there any chance that any of
this is wrong no I would I really
shocked right kind of bet anything at me
too alright well we'll keep it there for
for Apple like it's just get me mad I
know Stacy's in the market for a new
phone and I'm just mean yeah I yeah
it'll be interesting because they didn't
yeah yeah there's nothing really I can
say well yeah look like there's going to
be a demand for a lot of like older
maybe I phones for people I feel like
that six now is or 6s yeah success is
like the one to get yeah for right for
the foreseeable managers like the
macbook air whereas the new iphone 7
will be like the macbook which is like
oh you like ports yeah headphone jacks
no here you go so no man's sky came out
on monday for press I got my code early
Monday morning I'm playing it all day I
get a phone call about two o'clock in
the afternoon
and as a man with an Indian accent ok
and he says um not gonna do that accent
that's that's wise does tasteless but
yes he goes hey this is uh tech support

yeah he's like sir are you in front of
your windows machine I said I am he said
good there's something wrong with your
computer ok and I need you to follow
these directions so we can fix it oh so
like obviously I know he's foolish ok
yeah and then I'm like look I'm like
okay hold on hold on yeah and I'm
looking on my phone for the recording
button oh sure I'm like oh shit i know i
can view this somewhere where is it
where is it I never oh I know I know I
not suck I know I know but don't worry
the call didn't last long ok uh I go so
he goes open up your web browser ok and
go to this website yeah and I was like
sure hold on wait people hold on yeah
where are you calling from again yeah
said Washington ok I was like state or
DC washington ok great sure pop up up up

obviously because who knows yeah yeah
we're kind of you know uh so II egos are
you there I go yes sir I'm there yeah it
goes good I need you to fill out the
form ok and we can get this fixed for
you for a one-time fee of 49 99 and
that's kind of like when I ok was just
like I was like dude how many people do
you I said f how many people do you I'm
gonna how many people you fuck over
every day yeah and here's like wat sir
this is important your computer is
vulnerable and I was like is this your
job man yeah like what is this your job
and then the jig is up right sure calls
me a mother effort oh he goes you mother
you're sitting there I'm like you're
sitting there what I don't know it was
like I mean we're setting that was like
yep is a you mother I was like get a job
and hung up yeah
then I'm on the internet and bowling
bowling on Wednesday has a story about
tech support scammers wow so this kid
from the UK ya got the call I think it
sounds like okay and was like super
polite about it sure was like hey i know
this is fake yeah but can you stay on
the line with me because i want to talk
to you okay and he got like an interview
sure is the thing okay they call my cell
which I'm super pissed about her super
pissed about yeah don't like the fact
that that number is out there I get robo
calls all the time I don't get him that
often but I but you can you can block
those numbers and that's not the worst
idea anyway he goes any names luis the
interviewer and he's from birmingham UK
and I'm Birmingham was a Birmingham yeah
birmingham birmingham yeah Berman
continue uh and he's been making videos
about tech support scammers yeah and he
interviewed someone from Delhi India who
told him about the whole operation now
is up in a room with 50 to 60 other
scant scammers yeah he's forced to do
this because he signed a five-year
contract it's like some weird thing that
has on over there sure but apparently
they make decent money I'm sure they do
I wasn't doubt me I own doubt that at
all and he says on any given day he can
he can scam about 10 people yeah which
that's 500 but what's amazing about this
is um I guess I was surprised because
what i was expecting was it was a
fishing call and he would direct you
somewhere to like tie pin up I hope I
got another one you know no but like the
fact that he already jumped in today we
need fifty dollars seems like a like a
bad move it's weird that he called me
mother fucker so quick yeah well he
called it very quick he must yeah I mean
he must've you think he calls everyone
that that that plays around with him a
little bit I yeah I guess maybe I mean
like he was from being so polite and
like looking to help to be like you my
mother I mean this is the thing
like India has some pretty severe
poverty issues I know and if that you
know i'm not saying this is a noble
profession in the least i'm not saying
it's obviously not it's obviously not
but like if you can't get bread on the
table just cause you mother I was like
whoa we've if your option is like
shoveling shit or sitting inside in
front of a computer and talking to
people on the phone like we can't we
can't imagine ourselves right I'd like
that I'm saying you're trying not I know
what you're saying you're saying but
this is what it is there it's what
you're saying yes and I get it forget it
yeah I'm not mad at that guy no I'm
matted obviously think that you made it
the world the work the work your world
that allows the staff you're mad that
this is even a thing yeah oh yeah it
that's a weird situation it reminds me
to call my mom and remind her to not do
give out information on the phone and
you really think she would do that she
has done it not credit card information
but like bit she's falling for phishing
attacks and and how I've almost fallen
for phishing attacks sometimes they're
like wat what was the closest okay so i
thought i was being fished because the
rhr website has like a weird sub URL
which was asking me for a password my
password wasn't working and i actually
had to ask our HR and they're like oh no
that's fine that's actually part of the
site it just doesn't work right now yeah
but I was like is this did I just like
type in all of my passwords that I could
possibly remember into the site and give
them then give them everything um so
like I or like whatever you redesign the
chase site and you have one letter typed
wrong now and it brings you it to a
chase look-alike site yeah but like
there are little nuances that legitimate
websites all have sure that our artifact
very much impossible to come factor
authentication stuff like that but it
like my mom doesn't have any of this
you're right I get it like we this is
gonna sound super lame but we do speak a
different language than our parents
general yeah and I'm sure our kids will
do the same thing like I you know I
think there were self there were so we
know how shit works know where you don't
think they're gonna have technology that
we don't understand
but I'm just saying like they're gonna
be like what you just use the blorp what
an idiot so we used to have this
conversation all the time where it's
like yeah the generation behind us like
they're definitely more set on relying
on technology yeah but like we could we
are of the whole thing was like we might
know how it all works better than they
do where it's just like they just have
the ipad I know that the screen works
nothing they didn't know the baseline
right yeah like they were which we're in
a very unique thing and it's obviously a
very self they will self-important way
to look at they will have a new form of
technology that we don't know the
baseline of core up yeah maybe I will
maybe like some sort of weird ocular
implant Thanks yeah we're all getting
comp digital content surgically
installed um yeah no III know you mean
no and it's yeah that's yeah it's a
bummer but like it'll it'll always have
it will always exist of course that
stuff will always of course it's a new
form of pickpocketing said it's the one
of the oldest profession Oliver said
you've got to pick a pocket or two
actually I believe that was Fagan that
said that I don't know who did in Oliver
I don't know who exactly did that but I
will finish on this cat-and-mouse game
that's going on between Facebook and
adblock if you are one of those people
that uses facebook com I've used it have
you been there yes it's a website about
social networking did you delete your
account yet no but I haven't been on
about five days which is like such a
cathartic experience um so adblock which
is the infamous browser plugin at blocks
ads which we obviously can't endorse
because we are completely based on ads
yes our websites um but a lot of people
use them an insanely popular facebook
has a bit of a problem with that block
because well the majority of their
revenue surrounds is surrounded by ads
yeah it comes from as like a new
facebook makes a buttload of money
because they are able to serve billions
of ads so they've been going back and
forth on the desktop version of Facebook
because Facebook rewrote code that
prevented adblock from sniffing out ad
servers and blocking them sure but then
adblock pushed
a update that circumvented Facebook's
coding and this morning Facebook has
come back and be like no we got you back
yeah so I don't know I just want to talk
about this real quick before we say
goodbye for the week don't buy it like
it I think the bigger conversation is is
adblock okay and I guess on paper it is
even though your it's like basically i
know i don't think it's you don't think
it's okay no it's not illegal it is not
illegal I think it's morally not cool
dude I do plenty of things that are not
more good and and using a buck would be
another war Leon cool thing what is so
I'm not gonna get into them but here's
the argument for why people use adblock
all I know why they don't want to see
ads fine but but their moral high ground
argument is well these websites put on
really a like bothersome ads where they
play audio or they whatever that's
bullshit and that's but that's why
people say like if that's your only
reasoning that's cut your kind of
bullshit you're associating yourself
which is to say you know what the
response to that is then don't go to the
website right if you like their content
you should be watching wouldn't you ads
and if you think the pads are bad enough
to not go to the website you should go
all right I'm a TV exec okay I think
people who fast forward commercials are
immoral yeah who's right who's more
right I think it's a very similar
situation I think morally it is
questionable too fast dude come on thing
I'm saying you DVR'd you do all the time
I'm not saying I'm I don't innocent
nobody nobody watches commercials
they've recorded true on purpose yeah
I'm purpose sometimes they'd remotes on
the other side of the room and Nate just
like sometimes just gonna sit through it
you're just gonna sit through it and
like obviously on sports you generally
just sit through cuz it's live right but
you know TV executives have found a way
to make a profit on the amount of ads
that are watch that are watched by
people that are not fast-forwarded
through now so whatever or oh
it shifts the paradigm where everything
goes subscriber base like f yeah yeah
I've we're definitely headed we are
there as a subscription-based future
internet reality but I don't know it's
you know facebook is not Facebook's in a
separate category for a lot of reason
sure but when it comes to Ed's facebook
ads are so ingrained to the philosophy
yeah of their network like you're seeing
this ad because of the social network
relationship you have with people on
this service yes like that is why you
are seeing this and then that's what the
way a lot of ads work on the internet
but um you know what I would do well I
think this is the salt I I know a lot of
sites block people there like Facebook
in this case block people from using the
site i would let them read like one
article and block everything else if
that technology even exists more like
maybe give them like a 30 second counter
or something like that which is like we
know you have an ad blocker on uh if you
dug this article you can read the rest
of the site you just have to turn it off
or you just do what they're doing where
they're figuring out like face don't
tell me that the people at adblock are
wiser than the people people at facebook
i'm sure there are more people I don't
know how I baucus is it like a free do
whatever ya apparent and you know how it
works alright not really it's just kind
of like nose advertising server oh I
understand okay so is the way I
understand it I would imagine it's
difficult to keep up with like that ever
changing thing yeah and it's essentially
an anonymous I'm sure is supporting it
you know Facebook has to pay employees
there's a reason why VLC is the very
best media program on the word in the
world is because it's farrah free to use
by everyone and so it's the best
possible product so Facebook's never
gonna have that some people would
disagree with that you don't think it's
the best I I like it I like it a lot I
think it's for viewing there's some
people who don't like it some people who
there's some some purists they're wrong
some better using some time some video
playing purists would disagree uh but
yeah that's that's the story going on
with Facebook versus adblock and that is
