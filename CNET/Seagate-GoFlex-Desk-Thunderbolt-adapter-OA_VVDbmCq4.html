today and show you another Thunder bomb
device now I've been talking a lot about
Thunderbolt lately and you might think
I'm a big fan of Apple but actually I'm
just a good-looking guy trying to hit
job well some people believe that anyway
today though the device actually indeed
very interesting so I have here the gold
flakes - external hard drive foam
Seagate and as you can see here the
drive work with any computer including
the Mac now you can use it with the USB
port but you don't want to USB you want
to Thunderball and the drive here is a
very special Drive because coming to
part the dry part and the adapter part
and for that reason now you have the
Thunderball option this is the go flash
desk
Thunderball adapter from Seagate now it
should have to take the drive of the old
adapter put it into the new adapter and
right there you form the new Seagate go
flicks Thunderbolt Drive and there's
more you can also use this adapter with
any standard SATA internal drive such as
this Seagate 3 to buy drive right here
you can turn this one into a thunderbolt
storage solution you can also use that
with small laptop drive - such as this
one right here or you can even use a SSD
for it lies the run core drive right
here
now since the adapters support many many
different drives it comes with a thumb
drive right here that contains the
driver for the Mac to support drive that
is larger than 2 terabyte it's very
quick - into the driver only in case you
want to use a hard drive that is more
than 2 terabyte with the adapter now as
a Thunderbolt device the adapter come
with 2 Thunderbolt ports meaning that
you can use it in a daisy chain and I
did try that with about 3 or 4 devices
at a time and it works really well it
does require a separate power adaptor
but that's normal for a desktop solution
now the question is how much does this
cost the thunderbolt doctor here cos
hundred ninety dollars which is not
cheap
but it's still cheaper than many other
funnybone solution unfortunately like
many other Thunderball devices it does
not include the Thunderbolt cable which
you will have to get from Apple for
another fifty dollars in my testing the
adapter here actually really fast faster
than some other Thunderbolt devices I've
seen for that reason plus the
flexibility this device actually one of
the best if not the best
Thunderball solution on the market for
now once again my name is Domino and
this has to be in the first look at the
go flash desk
