the alpha x where we're talking all
things apple both good and bad and if
you're the type of person that believes
apple can do no wrong you might want to
cover your ears for a while now to
follow the last week's show apple will
be releasing a software fix tomorrow
accurately display how many signal bars
we see on all iphones both past and
present after being stunned to discover
they've actually been miscalculating it
all this time for three years but that
still doesn't fix antenna issues that
are hardware problems for iphone 4 users
experiencing it and if you or grandma
have promising those tiny little bars
apples also increasing the size of bars
1 2 and 3 with the upcoming software
update thank you that is amazing I still
have a hard enough time reading 36 size
font what does that say now if this
software fix is accurate those five full
bars I get at work which don't allow me
to make or receive calls or send text
messages should all disappear so you
know at least I'll know my reception
really does suck but that's not all the
latest developing iphone 4 issue has to
do with its proximity sensor it hasn't
been getting as much attention but when
you hold up the phone to your face the
screen is supposed to deactivate now
that's not happening for everyone
sometimes it won't turn off people's
cheeks will register as screen touches
or its screen won't turn back on after a
call now these problems aren't affecting
everyone but then there's also an issue
with phones taking yellow tinted
pictures that look like they belong to R
Kelly when it tries adjusting the lower
light conditions
this may have been the best product
launch ever for Apple but it's also
starting to become its biggest black eye
and I'm just waiting out for the next
batch of bones from the factories now
it's really been a rough few weeks for
iphone 4 owners ATT recently announced
that a software defect caused iphone 4
users on AT&amp;amp;T in areas like New York
Washington DC Boston Las Vegas Seattle
and many more to drop upload speeds by
one-tenth of their normal speed and you
can bet people were thrilled about this
but a fix is on its way with no time
frame set and they won't be thrilled
about that and over the July 4th holiday
Apple confirmed approximately 400 itunes
accounts were hacked after Vietnamese
book apps by tuan nguyen took over
approximately 40 of the 50 top spots for
paid books on itunes now according to
Fox News iTunes servers were not hacked
and Apple has removed all the apps from
that developer it appears the accounts
were compromised through phishing scams
or easy to guess passwords but it's a
little disturbing to me that we would
immediately assume iTunes was hacked
instead of potentially realizing that
Vietnamese book apps on itunes are just
as hot as just a fever
I'm just saying it's possible now in
quick bites all this bad press isn't
hurting Apple according to Piper Jaffray
and NPD's data Mac sales are up 30
percent year-over-year for the quarter
through May and the ipad doesn't seem to
be hurting the mac sales at all and if
you're still looking hard for an iPad
digit times reports Apple is ramping up
iPad production to over two million
units for the month of July now the
mobileme idisk app has been updated to
support multitasking in ios4 and it's
now compatible on the iPad and if you're
a mobileme user you can opt in to try
out the beta for the calendar app @
me.com Plus let's not ignore that even
though we've been going on and on about
the iphone 4s antenna issue there are
solutions like this one alright that's
going to do it for this week's show send
your emails to the apple byte at cnet
com i'm brian Tong thanks for watching
and we'll see you guys next week for
another bite of the Apple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
