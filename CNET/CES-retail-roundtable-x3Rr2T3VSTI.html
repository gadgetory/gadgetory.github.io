what really happens at CES and that is
buyers come to buy I'm Brian Cooley here
on the stage at CES 2012 examining the
way forward as we've been doing all the
whole CES show here from cnet joining me
now to give us a perspective that we've
never brought you before in all the
years we've been covering CES it's about
damn time we do it's chad taylor from ab
to lex tronox in based in chicago you
guys are a force in the Midwest Chad but
you're not a national but you guys are
deeply rooted in CES correct craig so
we're a single store retailer lo tailee
located in Glenview Illinois which is a
suburb of Chicago yeah you know one
store family-owned operation you know
carry everything from your you know
basic refrigerator up to you know your
ultrabooks your high-end appliances
high-end TVs I mean you name it we can
pretty much do it it's a navy furniture
yepp baby furniture I mean if they got a
place to put the stove and get it home
it never ends with us you know it's
definitely something we take pride in
describe your store layout because you
guys are really innovative in how your
store is said I've never if you have
never been to an AB to the app store
it's not just a big box would you used
to work for the biggest of the big boxes
but what's your store laid out like um
so you know you under main store it very
you know appliances on the Left TVs
consumer electronics on the right and
then you walk into our HP mirror we have
a big huge fountain that plays water
shows throughout the day then you have
our gourmet shop where you can get
everything for your kitchen that you can
possibly imagine and then you get into
our sony store or connect store which is
our computer store yeah and then our
apple boutique and then I can't forget
our time watch store yes I consumer
electronics or sells watches so you guys
are kind of make this little village of
different interests in tech now you're
here shopping for tablets and laptops
primarily right yep tablets laptops
desktops anything accessories go along
with anything like that
tell us how it works you come to CES
you've just got a map to walk the floor
you have meetings who do you talk to you
I so you know predominately I come in
and I have meetings so I meet with you
know I met with Lenovo yesterday so all
their new stuff I'll meet with a suits
and Sony today I'll meet with some
accessory vendors tomorrow so that's
basically my at my week I don't really
get to walk the floor as much as I like
but it's interesting because you're in
meetings and all this stuff something
more we know how many millions of
dollars these companies spend instead of
these boots but they want to get with
you personally what happens there that
we don't know about ah so in some cases
I'll see stuff that you know hasn't come
out yet and has that we haven't seen
possibly in some cases soloing I get to
see the stuff before it even you know
becomes public in some cases yeah you
know so back to school stuff that's new
concept even holiday for possibly you
know so the new asus tablet oh you guys
saw yesterday i'll get to see that
hopefully today yeah you know so in some
cases apps you know we talked about you
know forecasting and we talked about you
know any product shortages anything like
that these aren't just hey that's gee
whiz great stuff you guys are working
each other right they want you to buy a
lot and you want to be convinced it's
going to move yep so you know they want
me to buy a lot I want them to give me
great deals you know you know we want to
make sure that you know the product
sells well that we can get replenished
quickly it doesn't so well we can move
it out quickly so anyway so it's a
constant struggle to find the exact
perfect product that sells really well
and you know hopefully we know makes the
money tell you about some of the some of
the projects you've seen here let's take
laptops for example ultrabooks are
really hot what do you see the chill a
couple models or edible features ah so
the yoga from Lenovo's definitely you
know by far my favorite piece right now
and they've got their new I night what
they're a 700 series coming out where
you can actually take the 27 inch touch
panel and lay it flat and it's actually
10-point touch you can actually type
play on piano yeah so you got a look at
the yoga here that is there the Chad's
been looking at is the one is highly
articulated there's a 306 yeah solder
easel it starts as a regular laptop and
you can literally take and Bend the
screen back and it flips it over now you
got a tablet do you think that works or
is there too much bulk when it's in
tablet mode to be really a considered a
tablet you know it's it's it's going to
be a definitely market for people you
know because I carry a tablet em
laptop yeah a lot of stuff so you know
for me to have the functionality with
windows 8 to do everything I need to do
with one device how did we'll do a
little bit of the bulkiness yeah we're
talking to chad taylor from abdill
ektron exceeds here he's a buyer for apt
and he's looking for laptops looking for
tablets Weaver desktops some gaming gear
as well right yes we had to play with
the PlayStation Vita the other day yeah
do you like it was pretty cool so
definitely I liked a lot better than the
PSP much more responsive much more
comfortable as well interesting when you
place an order you have to figure out
what you want and how many of them you
want you mentioned forecasting no no how
do you know what we want you want sumers
hey you know you that i read Cena and
you just tell me my man so you know we
asked I mean you so we do we do listen
to to our customers you know the nice
thing about app we've been and we've
been in chicago area for so long now
that you know our customers will just
flat out tell us hey we're looking for
this and we try to go out and find it
now your website looks like it's a great
big sophisticated ecommerce website now
but your store is a very different thing
you guys were founded a long time ago by
jewel and David Abbott they were Hall of
Fame inductees for the cea in 2008 ma
they are part of the original siiii
crowd in this country what do you guys
do differently than a best buy or any of
the other big boxes that may be out in
your area um this is like a major local
vendor which is almost kind of a weird
mix so you know one of the one of the
biggest things that I half is our people
while you got sales people who have been
there 40 years you know so there you
know you got people who have been there
you know and that's what they specialize
in so if you have an a sales person that
you've worked with for 25 years and
they're gonna tell you hey go talk to so
and so in our computer store go talk to
so and so who you're going to trust that
person that you're going to work with
automatically yeah absolutely so let me
get this right I go into your store and
I've got a question about tech and I'm
gonna get someone informed to tell me my
answer absolutely who knew that was
possible right beautiful so yeah we
definitely take pride in knowing our
products knowing what's going on on the
world and we do take front of our
training as well yeah let's talk about
what you do with this whole area of
online
is offline majority of your sales are
through the cider in the store um we
have a good mix of us we actually we
actually do sales three ways in-store
online and we do have a huge phone sales
department so we just like that so if
you see someone inside there folks that
are buying the latest laptops and
tablets but they want to do it on the
phone absolutely you still have people
who don't want to put their credit card
number in on a computer it's just a lot
of people don't so we take hundreds and
hundreds and hundreds of phone calls a
day we actually just went to 24 hours on
Monday through Friday when we have
someone who will answer the phone for
you you guys remind me little bit about
like like B&amp;amp;H photo I'm sure they're an
archrival but you guys are in that same
sort of you know you have a locus in one
major city but you have a big reach how
do you guys get your product mix
together we've heard what you look for
to say yes to you also have to say no to
a lot of products you only have so much
shelf space because you run a real store
is a big part of your operation you have
to say more to make me more things than
then an online retailer who can drop
ship everything right is it tough to
make those calls you ever make the wrong
call and say we didn't buy the right one
sure you you always make the good
college you make the bad calls too so
you know one of the nice things is is uh
you know because we're one store we
don't have you know the thousand source
of support we can be very selective in
what we have but we also special order
almost anything so for instance with our
Apple assortment you know we will
special order any configuration our
customers want without any problem nine
times out of ten if customer walks in
they see a specific laptop you know that
and we can get it will order it for him
we're definitely gonna say yes any
reasonable request so the big talk that
was going on during the holiday is about
the retail space versus online people
were going into stores like yours or
bestbuy or any of these places looking
for things using their QR code of their
bar scanner app on the camera and then
buying it on Amazon after they checked
it out in the store is that a problem
how are you guys dealing with it um so
again it's loyal to think for us and our
customers definitely want to shop with
us we do have you know great a great
great customer base but you know again
if it's if it's being sold by amazon and
we're gonna and we we need to price
match it nine times I 10 will price
match amazon so we don't have a price
match amazon nine times out of ten yeah
it's got to be sold by amazon right but
we're not okay fulfilled by it
alright not just some sort of Amazon
network merchant you got it interesting
okay lastly one asked you about has it
been the news a lot is the the thai
floods have been hitting a lot of people
don't know this i think almost every
nikon DSLR is actually made in thailand
and components for lots of cameras and
computers come out of Thailand and
that's been I mean literally
unprecedented flooding in that country
what have you heard about what that's
going to do to the supply of things that
use hard drives so hard hard drives are
definitely gonna be some shortages and
hard drives and we've already seen that
seeing some cost increases I you know
for especially for companies who didn't
have a lot of stock to begin with you
know so the interesting thing is is the
bigger drives for desktops are going to
be hard and hard to find little big one
too terribly so especially the two
terabyte drives some laptops are going
to be affected you know they're working
through it but you know when you deal
with at kind of devastation you know
entire factories underwater yeah workers
and people displaced so we're definitely
seen go see some pains for you know next
couple months I think yeah after that it
kind of it should hopefully get better
soon what categories do you see going
cool at the store things that you know
industry-wide or just kind of think
we're losing interest um you know with
all the Ultrabook talk you know the the
big huge monstrous laptops you know I'd
oh yeah what's called the desktop right
you know so you know even for me i mean
i run around my store all day with my
laptop in my hand i run around the
little 14-inch i don't know where you
know I used to carry a 15 16 inch laptop
you know desktops all in ones are
definitely starting to kind of get even
more of a big hold on the traditional
desktop yeah and then with windows 8
coming out and being able to utilize a
touchscreen even more I think that will
continue a lot of times and Windows
comes out with a new aversion lexer
comes out the new version of Windows
it's 10 it can be but isn't always a
huge spike cycle it can be like a long
cycle you guys enjoy four months or a
year do you think Windows 8 is going to
be a watershed errs are going to be one
of the quieter windows driving releases
you know when a sudden is great it is I
think it's a guess um I think if they
can definitely put enough value in it
and make it reasonably priced for the
upgrade yeah you know it definitely
could help helpless else but seven was
good and that kind of makes it tougher
for eight to drive a lot of folks in the
door right yeah willing
in with XP still around I mean you got
windows seven that support XP people to
realize how popular XP is XP solar I did
dad you gotta people still haven't
migrated to seven so especially because
of corporate yeah alright Chad thanks so
much for being here for Chad Taylor from
Abdullah tronox in Chicago who is giving
us a point of view though we don't hear
enough of around here and it's kind of
the backbone of why people come to
consumer electronics show so thank you
very much Chad that's at the electronics
there at ABT ab com kind of an unusual
name that's how it's spelled</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
