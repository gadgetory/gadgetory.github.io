transformed the tech landscape with the
announcement of a single product the
iPhone it was expensive it was different
I still have my iPhone from 2007 and it
still works well it still turns on at
least ten years later what does it feel
like next to the iPhone 7 plus I've been
using them both side by side
it's amazing the iPhone still feels the
same mostly I mean there's a home button
a touchscreen volume buttons but
everything else is really different it
feels ridiculously tiny more like an
iPod it's round
slightly chunky aluminum design actually
feels more like the Apple watch than the
super thin iPhone 7 the original iPhone
only connected to ATT's edge network for
speed slower than 3G
my current SIM card wouldn't work even
with an adapter but I could connect over
Wi-Fi even that's a lot slower than
anything possible on LTE now there's no
GPS no front-facing camera and the rear
camera doesn't even have flash the 3.5
inch screen is functional and it's not
bad for 10 years ago but it's terrible
compared to crisper brighter screens now
but that original iPhone it's a great
music player if you load mp3s on it's
not able to stream to popular apps or
really load any apps anymore the App
Store which came later is on this iPhone
with iOS 3 but I can't download any apps
to it anymore
pandora one of the few music streaming
apps on the iPhone that I still have
doesn't play if I leave the app
background streaming came later photos
look really muddy but I can still upload
one to Facebook if I have the patience I
can surf the web Google Maps still works
the iPhones core idea is still the same
but now the iPhone is about connecting
to everything notifications Bluetooth
messages videos photos tons of games
plants vs. zombies was the best it got
back in the old days but in 2007 there
weren't any games the iPhone was a mac
connected iPod with phone service where
will the iPhone be in another 10 years
maybe it'll be invisible absorbed into
other gadgets maybe it'll be the hub to
everything
but it'll be hard to reinvent something
as singular as that first iPhone I
wouldn't Rock the old one anymore though
