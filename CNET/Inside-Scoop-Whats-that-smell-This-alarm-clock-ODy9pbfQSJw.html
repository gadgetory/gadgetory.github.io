it's been a long week and we're hitting
all the senses this morning first we got
to drink our faces with the ripple maker
coffee printer and now we're going for
high-tech smells joining us onstage is
gium role and CEO of sensor wake it's an
alarm clock that wakes you up with smell
how did this come to be what's the story
behind this so it was winter before it
was very odd for me to wake you up in
the morning very fitted in moments yeah
so I tried to figure out and to find a
new solution to wake you up gently
personality way so with this sense in
two minutes you can choose your favorite
scents and wake you up to enjoy your
morning well sense do you have in total
approximately ten different sense so as
such as mr aromatherapy coefficients all
croissants a lot of difference to enjoy
your day ok well i would like to have
you sample some sense for us on the
stage and I want you have to guess what
he might be smelling so I haven't told
Jeff what the sense we have as examples
are it's just like a canine esque nose
okay I'm so I'm gonna be able to sniff
out with oh I already never chose you
eyes because it's a its regional ok I'll
go promised someone like I'm gonna look
straight ahead ok are you ready so so
you insert it in everything I do I will
do demo ok in a few minutes it will come
to you and it two minutes who can wake
you up only with this sense oh I'm
getting it already it's like it's a
cottony um french toast yeah yeah what's
up hey look at that grifols ok cool that
were latian all right I don't one not
bad right ok all right clear clear it
out cleared I got another one coming hey
I ready for this one I'm born ready gium
oh that's I wouldn't like this it's too
flowery oh it's uh
what is that it's like melons and sort
of melon I flag on your garden it's his
it's gross grant oh I'm allergic to
grass oh sorry alright that's fine I'm
the last one is very very specific and
swing up with like cut grass the bourne
yeah I'm going up to sneeze a yeah no
that's that actually really does smell
like her grass that's intense I could
smell it over okay it's actually yeah
it's actually coming up okay hold on
let's cleanse the nasal palate the last
one is a niche in the limited edition
very specific okay it's I think it will
be difficult to find it but I can't
believe how potent and strong and yeah I
thought the science it has to be very
concentrated I cubes already okay Oh
what WI's that's weird um was it remind
you of would it give me a hint it's like
it's not natural it's not a natural so
it's like on its with leather since
leather eyes that's more more school so
he's this much feels like uh I don't see
like your wallet or something like that
yeah like it's was money yeah morning
sense you're right so forbidden find it
just perfect excellent a way to wake up
to remind you why you waked up for the
more I guess make that money wow that's
crazy so it so obviously not everybody
can be awoken by a sent everybody the
defense are very concentrated and very
stimulated the only way where you can be
awakened it's when you have a black nose
and for the blog knows where as an
emergency LM clock after three minutes
also what you found okay so there's a
backup there's no sound okay after three
minutes is there a way we could hear the
sound can that go off right now or no I
know your yeah you guys JMO so it's good
it's good off oh here it or no oh not
here because it was rested emo okay gosh
after a few minutes you have an
imaginative so you won't miss your
meeting it's right look nose right okay
if you found in your research that how
long does it have to start emitting the
aroma before people start to wake up
yeah so firstly we try to find a very
good technology to defuse the sense and
to be very easy
for the people so we have a dry
different system without eating
something so the perfume are very
authentic with this diffusion and very
strong and concentrated to work here and
we work with a war leader in fragrance
industry a big company ecology belong to
a very good sense like dolara like those
like otras on chocolate coffee real like
this one so to have a good morning game
