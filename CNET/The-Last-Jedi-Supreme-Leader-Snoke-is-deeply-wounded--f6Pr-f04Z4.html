different projects I've been told we
can't talk about or ask you directly
about Star Wars I won't say the S word
but maybe can you tell us about your
experience working with that with that
yeah I mean it's been an amazing
franchise to be part of you know first
starting with JJ and then now with
Lauren Johnson who's made an incredible
film and and again another really
challenging character to play
you know without saying too much about
him he is he is a ezel he's both he's
strong with the force he's strong with
the dark side of the force obviously but
he is also a deeply wounded character
and and there's a lot of venom that he
feels towards the resistance so without
giving too much away that's a little
sort of snapshot ya know I mean and and
and evolving these characters is is
really it's very exciting as an actor
too and I realized this sort of almost
at the end of Lord of the Rings when
Peter Jackson asked me to play King Kong
here was now a technology that allowed
an actor to play anything that you could
go off into all of these you know
previously unactive all roles because of
the know the scale of a character like
King Kong being a 25-foot gorilla or or
or or the extreme you know the the
emaciated thin lengthy skeletal kind of
figure that Snoke is for instance or the
three and a half foot wiry Gollum you
know that suddenly it doesn't matter
what kind of what your shape as an actor
is or how old you are or or or what the
color of your skin is or what sex you
are you can you can now climb into any
of these characters and that's that has
been I suppose the most thrilling
philosophically as an actor you know
this tool that enables you to do that is
what is what's what's been amazing over
that over the course of the last 17
years to to push and to and to so I sort
of try and see how we can
allow the actors palette to increase
over lots of different medium</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
