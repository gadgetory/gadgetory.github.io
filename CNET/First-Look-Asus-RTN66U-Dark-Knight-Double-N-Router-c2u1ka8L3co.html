in my work after dealing with crazy
names and this device right here is no
exception is the RT and 66u dark night
double for a 50 megabit per second n
router from asus let you settle with
dark night it's good name anyway now the
dark neck looks great
more like a box of chocolates or jewelry
than a networking device but it cannot
pretend to be one because you can see
here it has three detachable
antenna sticking up from the back now on
the back you see you have four LAN ports
and one one ports all this port are
gigabit meaning you have the fastest
wide network with this router there's
also the WPS button the reset button the
power button and a tiny power port right
here now the rare has not one but two
USB port also is report offer more
function than just the support for an
external hard drive or printers on the
front here you can see the usual array
of LED light that shows the status of
the port on the back and other functions
of the router now this is the first end
900 router from a soos that means it can
work on both the 2.4 gigahertz and 5v
good bands at the same temp which expand
offering 450 megabits per second
standard this is called the 3 by 3
standard now in order for you to take
advantage of that higher speed the
client also have support the 3 by 3 but
if they don't the router also work with
all existing clients in my testing is
work great especially in the
five-year-old bands it also offer very
good coverage with long range and very
stable signal now the router has common
features such as the guest networking
feature prior to control the support for
ivy p6 and others it also have a rather
unique feature in cooling and network
maps traffic managers and also a VPN
server which allows you to
create a virtual private network for
remote user to connect home securely now
the rare is not perfect and I found a
few funny thing about it for example you
can use the web interface to check for
the firmware and update the router to it
however even when the router is only
updated with the latest firmware the web
interface still say there are newer
version out there now that's kind of fun
but the only way for you to know when
there's actually a new version of
firmware out there is to go to a soos
website the second kind of our thing
about the router is a fact that come
with this base right here now from the
look of the base and the look of the
bottom of the rarer I will assume that
you put them together like this for the
route of work in the vertical position
however when I try to do that there's a
little bit of plastic sticking out from
here staying in the way making it
impossible for them to fit so I would
think if I break this piece off that
would work now let's try out voila now
it's broken
so let's see they're gonna fit now and
it fit I don't know whether or not
there's the defect in the malt or maybe
a suit want to play a practical joke
with us but sometime to break it to make
it work now those little things do not
mean this is not a good router in fact
it's one of the best and LAN router on
the market and at $180 it actually
cheaper than its peers for more
information check out the full review a
sitcom my name is dongho and this has
been the first look at the dark night
rarer from Zeus
