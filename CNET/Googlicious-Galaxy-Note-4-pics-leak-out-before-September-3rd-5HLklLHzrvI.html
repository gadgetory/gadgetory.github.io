welcome to Google Isha's it's all the
Google goodness that we can pack inside

teaming up with six other companies to
invest in a 300 million dollar undersea
cable nicknamed faster that aims to
boost the speed of web connectivity in
Asia now I know this may not be the
sexiest headline but the connection will
run 60 terabytes of data per second
that's 10 million times faster than the
standard cable modem so maybe they could
just add an additional connection to my
apartment now it will connect major West
Coast cities like San Francisco la
Seattle and Portland to coastal cities
in Japan Chikara and shima other
companies teaming up our major Asian
wireless and telecom groups like China
Mobile international global transit kddi
and more now construction will begin
immediately and it will be ready to use
by the second quarter of 2016 with NEC
being the main project supplier google
has invested in other underwater cable
projects in the past and it aligns with
their strategy for getting internet
across the world and creative ways like
their own project loon with their big
idea projects all right check this out
September looks to be a busy and hectic
month in the gadget world after Samsung

360 SmartWatch just to keep you
interested Italian site gadget dotnet
recently released a boatload of images
but the most interesting ones feature
the Moto 360 sitting in what's believed
to be the charging dock that charges the
