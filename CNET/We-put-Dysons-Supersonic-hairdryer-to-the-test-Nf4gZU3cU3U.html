makeover is called the Dyson supersonic
let's take a look this uses Dyson's air
multiplier technology you can see the
design is a little bit different to that
of a traditional hairdryer and that's
because Dyson is taken a lot of the
components that would be in the head
part up here and move them down to the
handle so all the air gets pushed out of
this thin gap around the front and I
have to say that this thing really does
push a lot of air around the other thing
that's really quite remarkable is that
this thing's pretty quiet now often when
you're using a hairdryer you can't talk
to anyone else in the room or even
really hear yourself think but if I turn
this on you should be able to just about
hear me it's not too loud
it's customizable too there are magnetic
attachments that snap onto the front
including a smoothing nozzle which does
gentle drying and a diffuser as well
which broadly disperses the air through
your hair controls are pretty simple
this button on the Left controls how
much air is getting pushed through while
this one on the right you tap it to
cycle through levels of heat down here
there's a cold shot button too in case
you want a blast of cold air case you've
just dried your hair using the
supersonic how did you find it well I
think compared to my normal hair dryer
it was a lot more powerful I mean I did
need to have it up to full power and on
the full heat settings I really enjoyed
the experience and my hair feels much
more like I've just come out of the
hairdresser's rather than I've just
dried it myself at home actually when I
removed both of the nozzles and that I
was using at various points while drying
it and I actually felt that the blast
was a lot more powerful and if I
probably use that the whole way through
it would have probably been quicker so
are there any downsides well this thing
is actually quite expensive when it
comes out in the UK in June it's going
to cost 299 pounds it's coming out in
the US in September when it's going to
cost 399 dollars that's quite a lot more
expensive than even the most luxurious
hair dryers out there but wait until the
full review where we'll find out if it's
worth the money</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
