everyone at Apple they inspire us to
create even better products that help
kids learn and unlock their amazing
creative genius today we're going to
take those experiences even further and
to start it off we're gonna talk about
iPad and to do that I'd like to invite
Greg josma cup to the stage Greg
the new 9.7 inch ipad takes everything
people love about our most popular ipad
and make it even better for inspiring
creativity and learning Apple pencil and
iPad pro has become the creative tool of
choice by the world's most demanding pro
artists illustrators and designers it's
incredibly fast fluid and precise and it
feels completely natural to use but we
wanted to bring that amazing experience
to even more people so now our most
affordable iPad has support for our most
creative tool Apple pencil
we're providing a high resolution touch
system with sub-pixel precision to this
iPad this will enable ultra-low latency
pencil support and the same tilt and
pressure sensing that had made Apple
pencil such a hit it's so versatile for
the things you do every day at school
like taking notes Apple pencil works
beautifully with the built-in Notes app
and markup it's now just so easy to mark
up a worksheet assignment or screenshot
and of course the great education apps
like explain everything that already
support Apple pencil will work with this
new iPad and it goes so much further
there's an incredible universe of apps
designed for Apple pencil an iPad pro
that will now be available to everyone
and more and more iPad pencilled enabled
apps and new uses for Apple pencil just
keep coming this iPad comes loaded with
all the other great features built fried
pattern Iowa's 11 and our terrific apps
like GarageBand clips iMovie notes and
the iWork suite they help can help
anyone be more creative and since we've
made both the hardware and the software
nothing comes even close to offering the
powerfully simple or magical experience
that iPad can and even if all these
enhancements were pleased that were able
to offer this new iPad for the same $329
starting price for you for consumers and
we're super pleased to offer this to
schools for just $2.99
it's available to order today and we'll
start shipping to our customers and
arriving in stores this week now let's
talk about something really cool
augmented reality AR is about combining
digital with the real world and iOS is
the largest AR platform in the world and
we believe a R is going to bring an
entirely new dimension to the classroom
enabling new ways to learn well the ape
that this iPad has the power of the a10
fusion combined with the big beautiful
Retina display the advanced cameras and
sensors that enable incredible AR
experience is simply not possible on
other devices AR on the iPad helps
students experience and understand these
concept much more deeply than they ever
could before the last app I'm going to
show you is one of my favorites it's
called Fraga pedia by design mate it
allows you to experience biology in a
way you never could before but the magic
via our students can place a virtual
frog right on their desk and they can
explore the inner workings of that frog
in a way they never could with a real
frog
and instead of dissecting a frog which
can have both cost and safety
implications not to mention some serious
implications for the Frog students can
dissect a virtual frog with our Apple
pencil they can even take a built-in
quiz to identify the individual organs
we just love this stuff
so that's iPad and as I said earlier
great teachers and powerful technology
are an incredible combination so now I'd
like to invite Susan Prescott to the
stage to tell you about all the things
we're doing for these great teachers
teachers are the heart of the classroom
and we know it takes dedicated
passionate teachers to fuel students
curiosity and to guide them to their
full creative potential so we want to
help teachers use our products to create
engaging and personal learning
experiences for all kinds of learners
but we want to help you do more to
communicate and connect with students
and give them the personal attention
they deserve so today I am very excited
to introduce a brand new app called
schoolwork
schoolwork is a free cloud-based app
that makes it easy for you to assign
handouts to tap into the power of apps
that make the iPad amazing and to get
visibility into each student's progress
so let's take a look when you open
schoolwork you can see all your classes
as well as any upcoming assignments it's
easy to create handouts for your class
with PDFs or web links or documents you
might want to send your class a simple
field trip reminder or a group project
assignment or maybe today's math
homework it's literally as easy as
sending an email but we just saw some of
the amazing apps in our ecosystem that
let students and teachers in the
classroom learn and create in ways they
never could before so we knew schoolwork
had to do more it had to go further so
today in schoolwork we're introducing a
groundbreaking new way to bring apps
into your classroom
now of course student lets you point
stuff up students and teachers
schoolwork will let you point students
to an app and that's great but that's
not enough what's really cool is we make
it easy for you to assign students a
specific activity within an app so with
one tap students can go directly to that
activity you wanted them to complete for
example this is the integers activity
from the clue top now assigning an
activity within an app is as easy as
assigning a worksheet but can it be just
as easy to check on their progress with
schoolwork it is and with just a tap I
can see a detailed view of all the
students work kind of incredible so this
means their documents their projects and
detailed view of how they're doing even
on their app activities and that's
important for many reasons but one is we
think it will allow teachers to be able
to tailor to the needs and the potential
of their students by getting this kind
of view we're really excited about that
so today I am so excited to announce
we're building a brand new curriculum to
inspire a new kind of learning
experience and we're calling it everyone
can create
everyone can create as a program
designed around the idea that technology
can unleash kids creativity and their
creative genius in the classroom and
applying these concepts can lead to
deeper understanding and demonstration
of what they know in any subject now
like everyone can code teachers have
free teaching and learning resources but
with everyone can create we focus on
developing skills in four creative
disciplines music video photography and
drawing and those are very powerful ways
for kids to express themselves but we
know crivit creativity isn't just about
art and music it's so much more the real
magic comes when you apply those skills
in the classroom to subjects you're
already teaching for example in
photography skills like composition and
lighting can show mathematical patterns
that exist in nature or a kid can use
drawing skills like sketching texture or
shading to bring out more detail in a
history report record audio and add
background tracks to bring the mood how
you felt when you heard a speech or
heard a quote like this
we choose to go to the moon in this
decade and do the other things not
because they are easy because they are
hard fun and those space sounds were
from the new GarageBand sound pack that
jaws talked about key video concepts
like setting and composition and
narrative can come to life by telling
stories in any subject like this video
from Nicole's class in Baton Rouge
Louisiana living cells reproduce through
a process called mitosis first the cell
gets ready to divide by duplicating its
DNA the chromosomes line up along the
center of the cell the proteins pull the
chromosomes apart to opposite sides of
the cell a membrane forms around each
set of chromosomes and the cell pinches
in the middle to form two separate
daughter cells
and that's mitosis such amazing work in
so much kids can do in the classroom and
there are student guides full of
real-world examples and projects to help
students build their skills and of
course there's a robust set of teaching
materials that include lesson ideas and
class activities for any grade level and
include assessment tips and sample
student work I hope you understand why
we believe iPad is best at engaging
students in new learning experiences
it's perfect for helping kids unleash
their creativity and have freedom of
expression we believe everyone can
create will develop and discover new
skills for kids and we can't wait to see
what they do with it everyone can create
you can preview today with more content
coming this summer so you can be ready
this fall in the classroom</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
