a security system that's convenient and
safe at the same time a few years ago we
answered that challenge with the
fingerprint scanner and today we're
taking another step forward in biometric
security pushing past the limits of what
many believe possible the note 7 comes
with an iris scanner so how does it work
well we developed our own proprietary
algorithm to map the contours of your
iris and the pattern of it and translate
it into a unique digital signature it
took five years to perfect but it only
takes a glance to unlock your phone and
this isn't the only software an
innovation designed with your security
in mind we saw the need for an added
level of privacy to protect your most
sensitive data so we created the secure
folder will let you store information on
your phone that only you can access now
using your iris scanner I mean think
about it this way we give our phones to
friends and family all the time to read
an article or look at photos but just
because I trust my friends to look at
pictures on my phone does not mean I
want them going through my text and
emails so it's secure folder I can keep
certain apps and content under lock and
key I can even make it invisible to
other people we also saw the need for
faster and easier ways to get online
with Samsung an internet browser you can
already use your fingerprint to log into
websites without using your username and
password and you can search the web in
secret mode now you can do both with the
iris scanner and this is just the
beginning we've been working on Samsung
pass a new service that's going to
replace IDs and passwords altogether and
allow you to simply identify yourself
with the
simple ice can</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
