pure imagination perfect drink system
this is a app and scale based system
that's gonna help you make better mixed
drinks at your home bar now like pure
imaginations other product the perfect
bake system perfect drink uses this
scale to measure your ingredients as you
poured them into a container letting you
know how much you need to add if you add
too much of one thing it'll compensate
for the other ingredients so you can
make a perfect beverage each and every
time you'll download the perfect drink
app to your smartphone or tablet so here
we've got this Bennett cocktail and if
you open up the Bennett build option
here you can see it just lists all the
ingredients we're gonna pour in some gin
and then from there add in some lime
juice and it'll beat when we've added
enough after that some simple syrup goes
into the cup and a little bit of bitters
you don't have the Angostura bitters but
we do have some cherry bitters here that
should do the trick there it's just time
to add ice and shake and gonna do that
as long as the app tells me to it count
down from 10 so I do it the right amount
of time and at the end of ten seconds
voila got myself a Bennett cocktail here
in my glass now before I reviewed this
kit I had never heard of a Bennett
cocktail and never made one so there's
something to be said for the whole
experimentation angle I think finding
new cocktails he might like new
potential favorites to add to your list
of things to get the bar but I gotta say
this is mostly a novelty this is not
something that you need to have even if
you do a lot of cocktail making at home
unless you want to learn about a lot of
different cocktails you want to
entertain guests at a party with a smart
drink making sections
I guess maybe that makes sense and at
$70 it's not that unreasonable I found
it for 50 in a couple of outlets at that
price I think it makes a decent gift and
I think it's something that you might
splurge on if you really like cocktails
and want to have something like this in
your home but not mixology must have
unfortunately thanks for watching and
make sure you check out the rest of our
smart home reviews at CNET appliances
drink responsibly the st. Patrick's Day
foreseen that I'm right Chris
