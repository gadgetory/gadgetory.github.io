the newest version of its action cam
let's take a look at the new features so
this is Sony's tiny camcorder it's
designed to be used in extreme
conditions it's water-resistant so
you'll be able to use it in the rain but
if you want to take it underwater you'll
need to snap on the protective casing
there are some new features for this
revamped model it's ever so slightly
lighter it weighs just over 3 ounces
with the battery in you can also shoot
footage upside down too in the settings
you can invert the capture if you want
to attach it to something by its
underside also at last there's a power
to put this thing on a tripod fire an
adapter that comes in the box it records
an NTSC and PAL it's got Wi-Fi NFC and
GPS you can connect it to an Android or
iOS device and use that to remotely
control video capture it's going to be
coming out in March for $300 if you're
willing to make $400 you can get it
bundled with Sony's live view remote
watch as well that watch lets you
control up to five of these Sony devices
wirelessly and it works up to 30 feet
it's definitely a very cute little
gadget I'll be interested to see just
how good the video that it produces
really is on the west ready to see net
