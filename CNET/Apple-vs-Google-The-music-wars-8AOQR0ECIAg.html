welcome to the apple pie for all the
good of bad inside the world of Apple
the big a finally launched the iTunes
Match service and google announced their
own google music service this week with
the ability to share purchase song to
the Google+ friends and tools for
independent artists to control their
music it's an ongoing war between
Android and Apple that won't end anytime
soon but a recent study from gartner
reveals that androids winning in
worldwide market share for their OS with
close to fifty three percent share for
the third quarter of 2011 and Apple at
fifteen percent but that's only part of
the story because Apple is winning when
it comes to the money race bringing in
more than half of the industries profits
at sixty-five percent and we all know
chatham makes a better
now both platforms want you to spend
more money consume content but is iTunes
Match really worth the $25 you put in
per year let's check it out hey guys
Brian song here with cnet com and we're
going to show you a first look at the
iTunes Match service that's finally been
launched by Apple now to get itunes
match first of all you got to download
the latest version of itunes and it's a
service for 2499 a year and you can turn
on iTunes Match by going into the store
menu now it will match your own personal
music collection with the same tracks on
the itunes store and then it'll also
upload your remaining songs that can't
be matched to the iCloud that allows you
to listen to your entire collection
anytime on your iOS devices plus you'll
also be able to use this service with up
to 10 iOS devices and computers total
and a maximum of five of those can be
computers now once the iTunes Match
service completes you'll be able to
either stream tracks to your computer by
playing them or click on the download
cloud icon to store them locally now
once they're downloaded the icon goes
away and the size of the file changes to
represent it's been downloaded locally
now if you don't have an internet
connection the iTunes Match music that's
not been downloaded will be grayed out
from your music list and you'll be
unable to access it until you have an
active internet connection now let's
jump over to our iOS devices I have my
iphone running the latest iOS 5 and i'll
go into my settings then music where i
can turn on iTunes Match on my phone
then jump into the music app and just
like in itunes you'll see your tracks
with a cloud icon next to each one now I
can select a song and the first play
behaves as if it's streaming but once it
downloads the entire song it will remain
on your phone and the cloud icon will
disappear you can also choose to
download an entire album instead of
selecting it track by track to your iOS
devices and the iTunes Match service
will also bring over all your playlists
so there's your first look at the iTunes
Match service it really delivers on
giving you access to your entire
collection on multiple devices but
you'll really have to decide if that's
where 2499 piscina com I'm Brian Tom
alright i can tell you that after using
it for three days my large music
collection still hasn't been completely
loaded different playlists from
different machines all combining into
one place that's annoying not all my
place we've been sinking it when iTunes
matches a track i have with multiple
versions of that song from different
albums on their store and then throws
them all in my library it's a mess so
bottom line is really not worth it to me
right now and it still needs to be
cleaned up some now in iOS news
according to german website Macker top
Apple's working on two separate software
updates they say five point 0 point two
should be coming no later than next week
and addresses more of the battery bugs
that haven't been resolved with apples
last five point Oh point one update and
iOS 5.1 will feature a significant
improvement to Siri with additional
commands for taking pictures turning on
or off services like Wi-Fi and Bluetooth
and also accepting my request for a date
which reminds me over the past few weeks
a lot of little things including the iOS
not update have been adding up and its
really worthy of throwing out a bad
apple you see a couple weeks ago Siri
completely goes down no one really
mentions it but that's ok because it's
still beta even though Apple is touting
it at the newest feature and selling
point for the iphone 4s then they
release the iOS 5 battery update but
only after a swarm of users say it has
only fix anything then they admit
there's still bugs dammit solved like
that battery issue and my favorite one
here we go guys apple offers a
replacement for 1st gen ipod nanos after
discovering or really finally admitting
the original model had the potential to
catch fire five years later now that
same model was exploding and setting on
fire for years but at least now we know
five years later I'm blowing and that's
a bad apple bad apple and bad apple and
all yalls now in product rumor news
sometimes made up
given time supports a small number of
components for the 15 inch ultra thin
macbook air will start shipping this
month and mass shipments of the finished
notebook will start moving in March of
2012 just in time to celebrate st.
Patrick's Day also didja Times reports
Apple is pulled back on its fourth
quarter orders for iPad to display
panels after they stocked up on parts
for q3 with the new ipad 3 Retina
Display parts for early 2012 now
everyone asked me is it's still a good
time to buy an ipad 2 and the answer is
absolutely yes five to six months away
from the last release is really a long
ways away and that's if you assume a new
one is coming then so it's a safe bet
right now now in a Nielsen survey ipad
ipod touch and iphone are the three most
desire to consumer products this holiday
season among kids ages 6 through 12 now
the iPad tops the list with forty-four
percent of little people thinking that
it's an affordable Christmas present and
no don't try to trick them into a kindle
fire because I have nieces and nephews
and they know so parents if you bend
your children's demands just accept the
fact that the only thing you'll be
buying yourself a Christmas are socks
and little nano socks that don't have
toes alright let's check out some quick
bites we know the iPhone 4 and 4s rank
is to the most fragile cell phones ever
but in a revealed apple pan they were
working on an inflatable shock mount
like an airbag to protect your screen
and obviously that didn't make it into
the final design the netflix app will be
getting a revamp on the ipad with
improvements for browsing searching and
watching TV shows and movies so it's
currently available on android tablets
and coming to the ipad soon Samsung and
Apple have also been going to added with
their patent battles which resulted and
Samsung having its galaxy 10.1 inch tab
banned in Germany so you know they made
a cosmetic change and added a silver
edge around it so now it looks like a
first gen ipad instead of an ipad 2 also
you guys want to check this out it might
not be the cleanest video we have but
it's really worth watching it may not
look like anything recognizable at first
but this is a live painting by artist
Aaron Kaiser who made a portrait
painting of steve jobs in six min
it's at the eleventh hour live music and
art show in Kentucky recently six
minutes I don't think I could do that in
six any things and we'll wrap things up
with more cool stuff it's winter time
snowboarding skiing season or in full
effect and the team at signal snowboards
created the first iPad snowboard they
call it the I shred the snow bird is
made from an aluminum base with its own
light up logo and iPad functionality
some pretty sweet stuff alright that's
going to do it for this we show send us
your emails to the Apple by to cnet com

see you guys next week for another bite
of the Apple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
