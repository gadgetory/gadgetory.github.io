about this 1699 Samsung freestanding gas
oven especially when you compare it to
other ovens it doesn't boil food super
fast it takes its sweet time to boil
burgers too and it's one of a relatively
few number of ranges that connects to
your Wi-Fi network so you can control
some functions through an app but
connectivity was just an extra feature
not essential so why did I end up
falling in love with this oven because
each of its individual features and
performance results added up to a great
overall product yes it's not the fastest
boiler but it's far from the slowest
we've ever tested and yes I got antsy
waiting for the Samsung to broil burgers
but the end result was a batch of the
juicy patties that made up for the wait
the best feature of this oven is its
Flex duo insert when you put this panel
in the oven it creates two separate
cooking cavities so you can cook let's
say a casserole on a chicken at
different temperatures in the same oven
and when you need the whole oven for
something big like a turkey you can just
remove the Flex duo until you're ready
to use it again I appreciate this
flexibility especially as oven use kicks
up into high gear over the holidays at
nearly 1700 dollars the samsung range is
more than you typically expect for a
free-standing gas stove but it's
dependable cooking performance and Flex
duo insert make this product a
worthwhile investment for your kitchen</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
