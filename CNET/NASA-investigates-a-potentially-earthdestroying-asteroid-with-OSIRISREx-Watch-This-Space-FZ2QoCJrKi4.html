towards Earth and there's a chance it
could hit our planet and destroy
everything we hold dear do you a send a
ragtag team of misfits to blow the thing
up in space or be send an asteroid
sample return mission on a seven-year
expedition to collect space rock
particles all in the name of scientific
research this is NASA so they're doing
the science thing I'm Claire I Lee
welcome to watch this space from the
Senate studios in Sydney this is your
weekly guide to everything on earth you
need to know about space and tonight
osiris-rex NASA's seven-year mission to
play tag with an asteroid for five
seconds the origins spectral
interpretation resource identification
security regular Explorer
yikes nasa is that to answer questions
that have plagued mankind for ages where
did we come from and what is our destiny
man this is gonna be one smart asteroid
osiris-rex is nasa's mission to learn
about the origins of our solar system by
picking up clues on an asteroid or as
NASA calls them the leftover debris from
the solar system formation process hold
on hold on this is a mission to dig out
leftovers we literally just landed in
sight on Mars and the Parker Solar Probe
is about to touch the Sun and we're
rooting around in the old casserole
parts of the solar system I mean NASA
even calls this asteroid an on planet
it's kind of like she doesn't even go
here am i right well no this mission is
actually kind of a big deal our solar
system was formed 4.5 billion years ago
when a giant cloud of gas and dust
collapsed in on itself imagine it like a
big cake mix the bulk of this cosmic
batter goes into making the big fancy
cake the Sun then the universe realized
it still has a bit of mixture left over
and remembered that delightful muffin
Tina got from aren't Glenda last
Christmas and so it divvied that up into
making the planets the stuff that was
leftover the raisins if you will because
no one should ever put raisins in a cake
those are the asteroids just like the
raisins in the back of your kitchen
covered those asteroids have remained
fairly unchanged for 4.5 billion years
so they could tell us a great deal about
the origins of the solar system and also
like the raisins in your cupboard the
asteroid osiris-rex is focusing on could
contain the precursors to the origin of
life seriously I need to clean
my kitchen cupboard so where is a Syrus
Rex heading well
after blasting off in September 2016 Oh
Rexy you're so sexy is heading to a
little carbonaceous asteroid about the
size of the Empire State Building
known as 101 955 venom it's a totally
normal nothing to see here
asteroid what's that oh oh the
Armageddon thing you know we should
probably mention that on an unrelated
note it's time for this week's segment
of will it kill me benno is hurtling
towards Earth and it's 100% definitely
gonna totally kill us all
maybe according to the center for near
Earth object studies Ben who is high up
on the Palermo technical impact hazard
scale that's basically the hot-or-not
rankings of how likely we are to get
completely obliterated by objects flying
towards us from space Ben who is ranked
at number two probably just after that
car that Elon Musk shot in the sky it's
probability of hitting Earth it's about
one in 2,700 right now so it's fairly
low on the Galactic death scale but on
the plus side you still have a bit of
time to prepare it's not gonna hit Earth
until 2175 if it does according to NASA
so there's no need to go buying
timeshares on Mars just yet I mean I
don't know why they called it a Cyrus
Rex naming it after the Egyptian god of
the afterlife if the asteroid wasn't
gonna kill us all anyway
osiris-rex arrived at Benner on December
3rd at 2018 according to NASA it's going
to spend almost a year surveying the
asteroid to find the most scientifically
interesting spot to collect its sample
but it will only make brief contact
fist-bump if you will to collect surface
samples in the hope that they will tell
us more about the origins of earth and
the history of our solar system because
just like your parents were into Jethro
Tull and fondue before you were even
born the solar system had a life before
we came along but because this is NASA
we're talking about they're not sending
a spacecraft 1.2 billion miles just to
collect a bunch of space dirt and shovel
it into a lunchbox first of all they
don't call it space dirt they call it
regolith fancy and Osiris Rex is going
to collect this regolith by playing tag
works kind of like a real game of tag
except slower and in space the
spacecraft will get up nice and close to
Benner and reach out with its touch and
go sample acquisition mechanism or
Tagg Sam tag Sam Venu
it's like those hipsters eat your coffee
place had twins and gave them the worst
possible names this arm will press down
onto the surface of the asteroid for
about five seconds
blowing nitrogen gas to rustle up some
dust and pebbles which will be collected
and stored in a Syrus Rex for the
journey home Syrus Rex has three chances
to collect between 60 grams and two
kilograms of regolith that's between two
ounces and four and a half pounds to
return to Earth after that NASA's team
of scientists will be able to study the
space dirt for clues about what was
happening in space 4.5 billion years ago
hope been who has lots of Secrets to
share after all this mission is all
about dishing the dirt on the origins of
the solar system alright that's it for

Reilly for Senate goodnight and Godspeed
I can just see them now tag Samms stay
away from the bagel station credenza
stop it
just be kind to Benner didn't Wylie had
children it was just so nice and
Brooklyn before all this musk you musk
you really I for one welcome the heat
death of the universe could not come
soon enough I'm over here now it's
flawless we haven't cheated this at all
and a totally different newsdesk we have
a multi camera setup not one person in a
room just try to lie with a green-screen
it's professional</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
