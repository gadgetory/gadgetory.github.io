delivery happens in the United States
and no it was not by amazon also even
though you're never going to be an
astronaut probably you can still tour
the ISS also a really awesome movie
that's coming from the oculus Studios
pretty soon hopefully cross your fingers
it's tomorrow daily
creating citizens in the internet
welcome to tomorrow daily the best geek
talk show in the known universe I'm
Ashley sceva that's kill anonymous I
windows kids it does Ted pay for your
solitaire oh man I can't believe this
it's not a story but let me just tell
you real quick I'm sorry have been my
like favorite non story um for for
Windows 10 if you want to play solitaire
you know the card game that you usually
get for free and you play alone yeah you
play alone um there they're gonna offer
it for free however it's gonna have ads
and have to pay to remove them two
dollars a month if you want them removed
a month or terminate there's there's a
there's a garret there's a little deal
okay so okay so ten dollars a year what
or ten dollars a year not forever I'm
offend two dollars a year so we're gonna
go maybe they're assuming listen pal
you're not gonna be alone forever
hopefully so you really only need to
reup this once a year and then you know
like oh if you just keep paying every
year if you if you're alone like that's
totally loneliness despite lonely I
don't listen you out there get out there
bub or else you're gonna be paying ten
bucks here for the rest of your life
spend those two dollars on someone that
you love or a real deck of cards plus
your headlines
alright so I didn't mean to be mean
about the never going to be an astronaut
thing but I've include myself in that
I'm never going to be an astronaut
unless they make it really easy to be an
astronaut which I don't see happening
like those online things job just like
become a minister yeah exactly the
universal life church starts a space
station that's what that's what I need
so I have great news if you've ever
wanted to visit the ISS and you're like
me you can now which is really awesome
the ESA the European Space Agency just
released unveiled launched whatever have
you this great tour interactive tour of
the ISS so Italian astronaut Samantha
Christopher Eddie has been was up there
for 199 days she broke a record for the
longest female stay up in the
international space station while she
was up there she took a ton of high res
pictures at least 15 in every single pod
cool they showed a ton of high res
pictures and they stitched them all
together into this awesome interactive
360-degree experience you can go to all
sorts of different places in the pod if
you click on the videos you can get
there's like text you can read about
different pieces of the International
Space Station there's even video like if
you see a little play button you can
check out like oh hey like what's this
and you say I want to check out what
this thing is and you can click on the
little play buttons and up pops a video
with Italian astronaut Samantha she is
talking about like what each thing is in
each pod like she'll explain what it is
it's really really cool i highly
recommend it's a great full screen
experience on your computer I the only
thing that isn't available yet is the
Russian pods at the International Space
Station oh but they did say the esa said
that those are hopefully all be
available later this year so they're
still working on that so this is while
it's in space then oh yeah this is no of
course this is she was up there she took
all these pictures and this is a stupid
question this is recent as of I believe
jun 2015 so last month so it's very very
recent she she always put great pictures
they got stitched together and and it's
it's so so cool and if you want to
educate yourself about the International
Space Station I mean
it's a fantastic way to do so and I love
whenever whenever the lovely samantha
christophe already is talking her hair
is raised because there's no grad
there's like very low gravity up there
so she's got like rage parents talking
about stuff so we're browse yeah yeah
yeah but yeah so really amazing stuff so
thank you esa cuz that's the way I'm
gonna get to experience the
International Space Station because
they'll never be no strong we're not
smart speaking of which I don't know how
that's that's not a transition oh that's
an Ashley s that's Ashley Ashley as
transition please okay so let's talk
virtual reality because that was almost
virtual reality there's your transition
there you go I I don't know if you guys
have been paying attention but oculus is
desperately trying to show that they are
not just a gaming device mm-hmm they're
trying to show that this could be open
up a whole new route for filmmakers and
why not have your second offering in
that sort of world be from someone that
used to work at Pixar that's pretty i
present to you Henry the story of a
little tiny porcupine he just loves hugs
but for some reason nobody wants to hug
him and he's had me hug something like
bikes that seems pretty pretty bad
exactly so this is from oculus story
studio this is the entertainment
division again this is about Henry a
little porcupine that loves to hug this
is made by ramiro lopez dois who is a
former Pixar animator you can definitely
see I can see some pics are in it yep
we'll get to the animation I mean the
actual animation I assume right that's
this is the this is the trailer so
they'll start off a little okay not with
the quick yeah you'll get somebody X
you'll get to me experiencing there you
go so there's some of the end there you
go yeah well you'll see a little bit
more in a living color here in a second
um but this will come with the rift when
you buy it and it's a little
experiencing and I and Ramiro says that
it really adds to the way either you're
engaging in the film because look I know
that if you haven't tried the oculus
it's really hard to understand why it's
such a cool device yeah living in this
world and like being able to experience
it with him a Romero says that it makes
him seem more real like a real creature
rather than having somebody giving you a
window it's more like you're actually
there so it's again and honestly here's
the thing
okay it's it's adorable it's super cute
and it's definitely the kind of thing
you'd want to be a part of there's been
a lot of hurdles as to how do we drop
someone in a world and make it feel like
they're part of it animations is the
perfect way to do it pretty good that's
pretty good way for you and a Pixar and
Pixar people seem to have a pretty good
grasp but I know he's not Pixar expert
sorry but ya know you should have to
wear that on his head um but let me let
me read this quote from from one of the
from palmer luckey at oculus ok so they
say they hope to have 10 to 20 bits of
content for rifters at lunch 10 to 20
movie ish type offering righteous things
like Angry to anybody that buys an
oculus rift and I think that is a great
strategy very smart cuz a lot of these
headsets launched with almost nope
almost nothing well and also I mean you
made the point earlier which is it's so
hard to explain to somebody what oculus
is and how cool it is in VR in general
like how amazing it is until you try it
for yourself and then you go oh I get it
yeah the moment happens the light bulb
goes on as soon as you experience
something that you're invested in
engaged in and that's a great way to
have people say oh hey mom like I know
you won't like this first-person shooter
but check out this cute little video of
a headshot like having all these
different types of content is a really
great way to sort of demo it to your
friends it's a great way to show people
what these headsets can do and so for it
everybody loves Pixar everybody loves
pixar everybody I mean and even if you
have you know maybe then you have like a
tour of the Louvre and you have this and
you have this and you have all these
different little pieces that suit
somebody's life style or suit someone's
personality to say oh this is why I need
a rift not for gaming but for Pixar
films or I need a riff for tours like
international touring like I want to go
do that in virtual reality like it's a
great way to hook people and to get
people to share their oculus rift
experiences with others which is exactly
what they want so really really smart
I'm or so think it's it's important that
they have content when it comes out
because again every other headset didn't
sell crazy we had nothing but again yeah
branchy
out having more than just video games is
great because you know maybe my sister
doesn't want to play video games on the
VR exactly you suck sister do though
anyway so that brings us to our hashtag
in a day which I will not allow my
sister to answer which is hashtag TD
Henry question is what's the plot of
your blockbuster VR movie you get to
make a VR movie what is the plot of that
I know pins gonna write a little novel
about this pant I bet you panels just
send us his screenplay my coby i care is
my script so I want mine to be kind of
like um almost like a telltale kind of
games but okay I'm just been falling
back into fallout which is it's a it's
kind of a choose your own adventure type
thing where it can kind of veer up so
it's like a movie but I get to kind of
control the ending like it goes
different places okay so I totally like
that's almost exactly what I was being
not a telltale Game but an actual like
Ed packard choose your own adventure
book that would be awesome so a simple
concept of like going into a haunted
house but then like ending up in some
other dimension or stuff like that is
the thing that I want to do like so I
would take I would adapt a choose your
own adventure book like directly into a
VR experience yeah but I like this
telltale 12 where you have like kind of
an arc of story and and it's a story but
then everyone reacts you differently
based on your actions and your words
like maybe you've heads that talk to the
characters that would be really cool
yeah I could see people getting a more
engaged into it because the problem with
VR is you have to get people engaged in
the world I can feel a part of it and
that's sort of extra I'm choosing the
story will just suck you in even more
yeah well that's why people love those
telltale games because they get to
choose which is I mean that's such a
hook because people you're a point click
ladies okay so yeah that's I'm all about
it um okay let's talk about drone
delivery this is awesome it wasn't
amazon i was shocked to read this the
very first legal drone delivery happened
calm down Kevin McCallister I the first
legal drama delivery happened in the US
and it wasn't amazon is actually NASA
working with a bunch of other companies
private companies and this and this
startup drone delivery company called
flirty and they use to drones to do this
this is a test run in Virginia they did
they had a very large drone that was a
modified version of a NASA drone that
had to go from one airport to the other
because flirt ease drones are short
distance drone delivery drones oh so
there it is delivering a package of
medical kit right down onto the ground
so there it goes we right on target I
don't know that they had like a like a
little landing pad or anything but I
think they had an area they knew they
could drop to tart the item into um so
they okay they had six medical kits and
they were like we're gonna do six trips
six separate trips and we're going to do
tests every single time but the great
news is guys the first two trips went so
well and so smoothly that they decided
on the third trip but you know what
forget it let's just pack all four of
the rest of the medical kits into the
drone and deliver them and also that
went very smoothly Oh didn't have any
issues there was no terrible explosions
or immune malfunctions there was nothing
bad that happened and so yeah it went
very very well and they were saying
especially with things like this like
medical kits there are a lot of regional
areas where people have to drive on you
know one-lane roads to get to certain
like to get to places and maybe they
need emergency services like let's say
you know you have a hurricane like
hurricane sandy go through rural areas
in the country need medical equipment
quickly and a lot of times these service
vehicles it they have a tough time
getting through now that's a good use
for delivery drone I agree and so Amazon
actually had a very interesting
proposition like related to this Amazon
proposed recently that they want to make
a sort of delivery drone highway in the
sky and they would do that by
designating a a section of airspace
lower than you would see a standard
plane flying in and and also just larger
crafts 200 to 400 feet above the ground
so that would be the area in which
Amazon's delivery drones would be able
to just deliver stuff and no nothing
could fly in that space unless it was
approved by amazon this is like their
idea this is not actually going to
happen I don't see this I don't see I
don't see the united states of america
going yeah let's just give 200 to 400
feet above the air everywhere except
above to Amazon like I don't see that
the Amazon layer p amazon lane and so so
Amazon error was saying oh yeah we want
to have this like zone and then we'd
have a buffer between 400 and 500 feet
where nothing could fly and then it
would keep smaller craft safe from
bigger crafts and vice versa so
interesting idea that they want to they
have they think that the way forward for
delivery drones is sort of this kind of
highway section of sky at a certain
altitude above the ground so we'll see
but I mean it's again so many
regulations like rules new things need
to start happening with unmanned aerial
vehicles especially with companies and
people like I'm act like that you keep
tying amazon back into this because
amazon is doing it for amazon course
they are but the thing is is private
corporations a lot of times push
innovation in terms of because of
capitalism they want a bunch of money so
they're like how can we make more money
let's deliver via drone and so they're
really leading they're one of the
leaders in the push for drone delivery
yeah so you can't deny them that but I
will deny that I don't want to look up
in the sky here I dream I for the for
the like medical supplies grace send
somebody emergencies I love all this I
like the idea of our organ yeah like the
patient organ donation like you get from
one hostel the other you don't have to
sit in traffic you can you don't have to
pay for a helicopter to airlift it they
can just get there like that would be
great but I don't know about this like
I'm sorry everybody I don't need my
phone mount for my car to come via drone
like not yet I mean I haven't gotten to
that point where i'm like i need drone
delivery like I just don't I look they
deliver on sundays isn't that enough
everybody isn't that enough Sunday's
empirical all right on that note we're
gonna watch a big rig leap over uh we're
gonna watch a jump it's insane it set a
world record it's really cool we'll be
right back it's smart daily
haha
welcome back to the show uh kill do you
have do you get out of bed early in the
morning dew you'd like enjoy getting up
early you don't strike me as the kind of
person who just love it card I wish I
wish I did when I was normal yeah
yeah tell me how I can fix that well you
can definitely fix that with this week's
Mod Squad so it's a guy on YouTube his
name's Colin Furze he's an inventor's
builder made some really cool stuff and
now maybe I'm not gonna say he's crossed
the line because I think this is
hilarious but i also have wily coyote
amount visions in my head this is a
catapult bed he made a catapult bed to
launch you out it's yeah he says it's
very low pressure he doesn't want to
blow you through the roof or anything
like that it's got a big steel frames
got a giant hinge on it you see there's
a headboard there space for a headboard
there's an air compressor underneath it
was just knock you right out knock you
right out of bed then push you right out
of there so he built this whole thing
and he's like yeah okay here it is like
it works the frameworks he was testing
the frame that was what the video is
it's him building the frame and now as
of tomorrow if all things go according
to plan supposedly Colin will be posting
an actual like video of a full bed like
he's gonna put a mattress in there and
I'm assuming he's gonna test it out I
mean I'd ask a friend to test it if that
was me I wouldn't he's being nice about
it being nice about it this guy needs to
build stuff for the Acme corporation
like right like this seems like a bed at
Wiley coyote we're like goofy would
sleep goofy exactly exactly where he has
a problem getting up out of bed and then
finally is like he is the launch amount
of the books like it just slide you out
of the bed so there's that yeah and it
also has a blue warning light that
flashes like when you're like say your
alarm goes off is you a blue warning
light flashes like hey bro like get up
or else no no that Urraca the problem is
getting up in time to get that to get
out of the way yeah maybe that's the
dangerous thing so I thought that was
really funny and really calling out with
super brief like but very entertained by
it thought I tomorrow tomorrow
supposedly I'll go over to Colin Furze f
you are ze let's all go all
over to Colin Furze his youtube page and
watch the demo because he says he's
gonna upload it tomorrow okay so right
there you have it but now let's go from
Ubik 60 you might actually see somebody
get launched in outer space who knows
maybe there will be a malfunction
alright guys now we got to talk about
you it's time for user feedback we asked
everybody to use the hashtag TV nu AI to
think of nice things autonomous robots
could do for us as opposed to weapons
because everyone so scared of killer
robots and mine was to replace it would
replace me yes and that would be great
that would be sooo I would like from him
maybe just have a robot drive me around
that would be a nice autonomous room but
I'm gonna get that anyway self-driving
cars so Oliver wrote in and said I would
make a robot cat so it would be a ninja
cat name would become kills pit whoa yes
Oliver thinking about kale will wilt
writes in and says hey I teachers
tailoring curriculum to maximize how
much each person learns more smart
people equals less problems and
innovation not less innovation more
innovation less problems more innovation
they say Las innovation he's just said
less problems more or less problems and
innovation so I think he meant oh oh
yeah yeah I don't think you meant less
good thing about I got what you were
saying Rick wrote in and said the AI
should watch all the game of thrones and
walking dead episodes and predict which
character would die next hahaha shoutout
to kale and honest oh yeah what's up
yeah you I don't know if I'd want to
know I don't was gonna die next cuz I be
scared I wouldn't want to know the odds
the percentages like you know there's
people who'd even had a bet man yeah
you're a betting man that'd be a good
one you want to know the odds you're
like all right I'm gonna go down to go
down to my local bookie and put money
down on you know sons of winning the
game of thrones like I wonder if you
could do that I'm sure you can Dustin
wrote in lastly says the best use I can
think of for new AI is of course an
autonomous pizza delivery drone that you
don't tip whoo and you keep the dude
maybe the drone was made a pizza to just
eat it thanks drone I sound like edible
drones like send it over it's made of
chocolate but you can only fly it when
it's cold outside of the residuals Mel
the sky Oh Toby the worst all right guys
it's time for our very last these user
feedback which is always our phone tog
refer the day so we didn't spend a lot
of time on Mod Squad but that's because
this is a little bit of a longer email
but he describes the location age of the
picture of so well that I want it so
this is from Joshua and he took this
with his sony xperia m2 and he says
Mabuhay hello Ashley kale and the
awesome crew of tomorrow daily my name
is Joshua from the Philippines and I
would like to share with you my photos
of our church and hopefully be
considered as phone down for the day i'm
using my sony xperia m2 LTE this is the
Mary Immaculate parish in Las Pinas City
located in the southern part of Manila
in the Philippines it's also known as
the nature church because the
architecture and the surrounding
surroundings full of thick palm trees
and plants we're gonna get a little
history lesson here let's hear it this
roman catholic church was built in
nineteen eighty six using a roof made
made of kogan and 40,000 footstool palm
leaves chairs pues made from typhoon
filled star apple trees straps and logs
kneelers made from flat pieces of wood a
patchwork stone flooring and wooden
slabs mingling with pebble wash out and
from above is a dove lantern made of
windowpane oyster shells flying from the
fringes on the center of the ceiling
illuminating the church by night also
there's a mini chapel located behind
this rock cave and adoration hall once
you enter you fill the privacy solemnity
and the spiritual silence been an avid
fan or show since episode one keep up
the good work and God bless Cheers
Joshua so that's the trick that's a
church that is a straight place that is
a location of worship that's beautiful
Wow more people go to church if it was
in a place like that Oh Mike people take
vacations to places like that book rooms
at that church book a book a resort stay
that's an incredible thing that you for
sharing and making a little bit more
history we very like we're like both
sides yeah the coins so I like stories I
like stories about places UK I mean I'll
take I'll take all of it it's great if
you want to submit your font ography and
maybe a little story of your own you can
email us tomorrow at cnet com you can
always find us on social media as well
