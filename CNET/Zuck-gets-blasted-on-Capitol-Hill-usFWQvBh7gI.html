the name of the hotel you stayed in last
night no if you've messaged anybody this
week would you share with us the names
of the people you've messaged senator no
I would probably not choose to do that
publicly here I think that maybe what
this is all about your right to privacy
the limits of your right to privacy and
how much you give away in modern America
in the name of quote connecting people
around the world Facebook and other
online companies will not or cannot fix
the privacy invasions then we are going
to have to we the Congress how can
American consumers trust folks like your
company to be caretakers of their most
personal and identifiable information
well what happened here was in effect
willful blindness it was heedless and
reckless which in fact amounted to a
violation of the FTC consent decree
would this relates to the issue of
transparency and the relationship of
trust informing the user about what you
know in terms of how their personal
information has been misused and I'm
also concerned that when you personally
became aware of this did you or senior
leadership do an inquiry to find out who
at Facebook had this information and did
they not have a discussion about whether
or not the users should be informed back
in December of 2015
senator in retrospect I think we clearly
viewed as a mistake that we didn't
inform people and we did that based on
false information that we thought that
the case was closed and that the data
had been deleted so there was a decision
made on that basis not to inform the
users is that correct
that's my understanding yes okay and
what I in retrospect I think that was a
mistake
and knowing what we know now we should
have handled a lot of things here
differently</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
