and this is a battle for one of these
things is not like the other it's a
prize 5-foot shout between Microsoft
Surface pro 3 and Apple's MacBook Air
13-inch 2014 edition now Microsoft threw
down the hammer with a direct comparison
so we're putting it to the test our
judges for this fight are senior editor
Dan the man after man
senior associate editor Joe The Big Show
Kaminsky and Brian
ringa linga ding dong we'll take all
three judges blind scores and average
them out to the nearest tenth each round
the final prize by score will be an
average of all rounds using the same
system let's get it on
round 1 is design Microsoft brings it's
edgy and modern design with the slimmest
Core i5 PC ever made that weighs 1.76
pounds without the keyboard case it's
the power of a laptop in a tablet form
it feels like a premium device but the
kickstand still doesn't sit on your lap
comfortably and its form factor is great
as a tablet but just okay as a laptop
now the MacBook Airs design is classic
and iconic with its aluminum unibody
weighing in at two point nine six pounds
it's smooth hinge allows you to open it
with ease but let's be honest this
design hasn't changed for years
it feels dated and we've said it over
and over that getting a thinner bezel
around the screen should be a priority
both designs impress but they can also
be better we're calling this a tie at
four points apiece
round two is features
the surface pro 3 stands out with its
2160 by 1440 screen resolution
touchscreen
that pops compared to the airs 1440 by
900 display it's the most flexible
portable with a kickstand and a keyboard
cover with the responsive trackpad that
really feels comfortable to use plus a
stylus for drawing and sketching this
truly allows you to use it the way you
want it's also compatible with Windows
software and the Windows 8 app store you
might look at this as a dual experience
that can be jarring at times especially
when you have to go into the desktop
version to tweak some settings but if
you're looking at the surface pro you
know what you're getting yourself into
now Apple is still kept the MacBook Air
pretty simple and straightforward and
it's lack of a 1080p screen as a glaring
omission with today's competition both
systems include backlit keyboard HDMI
out with a mini DisplayPort adapter
SD card slots 802 11 AC and Bluetooth
4.0 Microsoft takes this round with the
4.3 and Apple gets a 3 so after
averaging two rounds Microsoft leads
round three is performance
we're facing off a surface pro 3 with a
1.9 gigahertz core i5 processor with 8
gigs of RAM versus a MacBook Air with a
1.4 gigahertz core i5 with 4 gigs of ram
now the proof is in the pudding and in
our CNET's performance test Apple's
MacBook Air performed better in the
handbreak multi media multitasking test
and it also performed better in the
iTunes encoding test but the surface pro
3 outperformed the air in our Photoshop
cs5 imaging process test now it's
impressive that Microsoft didn't
sacrifice performance for tablet but
Apple gets the slight edge here with the
4.3 and the surface pro gets a 4 next
round is battery life battery life has
always been a Forte when it comes to
Apple's laptops specifically the air
Microsoft made valiant improvements to
the surface pro 3 and in CNET's video
battery drain test we were able to
squeeze out 7 hours and 28 minutes of
juice but this is where the MacBook is
in rarified air and in our battery drain
test we were able to get a whopping 16
hours and 26 minutes of apple juice it's
truly an all-day device and the MacBook
Air gets a perfect 5 and the surface pro
3 gets a 3 drops are a between four
rounds Apple has taken the lead the
final round that decides at all values
the surface pro 3 starts at $7.99 if
you're willing to go with the core i3
processor we're not but a core i5 with
128 gigs of storage starts at $9.99 the
same price as the entry-level 13-inch
air and the type cover is 129 so your
total cost comes in at 1120 eight
dollars before any other additions now a
13-inch air has gone down $200 in the
past two years and starts at $9.99 it's
arguably the best money that you can
spend on a dedicated laptop at that
price today so it's really the
versatility of the surface pro that
you're paying for and really they should
include the keyboard in that price but
in the final round
our judges give the MacBook Air a 4.7
and the surface pro gets a three point
seven so let's average out all five
rounds and in a throwdown where the
surface pro took an early lead
Apple fought back with its performance
and battery life taking this battle for
point two to three point eight and the
MacBook Air 13-inch 2014 edition is your
prize winner
now don't let the store tell the whole
story we're fans of the surface pro 3
it's come a long way and its versatility
makes it a truly unique product but
comparing these categories it's still
the air that reigns supreme
I'm Brian Tong's thanks for watching I
will catch you guys next time for
another prizefight</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
