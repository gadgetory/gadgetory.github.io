Morris and it's time to get loaded bad
news for the sony playstation network

hacked and more than 70 million
customers have been susceptible to
having their information exposed sony
warned its users that their name
addresses email and birthday could have
been accessed when the playstation

unauthorized person between April
seventeenth and April nineteenth they
don't think credit card information was
taken but they are still investigating

for nearly a week since this intrusion
was discovered if you are a PSN user
your best bet for now is not to panic
wait until sony unveils more information
but also do change all of your passwords

contract and run android 2.3 Gingerbread
