tech tips
we're finally shaking off winter and
heading into spring this is
traditionally the time where people tidy
things up so why stop at your house
here's how to tidy up your tech life and
number five clean up your hard drive
it's amazing how quickly big drives can
get filled up if you want to know where
all your space went both Mac OS and
Windows 10 have built-in tools to help
on Mac OS click the Apple menu then
about this Mac hit the storage tab then
manage you will see a breakdown of
what's on your Mac on Windows 10 head
into settings then system and storage
there you can turn on storage sense
which will automatically delete
unnecessary files and number 4
unsubscribe from those promotional
emails that you don't want you can do it
manually by searching your email for the
word unsubscribe and then go through
each piece of email or you could use a
service like enroll me which will search
through your emails and let you quickly
get rid of those annoying promo emails
unrolled out me can send you a digest
version of the promo emails you want to
keep so you just get one email instead
of many number 3 check out which apps
have access to your Google account the
fastest way to get there is by going to
my account Google comm on the left side
click apps for the count access from
there click manage apps on the right
side here you'll see what apps can
access your Google account and how much
access they have you can do a quick
search for full access to see what apps
can do anything with your Google account
get rid of whatever you're not using
number to check your social permissions
head on over to Facebook hit settings
that hit apps here you can see all the
different places you've logged in using
Facebook you can disconnect your
Facebook account from all those services
you never use in my case my Facebook
account was still linked to vine
remember vine you can do the same thing
with Twitter by going into settings and
clicking apps you can revoke access to
all kinds of things like AOL lifestream
or Windows Phone the number one
spring-cleaning tech tip is it's time to
delete some apps from your phone if
you're running iOS 11 head to settings
then general then storage you'll have
the option to offload unused apps below
that you'll see which apps are using up
the most
space and when you last used the app on
a Samsung phone head to Settings device
maintenance then tap storage you'll see
where your space went tapping apps will
bring you a list of apps that appears to
be sorted by how often you use the app
rarely used apps are at the top for
those of you who are hesitant to delete
any of your apps because you never know
when you'll need them again here's a
bonus tip take those questionable apps
and put them in a folder marked delete
in a month set a calendar reminder to
tell you to check the folder in one
month if you haven't used it by then
maybe it's time to delete that out oh
and one more thing before we go you
probably also want to clean off your
phone because it probably goes with you
everywhere and I mean everywhere
