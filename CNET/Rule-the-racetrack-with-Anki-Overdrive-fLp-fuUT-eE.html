smart racecars I'm Dan Ackerman and
we're taking a look at Anki overdrive
now if you've heard of Anki before
that's because they brought out an
earlier version of this system at one of
apple's WWDC conference back in 2013 and
they showed you an iphone controlling a
race car going around the track very
cool stuff but it was one static track
sort of a first generation toy this new
version works with iOS and with Android
still has the same sort of remote
control cards that you steer with your
iPhone or your Android phone the big
difference now is the track is
completely modular you can buy this
starter kit here for about 150 dollars
that includes two cars a charger for the
cars and a bunch of different tracks you
can buy extra track pieces and you just
put them together like this they snap
together magnetically and then you can
take them apart and put it back together
any way you want there's all sorts of
shapes you can make now hidden under the
pattern here is some code that the car
seat you can't see it but the car seat
and that lets the electric eye on the
cars see where the track is stay on the
track and not go flying off anywhere so
you don't do too much of the steering
the cars do that automatically when
you're using the iPhone app what you do
is you shift the cars from one side to
the other you can control whether on
this side or this side like this and
also acceleration but it's going faster
or slower go around a turn too fast you
could zoom right off and of course the
cars you can get up to four of them
going at once they can race against each
other they have weapons built-in that
you basically use by tapping a button on
the app and that causes the other cars
nearby to sort of short out or spin out
of control or get damaged so you can zip
past them you don't actually see them
shooting at each other in real life
maybe that's the next version of Augie
set up is super easy especially when it
comes to putting the tracks together
getting the app going and solving all
the phone's that you're gonna use and
getting everybody into a game together
that's a little bit more complicated a
little bit of a learning curve there you
know I feel like most of the time you're
gonna want to skip most of the game
modes and just do straight free racing
with your friends that seems like what
this is built for now if you want to get
more involved with this and get
everybody playing and build a very
elaborate track a little bit of an
investment is involved this base kit
here is 150 dollars you can buy extra
track kits
they break down to about $10 per section
of track and you get two cars here if
you want to buy more cars there are a
couple more available there forty-nine
dollars each but once you put it all
together you get everybody round race
around the pool table like we did that
is the Anki overdrive</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
