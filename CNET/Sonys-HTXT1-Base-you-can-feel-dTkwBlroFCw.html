many years a new style of speaker has
recently emerged which lets you place
your TV on top of it solving the
blocking issue of some sound bars these
new sound stands tend to be inexpensive
and if they're like the sony HT xt-1
surprisingly well featured hi I'm tai
penile brief from cnet.com the Sony HD
XD one is a $300 sound stand which comes
with a lot of features including three
HDMI inputs most sound bars only have
optical inputs and having HDMI means it
can also decode the high-res Dolby and
DTS sound tracks from blu-ray discs this
will also replay your TV sound with the
one cable as well as do video
pass-through for older systems the stand
also has optical and analog inputs this
sony has Bluetooth and NFC so if you
have a compatible phone you can touch it
to the stand to instantly pair it for
music playback meanwhile the remote
control is simple and offers more
functions if you slide open the bottom
the speaker features two subwoofers
underneath the unit and two oval woofers
on the front and claims to have up to
170 watts of power for such an
inexpensive system it can definitely
fill a room and without distortion music
quality is the best with a clean
slightly forward sound movies art is
good but definitely better sound than
you get out of a TV with a real thump
during action scenes and clear dialogue
if you're looking to upgrade your TV
sound quickly and easily then the Sony
HD xd1 is a pretty easy set and forget
system with good sound and useful
features for the price this has been ty
Pendlebury foreseen it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
