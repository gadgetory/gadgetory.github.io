2011 Consumer Electronics Show and I'm
taking a first look at the Toshiba
tablet this is Toshiba's Android tablet
and if it looks rather big you're right
it is this is 10.1 inches diagonally
it's also a really sturdy tablet you
want to keep in mind toshiba is known
for their really really sturdy and hefty
laptops well this is no different the
back has this easy grip technology so it
feels like something that has a little
bit more substance to it doesn't feel
like it's gonna break in your back I'm
told that this is replaceable so if you
wanted one say in pink or chartreuse if
that is your preference you could
replace these switch these out so it's a
bit more customizable it also has a user
replaceable battery now it does have two
cameras one in the back that's 5
megapixels and then one in the front
that's 2 megapixels so you really want
to do video chatting that's an option it
does have flash on its browser so you
have the full gamut of the Internet to
watch at your disposal this is running
honeycomb that's Google's Android
operating system it also has here the
ability to connect to anything over USB
and has HDMI out so you can take this
content and send it to a TV or a
computer if you'd like and it also has
many USB as well it also has something
called resolution plus that means it
takes standard def video and makes it
look hi-def this is a Wi-Fi only version
but Toshiba tells me that they will have
one out later with cellular connectivity
either 3G or 4G but we don't know when
yet we just know that this version will
come out in the first half of 2011 and
they said it will be priced
competitively with the iPad so I'm
thinking
five hundred dollars that we're not sure
yet we'll know that later in the year
again I'm Natali Morris for cnet.com the
2011 Consumer Electronics Show and you
just took a first look at the Toshiba
tablet</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
