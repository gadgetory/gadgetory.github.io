2013 and one company here has a cool
concept to show they're called the eye
tribe and what they're trying to show is
that your tablet of the future or even
your smartphone can be controlled by
your eyes they have I tracking software
that they have installed in tablets here
I have a Windows 8 tablet that they
attached a device to with infrared
sensors and an infrared camera now this
attachment is just one way of getting
there soft words work but they've even
hacked another tablet here to show that
it's really easy for device makers to
install this technology in their future
tablets they're selling it as cheap
technology that could probably enhance
the experience of your next tablet that
you buy in a year or two years to get it
started first you have to calibrate with
the software by looking and following
the dot once that's done you get started
by doing applications such as scrolling
or plain fruit ninja yeah that's right I
can now control fruit ninja with my eyes
I tribe is showing that for the first
time this technology could be for the
mass market normally if you wanted I
tracking software it can cost you ten
thousand or thirty thousand dollars for
something here this is something that
manufacturers can add into their future
tablets for pretty cheap Christina I'm
Bridget Carey here at CES 2013 with
software from the I try</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
