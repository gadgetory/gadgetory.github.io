LG's booth at CES talking about LG home
chat this is the new SMS based
communication system LG's announced for
its home appliances it's not out just
yet coming out towards the end of the
year it is that you can send text
messages to your appliances and sort of
interact with them control them maybe
get some food list some recipes going on
it's kind of a more convenient home
automation setup then you find a lot of
smart appliances currently seems pretty
cool so one example is you can look at
the ingredients in your fridge see what
you have and then find a recipe and then
send those cooking instructions to your
stove so if we type in food list we'll
see we have some stuff here so LG
suggested we tried dessert recipe we can
do that never have a few options for
using those ingredients that it found so
release details for home chatter still
kind of up in the air LG saying the end
of the year it might roll out to current
gen smart think appliances maybe the
next gen though so that's cool to note
that maybe some more smart think applies
to come in our way later in 2014 there's
also still in development LG says might
be adding more natural language commands
making a little bit more intuitive to
interact with home chat I'm rich brown
this is LG home chat here at CES
