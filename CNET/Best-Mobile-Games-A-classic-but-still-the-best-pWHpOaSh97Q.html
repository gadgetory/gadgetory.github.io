kid went down to bring me to the races
hello everyone i'm jason parker and
today we're going to be looking at real
racing 3 now this is not a new game it's
actually an old game that's been around
for a couple of years now but it is so
good and it's one of the best racing
simulators in the app store right now it
is free-to-play cost you nothing to get
started this was one of the earliest
freemium games where they charge you for
just about anything and everything but
if you have a careful strategy you can
play this whole game without paying a
cent you know some hitting the gas pedal
on the right side on the left is my
break when I need it but you'll notice
that there are a ton of cars here
believe there are 22 cars at once right
now you might notice I am racing the
McLaren but there are tons of officially
licensed cars from all the manufacturers
she could race Ferraris Lamborghinis
Mercedes Porsches you name it every car
can be upgraded the engine the drive
train the body suspension exhaust brakes
tires and wheels there are all different
classes that you can race in each class
has these different challenges and then
each challenge has all of these races
that include time trials and drag racing
and speed snaps and all kinds of things
and also if you want customization this
game is absolutely crazy look at the
different paint kinds and you can put
shapes on there and you can move those
around switch your rims to all these
different kinds all these will cost you
in the beginning you'll just have one
car to race with and when that goes in
for service then you're out of luck but
later on once you have like three or
four cars you'll find that you know once
one goes into service you can just bring
out another car and keep racing so I
think the freemium model is it's not as
bad as other games there are tons of
arcade racers whether it's like big
crashes and weaponry and things like
that this is just pure racing and I
think it's the best in the app store
even after all this time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
