Lucia mirror now this is one of a kite
or boat drive so first let's unbox it
here we go this is the drive itself but
there's more in here we have this very
nice wooden base the USB cable and
there's even more that's right over here
we have the carrying pouch and a
cleaning cloth now the first question is
do we need all of this accessory the
answer is yes we do and here's why first
the drive is covered completely in
Corning Gorilla Glass and that means
when you look at it you see yourself and
the base here make looking at yourself
very convenient and secondly take a look
here if you hold the drive for a little
bit it gets very messy because the
entire surface of Drive here is a
fingerprint and don't supermagnet so the
carrying pouch right here is to keep
your dirty hand off of it and the
cleaning cloth free to clean it or
better yet just leave it on the base and
never touch it again let's say that it
makes the drive here to demonstrate the
idea that in this day and age the data
we have reflect who we are to take that
too literally though because the drive
here reflects anyone or anything and not
just the owner now the mirror here
support USB 3.0 and in my testing was
quite fast with the sustain speed of
some hundred megabyte per second for
writing and more than hundred and ten
per second for reading it also work with
USB 2.0 and support Windows and Mac and
include very helpful and software but
the prize are gonna bother you at $280
it is on the most expensive 1 terabyte
drive on the market and for more this
one here check out my full review at
cnet.com and I'm not sure who gonna need
this one but if you don't like it maybe
you just self-conscious I look at it I
see myself clear and true and I like it
very much and that's because I'm don't
know and this has been the first look at
the low C mirror poor bowdry
