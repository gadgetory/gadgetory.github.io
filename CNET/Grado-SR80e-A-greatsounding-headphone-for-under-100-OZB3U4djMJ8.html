version of its sr 80 prestige series on
your open back headphone it replaces the
SR ATI and at $99 it's easily among the
best sounding headphones you can get for
under $100 hi I'm David karna and
welcome to another CNET headphone video
review as you can see Grado has not
changed the exterior design of the
headphone and like its SR 80
predecessors for an on-ear style
headphone it's quite comfortable and
relatively lightweight in fact we found
this models black foam pads more
comfortable than the $295 SR 325 ease
Bowl pads that apply more pressure to
the outer edges of your ears my only
complaint about the design of this
headphone is the plug it's very sturdy
but with more people using their
smartphones as music playback devices
Grado would have ideally made it more
case friendly as it stands you may have
to take off your case to plug this
headphone into your smartphone's
headphone jack Grado didn't totally
change the sound for the new e-series
but sree is a definite upgrade from the
previous series sound this model is more
laid-back and the bass is fuller and
deeper that adds up to a smoother tonal
balance before so when we compared the
SRA Te with the older but more expensive
SR 225 eye headphones the SRA TE sweeter
sound had plenty of detail along with
the deeper more powerful bass we also
noted that we can listen to this
headphone at fairly quiet volume levels
without losing much detail audio
Technica's ATH m50x makes more bass but
thanks to the SR ADEs open back design
its stereo imaging was more spacious and
natural sounding than that Audio
Technica model which has a closed back
design the biggest downside to open back
designs is they don't block external
noise so the SR a de won't be ideal for
travellers or anyone listening in noisy
environments we've long been fans of
grado headphones that are really
impressed by the quality of the sound
you get from this new $99 model if you
don't need the isolation of a
is back design or built-in microphone
for cell phone calls it's a great
headphone for the money I'm David Carr
