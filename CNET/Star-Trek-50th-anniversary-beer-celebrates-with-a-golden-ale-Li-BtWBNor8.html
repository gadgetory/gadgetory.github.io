I'm here with Dan Curie from schmaltz
Brewing Company and we are here at the
gas I'm Tavern in time for San Diego
comic-con with the Star Trek 50th
anniversary golden ale yeah tell me
about the health of the inscription of
his beer sure so our 50th anniversary
gold now is the second beer in our line
of Star Trek beers in the spring we
launched our Vulcan red session IPA
which was a beautiful amber kind of a
really multi red session IPA for this
summer we wanted to really do something
in conjunction with the 50th anniversary
of Star Trek Smeltz Brewing Company
we're celebrating our 20th anniversary
of this summer so anniversaries to us
are very important we wanted to really
kind of feature the golden idea of the
emblem behind Star Trek so we figured a
golden pal L would be the perfect beer
to match with that the the recipe behind
the actual beer was created by one of
our head Brewers drew Schmidt shout out
to drew one of his favorite episodes of
Star Trek growing up was the trouble
with tribbles episode so in that episode
a lot of Star Trek fans will be familiar
with the fact they were delivering
quadrotriticale on the enterprise which
was supposed to be a super super grain
that could kind of grow anywhere and it
doesn't exist yet here in our measly
2016 but we do have triticale that's
really been a fun beer to brew with it's
a hybrid grain between barley and rye
gives the beer a really nice kind of
spicy pepperiness on the back end and
then the hops that we've used for the
beer galaxy Aurora Admiral some comet
hops all have kind of a galactic tie-in
and they give it a nice sweet fruitiness
up top which really really balances well
with that peppery finish and Hugh's
mother decoration you guys have yeah
these are our triple sniffles are
creating a little noise don't you give
this fear a quick shot it's the pale out
Cheers mine
yeah so that's what nice pale ale some
like lights flavors but really really a
little bit sweet I liked that bit of a
pepperiness to yeah so again the
sweetness is going to come from some of
those fruity characteristics of the hot
spring out but like you said on the back
end it evolves into this kind of spicy
pepperiness but all subtle it's a five
percent beer you know the flavors are
subtle super drinkable super sessionable
just really nice smooth american-style
pale ale and where can you find the beer
all over if you're down here at Camp
comic con man I mean we've got a whole
list that I could read off to you if you
need me to but bars here and in and out
the area will have it on draft all week
so you know if you're down here at
comic-con keep your eye out have a pint
and cheers to Star Trek and schmaltz
brewing company yet all right and thank
you so much for your time yep thank you
guys for joining us they can here at
