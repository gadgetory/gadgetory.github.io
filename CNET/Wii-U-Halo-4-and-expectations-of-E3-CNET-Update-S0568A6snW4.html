looking to Venus and pondering iPhone
popularity I'm Bridget Carey and this is
your scene at update I've seen it we are
gearing up for III the Electronic
Entertainment Expo the big video game
conference of the year I'm so excited
I'm even wearing my sonic belt buckle to
honor the occasion seek it even spends
starting Monday we'll be hearing from
Microsoft who will be revealing what
surely will be one of the most
talked-about games this year halo 4
there will also be announcements from
Sony and Nintendo will reveal more on
the Wii U console hello well look who it
is it's jeff bakalar host of the four or
four and our cnet video game guru is
going to be heading to LA to cover the
show yeah now I see yes you got a chance
to actually see a demo of the Wii U but
intend has been so quiet about it
there's so many unanswered questions are
we gonna you know see some real working
games on this thing we better see some
games because up until now the reception
for the Wii U has not been good at all
and it's not even out yet at this III
Nintendo has to convince the world that
the Wii U is not just another gimmicky
console not only do that but they have
to win over the hearts of casual and
hardcore gamers alike well ain't that
the truth well be sure to follow seen
its coverage all week long beginning
Monday thank you so much Jeff thank you
and I hope you do some thumb stretches
cuz you know that's gonna be one game
heavy week in other news google is
holding an event to talk about new
features of its google maps and it's
well timed considering apple is expected
to talk about it Steve that features
soon and make your plans to see the last
solar transit of Venus on Tuesday if you
miss it you'll just have to wait another
hundred years or so we just learned the
iphone will be available on the no
contract cricket service from leap
wireless now there is an anonymous
source reporting that the iphone could
be coming to Sprint's boost mobile
prepaid service in the fall and
yesterday's show we asked if the iphone
is becoming more common and available on
more carriers and if that makes it any
less cool you said in some great
comments using tout
fajr iphone being cool it's never been
do you have an iphone that isn't going
anymore that you're looking to give up
because I'll take it I feel like it is
still the top of the line everyone still
loves it it makes it cool is the
functionality and what you can do with
it and the apps you can get so that's
never really going to change I got an
android and work vert always a big
functionality over coolness definitely
way down I don't have one yet I've gotta
get one soon but I don't think that when
I do I'm like have this thing for a
month I'm over it syba cool anymore not
change the iphone might be everywhere
but these days it really comes down to
what you can do with your smartphone
thanks and you can see all the comments
in our blog at cnet com / update from
our studios in New York I'm Bridget
