your first look at the Logitech UE boom
box this is the first mobile Bluetooth
speaker from Logitech and Ultimate Ears
that's a manufacturer that previously
only made headphones Logitech purchased
them back in 2008 while the name sounds
similar to the logitech wireless boom
box for ipad CNET reviewed last year the
company retooled the guts and the design
of the hardware this time to support
eight internal drivers and an anesthetic
that gives a nod to lead Apple designer
Jonathan eyes and of course the
legendary bran principles of simple
design aside from the small UE logo on
the front grille there's hardly any
branding on the speaker itself most of
the chassis is made of brushed aluminum
with plastic end caps that give you
controls like volume up and down power
on and off and a Bluetooth button that
lets you make a wireless connection with
compatible smartphones and music players
the handshake process is really simple
all you got to do is hold down the
Bluetooth button wait until the device
pops up in your device settings page and
the software does the rest and if all
goes well you should be playing wireless
music in less than five minutes on the
other hand if you don't have a Bluetooth
enabled device you can still use a
three-and-a-half millimeter cord and
plug it into this auxiliary jack in
terms of sound quality the speaker blows
away a lot of the competition including
Logitech's own mobile speakers
despite its Bluetooth connection now
you're always going to be losing some of
that fidelity in the audio compression
process over Bluetooth but you can
clearly hear the sonic finesse of the
Ultimate Ears co-branding in the higher
level frequencies so inside the boombox
you're gonna find two and a half inch
tweeters and two three inch woofers that
handle the treble and midsections while
for custom tuning passive radiators
deliver that really deep and resonant
helping of bass if you're looking for
boombox to power backyard barbecue or a
house party and those dinky little
portable speakers you have just won't
cut it this one's not gonna disappoint
now you can check out more details
including more photos and comparison
listening test results on my full review
on cnet.com but that's gonna do it for
me I'm Justin you you just took a first
look at the Logitech UE boom box
