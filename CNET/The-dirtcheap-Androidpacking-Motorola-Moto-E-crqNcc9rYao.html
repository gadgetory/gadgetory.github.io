bargain combining a good set of specs
for a rock-bottom price if that's still
a bit too pricey for you then cast your
eyes over the Moto e it's an Android
KitKat packin a 4.3 inch smartphone with
cut-down specs and an even more cut-down
price you'll easily spot the family
resemblance between the Moto e and the G
although smaller it has the same curved
back which is very comfortable to hold
the little dimple for the Moto logo and
it has interchangeable about covers
allowing you to change the color when
you fancy a fresh look it looks and
feels like a slightly less luxurious
phone in the Moto G but it does at least
have a toughened of Gorilla Glass 3
display the internals have been given a
water-resistant coating but it's play
has a 960 by 540 pixel resolution which
is lower than the G 720p display it's
not quite as crisp and it's viewing
angles are great but it's good colors
and regional brightness and make it more
than adequate for everyday tasks inside
is a 1.2 gigahertz dual-core processor
instead of the quad-core chip found in
the Moto G didn't put in a brilliant
performance on benchmarks but navigating
around the Android interface was still
pretty nippy with menus and apps opening
without any of that annoying lag it
handled a spot of light gaming
- although frame rates did noticeably
drop on occasion running the latest
Android 4.4.2 KitKat software which is a
huge plus for such a budget phone which
tend to save money by coming with older
versions of Android it's a near stock
version of Android which is simply
enough for even the most hardened
technophobes to get used to
on the back is a 5 megapixel camera
which I found generally unimpressive
thanks to its low quality and fixed
focus lens moto e is really not a phone
for photography fans in general the Moto
e packs enough tech to tackle the
absolute basics adequately and is a very
cheap entrance into the Android world
its price however isn't much lower than
the motive
which has a better camera more powerful
processor improved screen and along the
battery life unless you're shopping on a
very tight budget in the Moto G is still
the best value phone around I'm under
Hoyle for C net and this is the motorola
moto e
