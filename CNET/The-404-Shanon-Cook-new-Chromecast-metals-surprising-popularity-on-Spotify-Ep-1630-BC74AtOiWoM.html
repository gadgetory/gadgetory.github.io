show on this Friday September 18 2015
you've made a great choice and tuning in
to the show to my left Russ fresh to how
are you sir geoffrey you're doing all
right lovely as always always lovely
speaking of lovely the lovely and
talented Shannon kook on the program
today okay what's my talent uh we're
gonna my using me you'll see it was a
Spotify talent I do and you come with
you many gifts of phonic indulgence yes
yeah that's probably how you ready
describe that yes I bring gift-wrapped
songs um how you been it's been a while
you say that every time and it hasn't
been a bit it's been long enough that
you haven't seen us at least two months
okay well I'd say it's been about two
and a half miles yeah no work got
interested I've missed you terribly and
you've been cleansing not for to an hour
that would probably destroy someone that
would emaciated mean you come in what
are you cleansing you know you look more
than healthy I don't understand why you
have to do something like that the
chocolate you just gave us was delicious
though that was raw chocolate no sugar
no dairy wait there's your sugar and
that's just like you're ripping it also
know is palm sugar that sugar yeah but
it's it's acceptable sure it's like
saying there's no sugar in juice there's
tons of sugar yes there is but this is
this is okay shut up and it's in small
amounts so what was the impetus for you
saying okay we're on impetus cleanse
yourself of the wood please claw well I
do this cleanse once a year and it's
it's called the clean cleanse its
associated with the book clean by dr.
Junger it's a great book and itself it's
a cleanse for busy people well it's not
it's not like a juice fast where Europe
so you know deprived of energy
throughout the day that you're you're
hanging out for the next tues you you
actually eat a lot of food you just have
to stick to a list of acceptable so
what's like a typical meal for you well
you could have for lunch you can have a
big one
lunch and lunch will be say one protein
like meat okay they stabilize the size
of the chicken who can just eat a job I
mean they say it shouldn't be the bigger
than your fist but I actually what if I
eat really a whole chicken the other day
you had a whole I have a big fist there
you go yeah um no I didn't you know that
isn't always so hungry um no a bit like
vegetables quinoa brown rice and for
lunch and dinner you have these really
dense shakes or uh that's like lots of
coconut oil and avocado and in this
protein I guess well then they have
there's a powder that comes with it you
guys are way too interesting because
well first i wanted it was like why
because it I drink so much the rest of
the time yes and I you know I make not
so great choices a lot of the time like
we all do and this is just a chance to
give your body a press it's a reboot
it's a reboot and give your liver a
little bit of a cleanse can you go back
to drinking like a series their science
behind this is there like up there like
a graph I could look at where it's like
or a chart were like people who do the
cleanse live a better and healthy life
compared to people who don't cleanse
like because that's the only reason I'm
gonna do I mean there are people who
don't believe in cleanses and unless
you've done them and you feel the
benefits like for me I just get so much
energy yeah I feel better I wake up
naturally I don't need the alarm clock i
have this Ruthie's really deep sleep
that's not the cleanse didn't know it is
it is because if I drink a glass of wine
before i go to bed my husband literally
has to like clap ease can do it it's my
space to wait man essentially what
you're doing but the cleanse i wake up
at six o'clock every morning and I jump
out of bed and I'm ready for the day and
I just feel great here's my I feel good
yeah and I don't think I could ever do a
cleanse and the big problem is if I
don't eat something like reasonably
substantial every three hours and I turn
into an asshole yes but you and that
happens to me too but this is the great
thing about this cleanses you can eat if
you
hungry eat something right even if
you're between meals such as they are
you can have a bowl of brown rice if
you're really really that's not gonna
turn me not dress have a juice have
another smoothie sounds like you're on a
diet like it doesn't sound like a close
of shakes for dinner and breakfast that
is a little cleanse e Ramses you're not
she's like chicken and a shake it just
like mix the chicken in no but if you're
if you if it lunch you eat your chicken
and your veggies yeah your quinoa row
whatever you're having if you're still
hungry then you have some kind of snack
you could have a smoothie or it what
else but no like piece of real chocolate
you can't have one are you good no sugar
no dairy duh I i think the no sugar is a
great idea i no sugars bed and I can't
there is too there is bad for you yeah
there is that better human is so awesome
oh geez but that's the other thing about
this cleanses you're also taking
supplements you're taking vitamins and
stuff that you actually don't have any
cravings because you're everything your
body needs nutritionally yeah you're
getting okay well you're on this cleanse
and that's why it's a good cleanse for
busy people because you're you nourish
and you can actually still function I
don't want to spend too much time on it
boy thanks that's why I know this is
very important if I like just latex
would anyone like some more chocolate
maybe at the end of the show I also can
you send me like the list I want to look
at as you can yeah I want to see this no
you don't like pay a subscription to
something right you're not like getting
like oh no all right pyramid schemes not
like a consciousness all by yourself if
you wanted to ah the key with only a
quinoa I'm just never doing I'm not
gonna get on board with that shit don't
get on board it doesn't make sure not a
vegetarian cleanse like some basically
you can't eat me this this particular
way of eating they think we should be
eating mate say alright well let us
cleanse ourselves of this topic you
belong Shannon it's always a pleasure
when you're here because we learn about
the latest brightest stars in the world
of music as well as popular trends on
Spotify and before we start playing the
music
I want to talk about a little piece of
news that I'm not sure you know about
but it's out there we got talk about it
cuz it's a big deal in two weeks google
is having an event uh have you heard
about this event I've had a little bit
you probably have in San Francisco and
they're gonna announce well they're
gonna announce their new phones and
whatnot but they're also gonna talk
about Spotify joining chromecast did you
know about that I've heard little bits
about this yeah and I'm not I'm putting
you on the spot because we're not
expecting you to have the whole section
right put me on the spot about what I'm
eating but it'll be on this photo
bombing my company about your company
but this is really exciting because for
a while there will up until you know a
couple weeks there's no real support for
that and I think people are super
psyched because chromecast is one of
those little things that you bring
around anywhere and to have spotify
launching with that it's going to be
pretty rad I'm pretty psyched for this
personally i do not own a chromecast but
i am planning on getting a new one when
this one comes out so I'm psyched yeah
good so am i because I live with a
Googler oh that's right Warren this is
like a real incest wait this happened
within the house yeah what's this I see
you riskin see your house so to speak oh
Shannon started this thing yeah it's me
Daniel my Daniel not Daniel work Oh Rima
he know all right this is cool though
because like I use Spotify with my
playstation 4 when I'm playing games all
the time like I love it great just I
don't want to listen to like the same
game music over and over again I listen
to Justin Bieber instead it's lovely
yeah um but this is cool because you
know it's obviously much more plug and
play and like fix it fits in a pocket
presumably is it a new model of
chromecast Jeff I believe it is a new
piece of hardware do it's as tiny or
color but it's gonna be an hdmi dongle
II sort of thing and I know Shannon you
can't sit here and talk crap on other
streaming music services but I'll do
that for you okay because I've checked
out that other one and I'm not doing
this again I'm not doing this to shill
for you don't think you can be that
vague
there are like four or five talking
about the big one thing okay the big
talk about the big one yep all right the
one with doctors involved yes understood
all right look I'm not like i said i'm
not here to chill no money changes and
here we're being a genuine or fluids or
fluids well the show is young um yeah I
I used it on my dad's phone and oh my
god it's a disaster yeah that's what I
think I haven't used it you have a new
ZM yeah I have amused at you neither
i've seen demos I've watched other
people use it I haven't tried it myself
it's a little too busy and confusing for
my taste anyway we're my house is a
spotify house um but uh but yeah that
that's the direction I think this stuff
needs to go and it needs to have more
compatibility with other kinds of
devices like chromecast I'm psyched to
see where that goes so just a little PSA
for our listeners very cool new
chromecast coming with Spotify in a
couple weeks all right let's get to the
music yes well yeah we kind of like a
rated lists do you have burst for us
well I want to talk you brought up mr. r
us yeah Justin Bieber and I think you
brought up Justin Bieber in a jokey way
or you are trying to be self-deprecating
or I do you actually listen to be boom
not playing nah I do sometimes by
accident cuz i'm very lazy when i was in
to spotify and this is true i do was a
spotify pretty regularly but i'm very
lazy so often just like open it and just
like put whatever the playlist the top
is yeah so I'm like really well versed
in like pop music way more than I've
ever been just because I'm so lazy and I
don't want to go searching for job via
slee mr. Bieber is in that mix of pop
music we're not about to play that are
we oh no no I I'm doing this just to
piss you off yet but I've got things
things coming around its gonna be thank
you happy um Justin Bieber is having a
real moment and what does that mean be
crying I remember he cry right he cried
at the VMAs but here I actually really
like Justin Bieber at the moment because
he I think for the first time in his
career is making really great music uh
and he's being introduced to live
news like myself who in the past would
have been me wrong I'm not a believer we
need you bad boys more often but go on
was it the face no it was a great
American like cartoon voice is fantastic
coming from the Aussie um no he his song
what do you mean he's his newest single
coming for it he has an album coming out
in November it's our number one song
globally that's and it's our number one
song in the US it went it in its week of
release it broke a record set a record
for the most streams in its first week
it was streamed 41 million times it's
now it's now almost at 90 million what
um what do you mean it's a great song
it's a beautiful eyes are called what do
you mean is it just like when anyone
know that you like one of those emoji in
the title that's probably the sentence
he says most in life though what do you
mean well he doesn't say what do you
mean he says what do you mean and I'm
playing it right now but you can't well
it's thank you that's you're not
acknowledging Justin Bieber filter yeah
that's not know what do you
you can't have this justin what do you
mean
did I like the music but I find his
vocals really aggravating just cuz I
know the guy is it just because you know
it's just cuz i know it just me even
when I pictured to be Kate McKinnon from
sarah and i'm i still can't get but the
music is good i like to music well he's
gone in a I mean he's tried everything
in the pasta I'm not gonna say he hasn't
paired up with sort of a and tried and
EDM sound but this is a new EDM
electronic dance music direction that is
appealing to a lot of people like down
tempo and yes vocals kind of understated
he's not wailing like a prepubescent
child you look like you're trying to
give it a good go Jeff I'm like gearless
college try Megan huh sure thing I guess
is little bit of trouble yeah it's so
produced in like it's like dude you sing
man and only is just singing this but
that he's a freaking drummer to write
like god forbid you put a band together
and you sing like this over that I'll
listen to that right oh no is that i
like i like the music but yeah I like
music too and it's not your suggest it's
not your thing Jeff no roster studies
but the vocals is I just my image
engineer us I uncle pandering no but I'm
sure you'll play stuff I absolutely hate
okay i am now playing a song called
where are you now which was one of our
biggest songs over the summer is him
this is a collaboration between bieber
and Skrillex you play I've heard this
one and Jack you and the U is spelled
like the funny of course dome loud what
this is the similar thing it's like a
bit of an EDM it's like EDM emo yeah it
does a really cool thing in a minute go
give it a chance where's Skrillex coming
in in all this
tell me you give it a chance just wait
yeah we wait for the course does it drop
whoa is that it that's not a bit of it
that is a cool sound instrumental
playing
bogard Olivia
what you need you
well the intro is going on alright
alright I get ya like I like guitar I
like it I like this song more than the
first one its depths Jeff Japanese
chocolate okay so here's the deal with
like this kind of music it's not what's
the deal dubstep right but it's like
it's a it's an evolution of it anyway
right more palpable dubstep to me it's
like always trying to jam a square peg
in a round hole right like that's what
that sounds like to me where it's like
this shouldn't write pleasing to your
ears but you're gonna convince yourself
it is mostly cuz you're on MDMA fight
because Molly will do that to a person
look I don't know I am very open I
wouldn't know I'm on a cleanse when I
just said that I realized how full of
shit that must have sounded but I will
listen to anything once i will give
anything a shot and I understand music
like I don't look down like I don't
really like country a great deal but
like everything else I could kind of
like understand right yeah and this to
me is just like I don't know it's just
not like a super awesome evolution of
that stuff to me it's not but there's
something I don't like over-the-top
highly produced this well this is why I
think this is dwell it but it's also
kind of understated it's not in your
face like you said it all it's not
really grating like no one's like turn
that down yeah right all right you know
what this is though this is I don't
think anyone could like like I'm gonna
listen to music and I'm gonna like chill
out in a chair and listen this is like w
hotel lobby music yes thank all very Las
Vegas horrible it's good i like i like
the music but it doesn't I don't it's
like back see if I was in that setting
if I was in the w hotel and I'm sitting
in the lobby and
hear this I would want to drink my break
the quiz oh no this is designed to make
you want to buy a drink yeah like that's
what this musics about like something's
gonna be bought yeah I like this part to
me like somebody left two songs playing
at once my and they're like they're like
record that shit anyway look you know
what I like I'll give you this I like
that downtown song now you want to know
what is you want to know why why I bet
you didn't know this miss Spotify why
maybe you did maybe you don't the guy
foxy shazam oh wow well there we are you
got her she all right I'm sorry I'm
sorry Nelly this is really built yeah I
love this song so I'm mad about it Sam
though like a little bit dude this step
that's the stuff that's where it's at I
don't think I've heard this song oh this
is great to the moped store except fuck
this song has everything a bit of
everything I have a question Mariah
Macklemore and Ryan Lewis Oh heard the
start of the vmas recently I don't know
how like why did they steal my guy from
this band like that babe wins today
we're fans and he's great they have
picked him out but now the not a bully
went no no it's all about the dude who
is amazing voice is sick skinny little
bendy guy yeah we've seen him live a few
times really
I bet that's a function he eats a lot of
cigarettes on stage hee hee funk yes yes
he's not interested i skip ahead to
where we might hear ya
a little Freddie Mercury is getting
imperative
you
no people
I love him that's why and that's what
stuff at jeffs talking out when you
compare that Justin Bieber who doesn't
really feel like he has a motion when he
says this guy can belt and he can do it
lie and you feel it like you can sense
it in the way he's singing at least
that's my mother for me for this song
but it's all about the course yes like
this song's nothing without that chorus
arm so I guess we can like jumped around
a little bit is needs an ally right yep
he fronted a band called foxy shazam uh
like a like a glam ish sort of i just
used to describe them as reverb in the
darkness yeah there's like the darkness
net queen okay now they're pretty yeah
they're right I guess but it's like that
sort of love child became foxy shazam
and there's a band like you'd see live
and like they've got horns and a
keyboard and the guy the guy playing
keyboard would like crowd surf with his
keyboard play keyboard like on your head
that's at I've never been to a show like
a foxy shazam where did you see them saw
them in the stone pony in asbury park
new jersey when that was like two years
ago I got into foxy shazam maybe like
five years ago and they had released a
couple records and the record they put
out before the one that they ended their
career on called the Church of rock and
roll is like a front to back fantastic
album I mean it's unbelievable well um
Eric Nelly has said in an interview that
he actually did like Ryan and Macklemore
did or did not he did yeah Macklemore
and Ryan Lewis I think I just totally
mishmash their names it's the cleanse
the clinical and has an effect on brain
power um no but he used to said that he
would go jogging to their music so when
they called him and said we love you we
love foxy shazam will you do this vocal
for us he was like bah yes yeah
obviously I like money if you but he's
awesome and I haven't thought we been
making a lot of it with foxy and now
he's getting all this attention and if
you watch the music video I don't know
you
it is very he's riding like a chariot
down the streets of downtown LA and it
is very Freddie Mercury like he even
looks a little bit like don't ya maybe
he's dining himself like he it looked he
looks a little this is gonna sound crazy
but he looks a little like the guy
fawkes like the V for Vendetta guy where
he has this like wiry and mustache and
reigns freckles on he paints them yeah I
think he does but there's a guy random
and why would you write odd I'm not
gonna say he definitively does that but
I think there's like a part of that that
seems real he's just making shit up for
us oh I've seen I'm gonna stop making
some stuff yeah well I'm not I'm not
taking that much of a Liberty with his
styling right he he's just this amazing
prayer has this amazing prayer presence
and his stage presence is unbelievable
yes does he like an entire pack of
cigarettes at the end of a show and eat
them all I seen him do that it's okay
it's weird I was like I'll make sure he
has kids to yes be eating cigarettes I
was like your singer that's your that's
your bread and butter eating fine if
they were closed would that be okay is
that like more of the cleanse I don't
know the little veggie for you but foxy
she's you wanna play foxy shazam song
real quick pressures on um there's a
song called holy touch okay so so the
theme of that record that album called
the Church of rock and roll was like
very gospel and mostly about um African
I'm african-american women's butts
that's a big part of that shirt as well
but uh but yeah they did a lot of cool
stuff here his voice is pretty fantastic
here's a picture
okay yeah yeah I did the Queen it's the
boys very me CNN you hear ya and these
old wiry on seems like I see me fladeboe
man Guinea and bandy like during the
vmas when they open the show he
literally just throws him down today and
then bounce right back up
and the whole horn stuff and like the /
cut it's a really good band anyway
that's foxy shazam in a nutshell
man all he's having a good time in
social situations I feel like he's gonna
go and do his own thing now I feel like
we got voice in that in that exposure
that he just got right maybe who knows
unlike in this day and age i J I need
more like I remember when they won the
band broke up my wife was like what I I
need him I need his voice to compare
yeah and then we were watching the vmas
and I'm like is that the foxy shazam
yeah who's he doing there it was really
surreal I want to play I want to move on
to the libertines okay right great song
I don't know if you're Libertines fan I
actually thought the libertines were
done yeah and they sort of were for
about 10 years okay what it was there
hit like what would I know them um well
they're 2002 album was kind of big hang
on i'm looking up I feel like const a me
now was their biggest hit weren't they
in their busy I don't know maybe a movie
I mean they're they're the lead the lead
guy Pete Doherty I always want to say
Dodi cuz of the way it's felt but
apparently you say doggity oh really
Joel Evie told me that huh he would not
believe him he would know he's been in
on in and out of rehab more times than
I've been in and out of a hair salon
which is a lot I mean look at this hair
look at the air just don't wake up like
that I don't um this is constant yeah
yeah anyway they're back they're back in
business um apparently the heroin
addictions have been all suppressed okay
oh so they say and um they've released
his album which came out last week and
their new song is called Gunga Din okay
he's really cool I want you to hear
already like it like a ska thing going
like a reggae ish kind of thing yeah

at spotify his name is eliot van buskirk
and he crunched all these numbers for us
he's got a great name it has he does he
does and he's a very very cool guy too
he um did this thing and analyzed all
the metal listening on Spotify right and
determined that there's actually been an
increase in the listening of metal music
I'm spot a liar there's a god there is a
guy thirteen percent jump in what's fan
of thirteen percent jump from 2014 22
this year 13 that's it 13 yeah not 30
not significant yeah report that back at
the meeting cuz I'm trying to make I
feel like there wasn't like a pop metal
crossover song that would have increased
at that traumatic no no it's it's
unclear to me what accounts for that
increase but another thing that Elliott
determined and I didn't know this there
are 91 different genres of metal music
Wow 91 seems like they're really good
like is that left-handed albino
metabolic there's death metal black
metal and now I feel like their speed
meds nu metal new metal grunge metal
stoner metal I feel like what's
happening is they're just like really
taking every possible you know very item
with that very just because I'm a
current so just a simple one what is the
difference between death metal and black
metal uh I I might not even be able to
like tell you that like black metal it's
all about like theme and style like
lyrical theme yeah and style and like
the sound like death metal you're really
just gonna have like constant screaming
okay and it's just very growling vocals
yes he can
tickets are generally not for anyone
it's not for me it's not for anyone I am
NOT a death metal thing imma can I am a
stoner metal sludge metal progressive
metal traditional metal guy i know that
stoner metal is on Alice oh that's such
a thing or did you make that out you
could you stoner metal is a thing oh it
didn't make the top 25 he actually
Elliot actually laid out the top town oh
I'd love to see that subgenres is that
on spocom um yeah it's on our insights
blog here don't me to send you the link
no I can look I got the google here you
got the goods yeah yeah um the the
number one genre is alternative metal
alright so Sycamore what would be a
bands from the 90s late disturbed ok
right so that to me is like Koopa stank
fit into the hell probably that but see
to me yeah you're gonna mmm that's you
you pretty much speak in black bridge is
about something like alternate I don't
know just because most metal people
don't consider those bands to be metal
bands really well and it's interesting
because they Lizzie this is what we need
you Jeff yeah in this list too and I
feel like hard rock I wouldn't think of
like van Halen as metal rose it I don't
know I know I I think I space maybe I
think yet I mean these guys are more
hard rock I think metal has the the
definition of metal has definitely
changed in the last 20 years um you know
calling a band like disturbed metal you
prolly piss off a lot of people at like
a traditional metal show look if you
wore a disturbed t-shirt to like I don't
know but these are the hot dog obviously
these are pops on so that's the reason
it's number one it's like these are all
they like 90s papa roach's yeah this is
nice and early two thousand radio metal
yeah sure radio rock like this list puts
it I'm just excited that the seventh
most popular metal genre is metal know
the sub-genre of metal what I am Maiden
I in May the visted iron maiden is the
example here at the lion mane is
actually actually does really well and
Spotify what's code is Metallica I mean
we we talked about Metallica metallic
Metallica is a trait i said metal band
I think I'm and I'm checking out this
list man number five rap metal that is
just Linkin Park see I wouldn't think of
linkin park that rock maybe it's I get
it you can stretch for me a lot of this
is rock metal is more I i can almost
metal is like very focused on guitars
and guitar solos a lot of metal has like
a double kick double bass pedal we're
like the drummer is using both feet to
make the bass kick sound yeah um that's
a lot of that there's like orchestral
metal there's like you know we have this
like epic game of thrones e sounding
sort of metal swords up I'm looking at
this list like number six funk metal
we've got like really and red hot chili
peppers you have read actually there's
not a medal now yeah but I wish I could
sort of say I understand that you have
to like make these you know make these
labels and write them sort of thing like
my I like a lot of that maybe I like a
few bands in that metalcore genre it is
sort of weird though because it's like
it at this point when you're putting
like Quiet Riot and definitely def
leppard on this medalist it's I mean the
it's such a broad range of music that
like I'm kind of not at all surprised
that it might jump a little bit from
year to year cuz ya at this point you're
really including like a lot of different
music it's not what I would
traditionally think of his many strictly
male well let me share another little
deal with you around playing any metal
work a PDF yeah that's it um hey Elliot
um turned out another interesting thing
and he he was able to look adorable he
was looking at all genres of music to
try and determine which type of music
has the most loyal fans mmm and actually
came up with a formula which it sort of
perhaps a loose for me he's like a music
scientist she's amazing but i love the
data I mean you guys have so much doubt
like what people do what they like so
it's cool and he's working with echo
nest um you know which is always all
about data and and finding all kinds of
sting stuff out based on listener
activity and stuff but he what he did
was to determine which genres have the
most loyal fans he divided the number of
streams each core artist from those
honors had and divided them by the
number of listeners okay and this was
apparently good enough to sure German
which I which yeah I think so and anyway
metal came out ahead metal fans on
Spotify are the most loyal listeners
that's pretty awesome insofar as they
don't listen to a lot of as many other
genres are the most narrow-minded people
on the planet well you know oh I would I
actually asked my guitar teacher and
it's not just metal I think it's music
that's fueled by guitars guitar-driven
music solos epicness just to attract
loyal followers who go back and listen
to that music again and again and again
right I don't want to like cash more so
than other genres like like think about
the I don't know like my friend the way
my friends listen to music and the way
it's so easy on the surface like Spotify
to jump around from this to this do so
look here's this playlist let me try
this it's so easy to try different
genres I think we find with metal heads
am I allowed to call them that yeah sure
they don't care about the other genres
right at all yeah it might be that
transition is tough to make too because
if you listen to metal and like whatever
then we pivot into country right that'd
be another addition to make or just I'm
starting to understand now why you hate
every so I crazy jazz no no here's the
thing like I am NOT that guy like I'm
not the metal I wouldn't call myself a
metalhead right I enjoy that genre a
great deal I didn't grow up listening to
that that I grew up listening to like
traditional more like punk rock stuff
right where I grew up with like bad
religion and bands like that um and then
as I got older I was like I need this
heavier like I need it to be meaner and
heavier and louder what's happening into
your life in your life at this time jack
I mean this was not recent this is
probably like 10 15 years ago yeah where
I really lie was just trying to sound
like a psych college I know
well then it's like he was a teenager in
jersey like what else I was really
growing up I was uh really into ska and
punk rock like I love Scott was huge
where I grew up in the on the east coast
in jersey new york was like you know ska
be asleep like mm-hmm you're really
you're up that did I look confused no
not at all you're just like really just
looked a bit boy you're like that's sad
Jeff don't tell us about your musical
history thank you are and you know I
just kind of like evolved into it and I
also there's that side words like the
punk rock in the middle and then I also
have this thing were like I love
eighties music like I'm obsessed like
when yeah sure but like any even like
from I'll even go before 80s like
anything from like haulin oats I love
queen not a big haulin oats cakes is
amazing tastic I like journey as much as
that's over played and beaten to death
um you know I love that too I like Phil
Collins a lot I love like his greatest
hits sort of stuff I love Billy Joel I
really like Elton John so there's that
which is like a branch out I guess it's
just evolved into meat saying what kind
of music yeah that had no relation to
the other but now yeah yeah so what did
you learn from all that um that you're
really fucked up I'm worried about you
no no no no no all good but it I asked
my I played the guitar and I asked my
guitar teacher who's this really great
teacher called Jimmy rose of course
anyway that's his real name is not as
not jeans would ever make a field Jimmy
Page his first name and that's one way
that I'm gonna go with Jim rose well I
don't care about his name because he's a
he's a fantastic teacher he's he's the
best there is and I'm thrilled that he's
my teacher but I asked him why he
thought music that's really driven by
guitars might attract these really loyal
listeners and he said can I kind of just
read what he said absolutely i'd love to
try to impress do the impression Jimmy
rose says it better than I do um I had
but if I read it in his voice I have to
sound pissed off because Shannon hasn't
been practiced yes
had that he says metal listeners are not
casual listeners meaning that not only
are they devoted to the bands they love
but the music provides them a pulse for
their daily activity most guitar players
don't make a living by playing guitar
they work a day job so they can play at
a bar / club at night and that day job
probably provides some ample opportunity
to have headphones on their ears for
most of their day kind of like you Jeff
listening to music driven by guitar
keeps them on life support until they
can blow out come nightfall okay yeah
it's a great that's a great way to put
it and i only think that's covering like
one little section of course that's
people who actually do play the guitar
yeah I mean I play guitar not very well
but I've been playing for on and off for
like join me to give you jimmy's number
yeah maybe Ozzy he's so good he do
favors were like I can trade him
something for guitar lessons no no no
why'd you guys get it make our yeah like
I'll help him out with like his computer
or something anyway um I used to take
lessons as well and I learned the
general like basis of you know chords
and like the foundational like logic for
a guitar can you read music uh no Jimmy
will not let you strike a single cord
until you can read all right so I learn
how to read music I think the foundation
for like my understanding of guitar
playing is there I don't think that
would be a huge jump for me to start to
learn how to read music nevertheless
he's brandy Jimmy's very picky but I
think people high demands yes even if
you don't play guitar I still think you
can form an appreciation for just what
these kinds of metal guitarists are
doing right like they do stuff yeah that
no one else I don't even play guitar and
I watch some of the videos on YouTube my
name is like outrageous going on and I
think like you know for me it's like I
think a metal person who's super loyal
almost mirrors the passion that like a
Star Wars fan has four star wars where
it's like you become this metal geek
right and you form such an appreciation
and you and you understand that like
what these guys and girls are doing is
so freaking unbelievable and you know
you're probably a little a little bit of
a curmudgeon because you see like
what's popular and you see how like your
musical brain can be like well that
seems like very producing kind of
bullshit yeah it doesn't seem to be like
tremendous amounts of talent for some
some of popular music so I have this
little Club where everyone appreciates
the talent and understands how f and
hard it is to do stuff like that so it's
this you get it right it's like I do and
I think it also has a lot to do with the
fact that metal musicians keep within
the lines of metal music if you look at
pop which is far and away the most
popular genre yes Spotify hate the word
genre but there's no other way I'm could
sail a dial type um but you know there's
so much crossover within pop they're at
a rap artists you know collaborating
with pop singers there are um you know
R&amp;amp;B bleeds into pop it's just all it's
it's all a mishmash and things get
thrown under the pop label which could
also be under hip-hop or R&amp;amp;B or or what
have you or rock even so but we're metal
just doesn't jump around it's it's own
that's trash East I feel like we need to
listen to some metal Jeff I need you to
do me a favor sure build a website for
me oh just do it it's probably pretty
easy right Oh hold on let me just start

hear you tell me you really didn't bring
anything I thought matter because said I
told you I told you I'm not the metal
expert so if we've got mr. medal so did
that segment please you Jeff in any way
did I feel satisfied we need to play
songkong throw out a song yeah what
would be a good middle and just make
sure it's a song that's on Spotify or
it's gonna be a fairly on Spotify I ok
so we've gone through some of the genre
give me the songs you have time to find
it I understand but like I want to know
like what you want to hear obviously
we're not gonna do like a scream Ethan I
want to hear your favorite so my
favorite metal band for a while has been
a band called Mastodon right so you've
heard of the I've heard of you've heard
of mess and on I've heard of the animal
and the band uh right it was a
prehistoric it was a large elephant like
creature with big tusks I'm trying to
think like what their most popular song
on Spotify Mastodon an ast 0 do n yep I
would imagine their most popular song as
a song called oblivion that was like
their big single I can't find them oh
they're there Belva McGann M ay n ms I'm
area Mastodon are you feeling nest that
I
to say it with an Australian accent
master master don't totally matches
their um and these guys are a relatively
mainstream sort of popular metal band
yep they're there they stream in the
millions their biggest song is the
mother lode okay uh I would maybe play
I'm sure oblivion is up there yeah yep
does well it does well you started that
it's a slower kind of song and it's got
a really catchy hook that people really
dig so weak it does take a look a little
bit too like my favorite song rise up to
the occasion but you can appreciate the
guitar stuff that's going on in here and
I think you just I just can't believe I
searched for no I think it's coming yeah
yeah it might your connection might be
dropping here you go okay screaming
it's going to say okay streaming well
there was an issue briefly but we're
good currently the tree there's a
buildup so now just think about what's
happening right here with four guys
playing insurance
yeah it's very chanting which you don't
hear in metal this is what you don't
roll like I don't want to call stone
imply something for like it is still
more Jam baby metal
and clear vocals yeah these guys have
been known to get a little screen this
is a very accessible massive and I guess
we can go through the course because the
chorus is really nice
it's kind of cool itch yeah totally
there's a lot happening with guitars
right yeah
it's almost affecting my equilibrium
you're gonna ask
yeah that's it's a catchy hook sketchy
how it go it's nice eyes are bleeding
why are they that's how I look when I'm
really listening um I I'm happy to
listen to that I could never see this
band I though I just should I can't do
the live version i would just be get
pissed off after five minutes and I'd be
like I have to get that what did I never
bring Stacey to a lot what are the
issues that noise or it's just to me
it's just it's too much noise I like
listening to it through these quality
headshot yes i can appreciate it but
everything would believe they're open
stage making that kind of ruckus it's
just gonna smell like ruckus tomato and
i apologize midlands people it's not
offensive like it's not for me sure so
look up so here's another band i really
like that maybe takes it a little step
further you pronounce it in in a stray
sure you'll understand this this is just
like a phrase it's called every time i
die lovely ah we don't say that in
australia no but it's like a bunch of
words and you could put together these
guys are more under the radar a little
more under the radar um they're pretty
intense to kind of almost they have like
we sure they're pretty intense I mean
being called every time I die I'd say
that they're pretty low-key doctor Kynes
waiting for happy guy uh there's a song
called werewolf yeah um they're a little
more heavy
sounds like mid-90s
sounds like it would be like in the
soundtrack by tony hawk game yeah
curious with Shannon thanks
I like the message
I think don't
so they're intense this guy's guys got a
couple set of pipes on so it's you know
it's it's intense but that's another
band I dabble in I'm more I little
heavier I'm more into the foxy shazam
yeah there you go ok cool just a little
more there's a bit more melody in there
I can get friendlier and the send the
singer I like the singer his voice is
spectacular it is yeah they really are
not sure but I I can appreciate the
music and listening to it I actually
enjoyed listening to those two songs
through my headphones and watching you
be really happy yeah I mean I'll that's
as happy you can I glint in your eyes
that well I have tried to bring that
glitch with other songs and it hasn't
worked so know you've done it you did it
today already with the libertines yeah
I'm glad you it's very different you
would like that you know I'm here I'm
you know I'm I'm here and I'm gonna give
it the the college try like we said can
I destroy it all now by playing the most
stream song of all time on split up time
yeah wait whooshing yes yes I'm just
gonna stop playing don't know all right
um I feel like Michael Jackson no it's
gotta be something newer oh yeah you're
right it's playing now just just punch
it up and what we're gonna know I'm
gonna know it you might not
is this Sheeran edsheeran yeah damn
what's up well yeah sorry i had to
change things up to 17 right this is the
most streamsong that ever because a lot
of people want to get laid essentially
he does I mean this is like the modern
like let's get it on arion guess there
are these dreams hi I think it's gonna
be over a billion no I would say 30
million no I think it's way more than
that I'm ready oh wow sorry you were
greedy oh wow I snow spot if I went up

as my pledge it's always a fantastic
pleasure of ours to have all this new
music and thank you for playing some

around the world he's a rapper young
rapper people love him great greatest
yep so there you go and then also
someone asked and I guess we can maybe
answer this does the premium version of

definitely a higher bitrate I am
positive about that I'm not tech support

I didn't almost I don't know the exact
bit rate but is definitively higher than
the free version yes I'm gonna throw my
pen also I want to talk about a few
