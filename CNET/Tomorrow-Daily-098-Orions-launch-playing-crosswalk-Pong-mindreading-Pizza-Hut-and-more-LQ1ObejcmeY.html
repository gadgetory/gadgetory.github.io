makes a successful launches landing and
we're going to tell you why that's so
awesome and how it could lead us to Mars
new technology lets you play video games
at the crosswalk while you wait oh I
like it and also Pizza Hut has a new
piece of software that can read your
mind I'm reading your mind right now
mm-hmm Pizza yep sera daily
greetings citizen from the internet
welcome to tomorrow daily the best geek
talk show in the known universe I'm your
host Ashley scale adona me once again as
always on a Monday cantle anonymous I
want to go to Mars I do too yeah but no
cell phone reception they're like no no
no fios is a no internet is the reason
why we wouldn't want to go to Mars I
don't tell me the hardest sad yeah
that's I mean if we could have an
internet connection I feel like maybe I
would go well it's 56 k well the problem
is it would take so long to get like if
we could just ask like google com to
NASA like here on earth and then they
don't send it back or take forever yeah
half hour to like load up a page I
change my mind I'm not going yeah
alright so let's talk about how some
other people might go there let's hit
the headlines before we get started if I
start coughing uncontrollably I'm
feeling a little under the weather today
so if I sound like a dying person I'm
sorry I promise I won't get sick sit far
away from you're a marine um yeah I stay
away from nigerian please don't don't
touch me during the show on your screen
it's all germs okay so we have to talk
about Orion they actually we were gonna
report on this on Thursday but then they
moved the launch date back a little bit
because of the weather so they said it
wasn't the right weather we're gonna
wait a day we'll see how it goes and
then NASA successfully launched the
Orion spacecraft here is the actual
footage of the launch which is super
cool looking yeah look at that so this
is a four hour to write short flight
four hours it safely landed in the
Pacific Ocean so it went from one side
to the other right into the Pacific
Ocean pretty cool and it basically the
point of this if you haven't read up
about this if you haven't been hearing
about this is this is a capsule so it's
not quite a space shuttle it's a capsule
and this is one of the first steps in
exploring and sending human beings to
Mars which is pretty great so what this
capsule did was it tested critical
onboard systems while it was in the air
like heat shields it took measurements
on radiation exposure and it orbited the
earth twice and then landed in the
Pacific Ocean so basically the goal is
to send some day send astronauts in a
capsule like this to Mars so
the road map includes sending Orion on
an uncrewed trip to the moon so they
want to send this capsule again like up
to the moon uncrewed and then in the
future at some point hopefully by 2021
they want to send astronauts into the
craft I don't know if that's
specifically to Mars I want to say that
might be a little bit farther down the
road but I'm having a crude set of
astronauts like getting get into the
capsule and fly it around you're pretty
awesome we had a lot of work to do we
got a lot of work there's a lot of work
to do a lot of work but that's good it's
good we have it we have you know it's
good to have a success yeah yeah i mean
it's it's been a rough couple months but
i think now with you know even even feel
a like landing even though it didn't go
perfectly i think that was really
exciting and then of course you know now
we have this so more successes like it's
it's feeling a little bit better I know
for a while there was kind of dark like
we were all kind of bummed because there
were some some bad things that we're
going on yeah some explosions some very
bad likes of not cool things but the
neat thing about the capsule is we saw a
lot of people kind of or I did anyway
saw some people saying like Oh reminds
me of Apollo the Apollo missions and
like it's the exact same and why aren't
we progressing and why isn't this
technology better than it was but the
cool thing about this capsule as opposed
to a shuttle as I were to understand it
is that it's a safer and more efficient
way to launch and recover spacecraft and
the other thing is is it's mostly
reusable so this is it's capable and
it's also capable of farther and longer
our farther and longer time space
exploration so this is like perfect a
much better choice for the first set of
you know missions to get you know crews
out farther into space for longer
periods of time things like that sounds
like that's the kind of upgrade you'd
want I mean probably going to add laser
guns or anything to it yeah or you know
like space wheels like following next
Twitter in base Wales I'm sick please um
but yeah so I really really cool and I'm
just good job NASA and everybody
involved yeah great job NASA so um but
now is good news now I would like to
hear about this is this is the brink of
technology right just kidding I said you
know we're excited about going to Mars
but this is something we could maybe
potentially enjoy very very soon yeah
this is true this is
all happening in Germany but if you've
ever been impatient while waiting across
the street well now there's technology
and video games that'll keep you
occupied now back in 2012 these two
Germans I decided that they wanted to
create a video game where you can play
pong with the person waiting across the
street there's a pong game without and
they finally they got approval so now
they made it on a few street corners and
as you can see people are sitting here
playing pong they've even they now have
a company called urban invention oh yeah
and they've created a device called
active wait and you can just sit there
and play video games with the person
across the street oh it's with them yeah
its interactive with the person across
the street there look at this they're
playing it's time lapse and then of
course like oh we can walk now you're
good yeah when it when it's over when it
turns green it'll it'll give you a alert
go cross the street that's how much time
you have I love it they high-fived
airplane yeah it's an adorable way they
are they now have an IndieGoGo that they
have up try and raise funding for future
future games are just developing
controller yeah cuz I think it's like
yellow one intersection yeah it's only
one of their so that's still really bold
step in the right direction captured oh
oh my god there you go but it's really
cool that they're doing we're that's a
working prototype that's really neat
producer Logan said something very
appropriate for this which was guys uh
how did you miss the obvious you should
have put Frogger on there oh man that is
great he's like so uh yeah like
about Frogger you've like priori we'll
watch a movie he meant to say he meant
to say Grand Theft Auto yeah of course
Wow yeah that's always the first choice
but then you know Frogger pong those are
your second and third yeah so there you
go I don't have the information for the
IndieGoGo but if you look up activate
activate activate if you look up
activate you can go see Mona you know
what they're up to I like it what there
you go pretty yeah pretty little fun
little tidbit there for you so speaking
of fun little tidbits um as we all know
kilos pizza nobody could nobody knew
that I don't nobody know it's a secret
um trade secrets so I saw this story and
immediately thought of kale because
Pizza Hut would not actually need this
piece of software for kill but maybe for
other people so this is what they're
calling a subconscious menu
and what pizza hut is doing is they are
going to they would give patrons a
tablet and it has this software called
Toby its eye tracking technology called
Toby and the tablet running Toby will do
this little thing if you're watching
right now the pizza hut logo would go
around and that actually calibrates your
eye movement and then it'll show you a
whole bunch of toppings that are
happening and then based on your eye
movement in three seconds it'll decide
what toppings are the most important to
you and show you the and put an
algorithm together and parse it and then
say this is the pizza that you want how
great is that right Wow kill your crying
I'm just glad it finally happened I'm
glad to get my memo no this is super
weird it's so Wyatt why is it why why
why is it also well I'm looking at that
tablet screen and the only thing I can
think of is some of those toppings look
super weird and at first I didn't even
know what they were so I was I spent
more time looking at looking at it and
then I'm like this thing is gonna think
look at the toppings you ordered one of
those looks like a donut you ordered pig
elbows you know I'm just looking at see
whatever you know what that was like I'm
sorry but it was corn on their shrimp
like I would look at the shrimp going
who would put you up you've ordered
shrimp yeah I know yeah before you could
even say like why is this on here I'd be
like oh here's your pizza it's a shrimp
and hushpuppies like on a pizza with so
just we go instead of somebody coming up
and going like what do you want and you
go oh god I've never had any time before
I just have zero idea what could you
possibly but that's just weird pizza hut
but it's like I think s it's for the
people who come in and are like I don't
really know what I'm in the mood for and
then it's like well look at this thing
and then it'll tell you you know Oh
based on your eye movements these were
the things you were most interested in
here is a hero's a pizza that we think
would be good it's not like here's your
first and second choice it's like your
first choice was this and so based on
that we've created like a pizza with
that topping and you know some other
stuff on there that we think you would
like based on what you looked at what if
you just want one topping well then you
wouldn't need it you just
I want a pepperoni pizza you just look
at the pepperoni and should be like just
stare really hard at just the pepperoni
all right don't look at anything else
there you go it's weird pizza that is
really really weird oh by the way I
forgot to do our hashtag of their
question of the day oh I was a sec yeah
it is but producer ligand can you throw
up the hashtag of the day on the the
lower third here that would be fantastic
the hashtag days TD game wait and I
wanted to know and I feel good ask you
what would you play if you were sitting
at a stoplight like what's the game you
would want to be playing I said fall out
but i changed it to heart stone hearth
gotta be it's got to be a quickie ok a
nobody's gonna be like yeah nobody can
say like Skyrim here's a little trick
you see every 300 hours yeah no I'm
sorry I can't ever leave this well it's
a good question so what game would you
want to play at a cross one I would say
three's threes the it's a card game for
puzzle game um did you ever play 2048 no
okay well that get well threes is the
original um shout out two threes but it
was a it's a game at just one iphone
game of the year cool yeah so you can go
you go check out eyes it's an awesome
puzzle game you like puzzle games like
you have to basically get cards and you
have to match ones and twos to make
threes and then you have to match cards
it's really and you can only swipe like
up and down glad we both picked like
card games yeah well I can't drag an
angel position so that's your that's
your that's your hashtag yeah what game
would you want to play at a crosswalk
well game you want to play in a
crosswalk cuz that's that's actually
really cool technology and it keeps you
safe which is me you know don't forget
you're also you can also pick a game
that you're playing with the person on
the other side so give you smash
brothers a smash brothers whatever you
want so um alright cool we're gonna take
a quick 30 second break and then we will
be back with a back at her Hackett and
your user feedback and of course our
phone talker for the day so don't click
away tomorrow daily
welcome back to the show we're back
after a very quick break so this next
thing is actually it's a back of their
Hackett and we're really interested in
it but you know we're a little skeptical
so we have some fun stuff for you so
check out back at Hackett so of course
the holidays are upon us everybody's
decorating one of the things that we
always see like the joke the constant
joke about Christmas lights is that they
always get jumbled up into a big knot
and they're really tough oh yeah rabble
on so these two guys started a company
and it's called aura powered by aura and
these are Christmas ornaments that light
up so that's what it looks like and
their wireless and it's powered by a
ring and that goes around the tree so of
course I here's here it is the trope
that you always see it's like all of
these Christmas lights are so hard yeah
look a Christmas vacation yeah and these
are the two guys um oddly enough I
talked to them and they said that they
met on via Kickstarter you actually went
and talked to them oh no they came to me
they came to my house on Friday oh and
they came to my house to show me the
technology because honestly like I saw
this video you guys and I was I was
pretty skeptical I'm like I don't know
like it this seems kind of gimmicky yeah
we're square skeptical people and I
noticed that they were located here in
Southern California so I reached out to
them and they you know okay like talk to
their their lovely PR person and had him
had him come out to the house because we
don't have a tree here and we couldn't
fit one even if we tried yeah plus we
hate nature yeah we also just hate trees
and so why don't because I have one in
my house but I really wanted to see this
technology first hand and so I did so
invited the guys over to talk a little
bit about aura and then also show me the
actual product in you know working so
check out this little video that i put
cool my name is hardeep johar i'm the
co-founder and CEO of aura my name is
Chris Higgins I'm the CTO at powered by
aura I've always been annoyed at the
amount of wires on the Christmas tree my
my mom actually puts up so many wire
lights on the tree it just kind of
strangles it so we really wanted to get
rid of them and just make it a more fun
experience the technology
we're using as a perfect fit for the
Christmas tree because it's vertical and
it works better with the technology to
get to this point we've gone through
quite a few prototypes I'd say six seven
different iterations of testing out
different prototypes on the transmitter
side the ring itself in the ornaments
themselves I can't even count the number
of PCBs I've got at home so probably on
the magnitude of 10 to 20 different
models of the PCBs are as really
exciting is a future we're getting a lot
of people interested as but people want
to license the project as well as
distributed the response has been pretty
amazing people have suggested and we
originally had gone with glass all glass
frosted clear and crackle but people
brought up the point and have shown us
that they really like plastic for kids
for dogs for animals and for just normal
safety purposes so we're actually
launching a plastic option as well once
you have a field of wireless electricity
around Christmas trees it's incredible
what you can do with ornaments things
that really have never been done before
all wirelessly you can bring motion
music all sorts of synchronization with
smartphones and just a whole Internet of
Things vissa that was a little bit on
you know the technology and how many
prototypes have gone through took him
about a year about a year to put
together and yeah it's actually really
cool like I was really surprised at how
well it worked um I loved how you know
they were able to kind of run you know
the different colors over the board and
sort of show me like how each bulb
lights up and it was just great like it
was it worked really well yeah so there
are crazy talking to the people that
actually like worked on it yeah I know
it was a deeper they brought over
because you know obviously they have to
go through the manufacturing process to
get the small you know retail version of
it so that prototype that you saw is
like what they brought of the house is
this huge thing and it's a lot of things
going on on but it was amazing i was
really neat technology with you know
this they're calling a power ring where
it's you know it's this loop that you
would clip into your tree like if you
had a tree that was taller than i think
they said five feet you
in like the middle of your tree and then
it would light up all the bulbs from the
top to the yeah which is I mean it's
really cool like it's really good
technology of course it's not going to
be available this Christmas but there
thanks Chris next Christmas yeah that
you would get all your stuff by next
Christmas and I really liked like they
were saying in the video one of the
things they did was they really listen
to their backers and at the start of it
they only had glass available and glass
ornaments and then a lot of people said
well I have kids or I have you know I
have animals and pets that are you know
love to get in my dream jerks yeah yeah
like I've cat jerks like just like stuff
off me okay your cat jokes began and so
so they listen and they actually put
together what you saw in video the one
that was really glittery was a plastic
ornament that would also work with it so
it was really cool and it was really
nice pillow talk to them they're super
nice guys I just I really enjoyed kind
of seeing what that technology was about
and as a skeptic like I mean when I saw
the Kickstarter video myke I feel like
this could be manipulated in some way
like the lights could be made a little
brighter you know like and and it's real
tough with Kickstarter because sometimes
you watch these videos and you're like
how much of this is real and how much of
it is you know to either doctorate or
otherwise like kind of out of 100 takes
this was the one time it worked
perfectly yeah you know so it was really
nice ville actually just see it
functional and working right in front of
me it was really cool so I actually
backed it this morning after seeing it
and like I felt really good about was
like okay I'm we're back I kind of want
so maybe a great Christmas gift what's
only 69 bucks and so it's 69 to get a
version that is not Wi-Fi enabled so um
you get the the loop and you get the 12
ornaments for sixty nine dollars and
then 499 you get a Wi-Fi enabled one
where they're gonna have an app where
you can control lights oh man not an off
that's great yeah that's super cool and
they did I mean I'm sure somebody some
company is gonna have like lots of
interest in this like some Christmas
lights company or whatever i'm sure
they'll have you know like very strong
interest is really cool and I think a
lot of people would really enjoy this I
would kind of a neat way to light up
your tree that's right I like the
charger thing i like the charging that
loop yeah I want that what that day it's
really neat and it's it's bigger than I
thought it was um but it also was a lot
more subtle like I feel like you could
put it in a Christmas tree land it would
camouflage in pretty well okay so
oh yeah that's it's called aura powered
by aura you can go check it out but
thank you to the team over at aura for
for coming over and and showing me the
technology I know that that's all it was
a little bit of a hike for them because
they're out by the beach so so G Drive
especially on a friday in Los Angeles so
I appreciate that and but yeah so that's
aura I say obviously back it because I
actually put my money where my mouth is
and backed them this morning so I was
very skeptical but now i'm a believer
pretty neat yep I think it looks great
I'm bakit I like that technology and
actually that it's pretty affordable too
yeah like I was expecting it to be like
oh it's 199 for the starter kit cassette
that always feels like the end really
prized point for a lot of stuff on
Kickstarter that's sort of tech based or
it's like 200 bucks is the get in you
know are like 150 or you know Saudi hero
was under 100 bucks a--'s yeah for nice
the one I backed I got like four bot I
got like four boxes or something oh nice
oh it's like if you're gonna you know go
big or go home yeah that's I'm a
Kickstarter guys I'm a Kickstarter fiend
yeah it's very every week I'm always
telling you get a box and you're just
like was it your Kickstarter's we don't
even cover on this show that I'm like I
just back this I just back this like I
back lots of stuff so but i did back
this i decided to put my money where my
mouth was and I back to this morning
pretty cool so thanks sora are you ready
to toxin user feedback yes all right
let's do it last week we asked you guys
Suicide Squad right that's gone yeah to
use the hashtag tds squad to tell us
whether or not they got the casting
right and everyone said yes i will show
you who are pretty much an agreement
with it which is pretty cool even the
creator of Suicide Squad didn't write to
us but in an interview the guy who
created the comic book was like he was
he was very happy and pleased with
casting he thought was really good he
said he was really impressed and felt
that Warner Brothers was taking his
property very seriously by casting these
major actors and all the roles he
thought that was awesome I'm so it was
really neat i read that this morning and
i thought that was cool that he was so
excited um lady be excited to have
margot robbie play Harlequin yeah yeah i
just saying all right I agree so one of
them would they say so Rick wrote to us
and said excited for Will Smith hope he
doesn't pull another Hancock hahaha by
the way Jake horny is
of john mcclane and he's going to be
Kyle Reese I know he's I am well aware
that he's going to be in the Terminator
movie that I'm still kind of ignoring
yella you got a lot of hate for some of
your jai courtney it was one of them jai
courtney i actually may be all ok
alright what else we got I'm also Leo
Rosen said I personally think that the
Joker should have that should have that
awesome man bun of Jared Leto's tds
squad hashtag 10 out of 10 movie cast
yeah she's a guest eyebrows hashtag Cara
Delevingne yeah she does have the best
night Ross in the universe yeah sure
it's pretty good but jared leto does
have the best man but i will give you go
we're gonna go man bun and eyebrows all
right I think um I think that's a really
good comic book series that we should
start man bun and I browse button browse
yeah I I dig it um but those are our
those are our two main ones and then
also we're still collecting your TD 100
tweets oh there were some really good
ones so any of you've been leaving
comments about what you what your
favorite moment and all of tomorrow
daily whatever yeah we've had some
really good ones yeah we're gonna share
them with you at are intercepting
through we have more so shifting through
and then we're gonna make producer
Logan's stay up all night one night to
comb through every show we've ever done
to find every one of those clips we like
to make him stay up late and not have a
social life as often as possible yeah so
this is another opportunity that you can
help us out with yeah very true and of
course it's time for a very last piece
of user feedback this is our phone tog
refer of the day
