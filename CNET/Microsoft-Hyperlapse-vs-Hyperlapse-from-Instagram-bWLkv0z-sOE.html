then you'll love that there are now two
new apps to make hyper lapses one is
from Microsoft and it's the Android or
Windows Phone and the other is from
Instagram for iOS now they're both
called hyperlapse but they do have some
differences let's see how they compare
Microsoft hyperlapse shoots at 720p by
default as it's currently in Veda you
can't change that
Instagram hyperlapse also shoots at 720p
but you can unlock full 1080p just use
four quick taps with four fingers to
bring up the secret settings menu
Instagram uses the iPhones gyroscope to
apply stabilization when filming
Microsoft uses an algorithm to
reconstruct a camera path and stabilize
footage so there is some extra
processing time needed in Microsoft's
app once you've finished filming
depending on the length of the video you
could be waiting up to 30 seconds for it
to work its magic
now instagrams result does seem to be a
little bit smoother especially when
hand-holding the phone while walking
with Microsoft hyperlapse you can import
any video or you can film in the app but
with Instagram you can only record in
the app and you don't get access to your
original footage after its processed the
main editing tool is the speed
adjustment so you can run anywhere from
one time to 40 times and instagrams up
or one times to 32 times in Microsoft up
that's a quick comparison of the
Microsoft and Instagram hyperlapse apps
