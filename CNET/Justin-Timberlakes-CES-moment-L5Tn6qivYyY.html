partner Justin Timberlake all right hey
guys doing you rockin it out at CES ya
hear ya you look crazy the TV long
before the internet was our supplier of
true word of mouth our originator of
water cooler talk and now with this
exciting partnership with myspace
panasonic we're ready to take television
and entertainment to the next step by by
upgrading it to the social networking
experience why text or email your
friends to talk about your favorite
programs after they've aired when you
could be sharing the experience with
real-time interactivity from anywhere
across the globe for example as the plot
of your favorite drama unfolds the joke
of your favorite SNL character plays
example anything to do with a box maybe
you didn't like that one maybe you're
more into moms or even the last second
shot of your favorite team swishes the
net we're giving you the opportunity to
connect your friends to your moments as
they are actually happening this is the
evolution of one of our greatest
inventions the television and now we no
longer have to crowd around the same one
to experience it together historically
social has been about what you have done
possibly what you're doing right now at
this moment the future of myspace is
about what you're going to do about who
you're going to become
myspace TV is the first foray into that
future we want to say a special thank
you to Panasonic for its faith in our
vision and foresight to partner with us
also to the millions of myspace users we
want to thank you for sticking with us
in this shift we're excited about the
new things that we're planning to bring
you all this year and I'm personally
looking forward to all the things that
myspace TV is and will become thank you
very much for having us thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
