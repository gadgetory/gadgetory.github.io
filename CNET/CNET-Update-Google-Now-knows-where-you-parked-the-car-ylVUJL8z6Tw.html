pressure and Google's tracking your car
I'm Bridget Carey and this is your C nut
update the Google now service can help
remind you of many things upcoming
meetings traffic alerts sports scores
and now it can also tell you where you
parked your car when the Google Search
app is tracking your location with GPS
it knows when you're driving and when
you leave that moving vehicle on your
phone Google now will show a card with a
map of where you parked your car but you
still may need to keep clicking your
beeper a few times to find the exact
aisle that you parked it in and Google
may not know the difference between you
parking a car and stepping off a bus so
it's not perfect tracking down our car
is nice but tech companies are also
focusing lots of energy on tracking our
health samsung is having some sort of
event later this month to talk about
health gadgets and funny enough it's
just a few days before Apple has its big
Developers Conference both events will
be in San Francisco it's rumored that
Apple will also be talking about health
with a new application called health
book it would be one app to keep track
of your vital stats and fitness records
like your heart rate blood pressure and
nutrition and sleep but that's not all
Apple may be coming out with new ear
pods with sensors to measure your
heartbeat and blood pressure in your ear
that rumor was posted on the anonymous
app secret which also says these Apple
earpods would have ibeacon technology
inside and will require the lightning
port which is why the audio jack was
moved to the bottom of the iPhone
there's no way to know how true this all
is but in the comments the poster said
that they shared the news out of spite
because they were fired so we'll have to
wait another month to see what Apple is
really working on but in the meantime
you can entertain yourself with 6-second
looping videos I'm of course talking
about vine the video app vine now has a
website for browsing its vine Co and the
short clips are sorted by categories
vine is pretty popular with comedians
and artists that have fun with the short
frame vine is a creation of Twitter
which also has a new feature of its own
Twitter is testing a new button on the
app only some people are getting this
option but when you click on the more
icon there's a choice to mute the person
so their tweets don't show up on your
timeline why not just unfollow someone
you don't like
well maybe it's someone you work with so
you don't want to unfollow but they're
blabbing out all these spoilers for Game
of Thrones so you mute but it's unclear
when Twitter will roll out this power to
everyone that your tech news update you
can head to cnn.com for more details and
follow me on Twitter I'll behave you
won't have to mute me from our studios
in New York I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
