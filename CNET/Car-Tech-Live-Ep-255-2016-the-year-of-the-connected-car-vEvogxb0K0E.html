acceleration issue GM matches production
to sales and juniper research predicts
2016 will be the year of the connected
car this is car tech live for March
fifteenth 2012 r250 fifth show I am
Wayne Cunningham in the studio with
antuan goodwin and Mitch Chang on the
controls here Brian Cooley isn't here
yet again don't fret though he will be
back sometime i think in april he plans
on coming back he was pretty busy this
month though yeah i think he's actually
a frayed of the cars we have in our
garage right now we got some good ones
to discuss that later in the show yeah
but let's move on right away into this
story you know last year wait I had the
whole issue of unintended acceleration
or the previous year I don't know is a
long time ago it seems like and people
were saying oh these cars are just
taking off randomly like a Toyota Prius
apparently took off away from somebody
and they had trouble keeping control it
was racing down the freeway out of
control well that issue was sort of laid
to rest by a National Highway
Transportation Safety investigation and
Twitter's own engineers but CNN found
this memo amongst it was actually a memo
from a Japanese testers Japanese
engineers that were working on a system
in a Lexus actually the lexus ls460 and
said they found an unintended
acceleration problem according to cnn's
translation of the document what's
interesting is dates all the way back to
2006 yeah this this sort of confidential
document that they dug up and the big
sort of unintended acceleration stuff
can happen in 2010 so I guess the but
they're indicating here is that this may
be something that Toyota knew about long
before even people started making a big
noise about it yeah now see toyota is
saying that CNN is taking this this one
little phrase in this report somewhat
out of context at first toyota saying
that it's translated wrong even though
CNN got it translated three different
times and then toy it also says that
well this was actually in
testing the it was the LS 460 they were
the this test concerned and it concerned
the adaptive cruise control system on
the LS 460 and toyota says what happened
was they were testing this car and they
purposely sent a wrong impulse or
something to the system they told it you
know they sent some that a fault sensor
in which case the thing for a fraction
of a second just said ok you know
maximum acceleration which I don't know
why that would be the result of this
test but you know the the engineer found
this to be a problem and then they use
this on when they were working on a
separate car another car there's also
they were developing and toyota also
says that neither of these cars and
either these systems actually we're ever
brought to the US right i think the
other car is the one atl which is I
guess our toyota tundra yeah didn't hear
too many issues about people with toyota
tundra in unintended acceleration and I
think it's because I don't know if you
can get it out of cruise control on that
vehicle right I don't think you can in
the US yeah maybe another other other
countries other regions but yet I don't
think they have that that here so
whether this is actually indicative of a
wider problem with in Toyotas
electronics I don't know I mean it would
seem to be that from a toilet is saying
that it's a fairly limited thing issue
that they found out in 2006 and dealt
with mm-hmm whether it means that all
toyota you know vehicle electronics are
iffy and i think that's what CNN is
trying to dig up here i'm not really
sure what the point is but they
certainly had well the CNN article
actually which we will post in the show
notes to had some experts that commented
on this as well saying that well it
sounds like toilet I had an unintended
acceleration problem with a yeah right
actually identified way back when but
what's I guess you know playing the
devil's advocate looking at the other
side of the coin there though I mean
this is something an internal testing
situation so when you're testing crap
goes wrong that's the purpose of testing
is to find those things that are wrong
and to fix them without documents
surrounding this or more
and surrounding or exactly without
omniscient knowledge of what's happening
it leading up to this test and then
following this test it's difficult to
know if this is just oh yeah we had it a
bit of an issue here we worked that bug
out and moved on or if this is something
that he just kind of deprioritized and
and shuffled off to the side because it
was an acceptable level of failure yeah
I mean you think if they had a memo
about it and they said well let's make
sure we look at this in other vehicles
it is something they dealt with in in
fact CNN's finding of this memo almost
says that at where did you know
identified a potential problem and then
that will say I mean the fact that I
knew it was there was you know when you
test things when you crash tests and
when these when car companies internally
crash test cars I'm sure one or two of
them explodes but then it's like whoa
there's a bit of an issue there we fixed
that and then we went to our you know
our niche the testing yeah the problems
not there that's the whole purpose of
experimentation is part of the
scientific process I want to be that
crash test where the cars explode okay
yeah you know but if they find something
like that if the car does explode yeah
they can put bracing around the gas tank
yeah various structural changes to make
sure it doesn't explode but I kind of
you know the interesting thing is that
this this test is kind of if the issue
that they that they discover it in the
confidential document seems to be tied
into the adaptive cruise control system
and I don't know if anyone sort of made
a correlation between the unintended
acceleration cases of 2010 and vehicles
that were reported that we're actually a
data that were actually equipped with
adaptive cruise control or if there are
parts of that adaptive cruise control
system that were in place in vehicles
that were not equipped just deactivated
oh yeah that could be I mean certainly I
mean you've got the base level most of
these cars probably all these cars come
with basic cruise control right and and
also they're all drive-by-wire so you
understand it the the basic of giving
over throttle control to the ECU is
there whether or not the adaptive
control system is in place or not so
it's really kind of a complicated gray
area as far as like what's that
actually in the vehicles and whether
this issue that's been brought up even
has anything to do with the 2010 issues
and there's certainly plenty of those
2010 issues that were hoaxes or yeah
people trying to game toyota for money
or something like that people who got
like a previous decided they didn't want
it anymore yeah right or wanted new
priuses every year know what I knew like
yeah you know it's like those the people
who used to like before the phone issues
got really I guess when full warranties
got really a stringent people would like
find ways to quote break their phone at
about the time that the new phone comes
out so it's just like well I guess I
gotta get an upgrade yeah iphone 3d
Broca I needed to you know they can give
me a 3d s then yeah so speaking of a car
that actually had a bit of a well media
problem yeah the Chevy Volt this is my
Segway in our next story here the Chevy
Volt there was this issue supposedly a
bit bursting into flame or the battery
packs Catching Fire if it crashed which
was a very limited problem from what
we've reported before but that actually
caused an issue in sales right take
kossler sales a decline such that in or
that could have been part of the reason
why their sales declined but they had
sales of only about six hundred cars 600
Chevy Volts in January and that has
caused them actually to choose halt
production and they at the Chevy Volt
plant for five weeks right the idea
being that you don't want to keep
pumping these cars out for them to sit
on lots yeah so it's it starts costing
money you know if your if your supply
doesn't meet your demand so that's
that's kind of what they're doing here
yeah so they're idling the plant I mean
yeah I'd be nicer they had a surplus of
cars and they're practically giving them
away i mean we could have a volt what I
mean it doesn't work for any way for for
GM's benefit to be in that sort of
situation and then also the interesting
thing is like just couple weeks ago we
were saying that they actually raised
their sales target for 2012 where they
thought they were going to sell like
sixty thousand of these yeah and now
they're idling
plant for a couple of weeks because they
can't push him out to the Marcus because
the markets not gobbling them up as fast
as they're pushing him out yeah and you
know the sad side of the story is
there's thirteen hundred workers that
have to sit around for five weeks right
at this plan but there's some
interesting in the story there's some
interesting notes on the sales figures
they note that GM tartan said they
wanted to sell 10,000 of these cars last
year hmm they they did the 7,000
something 7671 all right so that's about
a c-grade yeah I think pass yeah yeah a
little over seventy percent they're
actually seventy-six percent you know
pretty clearly Nissan actually sold
almost 10,000 leaps yeah over over the
year too so interestingly see that
competition and certainly you know
Nissan beat them out on that and it's
you kind of wonder that because
obviously the leaf has much more limited
range than the than the Volt so I wonder
what you know what is driving those
sales well it's because if you're the
kind of person who's jumping into the EV
market right now you kind of are also
the kind of person who gets a custom
plate that says no gas right and you
can't do that with a volt you can with a
leaf you can like you can let your smug
flag fly in a leaf and just say that I
made the jump to complete electric I'm
not just testing the waters with a
gasoline car that can do electric range
yeah so I think that the perception
there is that especially for those sort
of early adopters people who already
have a second car and they just kind of
want to get an electric car for
commuting the volts more of a I don't
have a car I want to buy the greenest
car I can get yeah the Leafs like well
you know we got an SUV already for road
trips but they will get the leaf to
drive around town and I think that most
sort of early adopter EV drivers fit
into that mold where they're just like
oh I just kind of want to look for card
so that I can out smug and out green my
neighbor celebrities that sort of thing
yeah it totally makes sense and the yeah
with the the bolt you get sort of the
the half adopt not exactly a full-on
early adopter not not a full-on green
you get this at a half green effect and
there's probably fewer those people that
are already dead which is interesting
because you would think that
the one vehicle for everything sort of
approach would work best do you think
more people would be interested in like
picking up that not having to keep a
second vehicle but I think the fact is
that America is kind of a two-car
household kind of country once you get
outside of the extreme edges of the of
the country yeah yeah I think that's
true and also but one thing this makes
me wonder is will GM consider you know
will GM think well maybe we should have
just done full electric car and not
bothered with the whole you know gas
engine generally extended-range thing
well I mean I think that as people start
to kind of adopt it and they get more
comfortable with it the fact that the
Volt is more flexible than the leaf
lends itself to maybe a longer tail
right as far as when you start talking
about flyover States people who have
like really long commutes or people who
just want again again what do you just
want one car who only have space in
their garage for one car I mean that the
vaults not really out you know down for
the count in my opinion it just kind of
seems like right now when we're in the
early adopter stage it's that people
kind of want the most cutting-edge thing
and yeah in my mind and I sure in a lot
of people's mind full electric is the
most cutting-edge right and as far as
the volta not being down and out there's
a what supports that is the februari
sales were actually 1200 so they pretty
much double the sales / january and or I
guess I said jump seventy percent over
the prior month so yeah we'll follow the
volt sales coming up through the next
through the year to see if they are
going to meet their sales targets yeah I
mean I think it's a good thing they're
actually not popping too many out on the
market because that's you know the kind
of thing they did in the past and you
know end up with a lot of cars just
sitting in lobby sitting on a lot then
you end up with these like ridiculous
sales yeah that are good for the
consumer but not good for GM's bottom
line and not good for I think the EV
market when you when you start looking
at when investors start looking at well
you have X number of volts and just
sitting around why would we invest money
in this why would
GM invest money and something they're
not going to make cash on all right well
one thing they also note 2 is that will
probably help boost sales is that the
Volt can now get California's it is now
legal for the HOV Lane this was a change
that GM made to the the gas engine so
qualifies for the what we call the
partial zero-emission vehicle yeah
there's that ran five dollar gas yeah
it's definitely going to get a lot of
people kind of looking in that direction
as far as like well you know may work
out in the long run for me to ditch our
regular four-door sedan for something a
little bit more a little more green but
a little less prius c yeah I mean that
could def entire it to be interesting to
see as and and I wonder about this too
as you know more people see you say
their neighbors have a volt and their
neighbors sitting there go I'm like oh
yeah you know filled it up once this
month yeah you know and the neighbors
like ah ok well that's that's a pretty
good deal so well the neighbor effect is
actually it's interesting that you bring
that up where you know it's you know you
read in magazines and and and you know
this car exists but for a lot of people
seeing them around town is really the
kind of thing that gets you sort of
looking at it yeah you start seeing it
or you see one and then all of a sudden
you start seeing them everywhere and
that sort of thing kind of makes the
vehicle real in people's mind I think
for a number of people in the United
States the Volt's one of those concept
cars where you're just like yeah there
are they ever actually going to make it
alright well they are making it but I
just think that you know it just kind of
needs time to to spread and again but as
opposed to the leaf I feel like that you
have a better chance of seeing the
Fulton and and in in Utah yeah then you
would leave yeah it's interesting to you
because looking around San Francisco
here and this is obviously this area is
sort of a hotbed for early adopters and
people are going to jump on these you
know ultra green cards I certainly see a
lot more Leafs around especially in the
last couple of months between a
surprising amount of leaves just you
know roaming the roads around San
Francisco and yeah barely any votes I've
been seeing a couple of volts yeah but
they're mostly around around automotive
events yeah usually a journalist
I mean right yeah testing out another
one well let's move on to the issue of
the connected car which is a big area in
car technology and area with it you know
obviously we focus a lot of time and in
covering and there there's a new report
by this company juniper research does a
lot of analysis of consumer trends
things like that and they are predicting
100 million connected almost a hundred
million connected cars on the road by
2016 it's a lot of cars yeah what
they're saying is actually about 92
million vehicles will have internet
connectivity in 2016 and so that's four
years from now where they drawn the line
for internet connectivity would
something like on Star count uh I guess
it depends on if it's actually drawing
in data what they're saying is actually
going to drive most of this these
numbers is the connected phones you know
or in vehicle systems that are driven by
the data connection in your smartphone
this is like the Toyota and tuned system
this is like some of the other systems
that are starting to come out there like
Ford's Appling so and i can see that
because that's the that's really the
easy and cheap way to get connectivity
into a car it absolutely makes sense to
me that this would be the way it happens
right yeah because I mean the smartphone
market is pretty much booming yeah I
think anybody who's buying a new phone
now is probably buying something with
some sort of smartphone Internet
connectivity and yeah automakers giving
people an option for that only makes
sense yeah when they build integration
into the dashboard and you know you have
other things like Audi doing there their
built-in connected car they're built in
3g connection into the Audi the a six
seven and eight initially and eventually
the three yeah we've seen it in a three
and a lobbyist going today four and a
five to that kind of thing I mean yeah I
think a lot of companies will put in
these dedicated connections like that
the problem there is of course they
won't happen until the next upgrade to
that car and we know that happens pretty
slowly whereas car electronics are
actually starting to cycle a little
faster
right and and also when you get in the
you know the cars that most of us drive
the the economy cars the under thirty
thousand dollar cards it's much more
likely you're going to get a head unit
that can work with your smartphone as
opposed to a dedicated 3G or 4G
connection and that car right but on
those lines we also so last week was
last week or a couple weeks ago Mobile
World Congress actually I was a couple
weeks ago two weeks ago just before we
left for Virgin Eva right just for the
Dean of a show well HTC had demoed
something at that show that we've got an
article on here it's one of their phones
that when you dock it it automatically
goes into this car mode and it seems
like it's a you know they're definitely
thinking about the automotive market and
thinking about how they can make their
phones be the preferable phone for being
docked into a car right and once they
call it the car stereo clip that
actually makes the transfers the audio
feed over bluetooth and works with the
cars systems with the car stereo things
like that and so that you know the phone
can host certain approved functions like
navigation or you know audio things like
that right i mean the interesting thing
for me is that seem to recall the droid
one doing this it had like a car clip
that hasn't like a magnet in it and when
you clip the phone into it the magnet
trigger to car mode that i think is kind
of built into the core or at least used
to be built into the core of what
android is I'm not particularly sure
what's in words what's different here
other than its HTC's interfaith love it
or hate it HTC likes to do their own
sort of interface but they're sort of
sent to you I so this kind of to me
looks like you know they've kind of
built a car cradle mode into sense which
is I think something that's been missing
from from a lot of their phones for the
last couple generations so do you think
this will be something i will drive
people to look at HTC phones more when
they're considering a phone for their
car or phone for daily use well I mean
the automatic sort of
you know changeover is interesting but
it seems like you have to buy their car
stereo clip I do like that it seems like
the the connections are built into the
cradle so you can pretty much leave this
stuck on your dashboard or windshield
and plugged into your car at all times
and just get in the car and snap it in
as opposed to like a third party where
you have to you know snap your phone
into the thing and then you know it
shouldn't it initialize the bluetooth
pairing and then maybe if you're not
doing bluetooth physically do the 3.5
millimeter plug in every time so there's
a convenience factor here but then there
are also if you're if you're willing to
go those one or two extra steps and then
even if your phone doesn't have a car
mode built into it there are car mode
apps in the android market excuse me the
google play market right now and i mean
you could you could do this by yourself
but i guess that's sort of the thing
about android is that pretty much
anything that any OEM wants to you know
it out of the feature you can probably
do yourself mhm it's a little bit of
know-how but yeah i'm all for locking
people out of things that would be
considered distracting while driving and
making the things that you actually want
to do while driving easier yeah yeah
i'll be interesting to see you know when
this comes out ice well we'll have to
try to give it a test once once they
make this available but i would assume
this would count towards juniper
researchers hundred million internet
collections of cars or 92 million anyway
one thing that will definitely count in
that flavor is sprint actually signed a
deal vista now so they don't now it's
much beyond if they sign this deal but
they signed this deal to become the
wireless engine in Chrysler Group's you
connect program so Chrysler calls all
their telematics all there in in vehicle
entertainment systems information
systems you connect and they don't
differentiate between them either just
you connect yeah what does that mean it
means you got Bluetooth or maybe you got
an a ver maybe you've got some internet
connectivity or maybe there's an auto
net router in
your car we don't know it's all you
connect right it's not one feature just
a big bunch of stuff a huge umbrella
that's extremely confusing for me but
this is kind of cool though that sprint
they'd sign this deal with sprint
because you know that's kind of huge to
actually have a you know telecom
provider like this on board mm-hmm so
that definitely means there's going to
be some kind of dedicated connection
built into the end of the cars at least
a some option level or some you know
well let me they'd have to I mean even
Hyundai has blue and what is it what is
there a link link yes almost at blue and
me but even Hyundai's got telematics now
and I mean I kind of feel bad saying
even Hyundai like that they're pre
cutting-edge company now yeah but it
seems like everybody's kind of getting
on board with some sort of in-car
telematics you don't really have to do
anything but by the car and you're
you're going so yeah it's good to see
the Chrysler Group getting involved in
this yeah I guess we don't know if this
means that it will be a telematics
system like on Star where you punch an
operator and you're a punch a button and
get an operator and say oh my car
crashed or whatever or a system of apps
you know if they're going to power apps
and that kind of thing in in their their
dashboard maybe they don't even know yet
I mean it would have to be some sort of
like integration into the data if at
this point in the game just being able
to hit a button and talk to an operator
it's not a selling point anymore yeah i
mean that's that was on Star like half a
decade ago and that was great ving but
now it's got to be more built-in there's
got to be some sort of like web search
google search in the dashboard for
points of interest for it to even really
seem like it's worth doing this
otherwise why not just use your
bluetooth para phone if you're just
making a phone call like there's really
no need for a partnership there right on
the other side of the issue here verizon
is actually debuting a new telematics
telematics practice they're calling it
so another major telecom company
providing some kind of in-vehicle thing
now they haven't signed any d them and
announced many deals with any car
companies but what's interesting here is
they actually have this guy martin fall
who have met before
who used to be used to run Microsoft's
automotive practice mmm this is the guy
that over oversaw the development of
sync so you know and also the septic
going in the Hyundai Kia infotainment
systems too so you know that's pretty
good pretty good pedigree and he's going
to so he's got a lot of connections with
automakers and he's going over to
verizon and heading up a new you know in
vehicle telematics practice and I guess
they're say what I they talking about
here one as quote here he mentions their
4g LTE cloud analytics capabilities it's
talking about what they can do so you
know he's touting um you know Verizon's
4G LTE is being a good base or good data
pipe for you know that their telematics
right and we should mention the
telematics can mean pretty much any
connected aspect to a car yeah and I
mean even though like a lot of car a lot
of car stuff that you do in the car is
kind of low bandwidth you're searching
for points of interest you're getting
weather updates you that sort of thing
but I mean any sort of like jump in
speed if it takes you one second to
download a traffic update on 3g and it
takes you half a second on 4G I mean
that's half a second less that you've
been looking at the dashboard at waiting
for something to load and at another
half-second you can spend looking at a
car or you're doing like 70 miles per
hour that's a couple hundred feet of
asphalt that you can spend looking up so
the faster the connection in the car the
better I think yeah wait waiting for
things to update or you know if you have
a list of probably get some of the stuff
that showed up in that when we were
testing the Twitter and tune system well
just like doing something like a Bing
search for the nearest gas station yeah
or I mean he probably wouldn't want to
do this while you're rolling but then in
the in the Entune you can look up movie
times and purchase tickets on the movies
calm or like set up a reservation
through opentable so if you're you know
parked on the side of the road which you
probably should be if you're doing a lot
of button pushing you know being able to
make that table reservation
a couple of seconds faster means you can
get on the road faster yeah it's been
less time sitting in the car idling less
fuel wasted all that sort of thing right
it's also frustrating to sit there
waiting for a screen to load on in your
car when you know like on your cell
phone or at home on your computer little
load a lot faster right and I mean the
interesting thing about the the Entune
system is if powered by your phone so I
did it on a 4g phone and it was pretty
quick yeah I don't really have much
experience using it with an iphone with
a 3g connection but let me I could you
know i'd imagine that it would still be
pretty quick but if you can be blazing
quick sure why not yeah i found myself
using the 3g phone waiting for Bing
results to come up waiting a significant
amount of time to which was it was a
little annoying and I thought that might
be a killer for the system that if it
doesn't really update fashion out there
and it might have been more maybe is
more of an iphone issue as opposed to
android gonna be android powers it
better maybe it works better with
android yeah when when they demonstrated
the the Entune system for us at the
camry launched last year all of the cars
had droid x's in them yes i'm thinking
like yeah they probably well maybe they
just didn't want to put iphones in all
the cars because it does look a lot
cooler when you can go like and then you
got the system here and then you just
toss the phone in a cup holder yeah with
an iphone you'd have to be plugged up to
USB and there'd be like a cable and it's
not a sexy quote-unquote for like a
press demo so maybe that's the reason
why but yeah the wireless yeah the
wireless interaction with the phone in
the car is much neater it seems to be at
some point the Bluetooth connection is
going to be a bottleneck for that speed
so getting back to verizon here i'm
thinking they're probably talking about
embedded sort of things that are
actually going to be in the vehicle
themselves because i think 4g is way
faster than then that sort of bluetooth
pipe i can possibly be so yeah yeah and
personally you know I think the having
the connection built into the car is
it's obviously a much more solid way to
go I don't know it's certainly you know
I think it's I think it's a better
connection generally running it through
a phone is sort of a kludge
yeah well you know I like that that you
know that the different solutions exist
yeah I mean personally I I kind of enjoy
it and I prefer being able to run things
through the phone the interesting thing
about in tune is that that apps on your
phone so you can start the drive you can
start the navigation process before you
even get in the car you can start you
know the the opentable destination
search from the Entune app before you
know while you're walking to your car
yeah and then just hop in and in start
moving it's something that's embedded in
the vehicle maybe wouldn't be as
seamless there that's true i mean i was
in cons to both sides yeah there's
definitely different ways of doing it
and you know i think at least currently
with the prices and all that that you
know if you have say a toyota yaris the
phone integration solution is actually
probably more likely than having a whole
chipset and yeah if you get a toyota
yaris the suction cup on the windshield
is probably the best one for you yeah
most likely but well so we'll be looking
forward to seeing what is going to come
out of this verizon practice if we'll
see some new car makers announced 4G
connections into the car because they'll
be excited we haven't actually seen 4G
connection into a car just yet but
falling on our whole connected car talk
here are news stories here which we have
a bunch of them this week BMW this is
just a little small note your BMW
announced adding to their whole app
interconnectivity they've got the
they're adding stitcher now they've had
pandora mog facebook twitter i think
they've got anything else in those apps
yet yeah you got that weird mini connect
thing oh right yeah but yeah stitcher
being like I like to think of it as like
the stream podcast but they're
apparently they I guess they like to say
radio shows yeah but yeah it basically
allows you to to stream a curated
collection of like five styles and
podcasts right which I'd assume would
have us on there too I think so i
haven't looked at it in a while but I
had that we're on there well I think you
can choose the am sure we are in there
well they says access to over 5,000
radio show so maybe we didn't make the
cut well I mean the thing is if if the
podcast company is if you have a podcast
and you
to be on stitcher I think it's a key
like again it's accurate list so you
have to send them a special feed if you
can't just punch in an RSS feed in the
stitchery go like yeah I want that
unless things have changed again it's
been a hate to admit it but it's been
about a year since i've used stitcher so
maybe things have changed but i think
they've got a lot of the you know the
big shows on there you know the they got
the NPR on there they've got who i can't
think of who else is on there adam
carolla's on there if you can stand to
listen to that guy for more than an hour
at a time but yeah it's interesting that
it's on there and I mean even if you
don't use stitchers is good news because
it's proof that BMW still actively
courting more more more of these
internet streaming audio apps so I think
it's safe to assume that you know
eventually they'll get around to all of
them yeah it's interesting the way it
works in the BMW is that with Facebook
and Twitter and this is kind of like in
tune as well you have a the BMW
ConnectedDrive app and that actually
gives you access to Facebook and Twitter
in the the the cars interface and so I'm
assuming they added stitcher to that
list now Pandora and mog you actually
have to launch those apps separately
yeah and if you're using an iphone you
can only launched one at a time so
slowly you can't really listen to
pandora and mog at the same time well
that's true so there's that but I mean
you couldn't do so your Shores are
saying is you can't be listening to
pandora and then send a tweet that fizz
I'm in my BMW and it's 72 degrees
Fahrenheit exactly yeah you're sort of
then you have to go to the phone switch
apps on the phone and then go back to
the interface right which is not an
ideal that's not a seamless solution and
I imagine somebody you know well there
you have to be able to protect center in
the bay area here I'm sure they're
looking at ways to make that that work
better because they seem to have a good
handle on that so right we'll be looking
to see what they do and how this to have
this set your implementation comes I
guess the next time we get a BMW and
you'll reacquaint yourself a stitcher or
well oh yeah maybe I will I think it's
actually worth checking out to see if
we're
actually on there yeah um just cuz now
i'm curious my ego wants to know if i'm
on stitcher right now yeah you gotta be
able to listen to some stitcher and I
was actually looking briefly at their
site here and I don't see us pop right
up but I'm sure were in there somewhere
I'm sure but he'll outs on there how it
is sex I just found it but oh yeah there
you go if was that loud Zaun their we're
on there somewhere I sure hope so so
that is all the news for this week let's
let's go out on the road Antoine and I
take a little drive in the 2012 BMW 650i
this is a big coupe the 6-series is a
big I got a GT style coupe but it's not
curvy like a lot of the Italian
manufacturers BMW makes us it has really
straight lines in this but Antoine you
don't really care for the look of this
car though well I mean it's not my
favorite BMW it definitely looks a lot
better than the old model i keeps now
that now that this one's in the garage i
keep seeing the the old six series
around town it just looks horrible it's
definitely a better looking car but
still far from what I would consider
attractive yeah i like it i think they
improve this look a lot from the
previous generation this is really the
first of the new generation because the
previous one lasted from about two
thousand three to 2010 with maybe some
minor updates there we go and that is a
courtesy of the fact we're in sport mode
plus which takes off the traction
control and stiffens up the suspension
and also does a couple other things it
makes the acceleration more responsive
like that hey doesn't do so well over
this rough terrain like it on that
smooth sort of area it was nice but that
left turn is kind of bumpy I think I'm
gonna go into comfort for the rest of
this review talk about the cabin tech
here along with this fantastic beggin
Olufsen audio system this is the premium
audio system here it's i got 3,800
dollar option 1200 watts 16 speakers
sounds excellent looks excellent yeah
it's big about these nights metal
grilles and they actually have this
little they call it an acoustic lens
that pops up in the center of the dash
very neat stuff but we also have an
excellent app integration here
this is the part that just cracks me up
so this is like a BMW connected sort of
things you install on your cell phone
and then your phone talks to the car
we've got Facebook Twitter web radio and
calendar calendar is pretty cool because
actually looks at all the appointments I
have my calendar and shows those on the
screen here but let's take a look at
what's up and pushed it to Twitter today
so we got brian Tong here we've got
automotive news we've got one of my own
tweets so if we click on what a quick
one of my tweets here it shows the text
on the screen along with my beautiful
picture and that if I put the cursor
over this read out item here we get this
wonderful time out driving at the big
BMW 650i yesterday red car had those
rain-soaked roads well that what do you
think of the car reading out Twitter I
eat the thing about that the Twitter
function is it's cool for the person
sitting in the passenger seat but it put
it makes you go through so many steps to
get to the reading out of the feed that
by the time you get there you've already
kind of read it twice that's true I'd
say you know you have to you have to go
into the menu you have to go to Twitter
and then you have to scroll through the
Twitter feed to fund the tweet that you
want it to read it's only 140 characters
by the time you hit the button for read
you could have read it already right and
glanced at it and see it of course if
they follow mrs. new guidelines about
car entertainment systems or car in
vehicle information systems is they
point out they only want that they're
recommending to only 30 characters yeah
text visible at any time at any time
yeah it like period right they don't
want scrolling text either oh yeah
that's uh I don't know that it's a cool
feature and I will say this the part of
Twitter integration that I think is
actually useful is the integration with
the navigation so when you punch in a
destination so you you're leaving work
you're headed home you can tell it to
tweet your ETA so i can say i'm i'm
leaving work now
expecting to arrive or wherever you're
going at in and out burger and in 45
minutes so that you can let people know
where you're going that you're probably
going to be a little late but then you
don't have to pick your phone up and
send a text message that is a pretty
cool and useful feature actually yeah as
opposed to just being like I don't know
what Joe's doing everything else is just
it seems like they the world that they
already had Twitter in the car and
they're like well we'll just do some fun
things with it but as far as actually
being useful that's kind of the only way
that I see that sort of Twitter or
Facebook integration being being
interesting well what they should do
actually is you know is the first screen
you get is just a list of all the
Twitter say Twitter tweets that you have
in your feed and they should have a
button right there it lets you but lets
you make the car read it out I mean just
like read all of them again in order you
can do it individually huh you know I'm
added I don't see any reason why they
couldn't do that as opposed to making
you go into the tweet itself where you
can actually see the whole suite on the
screen and then pushing the extra little
button that says read it out to me
what's also weird is that it tries to
read URLs yeah so it'll go you know you
should check out this camera HTTP colon
slash slash cnet.com respect less of
that now in our little video there there
was a little point where you got a
little squirrely with the car well was
trying to do a donut but we were in
sport mode Sport Plus mode so it
actually did let the tail swing out a
little bit we had like a nice big so
open flat parking lot area there but it
still stepped in and in and caught the
car like midway through my perfect
bernal so it it seems like it will let
you have a little bit of fun but it
won't let you wreck it well I mean it
may let you wreck it but it'll try it's
best not to yeah that's what I found
with BMWs with that their their traction
control with their when you get into
their you know support plus traction
control system yet does and even in the
regular DT dynamic traction control they
call it there's a certain point and it's
like it'll let the rear end like drift
out like five feet or something you know
but it's right but it does really step
in at a certain point and say okay
that's enough I think there's a
stability control button that you could
like turn it off yeah and
so then then if you just want to sit
there and ruin a perfectly good set of
rear tire right pretty fast car yeah a
lot of power yeah kind of soft though
even in it will I mean in the Sport Plus
mode we were on a really rough road and
and I do we have adaptive suspension in
that car it did yeah okay so then the
Sport Plus mode it it felt really rough
over that really rough road but I think
it's a big car so it still manages to
feel kind of a GT comfortable yeah even
if you're on like a relatively smooth
Highway expansion joints probably won't
bother you too much well there's a big
difference between this the the sixth
series and the way BMW does there
there's suspension tuning and say like
mercedes-benz now driving an s-class
with the aromatic suspension that I mean
does a fantastic job just like oh yeah
there's a pothole area I didn't feel it
yeah you know in this one you will feel
the bumps in the potholes to a certain
degree I mean the car will mask them
pretty well but you know you'll
definitely know there's road that you're
going over right so it's pretty good on
that you know I like the steering feel
on this car I think the it does what BMW
been doing you know an excellent job
with four years of making it feel like a
car that you're driving making it feel
like you've got to be engaged with the
driving experience yeah and it doesn't
actually feel or look as big as I think
it is I think the six series is is about
as long if not maybe a hair longer than
seven series but when you see it in the
video there it looks like a much smaller
car and when you're sitting in it unless
you're trying to like ease out into an
intersection a blind intersection you
don't really start you don't really
realize how far out the nose is because
it does give you really good visibility
you are always kind of aware of where
your corners are ya and I Duke I do like
that about the vehicle yeah I liked it
you know conservative the one of the big
sixes or the big six is the phrase it
always comes to mind for this car
because it does have a certain laughed
and feel to it and it is you know most
be above your cars yeah it's up there
with the seven has been a you know a
decent sized one and certainly the
insurance / give them five
but interesting enough we actually saw
the m6 version of this at Geneva rightly
the last week and those you know they
use actually the same engine
architecture they both use the 4.4 liter
v8 with two twin scroll turbo but they
managed to get my hundred more
horsepower out of the m6 version right
which may just mean bigger turbos
generally possibly are they using the
twin scroll twin turbo situation and the
m5 I would assume yeah m6 it so it's
makes look the same engine out of the m5
it is yeah but stuffed into a coupie
kind of car all right a car that may be
more deserves the M hey you know I think
the m5 earns its in bed yeah I haven't
driven it but I've seen a lot of it on
paper it definitely earns the embed I
mean it did I think the interesting
thing about that having different M cars
the m5 the m3 of course and I don't know
if we have it we don't have an imp this
generation but they do allow people to
choose their level of involvement so
like a car like the m5 and the in the m6
I've always been kind of like cue cards
you know they're really big they're
faster than they look definitely whereas
something like the the m3 is you know
more of a detective to the track it did
say it feels way more comfortable and
that sort of let the tail hang out
environment where you know and then and
even more so it's something like an m
coupe or I guess 11 m yes case yeah a
car that you don't think deserves the
imagine yeah the little one I think BMW
got a little profligate with the M badge
actually but I need to come back to the
looks of this car and this is a point of
contention you you mentioned earlier you
said you'd never met a BMW M or a BMW 6
Series II that you like well I mean I
did see like a nice vintage m6 last
night with the really sort of boxy shape
yeah um I got that look kind of cool I
got one up on my screen here Mitch can
you bring this up here yeah yeah saw one
of those last night with the center
exhaust yeah it was red
and I thought that's kind of cool in a
sort of retro kind of way but I mean I
think even that it seems like the the
back end of the car came off of another
vehicle it just seems very very front
heavy um visually yeah something I still
don't love it I like the look at this
car a lot this is the 84 633 CSI which
is comes to about the last I don't think
they made MIT or made the 633 after this
year it's got a particularly high
greenhouse something you don't really
see too much in current cars but i don't
know i i'd definitely like this car a
lot i like the way the oh the front
looks it's kind of nice and it's got
that well they called this card the
shark was its nickname and it had a you
know that mean obviously i hit a fan of
this got a car for a while you know the
nose is kind of low the rear end drops
off nicely that was the problem with the
when they revived the six series in last
decade that they had to make the trunk
the cycle he said a wart like thing yeah
and the new one has not quite the drop
off is the original but it still looks
like part of the car at least right so
from that since you know I like it and I
like the new one one quite a bit and I
think other people had seen that here
might might disagree with your
assessment because well I mean again I
think we're coming off of like five
years of the worst-looking car ever
maybe a little more than five years
actually but the the previous generation
that the the the 2011 would do when they
come out 2006 2000 between 2000 2004 was
actually the the right revival of the
sixth year there we go yeah so from then
till about last year I mean it was a
mess yeah it was a disgusting mess of
the vehicle so the new six it just I
don't know it something about it and I'm
pretty sure this is part of the appeal
of it but it it doesn't look ugly but at
the same time it just kind of looks
plain and dull and most from most angles
and then from the rear it still seems a
little visually complex to me yeah yeah
you know it certainly doesn't have the
nice big curves of like an Italian
design cut when you think of like a you
know Italian GT with big swooping
fenders and stuff like that yeah
just looks like a semi from the side it
looks like a cigar I mean there aren't
very many character lines or any sort of
it's it's not a car that looks fast
sitting and I think that that's
something that this that the 6-series
needs it needs some sort of like it
needs to look fast and it just to me
looks big yeah and so again I respect it
i think it's an improvement over the
last generation but I'm not in love with
it definitely well I I respect how you
brought you you bolstered your opinion
here but I still love it I still like
the looks of it and it's time actually
to take a look at what use are currently
in our garage we've got the Jaguar XK RS
which is actually much much it's kind of
it's a GT car too and it probably looks
a bit better than the 6-series lot
better than the six here yet and the
2012 porsche 911 this is the porsche 911
update which we like to look up quite a
bit as well we also took a quick spin in
the the fiat 500 abarth oh right yeah
we've got that that write-up on the site
right now the Fiat Abarth the 500 abarth
the fun little fast car and these are
reviews of the Porsche 911 and Jaguar
xkr-s should be up next week so that's
