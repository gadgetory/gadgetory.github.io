in the last couple of years one of the
newest features we've come across is
rechargeable batteries so we're going to
take a look at three different models
the logic circle the canary flex and the
neck your are Lowepro to see which one
is best
to compare these models we're going to
look at three different things design
features and price so in terms of design
all of these models look fine but you
really want an option that's durable and
is going to last and is really easy to
use so my pick for the easiest is
definitely the canary flex mostly
because it has a really nice
weatherproof design so you can use it
for indoor or outdoor use and also the
magnetic charger on the back is super
easy to attach and detach but in terms
of features the neck your our low pro
really nails it so the first thing it
offers is seven days of free event-based
storage so if motion or audio is
detected it'll save that for you totally
for free you can upgrade but you don't
have to in addition to that this model
works with if and Samsung smartthings
which is more smart home integrations
than these other two models offer the
our low pro also promises to last on its
rechargeable battery for anywhere from
four to six months which is definitely
longer than the logic circle which has
about a two to six hour battery life and
the canary flex which lasts for up to
two months then in terms of price both
the canary plugs and a large circle cost
two hundred dollars so they're they're
competitive but the neck your our low
pro costs more at two hundred and fifty
so you really have to think if those
extra features are worth it all in all
its close between the neck your our low
pro and the canary flex but the Flex
ultimately edges it out because it has
great design nice features and it costs
a little less</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
