full of small subtle tweaks but there
are also some bigger changes that will
undoubtedly take some getting used to
here are seven of the most drastic
changes one of the most notable
differences is Notification Center it's
now called cover sheet and looks and
works much like the iOS lockscreen swipe
in either direction on alerts to take
action or clear them swipe from either
edge of the display to launch the camera
or view your today panel and your
notification feed will now be broken up
into sections for most recent earlier
today yesterday and so on before the
update you could for such on the left
edge of the screen to switch between
recent apps with iOS 11 that no longer
works will have to revert back to double
pressing the home button to switch
between apps Apple touted the iPads new
drag-and-drop feature when it unveiled
iOS 11 in June but what the company
didn't tell us is the iPhone has it as
well I'll be it in very limited
situations in the Photos app for example
you can drag a photo to an album instead
of tapping around NFC is no longer
limited to just Apple pay in the future
you will be able to scan NFC tags to
pair Bluetooth devices learn about
products and much more for current
devices the feature will be limited to
the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 plus when you
swipe up from the bottom of the screen
on your iPhone to view control center
you're in for a surprise
it's now a continuous column of buttons
and sliders instead of a three page
setup brightness and volume are easier
to adjust and you can now customize
control center by adding removing and
rearranging items within the Settings
app a long-overdue change to the App
Store is coming with a more visually
appealing interactive design the App
Store looks nothing like it used to the
new design will highlight new apps and
developers and it looks a lot like Apple
music only instead of songs and artists
it's games and apps the process of
taking a screenshot editing and then
sharing is also getting streamlined with
iOS 11 installed when you take a
screenshot a small preview thumbnail
will show up in the bottom left corner
tap on it to mark up crop edit delete or
share your screenshot for more tips and
tricks and other how to's be sure to
