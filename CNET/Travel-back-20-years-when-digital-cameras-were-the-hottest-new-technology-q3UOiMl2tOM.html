with this digital camera well look all I
have to do now he's plugged into my
computer and it works with a PC and a
Mac choose the image that I want I think
I'll take this one and I've got a
picture in about two minutes
pretty good shot huh and it's really
fast a lot faster than one hour photo so
with digital technology like this
driving to your local photo Matt could
be a thing of the past
digital cameras which record images
directly into memory rather than on film
allows cyber shooters to snap and
download images directly into their
computers most people shoot their
pictures with conventional cameras and
film but now with digital cameras you
can actually store those images with
removable memory cards like this or on
the hard drive or even on the internal
memory of the camera you just connect
the camera to your computer download the
images you want and voila
you've got pictures Alex Berliner is a
Hollywood photographer whose job depends
on making the front page using a
high-end digital camera and high-speed
phone lines alex's images span the globe
in minutes tell me more
when we're shooting for the Hollywood
quarter the Academy Awards we will shoot
these modem them to production they will
go directed press and be printed at
think around midnight the food chicks
and I kind of hybrid looks nothing like
a standard camp this is the the new b-2
stealth bomber of digital cameras at a
cost of over $20,000 the food Jaques
Nikon uses removable PCMCIA style hard
drives up to 131 megabytes and will
store up to about 70 images you see the
guest militants carrying these things
when they go to somewhere like buffer
because what they'll do is they'll shoot
some stuff they will get at a cellular
system hooked up to the Mac and
unloading stuff back once the image is
shot the hard drive or flash card can be
downloaded and stored in a computer
there the images cropped or color
corrected by a Photoshop a graphic
software program saved in a compressed
image format then transmitted by a modem
anywhere on the planet are you please
step in please also on the high end
portrait quality prints in about two
minutes are available at tourist haunts
everywhere the three chips Sony dkc 5000
has a resolution of over a million
pixels okay and if we just have a little
smile in this direction it's hooked
directly to a processor and dry prints
on photographic paper pop out and yep in
under two minutes
look at that do look at that hairdo the
question is do you want to keep them
professionals aren't the only ones using
digital cameras companies like Kodak
Apple Casio and I can't offer them for
an average cost of $800 and these low
inversions store about 54 images the
resolution that compared to that of a
$20 bucks camera engineers advertisers
and businesses use these digit cams
daily real estate agents take pictures
in the field download them into their
computers and right into weekly listings
Andrew MacDonald and his buddy Tom are
big-time burrito eaters with a web page
devoted entirely to the burrito is what
burritos yeah there's such a huge plate
of food using the just released casio QV
10 the burrito brothers scour the city
for the ultimate roll then download the
pictures into their sometimes daily
burrito review this is a free burrito so
you know we're still hungry just through
this fun thing and Tommy I didn't get
there you go out take pictures of food
take rest of each other eating the food
the people serving us the food and we
create this little website we have it
running right now
cyber gasps it's the next problem we're
facing on the net
