closer to reality it doesn't have a
super cool name like opportunity or
curiosity yet but the Mars 2020 Rover
does have some really awesome concept
art this artist render is the newest
look at NASA's future Mars rover NASA
featured the concept as an image of the
day and refreshed our collective
memories as to the rover's planned
capabilities
it'll be searching for habitable
conditions and microbial life from the
red planet's ancient past
the Mars 2020 Rover takes a lot of its
design cues from curiosity but there's a
new drill on board that will collect
rock and soil samples in addition its
wheels have been reworked so hopefully
we won't be experiencing as much wear
and tear as time goes on the concept
will continue to evolve as we get closer
to the rover's planned launch in mid
2020 one of NASA's goals with this Rover
is to assess potential hazards and
resources for future human explorers and
dovetails nicely with NASA's plan to
send a crew to Mars in the 2030s as for
where this rover will land once it gets
to the Red Planet NASA's got its landing
sites narrowed down to three potential
spots Northeast iris and ancient part of
the planet surface jezero crater which
used to have a Martian Lake and Columbia
Hills which may have been home to an
ancient hot spring I don't know about
you guys but a Martian hot spring sounds
pretty relaxing we'll be keeping a close
eye on the development of the Mars 2020
