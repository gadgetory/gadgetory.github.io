the sanam xp7 now this phone is
available in Canada for about 750
Canadian dollars unlock and can be yours
for about $100 with the two-year
contract depending on your carrier we
should be hearing more about a US
release later this year now the phone is
unapologetically bulky it weighs half a
pound and it's about 20 millimeters
thick eight tenths of an inch it
technically fits in my pocket but
certainly not comfortable now there's
just one exposed port that headphone jet
up on the top
everything else is sealed up tight to
keep out dust in water and the phone can
survive in up to two meters of water for
30 minutes that's about six and a half
feet it's also ready to survive drops of
about two meters out the hard surfaces
like concrete or you probably guess that
from the rubber shell of course that
also means that the 4800 milliamp hour
battery is locked up tight but it gets
about 40 hours of talk time I was
generally fine when I was away from an
outlet for a day or two or three the
phone is a 1.2 gigahertz quad-core
processor and it tackled all the apps
and games I threaded with ease there's
also 16 gigs of internal storage and the
phone runs Android 4.4 KitKat called
Kali was great though I tested it on
AT&amp;amp;T LTE network here in San Francisco
your experience will vary in Canada the
noise cancelling microphone help people
hear what I'm saying pretty clearly and
if you're surrounded by loud machinery
don't worry the speakerphone up top here
it gets really loud the display is a bit
of a sore point it's got a lonely 800 by
480 pixel resolution and runs into
problems with color shifting colors
start to look washed out when you look
at the phone off axis but even though
the colors can look a bit off you'll
always be able to see the screen pretty
clearly even in direct sunlight the
phone also supports things like
push-to-talk and that red button on the
side can call up a 24/7 emergency
support hotline aim to help workers who
might be alone in a need of assistance
somewhere now the Sun XP 7 isn't a phone
for everyone in fact it's not really a
phone for most people there are things
that could do better I'd like to see
high resolution screen and the camera
could be better both of those would make
for a really great experience if you say
want to share something with your fellow
campers or if you're working offset and
you want to share something with folks
back in civilization
that being said if you work keep you out
in the wild or you just spend a lot of
time camping and you want a device that
can survive the sentiment xb7 is going
to get the job done
I'm a trout thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
