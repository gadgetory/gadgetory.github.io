off to friends as smart shades but let's
get one thing straight these are premium
products an installation like this will
set you back thousands of dollars but
say you've got the cash and you want the
shades the next question is which ones
should you buy to help with the decision
I decided to get together two of the
leading brands
Lutron Serena shades and some fiy
motorized shades this is a smart home
showdown I'm considering three factors
in this showdown the ease of
installation control for the price and
noise unless you're willing to pay
somebody else to do it installing a
smart shade is going to take time and
effort some fee is separate battery
packing is harder to install and change
than Lutron's in shape batteries but
sarena shades have their own hassles
like requiring you to drill holes
through the mounting plate itself so
when it comes to installation between
Lutron and some fee it's a tie
control and price are connected for
these products some fees shades start at
about 300 bucks which is about $50
cheaper than Lutron sheets but Lutron
shades also have a lot more features out
of the box you get app control and voice
control through Siri or Alexa and all of
that is just for the price of the $350
shade and an $80 hub for similar
features some fee makes you purchase an
additional hundred dollar bridge and a
$70 hub so Lutron clearly wind control
for the price finally when you're
looking at noise emission soompi
definitely loses at least for the
battery-powered shades that I installed
when some fee motors operate they emit
buzzing noise as opposed to Lutron's
nearly silent shades when you consider
all the factors Lutron sarena shades
definitely come out on top and that's
why we install them here at the scene at
