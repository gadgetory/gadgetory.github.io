this time on pocket filemaker we're
going to have a look at some basics of
stock frame animation and how to get you
started now when we think of animation
we normally think of two extremes either
a blockbuster visual effects masterpiece
from Hollywood or traditional cartoon
style animation with handcrafted
characters essentially stock frame
animation is the process of recording a
lot of still pictures in the one video
or film sequence our eyes are easily
fooled and we see animation as the end
result in fact think back to flipbook
animations and you'll know that you
don't actually even need a camera to
create the illusion of motion pictures
so how can we make animation on our
smartphones there's lots of apps that
help you stitch together still images to
create pocket animations and some were
quite professional recording features
too but we're going to learn more about
those in a minute the vine was launched
recently as Twitter's answer to social
video sharing you know what it's really
simple but very powerful download the
free app to your iPhone create a user
profile and simply start shooting the
camera window doesn't even have any
buttons simply touch the screen to
record and lift your finger to pause and
touch the screen again to keep going it
records to a 6-second looping video file
and with a little practice and patience
you can create some animation clips this
very same way now to get started simply
make sure your iPhone is on a tripod or
hold up so it remains nice and sturdy
next fire up vine and frame your
animation surface in this case simple
whiteboard draw your first picture then
lightly touch the screen to record a
very short slice of video like a frame
next change the picture by adding or
altering part of your drawing then
repeat the process to report the next
section of frames eventually you can end
up with 6 seconds of hand-drawn
animation that you can truly call your
own
there's many great little apps to help
you record animations and stop-motion
photography on your phone here's a few
of my personal favorites miniatures is
an app that turns everyday scenes in the
time-lapse miniature settings thanks to
clever use of soft focus areas giving
the impression of very shallow depth of
field you can choose a variety of
different intervals between recording
frames plus a number of detailed image
control variables - very powerful and
great fun to play with so long as you
can keep this smartphone nice and steady
during recording animation creator
Express is a powerful stop motion
drawing up which gives you impressive
control over your finger drawing artwork
and the version I'm using here is
completely free great for learning the
basics behind how to draw objects in
motion and to share them with your
social networks in selecting stop-motion
studio is the answer if you're into
claymation of filming and stop-motion
sequences now it allows you to see the
previous frame your shot and positioning
your new movie in relationship to that
which is a really powerful feature and
simple enough for kids to understand and
use to bring on a rainy day well there
you have it if you haven't tried
creating your own animations yet hope
you have inspires you to give it a shot
thanks again for watching happy
animating we'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
