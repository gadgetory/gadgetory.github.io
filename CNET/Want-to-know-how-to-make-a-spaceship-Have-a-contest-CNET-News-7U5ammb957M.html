founder executive chairman of the XPrize
foundation and the founder detective
chairman of singularity University I got
excited about opening up space since my
childhood in the Apollo program and I
read this book called the spirit of st.
Louis that chronicles Lindbergh's
journey in New York to Paris and said a
prize can open up aviation may be a
prize can open up space and so I came up
with this ten million dollar prize and
just recently an amazing author as
chronicled the whole XPrize story in
this in this book how to make a
spaceship and it tells my journey and
I'm hoping that this book can inspire
the next generation of moon shots the
way Lindbergh's book inspired me in this
book you'll meet Jeff Bezos you'll need
Paul Allen you'll meet Richard Branson
you'll meet the teams competing for this
ten million dollar prize and you'll see
me announcing a 10 million dollar prize
without having the 10 million and then
going making a hundred and fifty pitches
to every CEO out there and being told no
over and over and over again until I
finally meet the Ansari family long
story but one of technology and
regulatory hurdles and financing hurdles
really making this dream of spaceflight
possible on the heels the XPrize being
one we built an extraordinary board from
larry page 2 james cameron Elon Musk is
funded a 15 million dollar global
learning XPrize we have a 10 million
dollar qualcomm tricorder xprize for
reinventing healthcare and we're really
focused on on launching X prizes that
will take on the world's biggest
problems we launched 120 million dollars
worth of prizes another 100 million are
in development it's really about
changing the world with entrepreneur
setting big goals
