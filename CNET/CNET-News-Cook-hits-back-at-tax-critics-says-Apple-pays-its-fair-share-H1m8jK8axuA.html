about to give will be the truth the
whole truth nothing but the truth so
help you God I do so help me God we pay
all the taxes we owe every single dollar
we not only comply with the laws but we
comply with the spirit of the laws we
don't depend on tax gimmicks we don't
move intellectual property offshore and
use it to sell our products back to the
United States to avoid taxes we don't
stash money on some Caribbean island
unfortunately the tax code has not kept
up with the digital age we recommend a
dramatic simplification of the corporate
tax code this reform should be revenue
neutral eliminate all corporate tax
expenditures lower corporate income tax
rates and implement a reasonable tax on
foreign earnings that allows the free
flow of capital back to the United
States can you understand there's a
perception of unfair advantage here mr.
Cooke sir I see this is a very complex
topic that I'm glad that we're having
the discussion and but I honestly
speaking I don't see it as being unfair
i'm not an unfair person that's not who
we are as a company or who i am as an
individual and so I i would not preside
over that honestly I don't see it in
that way I thank you i'm at a time what
I really want to ask is why the hell I
have to keep updating the apps on my
iphone all the time and why you don't
fix that I thank you mr. chairman third
we're trying to make them better all the
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
