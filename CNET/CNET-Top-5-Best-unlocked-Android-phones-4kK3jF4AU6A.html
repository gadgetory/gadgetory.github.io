means signing away two years of your
life to a carrier if you're a citizen of
the world who's accustomed to picking up
contract free SIM cards and whatever
exotic destination you found yourself in
what you need is an unlocked phone
they're more expensive than a subsidized
phone but you hate being under the heel
of your carrier you can't put a price on
freedom so here are the top five unlock
Android phones courtesy of senior editor
Jessica dull Court and associate editor
Lynn Locke
starting off at number five the Samsung
Galaxy s4 Google Play edition or GPE yes
you heard me right the s4 s5 might be
the latest and greatest but if you can
sacrifice a fraction of an inch on
screen size the s4 is still an
outstanding phone yet stock Android
4.2.2 unsullied by Samsung's TouchWiz
improvements quad-core processor 5 inch
1080p screen and a replaceable battery
that's pretty easy to come by
50 bucks ain't cheap for last year's
phone number for the Sony Xperia Z too
hard to track down in the US may be
impossible to track down in the US but
arguably the best phone on this list
when it comes to specs 2.3 gigahertz
quad-core processor 20 megapixel camera
waterproof is dust proof and it even
records 4k resolution video costs around
600 pounds in the UK which translates
approximately into way more money than
you ever want to spend on a phone that's
why it's here at number four coming in
at number three the Motorola MOTO G
here's the flipside of the coin
modest specs no LTE and the camera is
unusually bad but the price is just $179
unlocked and unsubsidized that is a
crazy steal for a name-brand phone
running Android 4.3 and a 4.5 inch
screen and if you squint hard it kind of
looks like a moto X but for a few
hundred more go with number 2 the Google
Nexus 5 350 bucks gets you the best most
affordable Nexus phone yet LTE
compatible Android 4.4 KitKat and
deep integration with Google now it's a
slightly better camera than you'll find
on the Moto G but not by much if you're
a hardcore Android fan though nothing's
gonna satisfy your google fix better
than this guy but before we compromise
on camera quality how about number one
HTC One m8 Google Play edition the
latest and greatest from HTC packs the
best sound a beautiful design great
camera a Snapdragon 801 processor and a
pure version of Android KitKat it's a
killer phone that will turn heads and
have you grinning all day but here's the
thing
it's $800 you can get two Nexus fives
for the same amount of money and still
have money left over for that prepaid
Parisian SIM card plus it's Paris and no
one's gonna judge you for loving two
phones at the same time so there you go
five unlocked phones that will liberate
you from your carrier and keep you
nimble as you travel the globe for more
