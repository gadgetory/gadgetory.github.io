forever I'm Bridget carrion this is your
cnet update oh how the mighty have
fallen what's left of the social news
aggregator dig has been bought by beta
works and dig will be buried inside news
dot me it's a daily news app and email
digest did has been struggling and was
slowly disassembled a subsidiary of the
Washington Post bought the dig team
techCrunch reports have paid about 12
million dollars for the talent linkedin
paid about four million for a few of the
patents and the Wall Street Journal says
that beta works took all the remaining
bits for half a million dollars back in
2006 Businessweek ran a cover story on
how the co-founder Kevin Rose made 60
million when the site first launched and
four years ago it was almost bought by
google for 200 million dig made a big
impact in online publishing but seems
the era is over DIRECTV isn't the only
television provider and a scuf with
networks because dish network dropped
AMC last month over a dispute and fees
so unless there's a resolution dish
customers will miss out on the new
season of breaking bad but at least for
the sunday season premiere dish
subscribers could log on to AMC to watch
the live stream in other news we're
watching if you have more than one
google account you can now merge your
Google+ accounts into one but you can't
take back a transfer also it takes two
days to merge the accounts during which
you can't post or make changes to your
circles facebook has debuted another new
feature on the right hand corner where
you see birthdays you'll now see
notification of friends getting married
or engaged also Microsoft is holding an
event Monday we're expecting to hear
about a new version of microsoft office
and we got our eye on the uber app today
uber is a quick way to request a car or
SUV for pick up and have the right
automatically billed to your credit card
but there was a new twist to the app on
friday the company let users summit an
ice cream truck seven major cities got
the chance to order ice cream on demand
some blogs have reported that this could
be a new feature but an uber employee in
New York told us that this was a
marketing tactic and they'd done these
before with other food trucks
recently announced ability for our
riders to be able to get a specific
vehicle type and so we're sort of
celebrating the ability to get more
choice by offering them the choice of an
ice cream truck we've got cool house
here they make some of the most
incredible ice cream sandwiches I've
ever had we're also working within lewin
and sort of every city it's a
case-by-case basis still it was a sweet
feature that would make a great app
don't you think that your tech news
