interested in picking up a new tablet
you're going to want to check out the LG
G pad X 8.3 for CNET
I'm Xiomara Blanco let's take a closer
look what sets this 4G LTE tablet apart
are a few functionality features that
you won't find on other models namely it
packs the full USB port IR blaster and
stylus the USB port is located on the
top edge in between the IR blaster and
headphone jack most tablets have them
like your USB port but an additional
full sized one is a rather rare site you
can connect the flash drive or hard
drive to load all your favorite content
or you can even connect a mouse or
keyboard if you want to the IR blaster
also on the top edge can turn your
tablet into a remote control using the
built-in app you can set it up to
control your TV blu-ray player cable box
or receiver
lastly the stylus which is slightly tuck
into the bottom edge is light as a
feather and traditionally thin it also
feels comfortable and makes navigating
the tablet easy the preloaded quick memo
app allows you to write or draw and
offers a healthy amount of different
style options
other notable software features on the G
pad include Q pair which pairs your
phone to your tablet so you only have to
use a tablet to respond to calls or text
messages and useful dual window
capabilities for simple multitasking the
LG G pad X 8.3 runs on the latest
version of Google's operating system
Android lollipop and it houses a
qualcomm snapdragon 1.5 gigahertz
octa-core processor 2 gigabytes of RAM
16 gigabytes of internal memory and a
microSD card slot that's expandable up
to 128 gigabytes the 8.3 inch screen is
rather average with the 1080 by 1920
pixel resolution display that's sharp
and colourful enough but not very bright
there's a pair of stereo speakers for
enjoying your favorite movies and music
but unfortunately they're on the back
directing the sound away from your ears
the good news is that they're not easy
to block when holding in landscape
orientation the LG G pad X 8.3 retails
for $2.99
but if you're willing to sign up with
Verizon for a two-year contract it's
only 120
which is a lot more reasonable if you
need something basic with a few extra
functionality perks I recommend you
check it out at your local Verizon store
for CNET I'm Xiomara Blanco and this is
going to first look at the LG G pad 8.3</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
