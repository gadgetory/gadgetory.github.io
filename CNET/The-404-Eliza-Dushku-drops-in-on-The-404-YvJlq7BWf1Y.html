Eliza Dushku chuckles guy we'll just
last to make it seem like funny yeah
what's up I'm not sure so thank you so
much for being here this is a totally
cool thanks for having me where we're
like just getting started today I just
woke up if anyone cared we were hosting
I had a lot of hosting CES duties last
night but now were after this we're
gonna hit the floor and I'm really
excited and I'm getting my my group me
have used that before actually saw you
on television yesterday partying with a
robot yeah attempted to do the robot
really cheesy but Ava the robot rolled
out at the spike party at tryst she was
on the list and it was really I don't I
didn't quite get a sense of all of her
abilities but it's it creeps me out a
little bit she was kind of all over the
place I felt like she was measuring me
up yeah I got that Terminator 3 like
rise of the machines fear these things
are gonna they're gonna wipe us out they
really are the end we're just spelling
our own doom right here yeah so you are
CES 2012 Entertainment matters
ambassador that's a pretty intimidating
title for me if ambassador Dushku to you
I know I came last year just as a just
as a viewer and a fan girl walked around
it's very it's very exciting but it's
very big and it could be a little bit
overwhelming we were here for two days
but we didn't quite feel like we we got
everywhere that we wanted to go and and
they're there they gave you the little
maps but we wanted something that
I'm around that sort of helped us
navigate our way and so we started
talking to the folks that entertainment
matters and they said why don't you come
and be the official ambassador and we'll
have a site where people can go and they
can type in what they want to find and
you can you know hosted parties and and
tweet about what you like and and just
it bridge the entertainment world of
Hollywood and in this tech world because
it it is so important it is so exciting
we've got to keep up with what's going
on and so yeah I'm representing yeah I
feel like we're learning slowly but
surely a lot of celebrities they have
like a geek side they're like closet
geeks yeah they come out the closet I'm
a tech now I mean I grew up with three
brothers we I was always playing video
games a Atari was our first Nintendo and
then I just have been I have about a
million a million point one followers on
Twitter and that kind of happened so
fast and I feel a commitment now I feel
a responsibility to to be on top of it
and also with the content that's being
produced Justin Hollywood and as a
producer myself now you look at kids now
and they're watching TV on this for sure
everything is so is so digital so it's
important thing that I know it the hell
I'm talking about you did a little short
earlier this year with a Freddie Wong
yes apparently a lot of confused me with
him because the green glasses do you see
like gunshot yeah the next generation of
your kind of here to help facilitate
that yeah I mean it was astounding the
production value that this I mean you
could say he's just some kid that
decided he wanted to make action movies
with his friends for a couple of bucks
versus the tens of millions that are
spent in action movies and he does it
really well and so I had seen some of
his work and I was excited to to go and
play with them and literally we shot it
on Easter Sunday and
we were there for a few hours and they
pulled together this amazing stunt
sequence and it went viral and I think
we have over you know 5 million hits but
people are seeing it people saw this
thing that was not attached to a studio
that was not not that I want to tell the
studios all of it I never want to work
with them again but it's amazing because
it really is coming people are taking
control and and they're making the kind
of content that they want to see they're
making things with friends they're
having fun and they're able to because
of all the technology I think people
were like involved in that it was a
small crew I mean I think the whole crew
was fed by one Domino's Pizza very basic
but uh but it was glass right it just
looks so good all right let's talk a
little bit about CES because that's why
we're all here
so have you had a chance to walk around
the showroom floor yet I haven't but I
know where I'm going I the TVs are
always incredible to me I was with
Felicia Day last night she was telling
me I had to go see the new 4k super
super high-res TV so that when I go home
I cussed the TV that's on my wall like a
4k projector is like literally like you
could start you can see like cores
inside of cores and you know it's just
like we not want to be but to watch it
and see I mean you feel like you're
looking you're looking through a window
if you're watching real life happening
for your screen I mean it's it's amazing
and we were reading about less than 6
million light pixels are coming through
I mean just everything can be condensed
and made smaller and more powerful I
like that because I'm small and powerful
but also we a lot of Wi-Fi the Wi-Fi
cameras where you can immediately upload
your shots to your to your devices and
there are wireless speakers Wireless is
always helpful because I don't know what
you guys but I'm the girl that still has
a pin at home with every old Nokia and I
mean I have probably 50 Nokia chargers
adapters and I mean all these wires and
you don't know to do with them it's a
big tangle box so Wireless to me is huge
for sure what about 3d people III really
just like it just cuz I get sick I get
seasick do you really be a little
seasick with the 3d but it and also
wearing wearing glasses when I'm
watching TV I mean I don't I don't wear
glasses naturally I wear sunglasses but
but I I think it's I think it's
extraordinary that we're creating these
you know something that's been always
been two-dimensionally anything that's
sort of evolving is kind of magical I
always think it's like you're like too
cool when you see someone like walk into
the living room they got their
sunglasses on
speaking of 3d I think I don't know how
you feel about this but I think 3d I
think the platform it can really excel
on is games I think video games in 3d is
a lot more immersive you've got a lot of
video game work before you were in that
game wet by Bethesda which is Ruby
Malone and Nike are you involved in
anything coming up because I know a lot
of our listeners are big gamers we love
covering the industry I love to know if
anything's going on in that my my last
video game was Fight Night and that was
new for me because that was motion
capture and so instead of just going in
and doing the voiceover in the studio we
actually went in and wore these little
one-piece cat suits with little so -
actually when I saw the game see myself
we acted out the fuse in these motion
capture outfits I wish that they'd let
me put the boxing gloves on and be one
of the fighters not just the promoters
likeable characters we're working with
them for fight night - on that but again
the three the the more three-dimensional
these characters or these you know we
are it's just more immersive and it is
more exciting for the gamer and even
even as I'm playing some of the games
now already I do I get a little bit
discombobulated too though because you
they move so fast and
I mean like you got a particular game
that you're playing right now that you
like last night we got a little sneak
peek at the new Final Fantasy we're
fighting some of the guys my brothers
are here with me and and my brother is
is pretty convinced that Final Fantasy 3
was the best fit that there ever was but
we played last night it he was impressed
with with the new game I've played it a
little bit in the world of warcraft in
the Wow I do I have been busy and it
definitely it takes commitment I mean
you need to be ready to like hunker down
for a couple of weekends and close the
doors in order features and we've been
on the move a lot but I try to keep up
also I have nephews and my boyfriend has
kids
teenage boys they you got to be on the
pulse you guys are cool and you got to
be able to play and I was always really
competitive growing up with boys always
had to play and had to be good and and
you know you have your cred so I want I
try to keep up so that I can I can be
the cool aunt
absolutely before we eat the break I you
know we a lot of our listeners are super
geeky they they're really into film TV
and stuff like that yeah I'm sure you
get that all done right we will be doing
the geek world a disservice if we didn't
ask you about this on IMDB right now
you're you're you're credited when
you've never heard of that right your
creative Buster's three is can you tell
us anything like that is it actually
gonna be just live you won't tell
anybody
right now it's just a rumor I mean I I
know Dan Aykroyd I've known him for four
years yes I was 14 years old and we've
talked about it and I mean I would love
it I'm a huge Ghostbusters fan I I I
love
I mean Sigourney Weaver to follow in
that woman's footsteps sure just iconic
so I will see you guys no first
motion-captured Slimer is that what you
know I would I'd want you in real life
that would be much more satisfying
unfortunately we have to say goodbye for
now but thank you so much for being here
round of applause Eliza Dushku everybody
have a great show thank you so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
