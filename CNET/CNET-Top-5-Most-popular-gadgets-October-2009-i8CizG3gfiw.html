phones has waned even if your
fascination with the iphone has not
coming in to number four the asus eee pc
1005 h a now this one's been on the list
for a while now it's our editors choice
because of the lower price sleek look
long battery life hey even if it is a
bit thick for a netbook up to number
three the sony ps3 slim like rain in the
desert is your attention to the sony ps3
slim sony's been having a rough go of it
lately but the more energy-efficient
cheaper ps3 slim has grabbed your
attention in a way no other game console
can claim right now sliding in at number
2 the LG env touch grand daddy of the
list we reviewed this one way back in
June it is the smartphone of choice for
verizon users but it falls from the
number one spot this week to a newcomer
but before we get to number one time for
another lame prize as we peruse and
praise all these popular gadgets we must
cleanse our palate with these one of the
most maligned creatures in star wars
history and you're not competing for
just one but two Jar Jar Binks this
matched set of Jar Jar will be yours
unfortunately if you can correctly
answer this question and be one of the
first ten folks to do so at the blog
posting for this top five at blog at
Cena TV com here's the question what was
the most popular product one year ago
hint it was a phone not Jar Jar Binks
and now let's get to our number one the
most popular product right now at number
one it's the zune HD you stare longingly
into its OLEDs screen you listen with
rapt attention to its HD radio you
wonder it's
long enduring battery life in a word
it's love you love the zoo there you
said it but I set it on your behalf and
it's true your traffic patterns don't
lie well that's it for this edition of
Cena top 5 don't forget to avoid ever
having to be in the presence of to
mid-size Jar Jar dolls for the rest of
your life don't answer the trivia
