cnet.com and today we're taking a look
at on key drive now what is anki drive
well it's kind of like a slot car that I
remember from when I was a kid except
for their notes lot aki drive is
actually run on a giant vinyl mat and
there are no grooves in it to supply
electricity instead the cars actually
have little batteries built into them
and electric motor is underneath that
give them the motivation that I need the
drive now the mat actually has infrared
codes built into it and printed right
onto it and on the bottom of the car
there's a little infrared sensor that's
actually reading those codes and letting
the car know where it is on the track
now the actual magic is going to happen
as part of an iphone app the tool
install on your iPhone or iPod Touch and
this apps actually going to provide a
bit of artificial intelligence that lets
the car is know when they need to be
turning when they need to be going and
it also allows them to communicate with
each other so they don't run into each
other as they work away around the track
now I'm actually only controlling one of
these three cars I get a little bit of
throttle control here I can change lanes
and I can actually shoot at the other
cars with a little virtual energy weapon
the other two cars are controlled by
artificial intelligence they're just
running on their own up to four players
can play if you have enough cars but you
only get two cars in the box additional
cars are 6999 and the Anki Drive starter
kit is 1 99 99 now a lot of people who
have actually played with me today have
actually gotten bored after one or two
games but after 10 games today I'm still
interested in what's going on with the
Anki Drive hear it a lot of fun shooting
the other cars and whipping around the
track well I've been antuan goodwin with
cnet.com and we've been taking a look at
the Anki Drive racers and the Anki Drive
app
