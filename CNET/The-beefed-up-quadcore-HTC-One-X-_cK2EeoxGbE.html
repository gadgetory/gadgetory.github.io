and today we're taking a first look at
the HTC One X plus for AT&amp;amp;T this handset
costs 199 99 and is available now for
purchase as its name suggests the HTC
One x+ is essentially a revamped and
pumped up version of its predecessor the
HTC One X so what does that really mean
well for one instead of the 1.5
gigahertz dual-core Qualcomm Snapdragon
s4 chip which powered the US model of
the One X the one x+ runs a 1.7
gigahertz quad-core Tegra 3 processor
from Nvidia also nice is that the HSE
one x+ features android for dot one
jelly bean software as well as HTC's
latest version of the sense UI called
sense 4 plus the most important
attribute of the 1x plus however is it
comes with a massive 64 gigabytes of
internal storage I don't know about you
but that's enough to easily hold my
entire music collection about three
times over and while it's still true the
one x+ like the 1x before it lacks an SD
card slot having this much memory goes a
long way to helping me forget this I
also dig the HTC One x+ is style molded
from a single piece of polycarbonate the
black plastic material HTC selected a
hue the company calls carbon feels
high-grade not cheap I like the phone
soft touch finish to which has a slate
like texture that wicks moisture away
and absorbs fingerprints at over a third
of an inch thick to the one x+ is just
as thin as the slim 1x above the screen
is a 1.6 megapixel front-facing camera
capable of shooting in 1080p HD below
are three capacitive buttons for Android
functions the right side holds a long
volume bar while up top are a peplum
Jacke power button and a sim card slot
around back is the phones 8 megapixel
camera and LED flash other interesting
features include beats audio processing
technology the latest sense 4 plus user
interface and connection to 18 tease 4G
LTE data network the HTC One X comes
with an excellent camera that's fast
Plus as
ton of features and shooting modes such
as an HDR mode panorama continuous
shooting and the ability to snap shots
while recording video at first glance
the HTC One X has plenty going for it
check back soon at cnet com for a full
review I'm Brian Bennett and this has
been a first look at the HTC One x+</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
