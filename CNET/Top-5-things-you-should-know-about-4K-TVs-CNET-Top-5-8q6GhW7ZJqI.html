know about 4k TVs have you been staring
at your HDTV and realizing it's time for
an upgrade like I have I talked to
CNET's resident television expert David
Katz Meyer to build this top 5 let's get
to it and number 5 they're cheaper than
ever these days it's harder to find an
HDTV than it is to find a 4k TV the best
televisions out there are 4k so if
you're looking to find a TV that has a
lot more pixels than your old TV you
won't have to go broke at number 4 most
content won't be in 4k great you've got
a 4k TV but what are you going to watch
you could invest in an Ultra HD blu-ray
player and get some 4k blu-ray discs
alternatively you can get the 4k version
of Netflix but not everything will be in
4k but you can watch Breaking Bad and
house of cards in high-res and number
three 4k resolution does not improve
image quality alone just because you've
got a lot of pixels in the screen
doesn't mean it's going to look great
look for features like local dimming why
image quality local dimming dims
areas of the screen that need to be
darker and leaves bright areas bright
without a feature like this the image
can appear washed out and number two
look for HDR and wide color gamut these
things might be more important than 4k
resolution itself why high dynamic range
or HDR along with wide color allow a
television to show pictures that are
more true to life look for these two
features if you're getting a 4k TV and
the number one don't pay extra for 4k if
you're looking to buy a cheap television
especially a smaller one 4k is no reason
to pay extra unless you're sitting
really really really close to the
television you are not going to notice
the difference between a small 4k or HD
screen don't hate me for that one
craving even more information on 4k TVs
we've got you covered at cnet.com a big
thanks to katz and we'll see you next
time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
