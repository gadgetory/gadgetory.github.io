a lot of things video streaming cars TVs
and phones currently its marquee handset
is the love pro 3 a 5.5 inch phone that
features the latest Snapdragon 820 1
processor and a 16 megapixel camera the
love pro 3 also has a big 4.0 7 ampere
hour battery inside that's pretty hefty
and during our lab tests for continuous
video playback it lasted an average of
16 and a half hours that's longer than
most flagships available right now
except for the Samsung Galaxy s7 edge
which lasted 19 hours and funnily enough
the mid-range motorola moto z play which
lasted 23 the love pro 3 does have its
drawbacks though for instance its
interface takes some getting used to the
home button sometimes takes you to the
loveyou newsfeed page you can't access
settings through your notification shade
and the recent apps menu is kind of a
mess the echos video streaming service
which is accessible here permanently on
your home screen is also a bit of a mess
while its quality casually browse clips
from time to time it doesn't have
anything I'd actually want to watch the
phone isn't compatible with CDMA
networks and oh there's no headphone
jack so say hello to the dongle if you
want to listen to music with your wired
headphones given all this why would you
want to buy a phone from an unknown
company well that's because this one
costs only $400 yeah fantastic high-end
phones are known to exist like the $400
one plus three for example but usually
phones like this cost $700 or more for
those looking to save a lot of dough but
want a powerful phone the LA Eco love
pro 3 may be worth considering</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
