always mean impressive performance
that's certainly the case with this new
GE dryer for nine hundred dollars this
mid-range appliance definitely has some
cool things like LED lights that glow in
a cool blue hue it also has a handsome
cycle dial which is very fun to use it
also supports the optional Wi-Fi connect
module which enables you to wirelessly
connect and control the dryer from your
smartphone or tablet it also is Energy
Star certified which means it will
hopefully save you some money in the
long run and use less energy the problem
with this GE dryer though for all its
good looks and interesting controls is
that it takes a long time to dry over an
hour on average it's also slow to remove
water from wet laundry and there are no
steam abilities or steam power D
wrinkled cycles at all the machine also
has the same hard-to-read LED screen
that you see on other GE models it's
hard to read from different angles and
from the top or slightly off angle
because the controls are back mounted
that means you can't vertically stack
this unit on top of other laundry units
and you also can't put it on top of a
pedestal accessory which will hopefully
save you some space in your laundry room
that's why I recommend passing on this
GE dryer in favor of appliances such as
the Electrolux 600 series which costs
$200 more and lacks smart app functions
but dries faster looks better and has
more features including steam modes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
