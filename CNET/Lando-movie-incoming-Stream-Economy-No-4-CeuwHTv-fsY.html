scatter and yes I did get a new t-shirt
thank you for asking but we don't have
time to talk about that because your
time is money and that's why we're gonna
discuss the news across movies TV and
games and decide whether you should buy
or sell your fan investments now we have
to talk about something upfront that I
am a huge fan of which is uh Lando
Calrissian press outlet premier France
reported Lucasfilm head honcho Kathleen
Kennedy said Lando will be next when
asked about the future of the solo
franchise that's the signal everybody
we're getting a Lando movie break out
those capes except put your capes back
in carbonite because that's actually not
what Kathleen Kennedy said Lucasfilm
issued a statement saying something was
lost in translation and that she
actually meant she would love to do a
Lando movie at some point in the future
not next so sorry everybody it's the
worst look I've seen Solo and if they
have Lando in the next two like they
have planned as much or more honestly I
think we may not even need a standalone
Lando movie but of course obviously
don't Glover is amazing and I'd love to
see him in the role as for solo my
spoiler free review liked it they don't
love it and I thought it was a perfectly
fun space adventure movie
good job run Howard but for functor ii
so i'm gonna give you a very calm bye
speaking of calm let's talk about
something that's the exact opposite
which is the set of lethal weapon fox
was on the brink of canceling lethal
weapon after reports one of its co-stars
claimed Crawford was emotionally abusing
cast and crew fortunately Fox opted not
to cancel the show but to fire Crawford
and replace him with Sean William Scott
who you might recognize as Stifler from
the American Pie franchise o other star
of the show Damon Wayans tweeted out a
bunch of crazy stuff about his time on
the set including this picture of a gash
on the back of his head that he
insinuates was caused during an episode
Crawford directed on top of that he also
posted a picture from the Warner
Brothers
where someone had attached a sticker
that said claim crawford is an emotional
terrorist to a post which is absolutely
bananas but overall I thought this show
was going to be a sell for sure but now
that Seann William Scott's in the mix I
feel really really good about it and I'm
actually really proud of Fox for not
throwing in the towel and putting all
those people out of work so you know
what I'm interested I'm gonna throw a
couple of bucks their way it's a buy
good job Fox and Sean William Scott if
you ever want to come on the show and
talk about it we'd love to have you some
things are able to be saved like lethal
weapon some things are not which brings
us to our next story about cliffy B
Gears of War creator Cliff Bleszinski z'
game studio boskie has folded cliffy B
posted a heartfelt official statement on
his Twitter and he talked about how law
breakers just couldn't get the traction
it needed and on top of that when they
launched radical Heights while a little
game called fortnight sucked all the air
out of that space unfortunately that is
it for boskie productions and cliffy b's
taking a little break from the game
industry but he did start tweeting about
a bunch of other things that boskie was
working on that i would like to mention
because they sound hilarious and crazy
and awesome first of all being this
insane ninjas writing dragons fighting
zombies up in airships game which sounds
pretty cool then there was a 5 V 5 V 5 V
5 V 5 team-based VR mech game which
seems pretty awesome and then the last
one is this which he described as sort
of Mario Kart VR like crazy with animals
I don't know guys I mean Bosque had some
really cool ideas and hopefully they
will live on in some form going forward
in the future but for now it was nice
knowing you boss ki and if you had any
investments left in there guys I'm sorry
but those shares they're worth nothing
it's a South bummer now kind of things
that come back to life we all heard
about Brooklyn nine-nine and how it was
saved from cancellation by NBC NBC
picked it up after Fox said now we don't
want any more of that and fans all
around the world rejoiced they rejoiced
except for one and that's our very own
mark Searles
well I like well I like when things in
something just good put things in
another when something was really good
on the telly or the pictures and you
just watch them and you friendly stop
and you're like oh that was good well it
usually gets did you like the MEP it was
really good
how come things on the open-toe come
Brut when they may name name name name
name coming in when they were like oh
we're going to cancel it I was like a
filmer wife sees it was good there
man
just let it go up oh come when I watch
that movie the pictures off the Steve
through the credits because I'm or
something's gonna happen where they guys
like oh I'm actually back something else

son of mine think of it all the time his
tears are gone from my jog or make my
cup of tea

it some things I watch it some things
that just watch it whelmed in the dishes

have like it's good Oh laughs then
something else and then left it to be
like bring it back bring your bike bring
your bike because it's good

were show once I was safe filled all the
time did bring back same feel that like

it's the why I watching any male
Brooklyn they may was long frenzy they
can throw the chicken onions man ski
therefore well done big man
you mean just sure let's pick a new one
stop make sense having a ball man
you might have heard of a little show
called RuPaul's Drag Race but what you
might not have heard was that Rubens
reveries has its own convention we're
here in Los Angeles California RuPaul's
Drag on LA and we decided we would talk
to some of the queens from the show and
have them define some drag terms for us
just in case you're a new viewer and
also talked about what the show means
not only to them but also to the
community at large
all looking very fabulous today thank
you go get your eyes checked
oh my god you would just complement to
me so we're asking some Queens to define
drag terms for us perfect let's do it
can you define clocking oh you find a
flaw and somebody in somebody's makeup
or they look that outfit and you kind of
you let them know that our clock this oh
I know what's going on underneath that
wig like I clocked you right you're a
boy
can you define shade for us shade it's
not just darkness it's a fun way of
pointing out somebody's flaw poking fun
telling a joke but you have to do it in
a way where it's funny witty and quick
you know when people like oh my God look
at that pig you're like my Pig okay what
about fish oh that's for three of us
true ladies basically when you look so
feminine that you are fishing the
complete embodiment of femininity so you
absolutely you know I will not disagree
with you because today on the real cool
take on the real fishy real house in
Spanish bath Scala what about Dustin
Dustin is like I love how I am when I
make it was so beautiful and it's so
late that I am Justin for the gods
effortlessly looking pretty so yeah
you're right you thank you
now that I feel fabulous I think it's
important to mention that beyond all of
the glitter the crowns the rhinestone
Drakon is actually a super special place
Drakon is important because it is a
queer lgbtq+ safe space for anybody and
everybody to come around walk around
Kiki get your judge with the Queens the
Kings and the in-betweens and just like
have a good time all of us had to find
our own family and playing places to go
within our community to feel loved it
will be done now we have this huge
platform in this huge event that
supports that it's fun to let go of you
like your gender and your thoughts about
who you are as a person and what you
should and shouldn't do people are here
to connect with people on beyond you
know the eyelashes and all that other
stuff it's really about this community
of Queens are inviting everyone into
this subculture which is now sort of
gone from being a subculture to a much
more mainstream for the girls it is like
a big reunion it's like a big family
reunion because we get to see all of our
sisters Drakon is a time where I have a
bottle of champagne behind my booth
secretly and I'm just kicking with
everybody tuned in to RuPaul's Drag Race
and find out a little bit more about our
community and we will try to find out a
little bit more about your community
through you cheers to that
