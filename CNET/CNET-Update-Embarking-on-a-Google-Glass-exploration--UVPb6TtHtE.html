this is your cnet update if you've been
wondering what Google glass is all about
and how it works well that's exactly
what I'll help you understand in this
special edition of cnet update I'm
wearing an early model of the google
glass it's basically a wearable screen
that is controlled with voice activation
and touch and it can do some cool things
like take photos search on Google send
text messages and give you directions as
an explorer i had to pay fifteen hundred
dollars to get one but it's not for
consumers to purchase yet rather this is
more like a massive test exploring how
we interact with this type of device and
developers in the meantime are cooking
up some apps that work with it it might
be another year until anyone can buy one
the first thing people want to know is
what does the screen look like this is
just really a tiny floating screen if
you hold your cell phone about an arm's
length away from you that's about the
size that appears to be I have nothing
obstructing my vision I have to look up
and to the right when I want to see the
screen it's clear right now because it's
in sleep mode I can wake it up one of
two ways I can tilt my head up slightly
or I can tap the side panel this is a
touch panel that you use to navigate
through by swiping and tapping once it's
awake I can say ok glass and from here I
have the option to speak a command or I
can tap to select it with the touch pad
you're really just swiping through
different cards of information like
whether message notifications or photos
you've taken the most basic use is to
use it as a hands-free camera if I don't
want to walk around yelling ok glass
take a picture ok glass take a picture
well there's a handy shutter button that
takes an instant snapshot of what's in
front of me there's no time to say
cheese and pose and see a preview it's
just instantly taken as soon as I hit
this button let me show you video ok
glass record a video by default a video
only is captured for 10 seconds unless I
tapped to make it go longer and then
it'll record until it runs out of
battery or until I tell it to stop say
hi to our producer mark there's no big
red light telling you that I'm recording
you just know it's
because you can see the light of my
screen people could be jerks and record
you without you being totally aware but
they could also record you secretly with
a smartphone it's fun to joke that this
makes us more like cyborgs but with
smart phones in our pockets and in our
hands all the time we already were
assimilated and attached to a screen
this time you just have to hold it in
your hand but you also have to look odd
wearing one we'll be bringing you
continuing coverage of glasses we learn
to live with this new device and explore
the apps being created for it because
that's where things will really get
interesting be sure to visit cnet com
for an in-depth first look at all the
glass features from our studios in New
York I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
