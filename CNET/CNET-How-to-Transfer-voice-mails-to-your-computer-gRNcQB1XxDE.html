from a friend or family member who cared
enough to pick up the phone and wish you
happy birthday or tell you something
special and if it's really meaningful
you might want to save it on your
computer for safekeeping the thing is
you can't just drag and drop voicemails
from your phone to your computer on the
iPhone voicemails are stored on your
computer when you sync it but the files
are stored in weird unreadable formats
likewise unless your Android has a
visual voicemail service with forwarding
like t-mobile your voicemails are stored
on your carrier server there are a few
ways you can save voicemails but after a
lot of consideration I realized that the
best way to get your voicemails from
your phone onto your PC is with a simple
audio trick to get started you'll need a
Mac or PC with audacity installed and a
stereo or audio cable also known as aux
or Minnie - Minnie now plug the cable
into your microphone port and launch
audacity first off you want to make sure
you can hear what you're doing so go to
preferences and check the box next to
software play through next grab your
phone and find your voicemail if you
have visual voicemail like the iPhone
it's easy just find it in the list here
plug the audio cable into your phone and
press record on audacity then hit play
on your phone a happy birthday all right
you'll see the waveforms show up as it
records if the level is too low you can
always turn up the volume on your phone
when it's done hit stop and play it back
to make sure it worked hey happy
birthday I hope your days awesome see
you later right now if you have one of
the many Android phones that doesn't
have visual voicemail like this Galaxy
Nexus you'll have to call your voicemail
service so after you plug the cable into
your phone hit record
call your voicemail service please edit
your path 1 then press pound enter your
password do all that you have to new
voice messages then player
message hey hey I hope you have a great
day and when it's done stop recording
now hit play to playback your voicemail
hey you can trim off all that extra
audio by highlighting it with your
cursor then hitting delete hey I hope
you have when you're done go to file
export give it a name and then select
the file type you want to save it as
like mp3 or WAV hit save and you're done
if you're like Sharon I don't have a mic
input well there is another quick and
dirty option unplug any audio cables
turn monitoring off in audacity and hit
record then play the voice mail back
through your speakerphone while pointing
it at your laptop's mic this isn't the
best audio quality but since the
voicemail is crappy to begin with you
won't hear a huge difference the same
method could be used with your friend's
phone just launch a recording program on
their phone play your voicemail and then
email the recording to yourself finally
if you want to save all of your
voicemails going forward consider using
a service like Google Voice or you mail
if you have any questions or want to
