way to eliminate blind spots and have
really cool navigation in your fancy car
Netflix PR let's sit down and tells us
we can't have netflix on offline mode oh
and we're gonna tell you how you can
send a 100-foot tall holiday greeting oh
and we're gonna eat some cookies made
with crickets cuz you know like you do
some our daily
greetings citizens of the Internet
welcome to tomorrow daily the best geek
talk show in the known universe I'm your
host Ashley scan the join me as always
once again forevermore kill anonymous
you have a reason why we're eating these
cricket I do ok promise there's an
actual reason behind this okay all right
there's a one-percent good trustful
reason we're gonna will discuss we'll
discuss the first we gotta hit the
headlines so a few weeks ago do you
remember the transparent car the gem yes
okay the Japanese researchers they had
like the special projection screens and
the cameras in the mirrors it was like
very kind of crazy setup little scary
but yes a little weird okay so this is
actually a really sophisticated version
of that brought to us by Jaguar and Land
Rover yegua uh this is this is really
cool so we're gonna watch this video
notice on the the beams there the guy
who's crossing the street uh-huh check
this out on the right side boom it makes
the the beam right there that pillar on
the side of your windshield look like as
if it's transparent so you're seeing Oh
see there you see that okay so this is
really cool so what that is though is
it's not a projection it's a screen and
they use cameras to show you what's on
those screens like so they will show you
a view of what's on the other side of
that pillar if there is something to be
seen there so if the thing decides like
you know whatever and then this is it
isn't projection on your windshield that
is a quote unquote ghost car that shows
you navigation so instead of saying like
just turn right it's a little bit easier
for the human eye to sort of follow a
car like an actual car so there it is
there's the ghost car right in the
middle of the windshield there and he's
driving forward and then the car is
going to be like oh hey like turn right
or left and then you follow the car the
actual like projection of a car going
down the road that's amazing that
awesome wow no what no no ghost time
trials yeah like in Mario Kart based on
banana peels can't really awesome um but
so the cool thing is that these blind
spots would only activate if the car oh
he drove by a parking structure and it
said how many spaces were free right so
this is a total concept
that they want to kind of implement in
their vehicles at some point in the
future nothing rolling off the
production line next year or anything
like that but they're saying that this
system will reach its full potential
when they can kind of link into
infrastructure like parking structures
and restaurants and road closures you
know different things I accidents things
like that where your windshield would
basically be your hub that wouldn't
necessarily get in your way or be
distracting but they would enhance your
information so all that information
would be at the drivers fingertips so it
should be really cool yeah and you
wouldn't have to like to you know
whenever I use maps I have to look at my
phone to look down and see like oh and I
like and also being able to see through
the beams could clear out some blind
spots for sure I think that's the big
thing so i really liked in the video if
you didn't notice when the driver
sitting there like this as soon as he
turns his head that's when the car
recognizes that you need to see behind
your blind spot so it changes the screen
on the pillar change awesome really the
coolest car tech I've seen in a while
yeah like I really like this idea it's
really cool it's interesting it's um and
I feel like this is a much more
practical use of it instead of a fully
transparent car yeah if you're listening
on iTunes you really got to see this one
this is like I dick so cool i picked
like one and 16 times in which to say
you need to see this that's different
this is definitely one that's that's
awesome I want that I want that in my
car yeah I want it in all cars I mean
that's the one complaint I have about my
philoso- ER Oh blosser it's an awesome
car but the blind spots in that car a
little challenging if I do say so myself
and you do say so yourself and I do i do
say tell me about netflix ok so i gotta
be say that was a happy story this one's
a little sad because there's been people
that have wanted to watch netflix
offline yeah you know you're going on a
flight you want to like have a couple
that you can watch on the flight well
netflix netflix PR specifically cliff
edwards has said that no that is never
going to happen that's a direct quote
yeah he said never going to happen this
was of course because a lot of people
were saying you know like they're
worried about you know quality and
finding Wi-Fi broadband that works works
well so they want to have some that are
offline and netflix is like you know you
know what
look like it's never going to be a
problem you know it's it's I think the
big argument is like this is a band-aid
offline mode is a band-aid for a bigger
problem which is Netflix wants everybody
to have broadband everywhere so that you
can use netflix everywhere yeah and that
you don't have an offline mode and I
would imagine there's probably what
licensing stuff there's probably
licensing like having something on your
having a movie on your you're a little
different yeah it's almost like owning
it but we never connect again it's your
movie but to be fair if you rent a movie
from will you rent it like I'll tell you
rented it so if you rent it from let's
say uh what is it google google play
store you can pin it so anything that
you have instead of streaming it you can
pin like that's in the cloud so you can
like pin it and then it's available
offline until you decide you don't want
it on your device in orange I'm pin it
but netflix has like certain length
licensing so they're like crowd you can
only have our movie for like you prepare
amounts like you can only have this
movie for five months yeah and then they
pull it and then if you have that they
can't control it and that's true yeah if
you were to pin something like bad boys
it's going away this is on netflix is it
but bad boys two is gonna be on netflix
in january oh you can't have a screaming
camel ya know you're gonna have to you
know you do uh New Year's Eve screening
a bad boys New Year's Day screen about
there you go yeah a new years playing
wind it up to like midnight so you could
just watch them back I totally
understand this netflix thing I get it
it's and I what like I wasn't even
actually jonesing for this it's yeah I
night one I think that they're right in
that there's a million other places to
get offline content and the other thing
is is that they're they're banking on
the fact that in a few years this is not
even going to be an issue that everybody
will be able to have you know reliable
enough broadband to stream netflix
wherever which is ambitious but we'll
see we'll see but that brings us to our
hashtag of the day I'm really curious as
to what you guys think about this it's
TD Netflix and I want to know are you is
this era cool 'this are you angry are
you Netflix easier furious are you gonna
cancel your subscription cuz no offline
mode like is this something with that is
really important to you and if it is
like why or why not should netflix offer
offline mode I just I like I feel like
we already made our argument
yeah no it's not their responsibility
they offer streaming service that's what
they offer they don't they shouldn't
have to go that extra mile I know but
it's travel i'm not paying three dollars
a month it's like maybe I'll extra cheer
like pinning offline yeah 30 bucks a
month I don't know they're like your
pastor kind of that I don't know you can
rent movies but that's the hashtag thing
I like I'm really curious to see cuz
people are really like really they're
really up in arms about this I feel like
they'd have upset about the fact that's
like well when you say never I mean when
a PR person is like it's never going to
happen whoa we'll get upset about that
cuz they had hope they were like oh
maybe someday oh now it's like no we're
shutting that down yeah they're working
on they got other stuff they need to
worry about fair enough yeah they got it
they got to worry about Marco Polo are
hearing not very great things show
coming out with Marco Polo yeah it's
like they are they doing all these it's
they're like Game of Thrones type show
where it's like this big you know kind
of fantasy historical epic tale with
boobs and stuff swearing things but yeah
I just um I haven't been hearing great
things that's all I'm saying that's I I
have not personally seen it but I have
heard from a few people that they were
not impressed um but things moving on to
things that are impressive to some
people it's your user comments no uh
this is holiday gifts not gifts with
atty gifts animated like anime build it
there um if a card is not going to cut
it for you this holiday season let's say
you you feel bigger than a card here
your holiday cheer is so much bigger
than a tiny little card that you want to
set in the mail I got a great idea for
you okay all right so you have until I
think the 19th you have until this
friday oh you're ready no I you can
actually shout your greeting in a 100
foot high animated gif a holiday holiday
greeting in San Francisco they're gonna
project them onto the side of two
buildings on Market Street oh I want to
sit and animated gifts so it's going to
be this is the brainchild of WP engine
labs ten up and grey area foundation so
they're going to actually project these
like animated gifts on to uh buildings
and you're going to be able to go over
to gift the halls com gif falls here's a
website
gift the halls calm you can choose a
premade animated gift so these those are
all the gifts so let's say you pick this
nice animated gift that's a fire these
are all local Bay Area digital artists
who've made these animated gifts um so
you gotta register for the site you can
sign with Facebook or whatever type your
message in and then you hit submit and
then it will be projected a hundred foot
tall onto these buildings between the
20th and the 24th of this month and
that's that's what it's going to look
like that's it that actually might even
be a smaller version because they said a
hundred foot tall so it's going to be
bigger than that um and it's free yeah I
mean us and they're not live streaming
it you have to be in the bay area but no
no here's the cool thing so if you're
not there they're gonna email you an
image of your message being projected on
the wall they'll email it to you after
they after they put it up there and it's
free yeah you can go over to gift the
halls com so they'll you'll get an image
of the card via email to prove to have
proof I'm expecting somebody to do that
for us tell us happy happy xmas or
whatever and also I to us is there
photog refer I have already taken the
liberty of signing of telling San
Francisco happy holidays from us here at
oh very cool get that and then hopefully
we'll either show it on the show maybe
before Kristen a if we get the email
like I don't know when it's gonna go up
on a wall let me know if San Francisco
calls us I'm gonna call us San Francisco
I said call 8675309 oh oh oh yeah ask
for Jenny but yeah that's uh it's just
it i thought that was funny interesting
weird kind of kind of awesome yeah and
if you're not there you can still do it
and say happy holidays in San Francisco
but I Theologo they tell you keep it
clean so you can't can't go crazy and
you can't pick your own animated gif
which is a real bummer that seems like a
huge I would have picked the animated
gif of Oprah giving bees every time I
answer when I own a given there's a
really good one for my cowboy all right
we're gonna take a quick break we'll be
back in 30 seconds or so and we're gonna
eat these crickets and I'm gonna eat
some eat some crickets so I don't click
away tomorrow daily
welcome back my hits you right hand
welcome back to tomorrow daily we okay I
don't even know where to begin with this
so let's just run the the back of the
hacker graphic okay so I have to clarify
this is not actually up for crowdfunding
right now yeah this was crowdfunded
earlier this year so it I backed it and
a-one and it got funded okay so this is
chirps this is uh these are I think the
Kickstarter started off as I they were
towards tortilla chips I guess made out
of crushed cricket pata flower will hold
on to it don't don't I'm not yet soon to
smelled it should it widened should I
smelled it okay so here's chirps these
are cricket chip so these three um very
enterprising women started this company
called six foods and they talk about how
meet in the future is going to be a lot
harder to be sustainable and how how we
get our protein in Western culture is
quite a bit different than some other
cultures where they're totally fine with
eating bugs yes we're not and they found
the best way to get people in Western
society to eat above is to fool them
it's a trick yes so just like you trick
your kids and eating their vegetables
tricking adults into eating crickets
their ground up sterilized they're
sterile ground crickets and so they
ground them into a flower and they make
you know turkey and chips I'm getting
the chips in I think it's January are
going alright so but for the holidays as
a thank you they added a free like they
kicked in cooking half
dozen chocolate chip cricket cookies so
I decided to bring them in and we have
to taste test them on the air because
honestly it's like what good are we to
tell you to back her hackett if I don't
with my own personal funds back
something and then follow up with it and
tell you if it's in you got to put them
up your money and your crickets for your
mouth is that's exactly right and so so
I'm gonna let you take one first because
I I've been sick and so I don't to reach
in there and touch a cookie right okay
um let me get like one that's not yeah
ticket pick a good one maybe with less
crickets in it okay so all right okay
did you ever see snowpiercer I did where
they eat the little the little blue
black blocks that turn out to be
cockroaches yeah yeah super gross that's
what that's the mode I'm in right now
you just dropped a whole cricket cuz I'm
sorry it should hop back into the bag
all right let's do this you want me to
read what's in it don't you read what's
in it while I'm eating it while you're
eating okay semi-sweet chocolate chips
is the number one ingredient sugar
salted butter wheat flour eggs cricket
flour oat flour brown sugar vanilla
extract baking soda and salt and there's
three grams of protein per cookie three
grams all right so I'm gonna try I'm
gonna try this it smells like a molasses
cookie we're eating crickets right now
how many crickets are in honestly / I
would like to know the ratio of crickets
per cookie I think it's good it almost
tastes better than like some some oh I'm
sorry guys but some of my friends
cookies that they sent me for the
holidays like bits may be better than
that do you feel weird about eating
crickets do you want some water I'm so
sick so I'm coughing now oh my god your
face is amazing okay to explain it to
you these these three girls women are
fantastic at making cookies now we'll
say that it's sweet and delicious oh god
the cricket and maybe it's just all my
brain and psychological maybe it's all
my brain makes a little tangy now as
long as it's tangy I don't get that you
know what I think on a dragon assault
that's insulting oh I made poke
two days ago no salt got out a little
salt you can't tell me you can taste the
cricket in that kill they must added a
lot of cinnamon there is it done I it's
like milliner cinnamon or molasses or
what's that one there's one flower we
can't really take what I'm saying is you
can't really cricket you can't really
taste anything but I could tell
something is a little something's off
it's off not like dangerously so it's a
special recipe where it's like this is
not a traditional yeah you're just a
glitch if you're just like wait a minute
this is this is a little bit of a
variance good my mind says hey wait a
minute that's not all hundred percent 12
cookies like a ninety-nine point nine
percent what I'm gonna give these to
people at Christmas like my family I'm
not gonna tell them until after they ya
see what happens maybe I'll film it
somebody did that with me recently with
a deer hot dog it was nice yeah it was
uh try cuz it did I've been eating a lot
of weird stuff recently I bet so at
least you're not giving blood while
playing video games I'm sorry I do
brought that up yeah no I'm not really
that I can't eat any more could I know I
know you've lost your appetite yeah but
yeah so if you want to check out six
foods you can go over to six foods comic

do too i'm to it um but yeah that's back
at Highgate follow up follow him back at
her hackett so i want to try the chips
cuz that's what that's where they were

like there's like spikes does your
stomach feel weird like circuits are
jumping around in there they just re
like congealed and animated reanimate of
themselves inside your stomach I'm okay
with us as as I think it's Americans
eating more bugs I'm totally cool with
it no that's why banks are good or for
pepper it was like I said listen I'm
like I saw the Kickstarter and I'm like
you know what they make a good point
yeah I'm willing to try it and I did I

20,000 Leagues Under the Sea the
adaptation of Jules Verne's classic
morality tale of balancing the
advancement of technology against the
preservation of nature Verne was so
ahead of his time in his perception of
Technology the story is worth revisiting
as mankind are now faced with the
questions that Verne post just the fact
that burn foresaw the technology behind
the nuclear-powered submarine armed with
nuclear warheads prior to Robert
Oppenheimer's work on the Manhattan
Project warrants are revisiting of this
