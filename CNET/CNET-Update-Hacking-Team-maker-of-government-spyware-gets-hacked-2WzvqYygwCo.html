has just been hacked I'm Bridget Carey
this is your cnet update an italian
software company that helps governments
hack into computers and spy on people
has itself been hacked the company is
called hacking team and hackers took
over the company's twitter account on
sunday and leaked out internal documents
emails employee passwords and source
code what you're looking at now is a
commercial for this hacking team company
it advertises its software as an
untraceable way for governments to hack
into any computer to spy on someone 400
gigabytes of documents from this company
were dumped online but as of this report
the files cannot be independently
verified as being real reporters with
our sister site ZDNet have been combing
through the files and that includes a
list of customers united states agencies
are listed customers including the FBI
Department of Defense and the Drug
Enforcement Administration there's also
a long list of other governments using
the software including Egypt Italy
Mexico Russia Saudi Arabia Spain Sudan
Thailand and Turkey in 2012 reporters
without borders labeled this company as
an enemy of the internet for selling
this encryption breaking software which
reports of it being used to repress
journalists and other activist groups
the hacking team company has previously
denied it does business with oppressive
governments and those that may use the
tools to abuse human rights this all
calls into question whether a company
can sell this type of software to any
government after all hacking software
can be considered a weapon in cyber
warfare this hack is also a gift to anti
surveillance groups who want this
company to be shut down because now it's
going to be hard for any government to
trust this software maker and speaking
of gifts let's transition to Amazon
which is creating its own christmas in
july for prime subscribers amazon is
celebrating its 20th birthday next week
with what it calls prime day on
Wednesday July fifteenth the site will
offer more deals than it did on Black
Friday the catch is that only prime
subscribers can get the deals for one
hundred dollars a year prime brings
several benefits including two day
shipping access to a library
videos music and ebooks but even if you
don't pay for prime you could just sign
up for the free month trial go shopping
on the fifteenth and then cancel the
membership aside from celebratory
birthday sales amazon has launched a
cloud storage app for android and iOS
the Amazon Cloud Drive app is the
company's answer to services like
Dropbox where you pay a fee to store
your files online Amazon's the unlimited
photo and video storage plan costs
twelve dollars a year and unlimited
storage for all sorts of documents will
cost you sixty dollars a year but here's
a tip it's not that great compared to
what other services offer that's it for
this tech news update there's always
