episode 193 of the 359 podcast as I
shatter my keyboard with my bare hands
as you hear in the background here good
morning it's a packed house with Ben
factory when Roger Cheng and Alfred hang
in the house this morning how's
everybody doing good I had a good
weekend yeah and I remembered your name
this morning I know I wasn't what
happened he like totally blanked on my
name last week really I got back my god
back to Barcelona I hope he didn't call
you i don't think it's that guy I as the
wolfpack time uh yeah we're already off
to a great start here Horace so we're
gonna be talking about two items a big
merger Intel buying mobile I for 15
billion dollars and you may not have
heard of mobile i but it is very
important explain to you why it's
important why it's really the key to
Intel's self-driving car ambitions um we
talking about next up Ben's feature on
venmo the secret hip social network
you've probably never heard of unless
your millennial like Alfred they have
been trolling on it like crazy yeah
there you go right take that Sean Spicer
and yes that actually is relevant to the
story shot there was a Sean Spicer
reference in the story Jesse doesn't
spicy spicy spicy spicy all right all
right let's uh let's get started you
have any questions about self-driving
cars intel mobile i then though
Millennials leave in the comments
section we do have a resident millennium
well answer you're welcome in the
comment section brian will pick out the
best and we'll answer them in three
minutes and 59 seconds i do have many
questions about Millennials but let's
get this policy why ha and here we go in
three two
welcome to 359 where we talk about the
top texts of the day and only the crap
we want to throw in I'm road to Chang
I'm Ben Fox Rubin I'm Alfred dang its
merger Monday Intel said it agreed to
buy mobile I and Israeli company
developing tech for self-driving cars
for 15 billion yes but the B dollars
mobile I focuses on machine vision so
the car can see what's around it what's
in front of it and basically operate on
its own then I mean you've been
following this lot more closer than I
have like what are some of the key
details that we need to know about
mobile mobile I is it's basically
self-driving car technology there are a
variety of different types of
self-driving car technology out there
like radar stuff different things like
that what's interesting about mobile I
is is just one camera in the front of
your car and that actually enables it to
be able to see where it's going either
on the highway see if there are
pedestrians in the way different things
like that so I'm not that surprised that
Intel would pursue these guys because
they are in effect a chip maker they
don't make the camera they make the
chips in the software that run this so
is that camera on any self-driving car
dog in any cars now or is it just all
sort of prototyping for like the future
of self-driving cars they actually had
partnered with Tesla for a while and
they pulled out if that deal after if
you remember the guy died yeah from the
that turning on self-driving the
self-driving mechanism but they've also
got a bunch of other partnerships mostly
with premium tier car makers like
Mercedes and BMW the expectation is is
that it'll trickle down to you know cars
that I can actually afford some time
later in the future it's really
interesting what Intel is doing here
right they feel like they missed the
boat on smartphones yeah mobile and
they're like doing everything they can
to get into all these new trends whether
it's AI whether its drones now
self-driving cars VAR e io t yeah
they're really trying to hit like all
these times you don't want to miss
whatever that next red is I don't want
to miss it and some of these trends
really aren't going to happen but Intel
is at least being smart in trying to
place a lot of these bets and I mobile I
is definitely one of these self-driving
car companies that's really on the
forefront of actually trying to make
that happen all right Meg
Ben you wrote a fairly amusing piece on
venmo and for those who don't use them
though they a money exchange service you
know if you want to give you your friend
taking bucks for pizza you give why are
you basically not wire but you send them
via phone your venmo it you venmo to
them but you've sort of looked at the
the fact that they offer this public
feed and how it sort of become a social
network in itself yeah the social
aspects of it were really quite
fascinating to me for instance one of
the ways that people started to jury-rig
the service to try to make it more
social was to just send each other micro
payments so instead of you know texting
Alfred to say like hey Alfred I'm
thinking of you I would send you like 15
cents and be like oh my god like miss
you boo with like I don't know like a
little heart emoji or some and that way
you're compelled to reply because it's
basically oh man it gave him 15 cents I
have to respond to this other how would
you respond to by the way how would you
respond had been giving you fifteen
cents on you boo I'm copies and fifteen
cents back or fifteen dollars but I just
never do this again that's pretty polite
I mean I didn't I did try this with a
friend of mine while I was working on
the story and yeah like I sent him 25
cents and be like hey what's up and he
sent me the 25 cents back and were just
like hey how are you so I don't know I
guess we're still trying to figure that
out however I mean how I mean how often
you use then I use it pretty much every
day because I don't carry cash on me and
in situations where it's like cash only
and a friend is the one that has a catch
I just say look I don't want to go to an
ATM right now how does that work with
you and your group of friends do you
have like a designated cash holder know
the person that just has this giant
money doesn't go usually there's also
you know the one guy who wants all the
reward points on the credit card sure oh
I'll pay for it everyone just venmo me
so I can get all these points for cheap
flights gotcha alright well to read more
about these stories check this out and
seen it I'm Roger Cheng I'm Ben Fox
Rubin I'm Alfred dang thanks for
listening
I like venmo but I disagree with the
social aspect of it cuz you're no Lee I
guess an old man I don't want people to
know what my money doesn't know what you
know I've definitely felt the same way
you know what a great social addition on
venmo would be you know how on Facebook
it tells all your friends like hey it's
your birthday send them like birthday
yeah in one venmo it like sent a message
to all your friends like hey it's like
this person's birthday everyone said I'm
like a dollar yeah yeah like I like this
place click this button is also called
the Tooth Fairy effect yeah oh my god
that is a phenomenal idea what a good
idea why doesn't I have roll that out
tomorrow I just it's the other thing is
that if they already have the social
feed 2 i'm wondering how long it's gonna
be before they roll out pictures and
video because they might as well like if
you're out at a bar with your friends or
you're getting a pizza late at night
whatever snap a picture look I slice of
a caffeine slice like you're already
doing all the emojis and you're sharing
it or whatever like why not inc I mean
what they have the server space for all
that though I have no ideas probably
it's owned by paypal so like why
wouldn't they know it is interesting
because I mean I when I first start
using venmo I was all turned off by the
public feet but after reading your story
I'm like especially the way people troll
each other in terms of like you know
this isn't this is for slice of pizza
that really it's like haha thanks for
last night or whatever like them your
energies thanks for all the hard drugs
right or eggplant emoji yeah thankfully
my fake that's kind of awesome like I
would I told you to be doing it you're
just trying to like screw with your
friends my favorite thing to do is so I
found out that the character limit is
about two thousand characters on venmo
how did you find that I basically just
copy and pasted a large block of text
and wait and kept deleting it until I
saw how many characters there's like you
know thanks for the pizza whatever if
you just keep scrolling down your feet
then you see this giant block of text
probably I've been continuously sending
a person like the entire book of a tale
of two cities how far along are you this
on the first chapter wait wait alkenyl
Alfred meme Lord why are you not sending
in the entire script to be movie because
it's the
there's not enough characters that's
probably like the next thing that I'll
do but I also do like monologues that's
like related to like why like I'm giving
you like this payment there were some
like ode to beer that I found online i
like your ego really you really put a
lot of thunder your venmo yes I don't
want to be like every other venmo
payment out there you're in so therefore
there are like a lot of other like
peer-to-peer payment services like
square cash there's chase quickpay I
also found out after writing the story
that apparently there's a feature on
facebook Messenger that you could send
people money's in facebook oh yeah yeah
which I didn't even I didn't even
realize was there it's like kind of
buried and let it go crack ecommerce
reporter it is not like out in front
right all like you have to find you have
to know that it's there in search for I
mean I don't know that a lot of people
use it it's automatic anytime you send
something with a dollar sign on ebay on
facebook Messenger like you did so it's
a link automatically and you can click
on it like send them that like dollar
amount which is really annoying because
sometimes I just want to say like oh it
costs this much and then as I oh do you
want to send this person like five
hundred dollars but it's so it's Levin
most popular but why aren't people just
using their bank surfaces because you
can you can send that money through text
message now right yeah a lot of them off
for that I do it through chase yeah I do
it through bank of america I think a lot
of it really has to do with the fact
that like venmo has been around for five
years and it came first and it was one
of the biggest ones and so it created
this viral phenomenon with the social
feed so if you start using it you try to
make your friends start using it yeah
and it has this build effect that's the
only reason I jumped on venmo i was
using paypal to like give my friends
money on their hands like just go on
venmo and give me the money like i don't
even know yeah and I was telling like
download paypal instead because yeah i
use paypal or switched over to still use
paypal venmo but then there's older then
loes a verb and venmo has emojis I'm
pretty much won the war out on this one
so is it doesn't matter because vendre
now I mean it's like I mean you take a
look at it we're like yahoo came before
google but then it's just one of those
things where right everyone uses it so
i'm using that yeah and by the way just
a plug for ben's video if you haven't
had a chance go on cnet watch the video
that been shot with one of the vendor
co-founders as he interviewed random New
Yorkers at Grand Central Terminal uh
asking them if they use them if they've
heard of them though some of those
responses are priceless the one woman
there's one just the one woman the
purple ladies surest person we found we
won't we won't spoil for you but you
really gotta watch that vid night it's
awesome thank you I'd the first make the
first comment I saw in our YouTube
channel was she was a true hero cnet
hire her hahaha her name is Regina she
reached out to me on Facebook afterwards
and thank you very much for being
interviewed Regina you choose if she was
issuing so much follows her reaction to
the video did she want I sent her the
video I haven't heard back yet but I
told her she was very much the star of
that video was yeah you should venmo
like guess I should read more well you
can't know we're game for sources so you
can only you can only Bend like a zero
sense key to vendo 0 I'll send her any
because I've tried to do it as an insult
to somebody but I think you're worth
this much I do want to test something
out to Alfred you you had this idea so
it was my birthday on march ninth I
didn't mention it on the show but now
that we're talking about venmo if you
want to venmo me fifty cents I want to
see anybody even father's doing this
probably i'm probably gonna get a boost
actually if it happens you i'm gonna
require quietly you write a story about
this okay all right and my handle is as
my name Ben Fox Rubin oh my god that's
it we'll see once I feel like 25 cents I
me done just one cent tell me one sec
I'm gonna make money yeah I asked for 57
come on man I didn't say you can get a
stick a gun for that so shut up yeah but
anyway we'll see if anybody even you
know a crab legs look yeah her like at
least a cupcake since I'm only asking
for a penny so I do have any questions
actually really not really it's pretty
quiet in the chat today however we
should probably brush on the
self-driving cars again yes so after all
of this it just keeps popping in my head
this is a right time it's a perfect time
to reboot maximum overdrive ooh the
Stephen King the Stephen King movie
movie / book but he actually wrote the
screenplay for the movie and co-directed
a truck was horrified that's not the car
kills people no it's like multiple it's
try like all kinds of you it's
technically all technology gets
possessed by this uh asteroid just
passing by earth I just call trucks and
that's the big showdown is like heavy
machinery corners a bunch of people into
a gas station meanwhile you see this
carnage or people are like getting
choked by their toasters chased by a
remote control car it sounds silly but
it's like just violent enough to still
be cotton oh you're way more horrifying
realistic today the truck has the Green
Goblin on the front of it yes that's
that's what I remember and it's got
Emilio Estevez and there's a rocket
launcher and it's awesome and I love
that movie so much and I think then they
need to reboot it all right all right
until you tell until you have money yeah
there's like a futurama episode that
parodies that when all the robots take
over here yeah yeah but everyone also
say like that the the robot takeover I
for one welcome our robot over that like
that's not a new concept that's not
originated that the spin on the whole
Stephen King thing was like the the the
semi trucks yeah and now that we've got
self-driving cars and be more like a
computer virus infects in they all go oh
that's so that's a plot that's like the
farm fascinating fade in the fate of the
Furious the latest fast in the Furious
movie uh no that Vin Diesel turning on
his whole his bros and family no that's
the plot Slater's trailer we're like
Charlize Theron is like all right oh
you're right yes like like all new york
city like just oh so yeah yeah it's some
of the worst cgi I've ever seen but that
wasn't see you like some of the cars
crashing out of the parking lot you know
that there was a flood of cars coming in
from on the streets that looked like
really bad CD the part in that trailer
that really does i heard this is really
stupid was when the rock like there's
like a wooden yes I was like torpedo and
he actually punches the torpedo aside
and it blows up other cars like I don't
know if that stupid or awesome cuz all
right I don't want to see driving cars
yeah it's any more realer but they're
loving it
all right Oh in related news Jacob craft
wants a Knight Rider reboot which they
already tried yeah they tried it with
the UH suppose a Mustang you think I
forget what the model the car was no
related question related question was
kid autonomous yes yes yes absolutely
wait like it drove you can try to Rome
itself yeah that's right it would always
go to like it has to be able to like
talk to kids rides right now I feel like
Knight Rider and 2017 wouldn't work
though because like when it came out in
like the 70s it was not only the future
of science fiction show that it's real
what is it okay yeah uncle has that is
my grandma that's way you talk to a
watch and it like yeah yeah I can see
that like that's real I don't think
that's why the the reboot failed I think
it failed because it was just crappy
show yeah that Matt had no Hasselhoff so
before we wrap it up today huge yeah
let's go around the horn um we got a
question from Zachary and I'm kind of
paraphrasing here but like I let's find
out from each of you if you personally
are in favor of and find self-driving
cars in that market and that future safe
Ben would you ride in a self-driving car
I've ridden in a self-driving car I
wrote and one immobilized self-driving
cars on the highway and at work and he
survived and I survived and it was fine
I mean do you think there's a difference
in performance between an open highway
and crowded City yes yeah absolutely
yeah open much much safer taking way
more intelligence to actually drive the
city for that machine vision for the
responsiveness that's why she comes in
and all those other things like all
these other technologies have actually
come to promotion before self-driving
cars actually work well everywhere the
thing about it being in a city though is
that it wouldn't be self driving cars
coexisting with cars that are already
out there it would just be like whole
fleet of what no no no but that's the
thing that's the dilemma is early on
it's not gonna be it's not like you turn
on a switch in every car self yeah
they're gonna be like five or six
self-driving cars for everyone to
maximum overdrive catch fire yet but the
problem with like urban areas is that
they're designed for people to be
driving around so like self-driving cars
you know like what's the point of having
all these parking lots of all these cars
are driving on their own any
exactly yeah you could build them out
and you know never argue until they put
forth legislation you will never take um
manual let's cut manual drivers what is
going to be regular regular drivers off
the road now right that's kind of
problems happen it's actually like I I'm
of the belief that self-driving cars are
safer than just human drivers but the
problem is when you mix human and self
drive together then yeah I've got this
combustible mix i think the going back
to the original question to the baseline
involves the fact of like what we're
currently living in and what we're
currently living in is 3 30 thousand
deaths a year or like automotive
residents and you know crashes so if it
improves from there then i would i would
consider it a success we got a really
good question but we actually have to go
because you gotta go somewhere Ben but
let's table this because this is a
fantastic question and we'll bring it
back up because I'm sure those will come
up in another show but think about this
one for the future how about
misinformation on the web interpreted by
your self driving car like knowing one
row one way road was a two way or
something like that yeah its liability
on the manufacture the cars that could
be on google or whoever the map that's a
great cause actual really a debate about
that yeah yeah what it's cable that
because tables until another
self-driving car and what time is it
it's a little 25 I've got I've gotta run
oh yeah you gotta run yeah alright if
you liked anything you heard or saw here
check us out on cnet our podcasts also
available on itunes tune in stitcher
SoundCloud feedburner and google play
music and an orsina a sub-site know i
know i know and maybe you'll see you
tomorrow we're not sure yet cuz we've
got a blizzard coming in tomorrow we
don't know if we'll actually be here so
maybe you'll see you tomorrow yeah we
can stroll away from home and open tamas
we'll figure it out yeah thanks
everybody well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
