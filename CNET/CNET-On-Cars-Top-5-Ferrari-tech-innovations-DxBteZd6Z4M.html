fast gorgeous pricey and far too often
read but lost in all that sometimes is
their technology I'm Brian Cooley here
to remedy that with the top five Ferrari
technology milestones seen that style
we're going to rank them by their broad
influence number five the electrochromic
roof the 2005 superamerica wowed with a
glass roof that went from clear to dark
electrochromic Lee kind of like those
sunglasses that were the rage in the 70s
but in this case triggered by a button
and an electric circuit the thing also
rotated back 180 degrees in case you
still weren't getting enough attention
not only had no one done this
combination before I don't think anyone
has done it since number 4 active
aerodynamics this is Formula One stuff
that Ferrari knows very well but brought
to production cars on the 458 speciale a
movable flaps at each end of the car
change its air flow starting around 90
miles an hour to optimize downforce and
keep the thing on the ground to be fair
though chevy cruze ford focus and dodge
dart also do this though to a
dramatically different end result number
three is the manatee no another lift
from formula 1 the manatee no is the
little handle it's the most serious if
not the first drive mode selector you
find it on Ferrari wheels BMWs M button
and the audi drive mode so let's do
something very similar but Ferraris
little switch as cool as it looks gave
electronic car modes wheel cred number
to a hybrid that's right the recursively
named Ferrari laferrari will be their
first production hybrid though it will
probably lack the ability to run in EV
electric-only mode the way other hybrids
do that's because the company reckons
correctly I think that a Ferrari should
always sound like one now yes Porsche
has the 918 hybrid beating Ferrari to
the punch by a whisker or so but there's
something about a Ferrari hybrid that
has been change more minds globally the
number one Ferrari innovation that
really resonated was no manuals
mission around late-2012 the California
spider became the last Ferrari to offer
a manual gearbox ending the run of the
most iconic and one of the most
unforgiving shift gates in all of
history all Ferraris today's ship with
basically an automatic a dual-clutch
automated manual gearbox now while
Volkswagen was first to market with this
in the 03 golf r32 Ferraris cancellation
of the clutch pedal really signals the
end of an era for more like this go to
cnet on cars.com where it's all about
high-tech cars and modern driving I'm
