of new hardware but it has new software
tricks that are useful too
first to make it easier on your eyes to
read text turn on reading mode which
turns text and images to black and white
in settings go to display and tap
reading mode select the apps you want to
apply reading mode - I chose the New
York Times text messages and of course
CNET's own app now every time you launch
these apps your phone will switch to
reading mode keep in mind everything
turns to black and white so you'll miss
out on any vibrant photos or images once
you quit your phone will switch back to
color in a similar vein night mode
tensor display yellow to make it more
comfortable to read your phone in the
dark and reduce eyestrain previous one
plus phones already had this but now you
can schedule it to automatically turn on
and off at certain times to start go
back to display in settings tap night
mode from there choose what time you
want to start I start turning in around
11:00 p.m. and wake up around 7:00 a.m.
after I chose those times I'm done next
turn off notifications while gaming so
you won't be interrupted tucked under
advanced in settings tap gaming Do Not
Disturb from there to add the games you
want to apply this feature to now you
won't get distracted by pesky
notifications that pop up and when
you're done you can check what you
missed in the notifications menu there's
also expanded screenshots that take
screenshots beyond what you see on the
display to start take a screenshot how
you normally would by pressing the power
button and the volume down button at the
same time then tap the rectangle icon
that appears on the bottom the phone
will automatically start scrolling
taking screenshots and stitching them
together when you want it to stop just
tap the screen and voila you have your
whole screen shot
lastly tweak your phone's vibration to
your liking in settings under sound and
vibration scroll down to vibration from
there you have different patterns to
choose from and you can adjust the
intensity for your cause notifications
and screen tab</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
