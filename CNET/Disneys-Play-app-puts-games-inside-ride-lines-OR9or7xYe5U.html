Disney parks for a vacation there's so
much to see you get to act like a kid
there's all these great rides and part
of that means waiting in long lines yeah
that whole waiting part is not fun but
Disney has a new app to help pass the
time in line it's called play Disney
parks there are many layers to the app
there's music trivia games scavenger
hunts achievements to unlock but the
most interesting thing are these games
that you can only play if you're
standing in line at a certain ride I
tried it out at Toy Story Mania in
Disney's Hollywood Studios in this ride
you are inside andis bedroom waiting in
line the play app has you on a mission
to help woody in the gang build this
carnival toy set at one point you may be
collecting targets for woody or you
could be gathering balloons for a trick
see the dinosaur and when you're on the
ride you're zipping around trying to
shoot those same targets and balloons
what makes these games unique is that
they're themed to the line and the ride
you're about to go on and you're playing
with your friends and family this is not
designed like a typical app game your
whole group plays off of one person's
phone you pass the phone around to
complete challenges sometimes it's
interactive where others have to yell
out the answers a snake just make sure
your Bluetooth and location are turned
on and the app automatically knows what
line you're in and the game will begin
the app can also tell how fast you're
moving through the line and the gameplay
will adjust so it feels like your game
has a start middle and end to the story
but there's even a bit of magic that
happens outside the app the games can
activate special effects in the line at
Peter Pan's flight in Disneyland
Tinkerbell can appear at Space Mountain
in Magic Kingdom look up at the ceiling
before boarding and you'll see an
animation of a space race showing how
your rocket ship scored against other
players not every ride has a game the
team at Disney says they are working on
more content including activities that
are tied to the new Star Wars land
galaxy's edge opening next year you
don't want to be sucked into your phone
on a vacation
but at least now it can be used to
enhance the story and interact with the
world and the people around you now only
if there was an app to deliver ice cream
in line because it's hot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
