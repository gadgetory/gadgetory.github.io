Bridget Carey and this is your CNET
update several new vehicles this year
will have software that works with
iPhones the system is called apple
carplay when an iPhone is plugged into
the car the touchscreen dashboard
displays a simple menu of iOS apps and
drivers can use voice commands to
control tasks and hopefully keep their
eyes on the road ahead
the carplay system taps into your
calendar to suggest directions for
upcoming meetings and appointments if
you get a text message it reads it aloud
and a driver can speak to send a reply
it also of course can play music and
podcasts from iTunes and it works with
other streaming apps like Spotify I
Heart Radio stitcher and beats radio car
play will only work with the new iPhone
models that's the five 5s and 5c but if
you're more the Android type you'll like
this news anyone that buys the new
Samsung Galaxy s5 smartphone is going to
get access to a bundle of free apps and
subscription services worth $500 among
the freebies customers can get one year
of premium service with the personal
trainer app RunKeeper

Wall Street Journal a three month
premium LinkedIn account three months of
Evernote premium and six months of free
storage on box worth 50 gigs and there

the galaxy s5 hit stores on April 11th
for those of you that are still hanging
on to Windows XP you'll start to see
pop-up notifications from Microsoft
urging you to upgrade because the system
will no longer be supported next month

updates for bug fixes and patches and on
the 8th of every month starting this

new Chromebook which is a laptop that
runs Google's Chrome operating system
the Samsung Chromebook 2 comes in two
screen sizes there's an 11.6 inch and a
13 inch and

that is stitched on the edges so it gets
the Chromebook this classy feel that
says I'm off to do business things with
my business Chromebook these Chromebooks
