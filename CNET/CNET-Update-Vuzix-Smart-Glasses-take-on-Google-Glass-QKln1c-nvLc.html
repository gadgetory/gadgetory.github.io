Bridget Carey and this is your CNET
update consumers may have to wait a year
or longer before the Google glass
computerized headsets go on sale but
musics may have its own version out by
the middle of 2013 the music smart
glasses m100 is something like a
hands-free smartphone it has an HD
camera and a color display that's
projected to your field of vision
showing data from your smartphone a
nonworking model was on display in New
York for a Consumer Electronics Show
preview event so I didn't get to see the
projected image for myself but the CEO
described it to me as similar to holding
a smartphone screen 14 inches away from
your eye the image just floats there
videos taken can be saved to a memory
card inside the headset it connects to
both Apple and Android phones via
bluetooth and has the ability to connect
to Wi-Fi it also has built-in GPS and an
accelerometer what you'll be able to do
with this all depends on the apps
created for it the processor is powered
by Android so developers can create
Android apps to do anything like
navigation gaming there are endless
possibilities the company plans to sell
this for less than $500 but we'll just
have to wait until the CES show in
January to find out more the job on up
is back from the dead the fitness
wristband monitor has returned after
being off the market for a year because
the problems with the battery draining
and not recharging production of the up
was halted and customers were given
refunds but Jovan has redesigned it and
it's available for pre-order for one
hundred and thirty dollars this
wristband is supposed to be a computer
you wear on your wrist all day long it
tracks steps logs your sleep length and
quality and it will vibrate if you've
been lazy for too long right now there's
only an app for Apple devices but the
app does give you analysis on your
statistics this version has a stronger
more flexible circuitry and wiring it's
also more resistant to elements this
holiday shopping season you'll see
retail stores eating creative to fight
showrooming that's when you go into a
store like Best Buy or Target to spend
time touching the products but then you
leave to buy it cheaper online some
stores are encouraging customers to use
their apps while inside the store
Walmart
for example has an app for iPhones that
shows deals specific to the store you're
in what aisle you can find an item and
you can buy online if it's not in the
store Toys R Us also redesigned its
mobile shopping apps to help users find
more info and reviews on a product by
scanning the barcode in the store
shoppers can also buy online using the
app and pick it up in the store within
three hours
that's your tech news update you can
find links to all of these stories on
the blog cnet.com / - do Xin New York
