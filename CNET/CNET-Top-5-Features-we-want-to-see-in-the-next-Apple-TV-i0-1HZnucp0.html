car apple is expected to hold an event
pretty soon the rumors saying we'll see
a new iphone maybe a bigger ipad and a
revamped apple TV so we kind of know
what to expect from a new iphone right
iphone 6s it looks the same but it's
slightly faster a bigger iPad it's
slightly larger iPad you can figure this
one out but the new Apple TV could be
really cool that is if Apple decides
this thing is no longer a hobby here are
the top 5 features we want to see in the
next Apple TV at number 5 a new remote
the apple remote proved you didn't need
a complex remote to get things done on
TV however Apple might have to embrace
the future with a less simple remote
maybe something with a trackpad or a
microphone so you don't then type out
everything with this little up and down
arrow key thing perhaps even a private
listening mode like Roku when you can
hear all of Apple music around the house
like if it was an iPod or something hey
that's actually really good idea I don't
say so myself oh yeah this thing gets
lost in the couch cushions all the time
lives a perfect shape to fit right
between two cushions how about a speaker
that chirps when you use a find my apple
TV remote on your phone a number for the
mythical Apple TV service the apple TV
is now 8 years old it's very Apple but
it's kinda light on the TV parts we've
heard rumors about an apple TV service
that could be like sling TV or Sony's
PlayStation view service either way it'd
be nice to see Apple enter the
over-the-top world of offering
television over the Internet imagine
instead of authenticating with all those
apps on appletv just authenticating once
and watching whatever you wanted more
players in the streaming world means
better deals for us normal people number
three a new interface this one's really
self-explanatory the big jeweled
interface has to go Apple installs new
apps whatever once wherever once there
must be a better way to display all of
those options we have
he even like folders or something like
iOS at number two search and suggestions
there are plenty of streaming services
available on the appletv a finding stuff
now that's difficult we'd love to see a
universal search function that can
search through whatever apps are on the
appletv a search that doesn't put apple
services at the top while turning a
blind eye to other services so yeah we
want more Roku functions in the Apple TV
before we get to number one here's some
stuff we don't want to see in the next
Apple TV we don't really care if it's
thinner or lighter it's got to be a
certain weight so it doesn't get pulled
off a shelf by an hdmi cable also keep
the same number of ports on the back
hdmi optical audio and ethernet they're
all hey okay with us it's now time for
the number one thing we want to see in
the next Apple TV apps and an app store
for far too long the Apple TV has been
disclosed offworld an apple TV owner
doesn't just get to choose what after
they install like I said before apolis
all's new apps with software updates we
really want to see an app store that
lets you choose all kinds of things
maybe access to an amazon app maybe
games with a touchpad enabled remote
like on our wish list that can really
work what about apps to control your
start home give us an app store apple
give it to us do you think the next
Apple TV should play blu-ray discs and
be 4k compatible should play VHS tapes
really you think that well let me know
when Twitter i'm matt is for more top
fives like this visit top five dot cnet
com thanks for watching and I'll see you
next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
