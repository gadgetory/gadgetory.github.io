LG's brand-new g6 and so far we think it
is a lot to make up for last year's
quite clunky modular design off the
cheese pie but we've got the Samson
Guard to sa just around the corner so
Jess do you think the g6 doesn't have to
hold it against something you know I
think that it is mostly it's not the g5
which was a terrible
so what LG's services gone mainstream
and everything about those problems I
don't like even expect any look
different wasn't working same seems to
work
I really like the foot of the shape it's
narrow LG's making a big deal over the
screen ratio but most importantly is
that you have a lot work screen to work
with in a smaller space and they say one
hand and operability and I agree is
actually really comfortable and it to
use with one hand I think it looks
really good as well last year's design
of the g5 really gray and boring and
plain which was disappointing to begin
before they had this all leather g4
wasn't amazing dish I think is a bit of
a return to form up but we've got some
big things coming from Samsung some of
the rumors it's where we've got all
screen phone with no home button so it's
almost camera module just like this one
and what LG has also done is its try to
close the gap between what some of the
Samsung flagship phones usually have and
then
so it is adding wireless charging and
that's actually for the US and water
person so that they'll say you'll be
able to get the foot wet right off all
of that and those were two advantages
that the Samsung Galaxy has phones last
year had what we're expecting the galaxy
has eight possibly have that the LG G 6
because it would be in a curved screen
great and a faster processor basically a
few more chocolate specs and maybe I
think a bit more in the resolution of
the camera make it a bit more for pro
shooters but generally I think what
they've done is almost look at the
rumoured specs of the SI anything okay
well let's do some of these things first
so that works yeah so that it's more a
level playing field because the last
year there was a big big discrepancy
between how good the s7 was with that
amazing curved screen and then the g5
with just a bit late I think one see the
design they could have done more with it
but it was a gimmick and it didn't
really didn't excite anybody in LG even
a better themselves
it wasn't the success they hoped it
would be I'm glad you said giving
because that's one other thing the
Samsung Galaxy S II phones are rumored
to get their very own a I possibly
called vixx me
and the LGG sex does have Google
assistant on board so that is something
principal
do you think well is it really going to
be that much better on the Samsung phone
it might be but it might also wind up
being a given so I think at the end of
the day if you're an everyday user
somebody who just wants a good phone the
price that you're willing to pay and
maybe you don't really care as much
about your phone process of being that
much better
they might might not be very very you're
just not going to know it's and that's
going to be March 20 yep March 29th I
had in the meantime we will have plenty
more coverage and hopefully a full
review of the LG g 6 so do you make sure
to keep it seen it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
