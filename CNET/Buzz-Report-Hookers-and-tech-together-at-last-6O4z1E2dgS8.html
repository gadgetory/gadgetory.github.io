buzz report this week TV on your
computer more dangerous cell phone news
and prostitution rings but first to the
gadget of the week the gadget of the
week is the axial tron mod book now this
has been the talk of the town lately
axio tron took this standard macbook and
they reworked it into a tablet even
bigger news apple is not planning to sue
them they're totally allowing this the
modbook costs about a thousand dollars
more than a regular macbook and it's a
big ole heavy tablet mac that you can
pay a lot more for if you're one of the
137 people or so who really need this
but you know what in the land of gadgets
sometimes there doesn't have to be a
reason they're only has to be a will and
the engineering skill to make that will
a reality and i gotta respect that and
now for the news we're actually starting
off this week with what's clogging the
tubes it's hulu.com hulu came out of
beta this weekend office productivity
around the world ground to a halt hulu
is the online video site launched by
nbc/universal and News Corp and it
features new and old shows from NBC and
Fox you've got 30 rock you've got heroes
the office Battlestar Galactica they've
also got new deals to deliver movies
here they are from lionsgate MGM Warner
Brothers now a lot of people are worried
that hulu is not gonna make any money
because no one's gonna go there or like
you can't download stuff to your ipod Oh
family guy hey can we shoot the rest of
this later there's good stuff on here
fine you couldn't work
anyway a new study finds that simply
listening to a cell phone even with the
hands-free headset presents a dangerous
distraction to drivers researchers say
they want to raise awareness of the
problems of using cell phones while
driving but they're not asking for a ban
or anything like that the researchers
did say that it is not known whether
talking to a passenger or listening to
the radio while driving has an equally
detrimental effect I'm sorry what it is
not known so we've done dozens of
studies on the effects of using cell
phones while driving and none on the
possible dangers of passengers talk
radio navigation systems eyeliner
paperback novels cigarettes children the
fail point in this equation is pretty
easy to spot and it's actually got
nothing to do with cell phones you know
what I'm saying this week as you know
New York Governor Eliot Spitzer champion
of the little people was busted for
frequenting a prostitution ring my
colleague over at ZDNet Larry Dignan
wrote an interesting piece about how
sophisticated IT networks helped bring
Spitzer down basically it goes like this
the prostitution ring was already under
investigation due to some shady
financial business on top of that
federal officials had been monitoring
suspicious money transfers made by
Spitzer which eventually led them to a
company called qat which was the alias
for the prostitution ring since they
were both under investigation everything
fell into place see Spitzer's
transactions looked like they were kept
below ten thousand dollars to avoid
federal reporting rules but that can
actually help tip off the FBI if you
have multiple transactions that are just
under ten thousand dollars basically
when banks record any of these
transactions they end up in a giant
super powerful federal database that
crunches the numbers and looks for
irregularities see
this is what sucks about being a
technology reporter covering a big sex
scandal Wolf Blitzer gets to talk about
hookers and services and all I get to
talk about this databases I'm Hollywood
and this defend the buzz report thanks
