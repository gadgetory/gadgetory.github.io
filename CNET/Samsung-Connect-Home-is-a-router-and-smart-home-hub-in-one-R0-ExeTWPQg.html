at the galaxy estate event in New York
City
the Samsung Connect home is similar to
what we saw with Google Wi-Fi it's an
attractive and compact router that is
designed to be easy to use you can
purchase just the single router or pick
up multiple devices that can be used as
networking extenders to expand your
Wi-Fi coverage throughout your house or
apartment the connect home is all about
making it easy for average consumers to
improve their Wi-Fi networks everything
from setting it up to managing your home
network is done - the Samsung Connect
app this app can also be used to manage
Samsung branded smart home appliances
such as the company's family hub
refrigerator now what's really
interesting is that the router will also
work as a hub for Samsung smartthings
home automation system and the app will
let you program and control smart things
compatible devices from third-party
vendors so that means you will no longer
need a separate smartthings hub we're
still waiting on pricing and release
information but Samsung did say that
plans to offer a pro version that will
come with five units and offer faster
Wi-Fi speeds and more coverage for full
specs and to see the latest information
