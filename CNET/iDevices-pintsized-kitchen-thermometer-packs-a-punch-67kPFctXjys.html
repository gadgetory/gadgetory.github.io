with iDevices kitchen thermometer mini
basically this is a $40.00 kitchen
thermometer with a twist similar to I
devices regular kitchen thermometer the
mini version is Bluetooth enabled and
will pair to your phone and send you
alerts when your food is done it's
really just a more minimalist version of
their regular kitchen thermometer it
only has one thermometer probe it
doesn't have a digital display that
shows the temperature but it does have
an LED ring that'll show you the status
of your food if you happen to be walking
by the kitchen performance-wise the
temperature readings were just as
accurate as the regular kitchen
thermometer I tested it simultaneously
with the kitchen thermometer during the
whole chicken roasting test and the pork
tenderloin test and found really no
difference in performance whatsoever
you're also using the same iDevices app
to monitor the progress of your food and
to receive those alerts when it's
finished so just like the other review I
really like the functionality of the app
I think the graphs could use a little
bit of design work but other than that
it works extremely well so I know that
this is designed to be cute and compact
but one thing I don't like about it is
that it's powered by a coin battery coin
batteries are those little coin shaped
batteries they can go and watches or any
smaller product so it makes sense for
this product but a lot of us don't have
coin batteries just sitting around the
house you have to make that effort to
think to buy one and that's just a bit
of an annoyance it's not a huge huge
deal breaker but it's just something
you'll have to think about the regular
kitchen thermometer is powered by two
double-a batteries and you probably have
a bunch of those already hanging around
your house it almost makes me wish that
this had a USB port for charging so that
you didn't have to rely on the battery
quite so much because it can drain
quickly for example if you don't make a
concerted effort to turn it off after
you use it it will stay on for hours
until it automatically shuts off that
will completely zap the battery life and
then you'll have to go out searching for
another coin battery another thing is
that you actually have to turn on the
device to use the app at all so if you
wanted to scroll through the list of
presets to find the food you want to
cook you have to turn this on before
you're even ready to cook another thing
that could zap the battery in general
though its performance is on par with
the regular kitchen thermometer
and it's a decent lower price option if
you don't need to thermometer probes if
you just need the one this is $40
compared to the kitchen thermometers $80
so while it's a bit more entry-level
you're really getting the same
performance thanks for watching I'm
