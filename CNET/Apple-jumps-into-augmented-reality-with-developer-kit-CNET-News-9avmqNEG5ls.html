multi-touch we've really changed the way
that you interact with the world on the
screen of your iPhone and with the
camera we've allowed you to capture the
world around you but when you bring
these things together the results can
actually be quite profound
now it's called augmented reality and we
have a new core technology called a arc
hit to bring it to all of you and I'd
like to show it to you in a demo now so
we've all seen a lot of carefully edited
vision videos on this topic recently but
in this case I'd like to show you
something for real so what we see here
is an iPhone that's look using its
camera but using computer vision it's
actually able to identify surfaces such
as this table and I can actually just
add an object this is a developer
application a test application that
you'll all be getting code for that
allows you to do these things now this
is a virtual object on this table now
got some some steam in there coming off
the cup now I can add other objects to
the scene and these things can actually
interact let's add a lamp and I want you
to watch when I turn the lamp off on the
dynamic shadows here I'm going to move
the cup and watch how the shadow moves
in relationship to the light here it's
really pretty incredible now I can add
additional objects let's add a vase to
this to this scene I mean isn't that
just incredible you guys are actually in
the shot here with these objects all in
augmented reality so it gives you a
little bit of an idea of the technology
involved it's really pretty incredible
now how do we do it well a arc it
provides fast and stable motion tracking
and it uses all of the sensors and the
camera on your device to do this it
actually finds planes like floors and
tables it's able to estimate ambient
light which helps us with the rendering
and also helps with scale you notice
that cup hit the table looking the size
of a cup not the size of an elephant and
we provide integration to all kinds of
third-party frameworks to help you with
your rendering the implementation is
possible because we're able to take
advantage of the awesome hardware and
iOS devices the cameras the
high-performance CPU and GPU and the
motion sensors when you bring the
software together with these devices we
actually have hundreds and of millions
of iPhones and iPads that are going to
be capable of AR and in fact that's
going to make overnight AR kit the
largest AR platform in the world</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
