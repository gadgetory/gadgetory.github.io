welcome to the buzz report first our
gadget of the week it's the brand new
palm folio sort of a thin client laptop
companion to go with your smartphone
initially just trio's what it gives you
as a big screen and a full-size keyboard
for email attachments web access it has
its own Wi-Fi access or it can borrow a
connection off your 3g trio it has
instant on and off that's nice it's thin
and sexy and most importantly it
scratches that it's that every
smartphone user has felt when their
screen is too small and the keyboard is
too small so what does this thing give
me more trepidation than a blonde James
Bond playing poker well here's a few
reasons the battery life is just five
hours that seems rather little for a
low-power device that has no hard drive
it doesn't run office or anything like
that you have to press a button to sync
the email from your treo to your folio
but what really gets me is that it seems
to ask us to start carrying another
device at least part of the time if I'm
going to start carrying anything more
when I'm running around and traveling
it's going to be a bottle of bourbon the
way I fear the palm engineers have been
doing now the news Microsoft's Windows
Media Center hasn't exactly sparked a
revolution in the living room has it so
now they focus on just one piece of
furniture the table this is called
surface a coffee table computer that's
been all the buzz this week using a
fisher-price looking version of Windows
driven by a giant touchscreen with
cameras under the glass it can read
barcodes and respond to multiple touches
at once you'll see it at t-mobile stores
where you'll use that instead of talking
to a human to buy a phone that could be
a good thing and it's Starwood Hotels
properties where it might be a place
you'd sit down and order a cocktail in
some food right there on the screen kind
of the digital version of one of those
really unappetizing laminated menus this
all sounds very advanced but I wonder
this will the surface have the correct
touchscreen drivers and dll's to
recognize real world inputs like teenage
Punk's carving they're moronic tags into
it stop check out this buzz-worthy tech
developed by a former doctor who before
that was a real estate agent and a pizza
chef and came up with the technology
while roaming around Mardi Gras in 1972
sound like an IPO to you it's called
chroma phones a color alphabet that
replaces each letter of the 26 with a
unique color like this animated poem
we're watching L is read you as light
yellow v is electric blue which spells
love just not correctly it is said that
this technology would allow us to embed
textual messages into any graphical
image so while looking at a Warhol print
you could also be reading your phone
bill plus things that are colorful
already might take on unintentional new
meanings like this hot dog on a stick
uniform let's decode it ooh not taking
the kids there anymore are we and
finally a new wrinkle in Google Maps got
a lot of buzz this week what they call a
street-level view as if you're a
pedestrian on the sidewalk it's only
enabled for a few major metro areas so
far and it's both really cool and really
invasive here's cnet's front lobby for
example you can see we're able to walk
up and down the street turn around 360
zoom in on the plaza recognize faces see
who's goofing off and smoking and it
gets really interesting when you search
a residential address zoom in see the
house number what car they own maybe
even read the license plate you can
basically reverse-engineer the kind of
license plate address lookup that most
states require a court order to do now
this isn't the first tool that lets you
do this but coming from google it'll be
the first one that gets all kinds of
visibility and freaks people out i'm
brian cooley this has been the buzz
report thanks for watching
