here and welcome to the apple pie for
all the good and bad inside the world of
Apple now we're giving you an in-depth
preview of what to expect at WWDC 2011
the winners of our iPad 2 giveaway will
be announced and much more so let's get
to the show Apple officially announced
that WWDC will be all about software
with Mac os10 lion iOS 5 and their
anticipated iCloud service steve jobs
will be part of the keynote and that
pretty much means it's going to be a big
deal Apple's iCloud services arguably
the most intriguing out of these three
amigos and cnet's own Greg Sandoval
reported that Universal Music Group has
signed on which brings all of the big
four music labels on board now the big a
has also reach agreements with some of
the large music publishers and we can
expect to see more details at WWDC now
seen it also reports that the revenue
from cloud song sales will be split with
the labels getting fifty-eight percent
the music publishers getting twelve
percent and Apple taking a thirty
percent cut sources say music streaming
will not be available on monday but it
will be offered soon and apples digital
Locker will only store music purchased
at iTunes initially but it plans to
source songs acquired outside of iTunes
later in the future cnet also reported
earlier that the iCloud service won't be
just for music and the Cupertino kids
are racing to license movies and TV
shows from Hollywood studios and TV
networks but we may or may not see those
deals come together by Monday's
announcement now the LA Times also
reports that the iCloud service will
initially be free for people who
purchase music from itunes but the
company plans to charge a subscription
fee for about twenty-five dollars a year
for the service now $25 for a year
that's 50 tacos from jack in the box and
you know what you can count me in now
with all the talk about the iCloud the
software that really will impact the
most people is iOS 5 techCrunch reports
that apple plans to roll out a
completely revamped notification system
something that they need desperately
plus widgets like this concept video
that would provide quick access to
information without the need for
launching an app now if it sounds kind
of like android
well you're right now Google and Apple
just renew their contract to have google
maps and search as a standard part of
iOS but they'll need to bring an
improved maps with turn-by-turn
directions in iOS 5 to keep up with the
competition Plus voice to text for
messages and voice searching will need
to be integrated it's not asking too
much but I'm really expecting a lot out
of iOS 5 now we've shown you also a lot
of the key features in Mac OS 10 line
and according to Apple Insider the
latest developer build a mac OS 10.6
point 8 get users ready for an upgrade
to line directly through the mac app
store we've had our hands online over
the past two months but forget about
those features you know what's the most
important thing all new desktop
backgrounds for example bristle grass
pop to pull the pose we all fall out
elephant
and Forests see the one thing you don't
know about me I can really fly now on to
the quick bites keynote Pages and
Numbers are now universal apps on iOS
bringing the apps to the iphone and ipod
touch so weird process spreadsheet and
slide show away on your three and a half
inch screen now we also told you how
Apple's legal team was granted access to
unreleased hardware from Samsung in
their ongoing legal battle of you copied
me and I copied you so Samsung they took
a page out of apples playbook and
they've requested that they get access
to apple's ipad 3 and apple's iphone 4s
or five and other next generation
devices well played Samsung now apple
has released an update for Mac OS 10
that includes a native malware removal
tool that detects that dirty Mac
defender and maintains an anti-malware
definitions list then a new version of
Mac defender was written to circumvent
the OSN update so now Apple is updated
their definitions to detect this new one
see this game of cat and mouse it's
coming to your Mac and you know me I
hate cats and I hate mice unless it's
that cute stuart little guy like
seriously how can you hate a mouse that
cute and this story comes from the
department of do not ever do this the
shanghai daily is reporting that a 17
year old kid sold one of his own kidneys
in exchange for money to buy an ipad 2
he could not afford he was paid about
3,400 US dollars the surgery was
arranged by a broker and he used the
money to buy the ipad now here's a red
flag people when you hear the word
kidney surgery and a broker from the
internet in the same sentence don't do
it that's a serious bad apple and
honestly we just hope the kid is okay
