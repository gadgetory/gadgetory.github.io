that luggage could have told you where
it was this one can is the blue smart
carry on it's smart luggage it's packed
full of features including the power to
weigh itself let's take a look so this
suitcase got where it is today thanks to
crowdfunding it actually raised two
million dollars on crowdfunding website
IndieGoGo now its main feature so that
it can track its own location so there's
a partnership in place with Telefonica
which means there's a sim card in this
thing so that it can locate itself
internationally and that's included in
the price so you want to pay an extra
monthly fee for the sim card so what
about security well you can lock this
thing remotely using the app and if you
want you can even have it unlocked when
you get close which saves you from
fiddling around with a combination
padlock now if you're not a particularly
light packer then this next feature is
going to be really cool this thing can
actually weigh itself how on earth does
it do that you ask well there are two
sensors just under the handle hit and
when you pull that up it figures out how
much the bag weighs at the moment blue
smart says the thing can weigh itself
with ninety percent accuracy they are
working on fine-tuning that if you get
too far away from the suitcase this
thing can send you a text which should
help prevent you from leaving it in a
taxi or a restaurant for example and it
can also track how many miles you've
traveled if your phone runs out of
battery there's a 10,000 milliamp hour
battery inside the suitcase and that's
going to get you up to six iphone
charges if you're not charging your
phone then that battery should last up
to six months it's going to be shipping
after the summer there's only this one
size of suitcase to start with but blue
smart tells me it has plans to expand
but this one will be selling for about
four hundred and fifty dollars alright
let me know what you think and check out
cnet com / mwc for much
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
