this is a review of the LG g2 google TV
it's been a tough year for the google TV
what with logitech blaming google for
losing a lot of money and the
underwhelming honeycomb update but
that's not stopping companies forging
ahead with new releases the LG g2 series
is the second television to feature
google TV after last year's sony and it
certainly looks futuristic with its
brushed aluminium bezel and unique stand
the user interface is also a little
different from standard with a
combination of both LG's and Google's
smart TV layout while it looks pretty
it's a shame the menu system is tough to
use if you want to do anything other
than customize the shortcuts the best
thing about this product though is the
hybrid magic motion remote with its
integrated keyboard it's the Swiss Army
knife of control devices and a million
times more easy to use in samsung smart
interaction system with its waving about
and shouting doodads and thingamabobs
are all well and good but what about the
picture quality well I'll just say that
that's the biggest disappointment the TV
has really shallow black levels which
makes images indistinct and colors
aren't as vibrant as its competitors
while 3d images are much more
comfortable to watch than even last
year's LTE passive TVs it's the lack of
blacks that destroy the illusion of
access is also a problem with an oil
slick appearance on dark sections of the
picture while it might look pretty the
LG google TV is hobbled by the android
interface and just too expensive at
1,600 for the 47 inch and 2100 for the
55 inch do yourself a favor and buy the
panasonic st50 instead this has been ty
pendlebury with a review of the LG
google TV</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
