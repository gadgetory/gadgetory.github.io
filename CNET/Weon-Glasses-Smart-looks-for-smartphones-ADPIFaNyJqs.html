it and we are at Mobile World Congress
2014 and we've been taking a look at all
sorts of devices wearable technology
we've got goggles watches wristbands all
sorts of stuff and sometimes it can be
just crazy complicated and are you
really going to use that in your regular
life so right now we're taking a first
look at the we on glasses and if you
look at this it looks just like a
ordinary pair of eyeglasses has a very
standard frame certainly not a Google
glass device here you couldn't even tell
it was anything special had any
high-tech capabilities at all but what
you'll notice is there's LED in the arm
that will light up when notifications
happen on your smartphone so if you get
an email social media alert Twitter
message it'll light up in the corner of
your peripheral vision right there by
the corner eye and you'll be able to
know what's happening without actually
digging into your pocket for your phone
now another thing you can do is you can
actually set the color for the
notifications so you can have green or
red or yellow whatever depending on what
kind of notification comes in so one of
the really interesting things about the
weon glasses is that it has a way to
locate it if you lose it so say you
don't know where it is it could be under
the couch behind the bed somewhere in
the house all you got to do is go over
to your smartphone open the app and it's
a little radar display essentially just
locate the glasses by the Bluetooth
signal so you don't have to worry about
you know did you leave it at home on the
train or somewhere down the street
hopefully every pair of eyeglasses will
have this in the future so the weon
glasses are expected to ship by May of
2014 and the approximate we are told it
should cost them 129 euros or the u.s.
dollar equivalent so that's probably
going to be the same price it also will
be available in America as well as
Europe so there you have it folks we
just took a first look at the Leon
glasses at Mobile World Congress 2014
