welcome to tomorrow daily the best geek
talk-show the known universe if you're
sick of Apple News this is your
counter-programming Emma I'm Geoff
kanata it is time for headlines Stanford
students are pioneering and showing off
some impressive face mapping and
imitation technology that is a little
bit terrifying this group has been
working on an animation system that uses
one person's face to animate the face of
another human and it's super creepy the
target person's face is scanned and made
into an animated face and then a source
can sit down get scanned and control the
animations facial expressions and speech
they're able to manipulate videos in
real-time and because the software can
account for lighting in the targets
original video it looks incredibly
realistic the first thing I thought of
when I looked at this Ashley is there is
no more truth no you're gonna really
keep an eye on stuff you guys anybody
can be made to say anything now how
we're actually animated right now
Sanford is making this show yeah the
more of it anytime you put yourself on
video good luck ever not saying the
things you don't want to say exactly
really weird and be a super creepy but I
have a feeling I'll just B's in like
snapchat or something right it's like
where the technology's going up hey guys
if you weren't planning on having
nightmares tonight you better think
again cuz I'm about to introduce you to
Sophia Sophia is a robot from Hanson
robotics and she recently attended self
by Southwest to showcase her abilities
she has 62 facial and neck architectures
and a patented skin called frubber
and during a QA about her ambitions she
accidentally let this gem slip do you
want to destroy humans please say no ok
I will destroy humans that's probably a
glitch right guys but just in case we
should keep a close eye on her Hanson
robotics says they want to make robots
like her for theme parks care facilities
education and more uh and also as I
mentioned at the end of the story of my
nightmares that is exactly what this
she's terrifying we want to make them
for and
take care and education and the ultimate
subjugation of all humans yeah if I was
one of those programmers though I would
totally have put that in as a prank I
know I'm sure that's unlike somebody
probably put it as a joke or whatever
it's not a joke maybe it's not I don't
listen guys Sophie is coming for you and
there's nothing you can eat what have we
learned today Ashley fear and no more
truth your everything trust nothing
these are these are the things we've
learned today good day you like to talk
about on Thursday show I really want to
talk about the face mapping technology
because I that I really do think the
ramifications of that are very serious
very serious pretty pretty unreal um
okay yeah let's talk about face mapping
if you guys want to get in on that
conversation or if you want to just send
me your nightmares that you have tonight
after Sofia please tweet out a season
hashtag hey TD
yeah if you shout at us using that
hashtag on the Twitter's well
incorporate what you say into our show
on Thursday it's so fun for everybody
that's very true
alright guys let's check out our phone
tagra for the day today's phone
