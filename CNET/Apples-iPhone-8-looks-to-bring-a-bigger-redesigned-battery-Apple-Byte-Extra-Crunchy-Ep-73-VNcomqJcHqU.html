episode 73 from an undisclosed location
somewhere in California
I'm Brian Tom your host Steven Beecham
my main man he is still on a break I'm
here remotely so we will get back on
track as you're used to with our video
and our audio together because come on
two voices are better than one
but this is what we have here it's me
and you together in your car at home
maybe on the toilet because I know some
of y'all listen to it like that again
this show is all about you and not all
about us you can call us at
1-800-669-9133
the computer industry then we have the
iPod people don't talk about the iPod
because guess what
the iPod is kind of dead now but it
completely changed how we consume music
there were plenty of mp3 players out
there before I mean I still have my
original iPod it still works today the
original four gig iPod it still works
with iTunes
it used a FireWire 400 connection so I
basically have this adapter that goes
from firewire 400 to firewire 800 to
Thunderbolt and it still works with
iTunes today I that is crazy to me also
the biggest thing the iPhone in 2007 and
I think the timing of this was obviously
meant to be on purpose Apple announced
this past week the official name of
their spaceship UFO campus they're going
to call it Apple park and the new
headquarters is in Cupertino
it's literally I don't like ten minutes
away from where I was born and where I
grew up in Cupertino off of a wolf off
of wolf and you're nearby Wolf and
Lawrence on 280 if you knew that
northern Northern California area for a
longest time it's been referred to as
Apple Campus 2 but it is now going to be
called Apple Park it also will have a
one thousand seat auditorium that will
be named the Steve Jobs theater this is
a 175 acre campus it will be ready for
employees to start occupying it in April
this is according to Apple the process
of moving more than 12,000 people into
the mothership will take over six months
and then they'll continue construction
of the buildings and park lands
throughout the summer now Apple began
hiring staff for the campus back in
November and again it's fitting that
this announcement comes during the same
week and today Friday as of this
recording is the day that Steve Jobs
would have turned 62 years old so a
happy birthday shout out to SJ just some
of the things that make this a structure
a building unlike other it has a 2.8
million square foot main
building entirely clad in the world's
largest panels of curved glass like this
is s J's legacy here that we're talking
about seventeen megawatts of rooftop
solar Apple Park will run one of the
largest on-site solar energy
installations in the world it's also one
of the world's the site of the world's
largest naturally ventilated building
and is projected to require no heating
or no air-conditioning for nine months
of the year so this is just this this is
unlike any structure we've seen and it
looks amazing you guys can all see that
and check out some of the pictures that
Apple has posted you can always see the
drone footage that people are flying
have done over the campus I'm kind of
showcase its construction but there we
go we just wanted to shout out to SJ and
give him you know just the credit that
he deserves for building one of the most
amazing companies and his legacy lives
in the iPhone so let's talk about it
let's talk about iPhone 8 or iPhone 7s
really I think this is all kind of
ramping up towards the iPhone 8 or at
least let's talk about the premium OLED
rumored five-point image iPhone now we
talked about wireless charging last week
Apple joined recently officially joined
the wireless power consortium there's
over 200 companies in there there they
support a single standard for wireless
charging it's called Qi and everyone
thought oh maybe Apple is gonna jump on
the jump onboard and instead of this
long-range idea of wireless charging
which Apple has put out patents for
maybe they're gonna go with Qi and just
be able just put it on a plate and some
people aren't too stoked about that we
have to also remember again the Apple
watch is a tweaked version of the Qi
wireless charging standard it's not the
official you know adopted protocol
across the board that's why you can't
use other charging pads with the Apple
watch you have to use Apple's charger of
course you do if they did something like
this for the iPhone we'd expect the same
but according to Reuters five different
group
or at least five different groups are
working on wireless charging ahead of
the iPhone 8 now they haven't
necessarily settled on the one yet
according to the report there's still
the coin of people with knowledge of the
matter they're still looking at
potentially doing this long ranged
wireless charging patents have shown
something like the IMAX or if he doesn't
base for that but we don't we don't know
the one thing we do know though is that
the iPhone 8 production is expected to
start relatively soon so if they haven't
nailed that down and there have been no
reports that have said oh yeah it's
definitely coming
you know the long-range wireless you're
probably gonna expect to see some type
of wireless charging drop it on a pad
but let's be honest if you want to take
this the next level you've doing
long-range wireless charging beam it'll
have a charge while you're even just say
like 10 15 feet away from from the
actual charging base in a room that has
a clear line of sight I'm not expecting
it to go through walls but if there's a
way to put some sort of station and as
long as it has a line of sight to charge
it let's let's let's say 10 to 15 feet
somewhere around there that that would
be something worth squawking about for
sure so we'll see how that shakes out
but again there's it's not it's not a
done deal where that goes um in other in
other news just surrounding the iPhone
whether this is the iPhone 7s or the
iPhone 8 we don't know exactly you know
which product but according to Ling
cheek whoa this dropped a little while
ago kji securities analysts has said
that the iPhone 8 and this is in
quotations will have a stacked logic
board design that allows for a larger
2700 milliampere our l-shaped battery
that would fit in a 4.7 inch form factor
right so that is the smaller screen
iPhone which I would I would love and
the goal here would be to have the same
battery power that people are currently
getting out of the larger iPhone 7 plus
sorry yeah
the iPhone 7 plus with their with its
2900 milli ampere our battery
you got about like what a little about
maybe an hour and a half or two with the
real world you should get more juice
that that is what they're trying to
bring base on this new logic board
design and an l-shaped battery most of
time the batteries are just a single
rectangle but that L is gonna give you a
little extra boost a little extra juice
that is the rumor that the new design
will support that which is which is nice
I think though look if you want to talk
about what is the phone with the best
bet what are we really looking for like
what battery life do we want just just
go look around and go hunt for the
Lenovo p2 all right now this is not a
phone that everyone's going to buy right
off the bat but this guy has battery
that basically will last you a solid two
days it has a 5100 milliamp per hour
battery inside okay it has a battery
saver mode but two days of battery life
without charging I'm telling you like
that is what we want to see and I know
why we get larger screens these phones
do so much more but if someone could get
me guaranteed even not even let's let's
get a day and a half I'd be impressed
but you give me two days of battery life
that that is that is what we're talking
about so right now if the benchmark is
the Lenovo p2 for the best battery life
I'm not gonna expect it to get all the
way there but get me get me at least
through the next morning that then we're
talking all right so we'll see but again
that is the rumor new design for the
iPod iPhone 7 with its support now
another thing is we've talked about how
look this might be a complete slate
glass design at least if we're talking
about the iPhone premium edition what is
gonna have to happen to the touch ID
button because most likely if it's going
to be a flat surface kind of the dream
that Johnny I've always had it's going
to lose a button so Apple Insider found
a recent patent application that was
published just on Thursday that might
give us an idea of where they're
thinking with you know different
biometric sensors we've heard rumors
there'll be a 3d imaging sensor to
potentially use your face to unlock your
phone we've obviously seen that in other
products being able to face unlock your
phone from Samsung they do have
acquisitions from primeSense a long time
ago the company that built and made the
Kinect camera for Microsoft Apple
acquired that company so obviously
they're gonna be using some of their
technology with depth sensors and 3d
sensors again this has not been
confirmed that this is going to the case
but a root of a patent report here from
that has been applied for by Apple
focuses on acoustic imaging technology
that might replace touch ID in the
future so this is what this is a it's a
finally for acoustic image sis imaging
system architecture so this is what
happens they put down an array of
acoustic transducers beneath the display
all right so what these do is these
transducers they generate acoustic waves
pretty much think of like pulses that
move through the surface of the screen
let's say you have your finger on the
screen and what it does is it then
senses if there's any imperfections or
things in the way so when an acoustic
wave hits something it's going to just
be stopped right so think about the
ridges of your finger something that
detailed it can monitor reflections
attenuations diffractions and these
acoustic waves basically now see that
fingerprint or that finger on that
screen they know what it is and that can
be used as the next gen version of the
touch ID sensor to completely remove the
touch ID button that's the that's the
whole goal here using sound waves and
this acoustic imaging system that can
lay again directly underneath the screen
as a fingerprint unlocked this is not
something that has been to confirm to
even be anywhere close to being
implemented into any iPhone yet this is
just a patent application of the
amplified filed for recently but Apple
Insider uncovered this and it just shows
you what they're thinking and that
always is kind of like a peak in the
they may or may not do it but again it's
just what Apple is thinking and they're
going to if they do remove the touch ID
they're going to have to come up with
new biometric sensors or new ways to get
us that responsiveness to confirm our
purchases to couldn't you know to unlock
our phones and and lock our phones down
as well and let's be honest keep our
information private from everybody and I
mean everybody every entity out there
also Apple addressing the iPhone 6's
shutdown issues I don't know how many of
you have had this I've heard it over and
over a billion times it happened to my
phone specifically when I would be like
driving where around 30 percent your
battery completely completely just shuts
down
well according to Apple they have they
feel that they have eliminated a
majority of the iPhone 6s issues in iOS
10 point two point one this is the thing
where probably for the past year
everyone was talking about it but no one
was addressing it example told you
TechCrunch that after letting the fixed
Cimarron customer devices the statistics
show that has improved the issue citing
an 80% reduction on iPhone 6s and 70%
reduction on iPhone 6 devices for
experiencing random shutdowns maybe an
actual reason to update your older phone
but there you go that that is according
to Apple here's the official full
statement they made of Apple made
improvements to reduce occurrences of
unexpected shutdowns that a smaller
number of users were experiencing with
their iPhones iOS 10 point two point one
already has over 50 percent of active
iOS devices upgraded and the diagnostic
data we've received from upgraders shows
that for this small percentage
percentage of users experiencing the
issue we're seeing a more than eighty
percent reduction in iPhone success and
over 70 percent reduction on iPhone six
of devices unexpectedly shutting down so
there you go that's the statement from
Apple maybe you guys can chime in to me
just
tweet me at Bryant on or just let me
know if if indeed you have felt that
this is this has been resolved um in
other news the iPad we know that Apple
typically does a march kind of early
spring announcement also all all signs
point to they still but the latest
report here from digit time says that
the ten point five inch this is kind of
that new iPad that we're expecting to
see with thin thinner bezels on the side
a larger screen but it are starting a
ten point five inch screen kind of the
the middle tier screen the report is
that the ten point five inch and the
twelve point nine inch iPads that are
expected to debut at a March event
aren't expected to ship until May or
June
according to supply chain sources that
would leave an entry level nine point
seven inch iPad as the only one to ship
within close proximity of the March
event so we know we right now we have an
iPad pro nine point seven inch and an
iPad pro twelve point nine inch which is
my favorite iPad of all time it yes is
not the most featured most feature
packed tablet compared to what is out
there and I will always admit that the
surface pro better surface pro 4 does so
many more things but look I'm an iPad
guy from a standpoint of I love I'm in
the ecosystem but I just love reading
comics and watching movies on the go
that's that's what I do during my free
time on my commute so um I'm always been
the biggest I've had the biggest boner
for the iPad twelve point nine inch but
digit times reports that based on the
supply chain that right now twelve point
nine inch iPad shipments have been
really just drying up around the world
in many retail checks shipping estimates
of two to three weeks in the US Canada
Australia France Germany Japan so even
though we will get some type of
announcement if they still stick to the
March event we may not see the new iPads
until later in the spring more like mid
2017 according to this reports and kind
of a just fun little follow-up story
before we wrap up we know the iPod
it's all the controversy of the iPads
I'm sorry I bear pods lookit I can't
talk sometimes my brain is filled with
so much stuff I can't talk the air pods
we know about the air pods right I'm not
wearing iPods
I'm not wearing air pods as we speak I
can't even do this right now color wear
is now selling air pods in 58 colors if
you've heard of color where they're the
ones that put this you can buy directly
from them they will coat your actual
products make them look fancy smancy
nice and polished it's not a sticker
this is literally a coating on them if
you want air pods in 58 colors you can
pay two hundred eighty nine dollars on
ear pods through color wear but you
could get black you could get purple you
could get red you get turquoise you get
any color you want you just got to drop
the cash for 289 so I'm just saying
there's options out there and Apple they
need to get on they they need to get on
first of all air pods are still pretty
much not in stock anywhere it's like you
go there sometimes they get a few
shipments but for the most part if
you're trying to buy one online
it's what about five this has been about
four or five months and you still can't
just walk in the store and get our air
pods off the shelf I didn't gonna cut it
Apple like this is this was your best
product for 2016 and it's it's hard to
get not because everyone wants them I
think a lot of people want them but you
didn't make enough like you just didn't
make enough so we will see again air
pods
very good very good very good not I'm
not gonna say they are like gotta have
but they're really good and if you're an
apple over here in the custom you're
gonna love them
but I I like to use different headphones
for different things and I want once
they get that full functionality I'll be
all on board once they get full
functionality air pods you hear me Apple
I will be all on board for them so we
will wait for that alright ladies and
gentleman boys and girls that's gonna
wrap it up for this week's Apple byte
extra crunchy again call us
one six two six or eight that's the
place to call leave your name where
you're from your comments we will get
back into the flow me and Beach beach
and Tong will be back so until then be
safe have a great time have a great week
and we'll see you guys next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
