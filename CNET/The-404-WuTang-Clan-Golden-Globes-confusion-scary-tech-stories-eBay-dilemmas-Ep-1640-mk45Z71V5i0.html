what's going on everybody thank you so
much for tuning in to our fine podcast
program for your delicate ear holes on
this Friday December 11th 2015 thank you
so much from the bottom of our
collective hearts myself being Jeff
Bakalar and you Russ fresh - hello look
on behalf of everyone listening to the
show we're all gonna want you to
introduce yourself better you haven't no
you always have a very uh you have like
a goofy ghost voice yeah like a goofy
villain from scooby-doo yeah we're like
oh it's not mr. Williams why is it the
owner of the old amusement park oh my
god he just carries a bunch of chains
around with him yeah that's just how he
rolls how you doing man I'm lovely I'm
good you're lovely you're good I'm good
also now to myself because you know Russ
there's a lot of awfulness in the world
these days there is both home and abroad
yeah and you know I won't lie I found
myself in a funk bit of a funk okay you
know when you have a kid you and I don't
want to sound like a damn cliche but you
know you look at this kid and he's just
like represents innocence in the future
and maybe not to me when I see him I
just see something some living thing
that doesn't understand how awful this
place can be yeah and it's not their
fault they don't know any better that's
true so you know every now and then I
get a little bummed out okay doesn't
happen too often very sad but then I
came across a YouTube video mhm and this
you looking into your children's a
child's eyes was not enough to pull you
out of this funk a YouTube video hello
it was 8:45 at night okay he had been
sleeping understand for me to go and
look into his eyes hold his eyes open
now I don't weird would have been mean
yeah would've woken up would have cause
both of us a great deal of grief indeed
so it's 8:45 at night and I stumble
across a YouTube video that turned it
all around for me
and I know this isn't gonna do anything
for people who are listening at home
this is not an like you can't hear this
and get the same experience we're gonna
have to explain what's happening in this
music video a music video for when the
going gets tough the tough get going by
Billy ocean okay this is not this is a
very popular song from 1989 okay
it doesn't spring to mind as a song I no
interest in hearing you'll know you'll
know the chorus I'm just gonna start it
if you want to get right down to it I'll
put this link in the show notes just
fast forward on YouTube to about 50
seconds into the video when they reveal
who the backup dancers in this video are
okay again little context it's 1989
think of the celebrities from that era
I'm guessing Chicago Bears well look
that would be my guess but think about
what this video would have to do to
bring me up out of the Gulf gesture they
go very far away dude the Bears wouldn't
do that for me so we're gonna play a
little of this video and I want Rus to
kind of like give out his organic
reaction because I know what's coming
okay
all right let's let's let's join this
video in progress okay
so there's a nice backing horn section
Joey's croonin and an awesome oversized
overcoat
there's the backup dancers just the peak
of them bottom left oh ok they're
wearing all white
it seems this three of them oh my god
so there's Michael Douglas and
what's-her-name from Cheers I believe
and Danny DeVito no it's that Kirstie I
know who is it on the Left that's
Kathleen Turner a clean Turner Danny
DeVito and Michael Douglas as backup
dancers from in full white suits full
white tuxedo you could give me 1000
guesses I know never ever would have
gotten that there is something about a
lego and they have choreography and
they're all timed up I mean
realistically they probably only need to
learn one step at a time because they're
really cutting away from them a lot but
it's amazing so this is like how have I
never seen this before is the mother
French so this is what's amazing is like
the three of them are perfectly
choreographed like you said the song is
great if you recall this song so I'm so
good at to Katoon they're so
enthusiastic about it like they could
not be happier to be there Danny DeVito
makes the most sense out of all these
people in terms of like people in
attendance like I get Danny DeVito being
there this so this is like Romancing the
Stone Roses got it got it got it now I
don't know like so 89 probably was I
guess War of the Roses right yeah I've
never seen that movie but that's not a
light movie right that's a but it's like
a dark comedy okay it is it's like a big
cult it's described as like a black huh
and was Danny DeVito in that as well
yeah any drunk directed yeah
this is saying he co-directed it so this
now what are we seeing so Danny DeVito
his plant fake playing the saxophone
riff Billy Idol as Billy Idol no Billy
ocean Billy ocean it's hard it's
gesturing with his his hips towards the
saxophone is as tall as Danny Jo oh yeah
it might not have been an oversized sax
it might have been a normal-sized sax
and Danny DeVito just makes everything
look giant it's amazing do you see where
I'm coming from
yeah it's spectacular watching this
video just makes me happy it's really
yeah it's great I'm real I am happy as
well and like could we just like as like
a propaganda tool just like drop these
videos on Syria and just maybe that
would like end the conflict right there
this video then there's no hope yeah it
is such a feel even Douglas is like
bringing his a game like looking right
into the camera with like full gusto
there's something about it I can't
encourage you people enough to go and
watch this video it is such a good
feeling awesome time I'll bet they had a
percentage on the on the back end with
the sales of those maybe but like and is
it in the mood isn't in the soundtrack I
don't know I don't even think it is cuz
that would make a little more sense I
would but they three of them they were
you know they've been in these movies
together and this was 89 so it had to be
War of the Roses yeah and they're I feel
like they were just like hey we're all
buddies now day we love Billy ocean yeah
let's just like show up in his video
really bizarre cuz I'm not like a moving
experience it really was delightful it
just made me so happy so there's my
feel-good YouTube video of maybe not the
month maybe the year maybe of 2015 yeah
I've not I can't think of a single
YouTube video that felt made me feel
that good
well that like did that to you Yeah
right
yes it's super special I fo I'm glad and
thank you for letting me share it with
you thank you for sharing it alright um
we got a few things I want to get into
you today not
whole lot of stuff going on that's
pretty quiet in the tech world pretty
quiet in the tech world but there's
still plenty of things that we can talk
about yeah oh man did I have a thing
happened last night what happened this
is the same moment that you watch this
YouTube video yeah okay yeah the YouTube
views a couple days ago got it uh but I
had am like have you ever had something
really weird happened to you in the
middle of the night that when it happens
in the middle of the night yeah there's
like no lot like cohesive lucid logic to
explain it it it's only till the next
morning were like if you even go back to
sleeve sure you could then assess it
with a clear mind yeah actually yeah
recently my shower curtain rod fell in
the middle of the night see that's weird
it just fell yeah
well it's like a suspension rod it's I
guess I don't know what that it's
pressing against the wall yeah so that's
a suspension rod we're locked down with
the shower rod lingo I apologize
obviously we're you know the things
could just happen yeah I had a weird
ball okay and this is more along the
lines of tech it is a long line okay and
I need to I I think after this story it
will perhaps awaken a story from your
past that you can then retell sure um I
it's 5:00 a.m. and I'm woken up to very
loud talking of like like podcasts
sounding talking got it not unlike what
everyone is listening to right now whoa
heavy and it was it was a conversation
it was like a very sort of passionate
conversation but you only heard the bass
you weren't able to like make out the
conversation no I could tell it was
people talking I just couldn't you know
I'm like woken up so I jump out of bed
the dog knows something's going on to
you so he jumps out of the bed and he
darts in the living space is still
sleeping she's she's - she's out she's
that so I get up I'm like what the what
is going on right now yeah I'm like kind
of losing it sure
so I go in the living room and I look
around and like it's still pitch-black
out okay so I can't see a lot of stuff
it's
just before the sons getting ready to
write oh you like closing in on like the
source I'm right there okay and it's the
coffee table why is the coffee table
speaking like that I gotta imagine an
iPad maybe but but okay so so am i my
living room at night is like a
planetarium there's all these little
lights everywhere sure I got so much
electronic everywhere though yeah
things are constantly glowing and
buzzing and whatnot so I figure it out
it's my laptop okay somehow my laptop
while closed yeah awoken and started
playing started playing audio isn't that
freaking crazy ants really bizarre and
terrifying to the point where like I
open up the laptop and just like hard
shut it down like let me kill this
animal before it can hurt it wasn't
there a Stephen King story I think was
called Maximum Overdrive or all the
machines came alive and killed people
yeah that sounds about right
and that's basically step one as well at
5:00 and ringing you up early at 5:00 in
the morning you you you sort of display
this sense of vulnerability where you're
like I just need to go back to bay that
logic is not prevailing at that moment I
have to I have to get rid of whatever
this is and sleep yeah that was scary
if really freaked me out think about how
bizarre that is even fathom how that
could happen how could that have
happened
it could be an alarm on the computer it
was a Windows machine
I don't yeah so you don't know what the
hell happened I mean my desktop at home
turns on like I put in sleep mode will
not ever stay ever very consistently it
will wake up I mean it goes to sleep and
then like a half hour later or three
hours later or something like that it'll
wake up there's things you can do to
like sort of uh yeah I have a figured I
just turned it off yeah you should
probably should um but that's weird it's
really these are if you ever had
something similar to that like you know
yeah I mean there's like the moments
actually I got a what is it
a what's the clapper stop it I so so
this is like ten years ago
you mean 35 years
ten years ago and in the apartment I was
in at the time the bed was very far away
from the light switch so I'd be like
reading in bed and then I want to turn
off the light and I'd have to get up you
ever hear of a desk lamp there wasn't
only a place to put it that slam oh
you're gonna say I'm in bed what are we
gonna be like oh there wasn't any
nightstand lamps when I was 10 years ago
no I don't appreciate the impression
either so I like figured oh I'll get a
clapper but I don't want to like clap so
I got a room there's like a remote
version of the clapper where you have
like a remote yeah plugs into an outlet
and that's the outlet that controls the
light so it effectively servants the
outlet the remote just basically like
turns the outlet yeah yeah and it was
ten bucks so it's like great apparently
for 10 bucks what you get is a really
shitty outlet controller because
frequently at 4:30 in the morning all
the lights in the room would turn on
like super bright and it was very
startling that's the worst
it's terrible so I had to like basically
toss it it was a waste but but so that's
the extent of your tech yeah I'm hamster
crawl on me once while I was sleeping
that was but that's not really tech
really no but that's there was a case
failure involved a hamster case failed
and he figured it out and he it cracked
that code he was in one of those to be
situations he just had like a mini
hamster stethoscope up to the block and
figured out the right combination and I
guess his predilection was to run across
the room and just jump on me in the bed
whether he was trying to like make a
move or whether it was trying to take me
out it's hard to say but I mean it could
have ended really bad for him I could
have just rolled over and crushed him
like that not a big guy but she would be
enough yeah so yeah he broke out and
then several weeks later he broke out
again and and jumped to his death
so drank oh my god super dragon that's
what he was going for the hole might
have been so I have a weird thing with
lights to my might live my bedroom fan
is um bedroom light is a fan light
domination and I guess some it's got a
remote sure and I guess someone in the
building or someone a bow above or below
hat
have the same thing my same model and
this thing would turn on in the middle
of the night so I'm full fan content
brightness and you know what what yeah
so and it's like yeah it's not what do
you do you don't there's nothing you can
just take the light out ya know you turn
so like this the switch on the wall turn
it all off got it excuse me at night
yeah it's just stupid I think that's
just like one of the perils of community
living it is actually I moved since I
moved into my I used to live in an
apartment that was like 25 stories and
like very full of people and now the
place I'm in now is eight floors and
like maybe 10 or 12 units in total and
way fewer those problems like connecting
two consoles with like game controllers
or Wi-Fi connection has been much
stronger because there's way less like
in turn yeah it's nice it's very nice
you stuff like weird things happen to me
when I was a kid and I got like a phone
line installed yeah in my room was that
exciting yeah it was that's did you have
that experience Greg didn't have an
individual phone line now so I got a
phone line and that was like a big deal
understand when oh I guess cuz you're
what to one year or two years older than
me yeah yeah like three by the time they
were there's there's not enough
difference we're like no there is enough
of the difference because by the time I
would have maybe possibly gotten on my
own phone line
it was cell phone moment no because I'm
there no because I'm talking like a
third down like 13 oh that's very young
are you talking to just friends yeah
about the the ongoing are you on a chat
line events hearty chat line yeah like a
pillow talk so I would have this thing
where like I would be terrified of the
phone ringing while I was asleep because
I had I had a bad thing happen once I
had a thing where like 3:00 a.m. yeah
cool night yeah bones rings yeah and I
used to keep that phone right next to my
face sir phone rings yeah and I my
instinct is to pick it up sure so it's
so it's 3:00 a.m. yeah
1992 yeah 1994 let's say 3:00 a.m.
Jeff's sleeping yeah oh my God my phone
ringing it's so I'm just a kid
hello something screaming in my ear oh
my god that's like an x-files episode
but it was the dude it was just like
some maniac right here it's a maniac
like that yeah and I'm like like a
chihuahua you guys shaking in fear yeah
that's intense so from then on out yeah
pull that thank you everything you're
going to bet oh yeah yeah oh yeah off
the hook
Wow do you have is that the case now
with your cell phone uh mmm a little bit
like I might do not disturb on I don't
keep my phone in the same room as me
really interesting that's more of like
you shouldn't have your phone now pretty
close to you at all times just
especially when you sleep like just not
just don't do that I mean it's pretty
close I'm blind what do you think is
gonna happen I don't know like it's just
like there's a lot of information being
sent back and forth you don't need to
like be exposed to that 24 hours a day
the information are you talking I
thought you meant like radio waves
coming out of it there are waves coming
out of the phone as well it can't hurt
you know not being right next to my
shirt so there's that yeah I'd and I
have like a fear of just like getting a
weird call which probably at my age is
you know something I should just like
yeah need to be available for at this
point yeah I mean well first of all you
can obviously look at the phone number
yeah but I don't think there's a I feel
like crank calling is over seeing its
moment no there's so many other ways to
destroy someone's life we talked about
this the other day I once got a call
from a number like they have spoof errs
now that like Hank you think you're
getting a local call yeah it sucks
really yeah one of my idiot friends is
doing and it was a spam call ya know is
one of my idiot friends pranking me into
thinking it was someone else's yeah like
by Stacy's number no no like my like a
very similar number to mine
like a normal number god I gotta go
stupid I want to hear your scary text
stories yeah kids please eight six six
four oh four seen it don't scream oh
that would be really if you're just
gonna ruin me yeah
86 for for CNN or the 404 at cnet.com
we're gonna take a break when we come
back I got more crap happening
I gotta talk about some more stuff Plus
just when you thought comic book
villains were not a real thing one
arises from the ashes and starts messing
with what we hold sacred more for or for
right after this today's episode of the
404 show is brought to you by our old
buddies at Raintree Russ you're an
entrepreneur that I respect a very great
deal I am I put myself out and I know
you for a fact use Braintree in all of
your mobile payment solution app
applications they have all of the
currency covered all of the currency
covered that should be their new slogan
I want to be paid in leather coins I
don't think they support that but pretty
much real money pays a portion of that
and that's their slogan pretty much real
money but all kidding aside Braintree
lets you accept every way to pay
essentially on the internet from PayPal
to Apple pay and every little
microcurrent transaction currency
platform in between all it takes is one
line of code one simple integration
doesn't matter what currency your
customers use because Braintree will
figure out a way to let you accept over
130 of those payments to learn more
about how your company can grow with
Braintree do yourself a favor and visit
Braintree payments comm /c net all right
welcome back to the show so we do have a
lot of stories yeah we do but I wanna I
want to first give you this dilemma that
I am having a very emotionally fraught
week no I just like enjoy little like
okay
enjoy little stories that happen to be I
enjoy guiding you through these stories
right and I enjoy talking about this is
therapeutic for me that's good can you
be my my can be a very can you be my my
lounging couch here out a second so I
know holidays are coming around I bought
some Cologne on eBay okay are you
familiar with this cologne in the pant
like you knew this cologne before I knew
it I knew a variation on it would never
in my life occur to me to buy corn on
eBay well so I so okay so I get a Wired
subscription okay and as far as I can
tell the only cool thing about printed
magazines these days are like cologne
samples like to be like everything else
can be emulated with a digital sure with
a digital iPad but you might not be the
right word it's not cool but unique
let's say unique and one of these things
that in five years we will tell stories
of cologne samples to our children
weirdly anachronistic things all right
sorry okay so give me that okay and like
there are occasionally really creative
advertisements that would only work with
actual yes tactile paper yeah so I don't
know every now and then I smell the
Cologne okay sample cuz that's what I do
and I like Cologne I I'm like a cologne
thing I like I have a cologne thing you
have like your brand I have a couple
that I've got a few bansuri I bounced
around you gotta is there like an
evening one is there like a Coulomb no
can you go hard tonight I don't think
there's the evening one no like when you
think of me do you think of a smell no
okay that's good you wear cologne when
you go to work yeah really yeah just for
the pleasant like just so you can walk
the halls and everyone can appreciate
your Musk yeah I guess when you lay it
out like that it's pretty silly yeah I
just enjoy like smelling the stasi of a
preference of your cologne uh no she
used to love this one Bert no my woman
likes me and Bruce no I don't know what
I think is John Paul
whatever their starter yeah she used to
love that anyway so I used to really
like aqua to Geo okay it's Giorgio
Armani here right it's like very most in
like a phallic-shaped bottle just a huge
penis awesome
so so regardless long story
I'm buying cologne I'm buying this new
Cologne on ebay because you saw it
cologne is and cologne is very expensive
yeah you know like you like higher-end
cologne is too much money for smelly
water like if I was if I spend $100 how
long would that last me oh that could
last you like a year okay that's I think
Oh reasonable now it's but Georgia
Romani : super expensive okay so I knew
I was like I am not paying full price
for this stuff just don't want to do
that totally let me look on eBay okay
so I find an eBay seller yeah super high
rated right 99.9% feedback score I'm
like oh this guy's legit sure I buy this
cologne from them yeah four days later I
get the delivery yeah and it is not an
authentic bottle of cologne did you know
when you open the box I knew right away
right away like even before you smelled
it Oh way before okay so I so I open
this really shady box okay
and even the box the Cologne comes in
yeah looked counterfeit okay it just did
not play the part no pun intended it
didn't pass the sniff test I'm like
looking at this thing and I'm just like
what is wrong with this box it just
looked like it was printed by somebody
in the shore house yeah like really
wired low quality Chinese DVDs super low
quality and I'm just like oh man did I
just get winked there just get
bamboozled sure so it says the name
brand and in face of a dozen it says
like Jojo Armani and then it says like
aqua it's an aqua to geo twice I think
this is clearly not real upon further
inspection now grant you this is before
he even took the bottle out yeah upon
further inspection I looked at the top
of the box which normally has like an
embossed short logo yeah that
the frame of what someone must have used
the stamp of artificial logo yeah like I
saw the outline of the stamp and I'm
just like oh my god this guy wasn't even
trying
no not even giving an effort I open it
up the bottle looks pretty legit okay
but it smelled awful oh really why it's
not even close like not even close
because I've then gotten the real stuff
the real stuff really happens to smell
nice okay and I just was like what where
did this come from like what is the deal
sure
so I initiate a refund yes I'm online
i'ma go hey I write this guy a mostly
polite letter yeah and I said hi I just
received my product I'm 99% sure similar
to your feedbacks that this is
counterfeit Cologne sure he writes back
and he's like you know no no way this is
real I'm like nah no I said you're wrong
yeah I go to the store in town yeah and
I find the real bottle here and I show
this guy his bottle next to the real
bottle PayPal refund right oh yeah I'm
sure okay but then I get a phone call
yeah I see his number and I'm like who
is that like sure I pick it up this is
Jeff uh who's this this is your eBay
seller like how did you get this number
like the future is now and it means you
don't have to talk to anyone like me
talking to my eBay seller is a situation
I do not want to be confronted with let
alone a seller that I'm I'm having a bit
of conflict with yeah it's really even
think of where he would have gotten your
phone number so that occurred to me
during the call sure when you do a
PayPal transaction they get your no I
guess like that is just part of yeah
your dress is never occurred to me that
anyone would ever use it right sure
so I felt immediately vulnerable to be
like oh man this guy's calling me yeah
it was a Midwest number so like I wasn't
like he was around the block like it was
still a little upsetting I'm picturing
like a Jack Lemmon
in Wabasha know in going Gary Gerdt Glen
Ross were like oh geez man you gotta do
me a favor and that's kind of the way
the conversation went he goes he goes
like this he goes so yeah oh you know
man
I'm so sorry this happened to you man
you know we hired someone brand new and
and he's just dropping the ball left and
right well that's with my head I'm like
um okay so at that moment he's like I'm
gonna I'm gonna refund your money right
away I'm like yeah well and then at that
moment the email came in where I got the
refund so once I knew the refund was
secure then I was like oh dude you sent
me fake Cologne
yeah what's like what's going on sure oh
my god he's brand new II didn't know I'm
like how does that explain the fake
cologne like your new guy is you are you
implying that your new guy like took it
upon himself to start brewing his own
Cologne in the bathtub getting bottling
that shop really poorly and
unconvincingly and then shipping it out
to thousands of eBay customers how's
that work going good profit margin
margin in that yeah probably 99% you got
to imagine okay so the fact that they
have such a high rating you gotta
imagine that they were selling legit
cologne for a very long time definitely
so that plays into the conversation as
well okay Oh continue right so I'm like
man I don't get it you're so highly
radian searched his all of his feedback
yeah and he only had two people claiming
they got fakes in like oh seven crazy
what the hell is that about
and I don't forget it so maybe he's
telling the truth we're like he hired
someone new who like so maybe this guy
the guy he hired that's new has I could
tried a different line of like getting
his product yeah yeah and the product
he's getting is like counterfeit like I
don't know what happened yes we got
imagine he's not the one doing the bar
if the guy you're talking to it I hope
to know if he probably has like a guy
that he goes to and the guy was trying
to pull a fast one so the whole time oh
I'm so sorry Jeff you know it's a
holiday season I just want you to have
the best holiday possible the whole time
I'm thinking oh this guy just doesn't
want a negative feed exactly that's all
this is yeah that's all this is all
right my question to you Russ yeah do I
give 110%
totally I have to yeah I absolutely have
to you know why there's a few reasons
one I would say he fought you on the
fact that it was counterfeit like he
didn't immediately be like oh yeah sorry
we'll get you a refund
he he he played that card for a second
and then realized he wasn't talking to a
dummy well right exactly so that's an
instant indication that like he would
take advantage of someone that was not
willing to go the extra mile and prove
oh this is counterfeit right so I don't
like this guy be he's Paul I don't like
him he's pulling the holiday I want you
to have a good holiday line which really
bugs me like no you don't give a
about my holiday you just want a good
eBay rating so but there is a creepiness
factor here where he failed me yeah and
mine he has your address and he has my
dress he has my number here and now I'm
gonna leave him this awful I'm not gonna
leave is it it doesn't say it was you
well I guess he doesn't put too much
yeah but he doesn't know like who gives
some ratings and stuff yeah what do you
mean of course yeah okay I mean yeah
uh-huh say it's not as easy is that an
ethical dilemma because the ethical
answer is Raven right oh you know cuz
you want to detract the possibility
that's happening to someone else again
right if it makes you feel unsafe which
I don't in the end like what's he gonna
do come to your house and if you up for
whatever the amount was I'm not worried
about that okay so whatever write them
down but you understand like the the
place the things in place here are like
not the they're just strange I would
when I rated him I would be like 100
percent SuperDuper honest yeah and just
like give like whenever when I say it
like weird a or Airbnb scenarios I'm
always like very blunt about all of the
different things that happen there and
then people can judge for themselves so
maybe this is a neutral situation where
I say was not was not convinced sellers
product was authentic
but supplied an immediate refund neutral
yeah I think there's probably fine
although I will I would not do I think
I'm gonna go negative go negative
this guy's about
get it get it he's getting it bad how
many stars are gonna give him half-assed
arms a sliver
look the tiniest slice of a star he's
only getting one point out of that stuff
that's that's scummy though I don't
wanna deal with that now I do a thing I
just use Amazon for that stuff no this
is the price price can be beat pricey so
what was all this excuses I don't even
get to that yeah okay so his price was
like $45 yeah on a bottle that should
have been like 90
oh yeah that's crazy but but the real
one I wound up getting yeah it was like
50 tears okay
which is like only 7 bucks moles that
from another seller yeah yeah it was
authentic interesting a little tip -
yeah for anyone listening as a cologne
fanatic mmm buy testers what does that
mean cologne testers what does that even
mean so you know when you go to like me
a cologne tester yeah they say tester on
it right what's the same thing they sell
those discounted oh they're sold as
testers because I thought it was just
the store that stuck that's thicker no
no interest oldest testers okay there
you go a little bit of cologne advice
for no friends at the 404 show even some
money this week pop culture in the
forefront today the x-men apocalypse
trailers out we're not gonna really talk
about that just go watch it it's I
thought was a better trailer than Batman
oh yeah yeah I mean that goes was Russ
just doesn't like the way apocalypse I
think apocalypse looks like a Mighty
Morphin Power Rangers villain yeah IVA
needs to be particularly is Bryan Singer
yeah
did you like Days of Future past ah
throws okay okay I kind of fell asleep I
was pretty tired when I watched it but I
agree well yeah it's like fine I like
the first one more although I kind of
hated the second half of the first one
when like the whole story kind of fell
apart I think two is the best x-men -
yeah x-men stop opening with Niekro oh
it's amazing where he's breaking into
the White House fantastic it's really
good anyway we bring up pop culture
because the Golden Globe nominees were
announced and
everything anyone get excited about the
Conchords I think so I think the Golden
Globes are like more of the party no I'm
not talking about the people that like
go I'm talking about like people at home
like oh I can't go out tonight the
Golden Globes are on like really not
right absolutely
the only reason I care is because Ricky
Gervais has been like essentially
ripping people to shreds right during
every shift just uses it as like a
roasting plant and that and and he says
stand up is very good yeah
so that's entertaining but like as in a
word show it's kind of a joke it is yeah
so but what do you got going on here
well I bring it up because every year
the nominees come out I look at the list
and you know the Hollywood Foreign Press
they nominate weird stuff like the
innominate movies that clearly should
not be nominated yeah like Best Motion
Picture comedy the movie spy should not
be up there people kind of like that
movie I saw it no no I
I liked Mo's McCarthy yeah I do yes
movies not that funny
maybe it's not for me I don't yeah but I
love bridesmaids sure and that seemed
director yeah same thing and there's God
you know yeah of course bullfight yeah
big thang big beak ballad it did just
occur to me by the way that the reason
it's the Golden Globes is because it's
the Foreign Press because it's like an
international thing yeah no I
didn't I never put that together so
anyway the reason I even bring any of
this up yeah people think all you don't
like spy which I did the spy had its
moments it's just I don't think was that
fun I would say of these it's obviously
the weekend well I don't know what the
big short is but make sure there's like
this caper isn't this caper movie that's
out I don't know peep there's a lot of
bunch of joy which is a Rosa David
O'Russell movie right which is obviously
like very highfalutin train wreck
obviously I enjoyed training like that a
little bit so boy wait here's my thing
we're talking about the category of
comedy yeah well it's actually the
category of musical or comedy but fine
yeah and then the marsh the Martian yeah
this is a weird howling
but this is my point exactly where it's
like oh no you guys don't have a
category you're missing a category that
you have drama
you have musical and comedy but you
don't have like whatever the hell the
Martian was what category would that be
the action thriller
I think it's action thriller but that's
like just add another category no yes I
I think it's we know you're wrong here
ama drama yes okay drama d and music I
think it you're a thriller is a drama in
the like okay so rather than why
revenant is nominated for drama right
and it also be after and so is met Mad
Max fury road is not a drama you call
that movie a drama I know I I mean sure
fine it fits max Mad Max fits and drama
both and the Martian fits in common the
second you start introducing these crazy
genres it gets really messy because
where do you see like do you have a
separate musical category no do you have
a do they have a animated category like
the Oscars do they do but the Oscars
doesn't break out comedy so that's an
another interesting they should they I
think so Tim I think it is very very
very rarely win best picture of the year
I mean you could say like Birdman was a
comedy yeah I'm over like babe oh wait
that didn't win but it was nominated
babe babe the pig movie the talking pig
was nominated for an Oscar picture what
yeah are you directed oh no he didn't
direct it but I think he worked on at
the director of Mad Max fury road worked
on that movie he definitely directed the
second babe George Miller George Miller
directed babe to picking us I know that
are you searching this like I don't know
what I'm talking about with babe being
nominated for Best Picture it was
nominated not pig in the city pig in the
city was not now enter for Best Picture
so what is just baby you never seen it's
terrific I know what it is it's Cromwell
you're telling me this pig talking he
talked yeah he's a talking pig a talking
pig the voice of Chucky from Rugrats a
talking pig movie was nominated for an
Oscar yeah I don't I don't believe it
it was nominated for Best Picture
director adapted screenplay like it had
a lot of nominations was this like a
joke like what happens really good movie
but what I'm saying is it's very rare
that those lighter movies win Oscars
it's usually the biopic or like a really
intense whatever drama
well Birdman won last year well that's a
I mean yeah I wouldn't yeah it's like a
dark comedy drama situation this is a
long way to say the problem with the
genres is that it gets very messy and
categorizing stuff is very messy and
that's really why the Martian is there
because the studio that put out the
Martian was like okay we're gonna have a
really tough competition in the drama
category with revenant and a bunch of
other stuff let's make it easy on
ourselves and go into the Comedy
category now the question is who in the
foreign press is making the call to say
this isn't comedy you're crazy like no
way the Ray Charles biopic deserves a
Comedy category if that's the thing or
musical I guess it would be yeah but
that's the thing I think you can get
away with putting comedy and musicals in
the same thing because there are so few
yeah and they can they kind of they're
cut a little bit from the same cloth
okay
lighter generally yeah yeah like lame is
I'm okay with putting in comedy in the
music okay fair enough so you have
comment feel fair to put lame is and
like trainwreck in the same category
though that's really bizarre and it also
doesn't feel fair to have Selma go up
against Birdman for a picture of the
year if it's me I would separate it out
and then get rid of like the just what
is it like Best Supporting Guest Actor
in a TV drama like get that out of there
yeah just you know have the awards
beforehand with the like dus celebrity
hosting and through that or then and
just like have top-tier Awards I hate I
hate award shows I've very horses for so
do I for me it's all about the results
yeah I'm so in the morning I find out
the results it is but I really do it's
bizarre more the Martian being it labels
economy is weird although there are a
lot of pretty funny jokes in that movie
right like science jokes yeah I mean
jokes are jokes yeah kind of jokes ish
they're mostly science jokes but he like
says the F word Allah
you know yeah there's I mean I don't
really want to get these potatoes
he makes potatoes oh yeah you still
haven't seen hasn't seen it on the moon
on the pump on the Martian right yeah
yeah so anyway go look through the list
and see if you tell me it's only one
episode deep into the second season but
I already declared today oh it's it's a
triumph a success I love it I love
everything about that show yeah so there
you have it confusing as anything that's
the story with the Martian and very way
the Hollywood Foreign Press categorizes
films nominated for prestigious awards
when we come back we're gonna talk about
a man who is not worthy of anything good
in this world he is a comic book villain
personified so many teases we're gonna
tell you about the human piece of
garbage right after this stick around
for for show today is also sponsored by
canary a complete home security system
and a single device I've been using
canary the eye in the sky and I'm
getting a very uncomfortable peek into
the monotony that is my dog's life I
assume there's not a lot of moving
involved he just sits there yeah and I'm
like is this working oh it's working
he just doesn't move because Canaries
1080p HD camera pretty much picks up
everything in my living room it's got a
wide-angle lens and it's motion
detection capable night-vision which is
so cool because when I turn on the
lights I like see the infrared go oh
yeah and it's kind of RAD what's really
cool about canary a lot of other motion
detection sort of security systems out
there don't go the extra length
well canary has computer vision and
smart notifications they can actually
send you notifications to your
smartphone if something gnarly is
happening while
emergency response features such as a 90
decibel siren oh my god I wake up the
frickin dead scare off intruders all
that kind of stuff can also alert police
local police and fire departments near
your home so if you're traveling you can
quickly get in touch with the right
people that's that's important that's
great
canary has automatic arming and
disarming modes that know when you are
at your house or when you have left and
you can link up to four canary devices
when when you when you saw the home
system pretty damn great and also look I

emmy ET canary calm and use the promo
code 404 show hey welcome back to the
404 show i mean i don't know why i've
been teasing this story so much it's
just such a strange very bizarre set of
circumstances that I just I don't know I
don't know why I find this shocking but
it's a mate it's an amazing story it is
an amazing story and I just noticed a
part of the story that I really hadn't
noticed before that makes it even more
amazing yeah like things just continue
to get exponentially greater the more
you you you read about the story do you
remember who Martin shkreli is I do this
is the gentleman I believe he was a
former hedge fund manager that took over
a pharmaceutical company and raised the
price of a drug by like fifteen thousand
percent or something close four thousand
percent he raised the price of an HIV
medication from dollars to thousands of
dollars something that was a real
scumbag about it while Mikey was
basically being a real dick about it
in addition right he was a scum I think
okay I'm sorry that the he made the pill
seven hundred
50 dollars when it used to cost
something much less and more reasonable
like and it wasn't like a way it
wasn't like headache medicine yeah it
was it was a more effin aids medicine
yeah so everyone really started to hate
this guy he did a lot of interviews and
he kind of was like I do what I want it
more or less yeah it's like what he said
to the world well if you recall we're
just gonna somehow tie this together in
a very you know out of order strange way
if you recall a while back the wu-tang
clan was talking about how they're going
to make a new record and sell it to one
person yes and there was all this like
mystery surrounding it and that they
were gonna like destroy the original
source material once they were done well
guess who bought the album someone with
a lot of spare change the human piece of
garbage that is walking this earth this
Martin shkreli guy actually bought the
album for around 2 million dollars it's
called once upon a time and Shaolin and
I cannot believe that evil exists as
much as it does in the form of this
person yeah he's a big-time scumbag and
and even the RZA went ahead and said
that they didn't know who the guy was or
what his reputation was when they sold
it to him and made the deal and now that
he does he feels bad but at least the
money that they were given a quote
significant portion of it went to
charities so nice nice of wu-tang and
and his clan but guess there's no guy
named but there they are I mean growing
up I was a little obsessed with wu-tang
yeah anyway story gets a little stranger
and maybe perhaps a little better yeah
because in the contract in the contract
that apparently was signed by both
parties during the purchasing of once
upon a time and Shaolin its I can't even
begin this is gonna sound crazy but this
is actually the legalese used
in the contract this is a clause in the
contract and goes like this
the buying party also agrees that at any
time during the stipulated eighty eight
year period which is like how long the
music is exclusive until the year 21:03
at any point during the during the
stipulated eighty eight year period the
seller may legally plan an attempt to
execute one heist or caper to steal back
once upon a time and Shaolin which if
successful would return all ownership
rights to the seller okay even better
said heist or caper can only be
undertaken by currently active members
of the wu-tang clan and/or actor Bill
Murray with no legal repercussions
everyone got that yes so I guess like
during like Jim Jarmusch's coffee and
cigarettes they conspired at one point
we're like they just had a great
relationship and they hit it off because
it was a RZA and I forget the other
dudes name in this conference in this
scene with you with with Bill Murray I
remember and and that's a stipulation in
this contract so they could plan like an
ocean's 11 style they could to break in
and steal it back and then it becomes
theirs again now I don't know how this
is delivered to the human piece of
garbage oh he doesn't have it yet I
don't know yeah and like I'm curious if
like he can also release it to the world
for free right but knowing this guy's
track history he'll never do that
apparently he's been arranging listening
party with like celebrity right that
seems likely or he would just like sell
don't like as so it is a show where you
could like pay 20 bucks and like sit in
a chair alone isn't this very weird I
have never been more effective well the
weird thing is like let's also back up a
second and be like oh man I want to hear
this album like I want to hear you what
was the last album they put I don't know
yeah a while ago yeah
no it is fascinating I'm sure everyone
is chomping at the bit to listen to it
this book do you understand how to build
up like it's a lot of build up and who
knows like how it exists yeah but the
crazy part is like no man this this this
pharmaceutical executive guy like he's a
real-life supervillain yeah he's like
he's like telling the world like oh no
you know that you know that group that
that hip-hop group that like really
influential in the 90s and to this day
like oh you're never gonna hear their
new stuff because I hold all the power
it does feel and you know that aids
right sorry it does feel like if he
wanted to he could like mic coordinate
some sort of caper with them and film it
online and like just from a PR
standpoint make try to make himself less
of the scum of the earth he could he
could reverse all that yeah sadly he
could I wish that wouldn't do it well
plus the AIDS medicine lowering the
price yeah that would help too but I
think yeah a lot of his rep like he put
cameras all around his house and
released the footage of like the RZA and
Bill Murray breaking into his house to
get the album Mac would do a long go a
long way to like redeeming him see what
the AIDS medicine is a nice that so
here's what I do if on him yeah right so
I think this is maybe on the track that
you were okay
where you said so you were you implying
like he conspires with who tang to like
make this a movie almost sort of like
that's that to me that would be like the
best way and I don't even pay to see
that totally I go pay ten bucks to watch
that I mean yeah I don't know how long
it could be long as you as long as my 10
bucks includes the album yes that's it
yeah that's what he does yeah
for $10 mr. shkreli you I will pay to
watch a very carefully choreographed
thing where Bill Murray and wu-tang
break into your house steal perform the
caper /hi steal back their record and it
like and like you get some director you
get Jim Jeremy sure to direct the the
kite the the the
the heist the caper and you get free
AIDS medicine with the package just like
the first 10,000 purchase
I hope the album gets out in some way
and I hope it gets out in the form of a
heist with don't worry that would be
delightful I'm just saying it's an
option yeah uh finally on the docket Rus
yeah well let you take the wheel for a
little bit yeah so I don't know Jeff are
you are you a bingeing kind of person
and by that I mean entertainment but
yeah I knew you didn't mean like heroin
yeah I was there was a time I the most
recent most recently was the strain last
summer I watched that whole first season
in about four days which they that's the
one with the ad and the worm coming out
of the I first season is really good
second season not not good good great
pilot in the first season yeah I was
Stacy and I became obsessed how to how
to bang it out in one week yeah did that
but then when I see when I binge
takes over my dreams takes over my life
it's not good I also feel like you miss
a lot of detail like it all starts to
bleed together a little bit I mention it
because there's a game that I've been
wanting to play called Borderlands tales
from the borderlands yeah the telltale
game and I've been watching it for a
while and it I think the first episode
it's episodic and the first episode came
out in like June and the last episode
came out of a month or two ago and
they're selling it if you have a
PlayStation Falls account they're
selling it for three seventy three
dollars and seventy five cents for the
whole thing go get it what are you do
yeah which I got yeah I got it but it
makes me feel a little bit bad because I
didn't like pay any reasonable sum for
this well don't worry about that it's
not your fault and B I feel like
especially with the telltale stuff like
I want to support them because I like
what they're doing but it's so brutal to
play those games piece by piece when you
just sort of want to like play through
the whole thing and get the whole story
right there they're pretty long like
you're saying you don't want to go
through the motion no I know I don't
want to play the first episode and then
wait three months for another episode
especially when each of the episodes is
like
two and a half hours long yeah I thought
always thought that was like the
brilliance of the tell-tale stuff where
it's like if you take your time and
don't plow through them yeah by the time
the next episode came out you're like
ready you're kind of like ready to go
yeah I guess so
that that's what happened with me and
the wolf among us I I tend to yeah maybe
I don't know I just lose interest it's
like with the comic books like come
rooks I can't read if they're coming out
once a month I started doing that and
I'm with you on that looks like a drag
like you're over it's over in like ten
minutes it is yeah it's one of those
things it sounds a little longer but
still it's like do you want to it's
intentionally designed to be this
ongoing story and like with crazy
cliffhangers at the end of each episode
but imagining like watching a TV show
and that's at the end of each TV show
it's like three months away from the
next one and there's a cliffhanger like
drag it's a problem you know they do
that in between seasons sure but that's
once it's once you get a whole story and
then once yeah I'd be fine at the at the
end of the borderlands game is a
cliffhanger for next season see that's
the thing we're just we're just trained
we're just conditioned to expect it one
way and that's what it is yeah just used
trained through TV I guess so but they
they match the format of TV so like they
kind of do yeah I guess it's working out
for them like they've been doing this
since Walking Dead totally structurally
it seems there may be no Batman one next
year or excited about the Batman one but
again like the Batman one I know for
sure that I'd much rather play it as a
bulk thing yeah then one at a time
totally I'm with you you know for me and
then I know they just they also did a
game of Thrones y-yeah
it's tough it's tough I don't know how
they're making so many of these well
they're not tremendously expensive to do
but like the writing in the developer
that's something that's that's tough
yeah that that engines showing a little
bit of an age to his right yeah I mean
that's keeps the price down for them and
obviously they have good writing
probably I would say maybe the best
writing in the games industry right now
which isn't saying a lot but it's
certainly up there right yeah I don't
know it just it just makes me feel torn
I understand you're gonna be torn yeah
just like no but I think yeah what's
that just like Natalie Imbruglia well
explain that she wrote a song called
torn Oh God okay well I guess we're just
gonna have to settle and end the show on
that can I mention the producthunt game
oh my god that's right I'm sorry what is
it yeah so there's a game called inky
blah
it's called inky blocks and it's like
Tetris but it's in a circle and it's you
know nice pastel colors and like like a
cool look to it it's on iPhone I'm sorry
it's not Android oh it is it's only on
android iOS as well I don't know
I'm checking but I just like the art
style and they clearly spent on it yeah
it's on oh no sorry it's on only on
Android yes Wow we got one I really like
the art style and it seems cool
it's a colorful reimagining of Tetris
you can check it out and a lot of other
games on producthunt calm slash games go
check it out follow Russ follow me
that's gonna do it for this week on the
404 show real quick before we leave we
were supposed to have Katie linendoll on
