specialized car in the world under 40
grams now heavily revised for 2015 let's
drive this newest formula of the average
Joes rally car and check the tip now
spotting an STI are you kidding
that's the easiest thing an auto dumb
this look at the back where you've got
that wing big enough to drive a BRZ
beyond that is back to being a four-door
sedan only in classic WRX historical
roots I think it's the best-looking most
cohesive one since the original it comes
still partial - they have thinned out
and more rakish Lee extended these eight
pillars and this wide-body design is
much more elegantly done than the
outgoing car it's got a cohesive look as
if it was meant to look this early not a
base in presence that was bumped out to
be that bird and note this led low beam
headlights are standard on this car kind
of a nice touch now the cabin of the new
WRX STI
is very gutsy these carbon fiber trims
and I'm gonna go through a bunch of
drive controls in a minute let's start
with the head unit though which base is
pretty basic stuff I mean that's a dot
matrix display no navigation and your
basic media sources they're all there
but there's nothing that's gonna be i
popping I never look to Subaru to wow me
in the head unit this is no exception
now you can't upgrade this however to a
six inch touchscreen navigation system
that will also include voice command we
don't have that here so I can't comment
on it
you can also bump up to a Harman Kardon
audio system which I would recommend
because the sound system in here is one
of the few I noticed in the cars that I
Drive because it's kind of cardboard
sounding all the time no matter what I
did with the tone controls I couldn't
coax what I thought was a good sound out
of it now luckily you've got this helper
display standard it's small it's far but
it's doing a good job with many things
like media display for example it'll
also take you into your various fuel
economy and advanced trip odometers
you've got some real-time fuel economy
that shows you what the drive trains
doing in terms of steer angle and torque
distribution and you've got a virtual
boost gauge for the turbo that's a nice
complement both stylistically and
functionally
honey which is all analog gauges with a
small LCD helper and that same little
screen also displays your standard rear
camera I'm pleased that it's there I'm
pleased that it's standard but it's
rather far and rather small to be as
effective as I like it
I'm corporate with an STI B without its
famous intercooled flat for a boxer flat
for the Subaru tradition you know it's
in our cold because there's the
intercooler nestled where the functional
front hood scoop will sit right over it
now the dimensions on this guy two and a
half liter flat four again you've got
two cylinders punching this way and two
punching that way it's kind of like part
of a 911 engine put in here the numbers
of 305 horsepower of that configuration
290 foot-pounds of torque
lofty numbers from a pretty compact
engine again thanks to the intercooled
turbo charging which maxes out near 15
psi of boost zero to 60 for a car that
weighs about 3400 pounds happens in the
low fives possibly better let's call it
5.2 to be conservative what did I bring
17 23 mpg not great for a compact car
but this cars done a special mission and
of course these guys are all all-wheel
drive symmetrical all-wheel drive which
is Subarus brand symmetrical all-wheel
drive puts the engine right in the
middle of the drivetrain literally
instead of using a lot of added auxilary
shafts and power take-off gearboxes to
reroute the torque around the car it's
always on designed to be all-wheel drive
from the ground up and another benefit
of this whole architecture is that it
all sits down flat and low great for
center of gravity and goes only through
a six-speed manual gearbox of course
now translating what's in the engine bay
goes through a variety of controls
primarily here in the center console
first of all you got your intelligent
drive controller here push it once to go
into an automatic mode kick it to the
left or counterclockwise you go into a
sport mode or go to the right clockwise
and you what's called sport sharp and
those curves on the display there give
you the main gist of it
it's sharpening up the tip-in and the
ramp up of acceleration under your right
foot it's primarily a throttle control
contour now all that power in the front
gets translated through not one not two
but three differentials in all WRX STI s
front rear and a very complex
electromechanical Center differential
and that's controlled right here by this
center differential control if you put
it in automatic you can make a little
bit of change to an automatic plus
automatic minus plus is going to handle
slushy slippery surfaces better- is
gonna be a little more locked for gutsy
performance or go all the way into
manual and you call the level from most
negotiation of difficult surfaces all
the way to locked from the highest
performance on the tarmac an STI is a
base 4159 torque split but if you work
your center differential right you can
get to just about 50/50 that's kind of
your range of where the power is going
nominal there are also three stability
control profiles normal traction and off
and those are in order of sportiness off
by the way also turns off torque
vectoring so you're handling everything
yourself
I've never driven the cars that I can
recall because the throttle is so
responsive to a little blip when you
need to do a Rev match it is like that
spot on super cool
next thing you hear is that great
exhaust these sti's have a great exhaust
system which is good because i'm not
really a big fan of the sound of a boxer
engine the next thing i noticed is this
car actually feels the best way i can
describe it is it feels square which is
a big compliment it can go any direction
that i wanted to without any sort of
prejudice toward its longitudinal length
most cars kind of want to go the long
way this car will go wherever you put it
it's incredibly agile there's a reason
that SDI's have this legendary following
they're very balanced they're very agile
they have those rally routes and that's
where all that comes from these are not
overpowering cars but they're
exceptionally able to get where you want
to go with precision oh by the way the
steering on this car is in the old
school simple hydraulic assist there
doing nothing tricky with electric
assist on the steering rack whatsoever
and by the power delivery is real nice
they've dialed out a big piece of any
turbo lag in this car the only area high
notice it is down real low if you go to
stab it you gotta wait for things to get
up to 2000 2500 rpm I feel to really get
the sweet spot the clutch transactions
are great the gearbox is a little notchy
but I suspect I mean our cars only got
2,700 miles on it I bet it'll smooth out
of it with where I'm not a huge fan of
the cabin power in an hour out it's a
little bit dated and kind of tacky
looking I think oh it really shines
boys this car feels not so much the way
it looks
now pricing the new STI is a pretty
simple affair you got to buy one car and
add it to one option package and off to
the finance managers desk 35 3 is your
base for this car and again there's no
transmission choice and almost nothing
else to pick from until you get to the
navigation and Harman Carman audio
package for 2500 bucks I think it's a
good value even though I haven't had my
hands on the nav rig because it includes
not only that but 440 watts of Harman
Kardon audio support for aha
music audio book and radio station
streaming keyless access and a very
appropriate push button start as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
