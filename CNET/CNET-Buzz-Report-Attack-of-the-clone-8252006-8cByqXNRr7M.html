like the buzz report Molly got bit by
Hector last week which was actually
pretty hilarious I don't know how it
happened Hector was totally safely
locked up and cozy inside my anyway
looks like she's like in a coma or
something it's probably fine anyway this
week you got me and now it's time for
the gadget of the week what I don't want
to turn over there I'm looking right
here why it's stupid the gadget of the
week is the fisher-price kid tuff fp3
player it's like an mp3 player for
preschoolers oh yeah like preschoolers
need to be more loud and annoying and
now for the news SanDisk has released a
8 gigabyte flash player whatever that is
and now everyone's starting to wonder if
Apple has fallen behind the curve with
it's pathetic 4 gigabyte iPod Nano what
this is so boring who cares about iPods
I got a funny story for you I was at
this party last night it was a toga
party if you must know
anyway the student was totally doing keg
stands and his toga is his button
everything and then his toga totally got
caught on the pump which please stick to
the script right fine the script that's
a genius piece of work seriously she
writes this junk ok ok
computer scientists in Scotland have
developed a program that can write
terrible jokes they call it Molly what
dudes come on seriously
she's got nothing there there's like
some about a fish and a slice of Bologna
we move on I thought so Verizon and Bell
South recently got to stop paying a
federal fee that went toward the
Universal Service Fund the telcos had
lobbied the FCC to change the way it
classifies DSL so that they could stop
paying into
which by the way helps subsidize rural
telephone service and provide Internet
access to schools and libraries
so now Verizon and Bell South could stop
charging you the monthly fees that you
see on your bills but instead they've
decided to keep charging you and just
keep the money what's the problem that's
what I would do they charge you the
exact same amount call it something else
and pocket the cash these guys are smart
Microsoft is added a feature to MSN
Messenger they let you report a
suspected sex offender with just one
click the new tab on MSN Messenger and
Windows Live Messenger lets you click a
link that will file a report with the
police on anyone who seems to be a
potential sexual predator can't see any
potential for abuse their report Mali
report Mali report Mali
report Mali report Mali report
hey so can I get like a name or
something I don't really like it when
you guys call me clone maybe like
lightning or blade woohoo or like flash</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
