Luke Cage season two marvels and newest
Netflix series is out but maybe you
skipped it here are the reasons why you
should check it out if you haven't seen
the season minor spoilers are ahead
let's get to it at number five there's a
lot going on in the season this could
also be a bad thing at time since
there's a lot going on in the season to
the point that maybe the stories told in
season 2 could have been spread out in a
season and a half easily a couple of
episodes seem like they could serve as
season finales all that being said the
smaller stories interconnect well and
serve a greater story coming in at
number four is the music since a lot of
the show takes place the club Harlem's
Paradise there are a lot of musical
performances watching season 2 you'll
see Faith Evans Ghostface Killah K rs1
and others perform there are also some
great blues covers all of the music add
to the overall ambiance of the show
number 3 the supporting characters are
great this kind of goes hand in hand
with number 5 since there's a lot going
on the supporting characters have a lot
to do misty Knight Luke's father James
Mariah and shades are all excellent each
of their arcs are told well with twists
and turns and make for a lot of
intricate stories all of the actors seem
to be comfortable and are having fun
with their roles coming in at number two
are the compelling rivals in season two
you've got both Mariah and Bushmaster as
the two main antagonists for Luke Cage
and to each other in some respects
they're not really your traditional
villains especially bushmaster he's just
trying to undo some wrongs done to his
family there are some great scenes with
bushmaster as he is talking with his
family and he comes across as a
three-dimensional character another
scene has bushmaster talking with Luke
Cage while in a semi truce which adds
another layer to earth and the number
one best thing about the second season
of Luke Cage is changing the status quo
by the end of the season things have
changed substantially we're not gonna
spoil the season so the b-roll we're
going to show next will not match at all
to what I'm saying
characters die other characters get
their comeuppance new alliances are
formed
other characters ascend to take over a
Harlem by the end of season two you will
want to see season
and that's the mark of any great season
of television did you like the second
season of Luke Cage or are you over the
Marvel television universe let us know
