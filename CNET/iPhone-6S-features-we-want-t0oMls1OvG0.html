history of iconic Apple gave the iPhone
a substantial refresh in 2014 which
means this year Apple will probably only
update a few specs or color options to
keep you interested that said it never
hurts to be optimistic I'm Tom Bell and
here are the top five features we could
reasonably expect for the iPhone 6s
starting off at number five optical
image stabilization on all models not
just the plus I will do this camera
feature in last year but only on the big
boy this time around the great seat on
the standard model as well so that's
your low-light photos are razor sharp no
matter how much you've had to drink at
number four wireless charging now that
the Apple watch uses what we can
technically call a wireless charger
maybe there's some hope for the iPhone
as well I would hold my breath on this
and even if Apple does go wireless
you just know they're gonna use some
proprietary system that you can only get
in a Johnny I've designed 14 karat gold
charging board coming in at number three
force touch this is a feature used on
the Apple watch and now with the
trackpad on there paper-thin MacBook in
spite of the molesty sounding name this
is a cool trick that allows Apple to
measure not just the on off press of a
button or tap of the screen but a subtle
range of pressures incorporated the
iPhone screen and home button they could
open up some new possibilities for
nuance control and haptic feedback at
number two a better battery according to
Apple the new thirst battery design for
their MacBook is a breakthrough in
battery design the adds extra capacity
in the same amount of space so it stands
to reason that if Apple used this
technology with the existing iPhone 6
design you have a longer-lasting phone
instead what we'll probably do is use it
there's a way to slim down 2016 iPhone 7
while keeping battery life the same
because why make practical improvements
on their products when you can
needlessly make it thinner and more
fragile speaking of fragile our number
one most wanted feature for the next
iPhone a sapphire screen but the second
hardest material on earth is good enough
for the Apple watch then why not put it
to work on the iPhone well probably
because fragile phones are good business
for Apple but that doesn't mean you
can't dream it right so there you go
five features we hope to see in the 2015
iPhone refresh all the latest iPhone
rumors head over to phones at cnet.com
and for more top 5s from me
