case looks a lot like some of its other
iPhone cases but this case is special
it's a new modular case that's designed
to work with a host of new accessories
from several companies that OtterBox has
partnered with the case comes in black
or white and is based on OtterBox
asymmetry case the difference is that on
the universe case there's an accent
plate on the back that you slide out to
reveal a rail system when you want to
attach a module you simply slide it on
to the rail and it clips on to the case
a variety of modules will be available
including a speaker additional memory a
card holder backup battery and squares
credit card reader as well as camera
lenses car mounts and a barcode scanner
in the past some of these iPhone
accessory companies have had to create
their own custom phone cases for their
products because a lot of people like to
keep a case on their phones at all times
where people already had an otterbox on
their phone and wanted to know if the
accessory could fit over the case so it
made sense for these companies to
partner up with OtterBox to try to
create this accessory platform at launch
the OtterBox universe case will cost $50
for the iPhone 6 6s version and $60 for
the iPhone 6 plus 6 plus S version
eventually the case may get bundled with
certain modules but for now the case in
modules are sold separately naturally
the hope for these accessory companies
is that once you buy the case you want
to try out not just one but potentially
multiple modules including theirs I'm
