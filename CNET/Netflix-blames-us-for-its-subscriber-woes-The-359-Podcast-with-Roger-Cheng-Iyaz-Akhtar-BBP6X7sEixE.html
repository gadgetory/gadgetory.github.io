we're about to tape a podcast usually
we're on Facebook lab but we've decided
to make the switch to YouTube hopefully
some of our viewers will jump along
although we haven't really told anyone
yet so probably not so you're here so
thanks for being here thanks for being
here thanks for checking us out our
first Youtube episode i'm here with I as
the wolf oh we are that's me we're going
to be starting our podcast shortly but I
just wanted to run down our list of
headlines for you will be talking about
Netflix as earnings disappointing
earnings and the fact that they blamed
us by us being the media for their
subscriber woes as well as would we talk
about Pokemon go again you can't avoid
it can avoid it as well as Leslie Jones
and her Twitter account and Leslie Jones
is a different pokemon she's not she is
the one of the stars of the latest
Ghostbusters film and a victim of just a
huge amount of Twitter harassment uh
yeah I'm really since the movie air
premiered was finally the movie did
pretty well under the reviews have been
okay right have you seen it I haven't
seen it yet nor am i but the reviews I
think we're you know there were mixed
the positive I think there were so many
articles explaining how internet movie
reviews are broken based on this
particular movie because it's it it
skews male seem to hate it female seem
to love English before it even came out
so I haven't seen a lot of yes there was
a lot of judgment ahead of time I saw
the trailer I wasn't super impressed
with the trailer but you know I didn't
hate it I wanted to get a shot I still
do if I ever actually want to watch
movies I would give a shot yeah you
don't you're not bitter at all yeah
that's that's a new data me so just took
quick note please if you have any
questions about any of these topics
definitely shoot them over comment
section our producer Brian will field in
the world will answer the questions
after the actual podcast taping so
what's that brand new i get sorry I'm
ready when you guys are
all right start the countdown and audio
to speed take away the recording in
three two welcome to the 359 when we
talk about the top tech news of the day
and all the crap you want throwing I'm
Roger Cheng and with me is esteemed I as
the wolf pack tar hello I want to start
with Netflix which reported it's worth
subscriber gain in three years but they
don't blame the price increases that are
being rolled out to customers netflix
says it's the media's fault what do you
think that's a weird excuse that there
are other foreigners already excuse now
Hastings was saying that in April it
trended a netflix price increase and was
it was spiking there when people who
weren't even subject to the price change
we're canceling that seemed to be a part
of it n of the press is it or people
just freaking out because it's really
easier for you got yourself price hike
you're like no right but why would you
leave it's a dollar increase that's the
thing it's like our people for really
freaking out over a dollar a month
increase well I think it could just be
the principle that matter how dare you
give me such a cheap commercial free
service for nine dollars now it's ten
dollars well it's just a note like
Amazon Prime broke out their video
service for 899 so they're technically
their undercutting Netflix the options
are not the selection of videos are not
the same but you know there's definitely
competition out there right yeah there's
other services that are vying for your
money but I still think that Netflix
they've had a very interesting history
when it comes to quality of video but
the originals that they're coming out
with the movies you have original series
documentaries that holds that whole slew
of of content is so rich then I think
they have a pretty good set of content
compared to any other online streaming
service yeah it looks like this is gonna
be a long term affected they warned that
the next quarter subscriber growth was
still gonna be pretty muted so we'll see
there's there's I'm sure there's a lot
of confusion out there I mean I got my
email notice that my price is going up
next month so not gonna make me when you
infuriated at yourself because you
reported this mr. Pressman I wasn't i
wasn't i took it pretty cold lane
knowing that you know a new season of
ultron it's gonna come out soon I'm
gonna want to watch it oh no I could see
the backlash because Adam Sandler like
oh we're gonna invest in quality
contacts sure top backing Adam Sandler
more Voltron less Sandler all right next
up we want to talk about Pokemon go
again
you do yeah I do the game is reportedly
set to launch in Japan it's its home
market finally tomorrow and this comes
as the company's market value has
doubled since the phone since game is
launched and is actually worth more than
sony now this games been out for like
two weeks now yep and they ran into lots
of server issues you saw the are mine
half after you talked about that when a
hacksaw there's a ddos yeah under the a
hack what it wasn't really that
effective cuz i was able to play over
the weekend look I don't think Pokemon
servers but Mongo servers need any more
load right doing this is was I thought
was complete jerk move I know they want
to say that they're claiming that we can
show you how to secure your servers
right but with Nintendo point care
please hire us this is how this is all
you said a weird way to get a job but
yeah Pokemon go being in Japan I'm sure
hopefully they have enough servers to
handle that it's been like a phenomenon
I'm thinking I've seen anything like
this where everybody people in New York
are talking to each other when they're
playing like this strange like oh is
that is that a Pidgey here I've got 50th
at why don't you know the Pidgey no
there's definitely that social element
where like people are interacting and
meeting each other because of pok√©mons
oh it's weird it is it just touching is
it I think people are touching that's
the problem i think i think pokemon go
is just just amazing right now and I
don't know you think it's gonna last any
further than I don't know like right now
it's sort of that that perfect time
we've got summer kids are out in school
the weather is nice we'll see it once
life's storms start hitting it gets
colder we'll see if people actually
wanna go out and play I lastly lessee
Jones one of the stars of Ghostbusters
called out Twitter trolls for the
disgusting racist and sexist comments
that battered her account guys's does
Twitter have an obligation to clean up
these kinds of attacks my twitter has
tools for the users to block people i
think that's relatively important and if
that you can report users i think that's
their duty but i know if twitter can go
out on its own play policeman well it's
interesting that she she actually
actively unblocked it she wanted all
these these tweets of show up at her
feet to show the public just how bad
things have gone and it's it's crazy for
looking over the co-sponsors which
already had its fair share of negative
reaction that she got huge brunt of the
day he pretty ugly yeah it's gone really
ugly so y know more about these stories
check us out on cnet I'm Roger Cheng
Amaya's actor thanks for listening and
we're cut on the recording alright but
we're still love
on YouTube awesome all right YouTube
you've got any questions time now's the
time to ask so we've done 35 seconds of
it Oh crud oh it's the quickest thing to
say about that man you know I've been
I've gotten a couple of nice racial
slurs on YouTube yep oh yeah oh yeah and
I'm like wow I haven't seen one of those
in a while I remember running about
Trump's comments about making the iphone
here and I started talking about the
economics and why that's that's kind of
impossible yeah but I remember the
Twitter reaction was like oh like you're
you're an expert because your brother is
back in back in China make these phones
like I had some really terrible comments
that came in just I feel like that's
part of the Twitter culture which is one
of the issues that the company has yeah
I mean people are gonna say stupid
things yep no matter where you are it's
just the fact that they have keyboards
and there's anonymity and they can hide
behind either like a little egg avatar
or whatever it is it's it's a real it's
a real problem to see that if you know
sometimes I see the people who are just
flat-out hateful and they're just honest
about Italy they're consistent and
sometimes I'm like well okay that's
impressive that you're consistently
hateful but it's it's just the nature of
while humans essentially like yeah and
you have a tool like the internet it's
going going after the worst comment on
where they're and because you have that
you have that freedom yeah that again I
mean I think sometimes we at least I've
done this in the past or I'd neglect the
positive comments I've seen a really
nice things from viewers out there for
sure the negative stuff always stands
out in your mind right like I can't I
can't really recall like the more
complimenting comments that I've gone on
Twitter but I definitely remember the
negative ones well I i think in Leslie
Jones this case it's like a perfect
storm isn't ghostbusters it's like a
beloved franchise right it didn't matter
who was in the movie honest yeah yeah it
was gonna get a lot of heat no matter
what yeah and so the remake issues I
haven't seen it I don't know what it's
like I'm shirts I hurts okay right I
know it didn't outperform secret life of
pets which I'm surprised that that in
its second week beat ghostbusters I
don't know I feel like the buzz for that
movie was so high that people were and
it's like it's an it's a family film
right its moral family film the ghost
ball strangers I saw I mean I saw see
her life of pets I thought it was like
it was all right it wasn't great or
anything good to know I'll
not to watch it's about six out of ten
all right but Louis CK is the lead dog
okay Oh ready change his voice they
altered it I'm like let's Louie CK he's
got a distinct voice why would you do
that yeah Louie ck if he wasn't
ghostbusters probably watch that I don't
know if he is I Brian are there any
questions or comments so uh one person
just thinks that I as this mustache is
sexy thank you there you go I just got
some new white hairs in there this week
exactly adds to you know then I
distinguished yeah you know I've been
working on this mustache for a couple
years now i'm jealous i can't grow a
mustache can physically unable to grow
moustache might not be as as full
definitely would and this mustache is
nowhere near as full as like Brian's
mustache is a work of art yeah can we
can we get a tag that a sharper look at
your mustache Brian cuz that and that
thing is awesome look at look at me I
cannot do that beautiful I'm jealous I
definitely can do you reach the mustache
and beard hair the facial hair love
portion of the shin pretty sure Bryan's
gonna love this conversation um just got
a Pokemon go just just curious you know
whatever we talked about this earlier
there's all the hype about Nintendo and
its association with the game but you
know it doesn't actually make money
directly off Pokemon go right right
because the Nintendo is a third partner
of the very creatively named Pokemon
company right it's three different
members own that but believe Nintendo
has a share of niantic which makes the
game yeah but niantic was spun off of
Google after the whole alphabet thing so
there's a whole lot of things that
Nintendo's getting indirectly right and
for shareholders winder like capitalize
on the Pokemon go phenomenally Nintendo
is still the best bet but it's just
interesting that you know all those
in-app purchases that Pokemon go is
generating that doesn't go to Nintendo's
coffers but they could nintendo could
use this kind of leverage in the future
to say hey listen we want a cut of this
yep in the future maybe they do have I
don't know if they have a cut but I
don't know there are no terms the deal
is not and honestly maybe they do get a
cut maybe but that's totally speculative
I have no idea right so maybe in the
future when they do other mobile games
and they work without developers they're
gonna be like hey you know we were
really important to integral to this
game although i don't know how integral
they were other than intellectual
property
I believe that the Niantic folks
mentioned Nintendo as a key partner
during the initial announcement but that
that well yeah that could mean anything
right they had ingress which is like the
same game right and a lot less users and
a lot because it was weird then now it's
like yeah it's Pokemon so it's totally
cool that I'm like hiding behind this
miss van today right at last do you
think that Nintendo or niantic or anyone
can repeat the successes Pokemon go sort
of a one-off it's a one-off there's no
way I don't see this is gonna be like oh
wow this is gonna be the start of a our
games cuz it must be like I was like
Pokemon go right and like why I can play
pokemon goes who I do this now maybe
there'll be a variant like two to three
years but like we've seen a lot of the
pan games yep words with friends was
super hot draw something Angry Birds the
original super hot killer app everybody
applying it really and I just heard
fizzled so yeah cuz if they'd like
thousand iterations of it but then again
Pokemon in general as a game has
survived iterations you're my red
pokemon yellow put my fist that is true
so if anything is able to survive it
iterative changes it be that because
everyone's kind of used to it already
right right all right let's uh let's
wrap things up Brian will ask questions
before we go well people would like you
to revisit the the price changes in
what's happening with Netflix for those
who joined Leia just a recap last year
Netflix actually put in the price
increase for new customers so it's 999
for anyone signing up for the standard
plan so the standard plan and which
isn't that great actually but it's a zoo
screens HD it's three it's Jess two
streams HD but for existing Netflix
subscribers you were basically
grandfathered in at the lower price for
about a year and now that it's now that
the bad year is sort of ending a lot of
people are getting their price increases
now and it's getting phased in sort of a
slow rollout so some people are already
came the price increase I for instance
bullhead mom my mine will actually go up
in August others will probably go a
little later but we're starting to see
the impact of it now and you know
netflix brands of blends of press but
you know it's the subscribers are
actually canceling they still have the
basic plan which I think's remains
unchanged at 799 but it doesn't have HD
one stream they have the the Africans a
4k that's the ultra HD and it also has
I forget mr. streams all say it like the
little box yes even the most mess was
$12 that one hasn't change in either the
basic it's just this 899 plan movie
night unit plan everyone is on yet it's
the one that's the most populous but
it's also like it's not that I got my
increase about last month and I was also
like Oh what is this I'm like oh yeah
but it's also it's a dollar it's a
dollar and I watch enough netflix words
yeah little to me yeah so I could spike
see people to see the word your price
height of the phrase price hike right
increase your like y know and they've
been trying to massage this you know and
it's not really a price increase since
we did the price increase last year you
guys are grandfathered and you got extra
time to save out on that extra dollar
but you know for most people their bill
will go up a dollar yeah that was odd
though you like what you just said like
you're like a year of using your old
plan price and no but people aren't
happy about that maybe they didn't Nick
they didn't the same is I don't think a
lot people knew they didn't know tell
though the headlines start popping up
that your your bill specifically you the
existing subscriber will pay a dollar
more like that's when they start caring
right yeah I mean that was everything
there's people remember had lines would
scream like percentages wise yeah cuz
it's a huge percentage jump a dollar an
8a nine dollars huge right but like when
you think about your like that's what it
was that like a buttered roll Roach
coach like that's not that expensive
right to get I don't even know what I
can get for a dollar a dollar one could
get maybe stickers borrow oh maybe I'm
really maybe a fun size yeah you're
right we're New York oh so like yeah
things are a bit more expensive yeah
maybe like in Wyoming you can moon
alright let's wrap things up reals um
