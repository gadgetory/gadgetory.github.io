if you follow these things which
basically means that it will be very
limited and have a lot of
and it really does I know you can't see
it from here but it is shining out of me
the phone also comes with sprint IC
which basically gives you a gallery and
freeze Oded profiles that you can
download all in one fell swoop that's
the zookie optional so if you're not
into that you can just skip it over
