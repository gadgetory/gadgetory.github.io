minivan as Kia's largest vehicle kia
calls the sorento a crossover utility
vehicle or CUV for short
it comes in l LX e x sx and limited trim
models we have the limited trim model
back here with a 2-liter direct
injection turbo charged engine that's
one of three engines available we also
have all-wheel-drive this can have you
have the front wheel drive as well in
this limited trim model we have a
panoramic sunroof and we have two rows
of seating good for five passengers to
get three rows for seven passengers you
need to go up to the v6 option that's
going to decide it for a few people in
the center of the dashboard here we have
an eight-inch touchscreen now this comes
standard in the DX SX and limited trim
Sorrento models you don't get it in the
lower trim I'm not crazy about this
interface we've got buttons down the
side for quick access to some of the
features then we also have a main menu
screen a whole screen full of menu icons
to get to the different things it's a
little bit confusing a little bit
duplicative with this navigation system
here the maps look good and there's good
traffic coverage but we don't get
perspective view maps we only get
top-down view maps we have some app
integration here so if I want to use
Google search to find a destination I
just hit my Navi button hit local search
and then I can enter in any search term
and get results but the way this works
is it's actually tethered through my
phone using my phone as a hotspot so you
have to have a Wi-Fi hotspot in the car
either your phone or a mobile device but
that's what you need to make the apps
work in this car that's not a great
system because not everybody is gonna be
able to figure out how to tether the car
to a hotspot for audio sources I have
the typical ones I've got bluetooth
streaming here I've got a USB port down
here I can plug in iOS devices and USB
drives full of music I actually have a
USB port in the back but that's only for
charging that's not actually connected
to the audio system I've got HD radio
and satellite radio as well and this
top-trim sorento comes with a 12 speaker
infiniti audio system 630 watt so that's
a lot of good sound quality there and
Kia's also included a system called
clarify this is a audio technology that
she tries to bring back some of the lost
sound in highly compressed audio files
but I've noticed that the audio sounds a
lot better when plugged into the USB
port rather than playing through
bluetooth stream you know I think that's
because it's reconstructing some of the
lost details in compressed audio files
so I like that now see what happens when
I put it in reverse I get this nicely
detailed surround view camera system so
I can see behind me I can see a top-down
view of the car and I also press these
buttons to get different views I can see
straight behind me I can see a corner of
the car and if I put it in Drive while
the camera mode is on and I'm creeping
forward I can actually see a front view
of the car in front of me so that's
convenient I also have adaptive cruise
control and a blind-spot modern aiding
system in this car with the tech package
and finally on my instrument cluster
I've got an LCD panel for my speedometer
there's real analog gauges on either
side but the centre is pure LCD and you
get a nice little informational display
which shows you audio or navigation or
whatever you want to switch it
now I mentioned the 2-liter
four-cylinder engine under the hood of
this car that's got direct injection as
do the other engine options for the
Sorento and it also has a turbocharger
so that gets us 240 horsepower 260 pound
feet of torque which is decent for this
vehicle almost up to the levels of the
v6 that's mated to a 6-speed automatic
transmission and we've got a manual mode
here so I can choose gears that takes
the place of a low range idea so if I
need 3rd gear 2nd gear I can choose
those this goes through an
all-wheel-drive system in this vehicle
it's actually a front-wheel drive
platform but they've run power to the
rear wheels and torque will shift
between the front and rear axles
automatically depending if there's wheel
slip and I have a button on the console
where I can actually lock the
differential and get 50% report the
front and rear I want to do that if I'm
in a situation where I really need power
at all four wheels like if I'm stuck in
snow or saying something like that with
this driveline I get 19 miles per gallon
city 25 miles we all in a highway I'm
not the greatest members in the world
I'm driving this car I've noticed that
it doesn't really take out very fast
when you're making a rolling
acceleration so right now I'll just
punch it and it takes a little while to
pick up and that's because the automatic
transmission takes a little while to add
the extra mm that you need it takes a
little while to ship down I got to say
overall the driving character of the
Sorento is very nice and comfortable
doesn't take much thought which is kind
of idea behind these kind of cars you
just get in and go
all right let's price out our 2016 kia
sorento now base model and L trim with a
2.4 liter four-cylinder engine will go
for twenty four thousand nine hundred
dollars we've taken a big leap up to the
limited trim model with that 2-liter
turbocharged engine
this goes for thirty nine thousand nine
hundred base we've added all wheel drive
for eighteen hundred dollars and that
tech package with adaptive cruise
control and the surround you camera
system for $2,500 that puts us with
destination at a total of forty five
thousand ninety five dollars that's a
big chunk of money this is a pretty
well-equipped pretty nice SUV</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
