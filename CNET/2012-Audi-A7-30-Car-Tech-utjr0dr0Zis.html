a6 and the a8 and Audi's line but it's a
very distinctive model known for its
four doors coupe roofline and huge
hatchback let's drive the 2012 Audi a7
and of course check the tape
I'll be sleek a7 has been a bonafide hit
since it joined the four-door coupe
battle but that is still a battle in the
larger war of car making still a niche
bear in mind none of the cars in this
class have the same rear passenger
comfort as a sedan sibling partly thanks
to the sloping roofline that tends to
require the rear seat location be pushed
forward
howdy may have the most cohesively
impressive cabin tech in the biz right
now
one example is how this car can span the
task of navigation across the instrument
panel screen on over to the center stack
screen creating what could be the most
powerful navigation control center out
there now BMW might argue that Audi has
to do that since their main screen isn't
really wide but Audi can counter nicely
with their cutting-edge use of Google
Earth imagery downloaded on the fly I
find it more useful than the 3d building
renderings most of the industry is
pursuing Google is also present in this
car in the form of live search a great
way to power navigation and connectivity
is via a dedicated sim in the dash and
its own cellular radio not relying on
smart phone tethering voice command is
nowhere near as good as your Android
phone but that's par for the course
across the car industry 235 second
street San Francisco California 35
second street San Francisco California
has been accepted outies unique touchpad
lets you finger paint input and I often
find it more satisfying than voice but
to a degree and I'm still getting used
to Audi's four corner buttons that map
to far-flung corners on the screen I
guess after five years we'll just have
to agree not to love each other
our a7s 3 liter v6 is supercharged so
force-fed by a belt-driven pump rather
than from an exhaust path flowing over
an impeller which would be a turbo
tomato tomahto except that the Audi's
response feels faster on throttle than
most of the turbo cars in its class
that's a traditional hallmark of
superchargers but they do introduce some
parasitic drag on the engine
the numbers are 310 horsepower 325
foot-pounds of torque
0 to 60 is in 5.4 seconds for this 4,200
pounds car and the mpg isn't bad at 18
28 at least that's the stated mpg all
a7s have an 8-speed automatic with
paddles and standard Quattro all-wheel
drive that's a big deal howdy chooses to
make that standard while things like
navigation rear cam and sensors and
steerable front headlights are optional
one of the first things you notice about
driving the supercharged engine is that
it's a supercharger there is really no
perceptible delay in that on rush of
power and it's a big boost when you get
it there's also this all-wheel drive all
four paws are gripping once you get the
feel of that and Audi's Quattro is the
best you realize this car really knows
how to vector itself in around corners
that is part of the logic of its
drivetrain incredibly smooth motor
almost a little light on throat at least
in the cabin but that's just an
aesthetic thing there's also a little
bit of kind of drumming and thrumming of
the chassis
I noticed driving the BMW 640 I recently
it seemed to me more of an ingot of
metal I'm getting a little bit of the
sound of parts moving in the
undercarriage which is not my favorite
sound but I don't believe that this car
is built to be pressed as hard as
MWF similar caliber it also tends to do
everyday driving a little more refined
Lee I think it's no slouch but to me
it's more of a civilized car than an
equivalent BMW
it was crisis out e87 with
all-wheel-drive and the supercharged
motorettes the only way they come 60
grams kind of a value but not fully set
up see net style see you add thirty six
hundred bucks for Premium Plus that's
going to add the Google Earth navigation
system out eConnect services all those
parking sensors rearview camera and a
lot more stuff that you are gonna want
