here just happening this week on SEANET
scrambler augmented reality is making
leaps and bounds as of late with
products like microsoft's hololens and
other apps that allow you to see digital
objects rendered over the real world
well this week of Google back startup
called magic leaf released a short video
showing off what it can potentially be
capable of in the video we see a demo of
a small robot hiding under a desk the
video has a disclaimer on of stating
that the video was shot directly through
magic leaf technology on October 14th
2015 without the use of special effects
or compositing as the user moves closer
to the robot we notice that the leg of
the desk is in front of the robot
suggesting some sort of 3d mapping
technology the video continues with an
amazing look at our solar system and
augmented reality as a woman works in
the background editor computer last
March magic leaf released its first
product video showing off the interfaces
and then a game where the user is
blasting robots with a futuristic weapon
so if this is any indication of what
we're in store for in the next few years
you can count me in
a lego genius by the name of Jason alman
aka jkbrickworks.com nation safe out of
LEGO bricks and produced a short video
along with instructions on how to build
your own used an older Millennium Falcon
piece from 2003 to create the dial for
the safe which when turned to the proper
positions will unlock the deadbolt
inside the safe and allow you to take it
out of its housing revealing the golden
Lego bricks inside the safe was built in
a way where it cannot be easily taken
apart when locked one would have to
physically break the LEGO pieces and
destroy the safe altogether but if you
know the secret combination the golden
Lego bricks inside can be yours
read more about the lego safe and watch
the entire video embedded in the crave
blog post sit back relax and enjoy 45
minutes of slow motion NASA Apollo
rocket launches set to mellow piano
music sounds mildly enjoyable YouTube
user space videos has put together a
long slow drawn-out video of Apollo 8
Apollo 11 and Apollo 12 in 16-millimeter
launch views according to the video's
description you can find the entire
video embedded in the crave blog post
Harvard is developing a tiny drone
called the Robo V that can both fly
through the air like a bee and swim
through water kind of like a jellyfish
we're now moving past quadcopters in
larger drones and entering into the age
of insect sized drone robots which is
kind of scary engineers at Harvard
Johnson a Paulsen School of Engineering
and Applied Science microbiotic slab
studied the flying and swimming habits
of the puffins a bird that flies and
swims using its wings and discovered a
lot of similarities between flapping
wings for flight and flapping fins for
swimming the Robo B was outfitted with
very fragile and thin wings and was
programmed to flap its wings at a rate
of 120 beats per second for flight when
the Robo B enters the water the speed of
the wing flapping is then slowed to nine
beats per second for slower safer travel
through water that won't damage the
wings the wings also change their angle
of attack for both flight and in the
water the Robo B currently has to be
tethered to a power source because
having an onboard power source at this
point would make it too heavy for flight
and it also cannot take off from water
yet because of weight restrictions but
it's a start and in the coming years we
can look forward to swarms of robotic
bees that can follow you into the water
so don't you worry right guys that was a
show thank you very much for watching as
