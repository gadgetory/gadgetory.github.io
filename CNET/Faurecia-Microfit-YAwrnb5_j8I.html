never quite get comfortable in your car
seat especially on long trips and number
two how many of you have a sleep number
bed all right those to kind of come
together in these seat technologies i'm
going to show you now from for SIA
here's an app that is tied to this seat
sensors throughout in at least a half a
dozen locations are picking up my body
pressure where is there too much
pressure where is there not enough and
you can see it's live reading all of
those into this data based app if I hit
continuous here this technology called
micro fit is now automatically adjusting
all of those zones based on the pressure
the idea is to get everything as close
to zero as possible that's the nice
neutral where I don't have too much
pressure or too little supporting my old
aging back now once you're comfortable
how do you stay comfortable when you're
driving that's where something called
GPS fit comes in you've heard of active
seats we've shown you in Mercedes for
example that change the bolsters as
you're in curves but those have kind of
elaborate hardware this one is different
look at this GPS fit is using GPS
mapping and map data to know where I am
so here on the map I can see on coming
up there we go on a left-hand turn kind
of a strong one and the seat just
readjusted it didn't react to the
dynamics of the car because I'm not even
in the turn yet it pre reacted based on
what it knows about what's coming up on
the road how fast I'm going and what it
knows about my height and weight because
I set this thing up to myself when I
first started driving the car and there
it goes moving again now because we're
getting back into a straight so we can
handle lateral force prediction it can
also get you set up for visibility by
changing the angle of the seat and if it
pushes your head forward to get you in
the right place to see over a hill or
something it'll also adjust the bottom
at the same time to maintain your leg
distance so you're not getting pulled
away or too close to the petals lots of
things going on here the idea of this is
that all the technologies built into the
seat whereas some of the current
technologies there it goes again I guess
returning require a lot of ancillary
hardware now for see it doesn't make
cars they don't sell seats you can buy
there a vendor to lots of the major car
makers out there but this is the kind of
thing that we like to see companies
showing to get the car makers to raise
their visible
a little bit toward the next or next
innovation in car tech it's not always
on a screen</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
