pre-production version of ten taxes
latest flagship aps-c DSLR the k3 Pentax
overhauls the k5 to successor inside and
out it's got a new anti-aliasing filter
free 24 megapixel sensor a new body
design a new 27 point AF system and a
new 86,000 pixel RGB metering system
there's also improved performance with
continuous shooting increasing up to 8.3
frames per second the new autofocus
system unfortunately doesn't have any
live view optimizations the Pentax says
that five of the AF sensors are
specifically for low-light and even the
pre-production model was able lock focus
in some pretty dim conditions like the
70d it now implements zone focus though
it doesn't display the zone just the
selected focus point when you pre focus
it does seem to select the center of the
zone which is good more often than not
perpend techs the new viewfinder has
improved coatings and while I didn't
really see a perceptible difference it's
still a nice viewfinder it's also the
first camera to support USB 3 oh I'm not
quite sure of the implications yet as
that depends upon implementation but it
does open the door for faster download
speeds through the computer and improved
bandwidth for tethered shooting the
camera also potentially delivers
improved image stabilization Pentax
claims an extra stop and better
durability of the shutter for up to
200,000 cycles Pentax brings its movie
mode into parity with the rest of the
world now it has 1080 30p and 726 DP
options along with a mic input and a
headphone jack the body design will not
completely overhaul does have many
significant changes over the K 5 series
it's still sturdy with a weather shield
magnesium alloy body and kind of heavy
the mode dial is now lockable though I'm
not sure about the implementation
there's a lock switch that you use in
conjunction with the more typical
central button it seems a bit overkill
to me well I like the interface which is
typical Pentax the company does tend to
think different on other cameras on the
brief info screen you hit a button and
then
get around the screen changing settings
on a Pentax you see all the important
settings on the control screen but have
to hit different buttons to change each
setting to change multiple settings from
a single screen you have to go into the
more crowded and difficult to quickly
parse info screen on the K 50 which has
fewer features this isn't so bad
on the feature-packed k3 though it's
more to wade through the new navigation
buttons are designed with slightly
raised edges on the side that you can
use to navigate diagonally that's pretty
clever
and there are some disappointments for
one it's got a fixed rather than
articulating LCD for some reason Pentax
is the only manufacturer that resists
incorporating moveable LCDs and the
camera lacks built-in Wi-Fi
Pentax instead opts to use an SD card
based solution from flu card which will
have a custom option for supporting
wireless tethering via web browser as
for Pentax scenes you don't need the
latest and greatest the k5 2 and 2's
will remain in the line at a lower price
I'm Laurie Brennan and this is a
pre-production version of the Pentax k-3</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
