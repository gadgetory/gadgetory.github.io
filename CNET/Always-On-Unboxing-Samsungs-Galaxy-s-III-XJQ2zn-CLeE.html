galaxy s3 kind of the hottest android
phone that you can buy right now and
even though Samsung made the
unprecedented move of making it
available on all the major US carriers I
got so excited that I ordered the
international unlocked version so I
could get it sooner let's have a look
now I got the white model as you can see
this phone is pretty it has a four point
eight inch Super AMOLED screen looks
pretty good there's a 1.4 gigahertz
quad-core processor although
unfortunately the US version will be
dual core only but it'll have two gigs
of RAM to make up for it there's an
eight megapixel camera on the back it
has Gorilla Glass it's 16 gig standard
but you can get up to 32 gigs of storage
there's a removable battery and a
microSD card slot now the phone has this
weird eye tracking feature so that it
keeps the screen on whenever there's a
person looking at it that's a little bit
more of a gimmick than anything and then
s voice is the feature that's supposed
to go head-to-head with Siri we're going
to do a road test a little later and see
which one of those can drive us crazy
the soonest but all that said the galaxy
s3 is unquestionably an awesome phone in
fact our UK editors already gave it an
editor's choice based on that unlocked
quad core version make sure you go over
to cnet com and read the full review
there too</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
