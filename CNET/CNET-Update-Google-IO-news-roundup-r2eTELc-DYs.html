goodies I'm Bridget Carey and this is
your cnet uptick Google made a ton of
announcements during the keynote address
of its annual IO Developers Conference
among the highlights Google is entering
the streaming music business with the
launch of Google Play all access for ten
dollars a month subscribers can stream
any song in Google's library and also
that you blend that with your personal
music library google also gives
recommendations and curate stations to

30-day trial and those that try it by
june thirtieth get it for a discounted
price of eight dollars a month google is
taking on services like Spotify and
Pandora and it also beat Apple to the
punch on this one it's been rumored that
Apple has been trying to launch its own
version of a subscription music service
which could come this year switching to
android games will be able to support
multiplayer mode so you can invite other
players and not just other Android
players but also people using Apple
mobile devices and you can compare your
score with other users in a leaderboard
users will also be able to start a game
on one device like a phone save it and
then pick it back up later on another
device like a tablet google plus social
network also gets a major overhaul its
rolling out now the design is different
with multiple columns of cards for every
post and these cards flip around for
more info if you want to dive deeper
into a topic Google can show you related
hashtags to that post in some cases
Google system is smart enough to know
what you're taking a photo of and tag it
for you if a user doesn't write the
words Eiffel Tower it still knows it's a
picture of the Eiffel Tower and gives it
a hashtag you can turn these things off
or if it gets the hashtag wrong you can
remove the tag Google wants to do the
work for you even help you sort through
what the best photos were from your
family vacation by weeding out the
blurry images duplicate shots and those
with bad exposure and it also recognizes
when people are smiling and if these
people are important to you pretty
amazing how smart the algorithm is but
it also might weird you out with how
smart it is Google Plus will also auto
enhance your photos to soften skin flaws

also improving you can search with
google now on the chrome browser and
Chrome operating system and the voice
search can understand when you use
pronouns such as here or it'd be on the
lookout for Google Maps getting
improvements both on the desktop and
eventually on mobile apps and googled in
