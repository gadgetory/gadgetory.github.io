ads seriously I'm Bridget Carey and this
is your cnet update would you pay a
subscription to remove ads from web
pages Google a company that makes most
of its money from advertising is testing
a service that lets you block ads for a
small monthly fee between one and three
dollars it's called google contributor
when you visit a participating website
the ads are replaced with a thank-you
note and a portion of your subscription
fee is shared with that website right
now only 10 sites are participating and
you can try it out unless you are
invited to the test if it seems totally
crazy that Google would block its own
ads consider the following google may be
coming up with a solution to micro
payments the idea that you can support
the site you like by throwing in a few
cents into the tip jar when you visit
it's not practical for you to give ten
cents here and ten cents there because
transaction processing fees eat all that
up with this google is handling the tips
in bulk also Google's testing an ad free
paid music service on youtube if we get
used to pain small bits for ad free
music maybe in years it won't seem so
strange to pay for ad free websites but
we're a long way from that now while
Google goes ad free Amazon could be
heading in the opposite direction the
New York Post reports that Amazon may
offer ad-supported video streaming and
it could be cheaper than netflix this
would be something separate from the
Amazon Prime instant video service you
get with the 100-dollar yearly
subscription now it's not often you hear
about innovation with cable operators
but perhaps comcast has come up with a
way to make appointments less annoying
the comcast my account app will alert
customers with scheduled appointments
when the technician is about a half hour
away and you can track them on a map
you'll also get alerts if they're
running late comcast is first testing
this in the Boston area now before we
end there's quite a bit of innovation
happening in the smart home space right
now but not all of the technology
is quite perfect and just yet to see
what I mean you should check out our
review of the ubi it's a smart speaker
that's designed to answer your voice
commands think of it as a Serie on your
wall but you can turn on your home
appliances as well as get answers to
questions okay ubi turn heater on till
then turn all that dropout it didn't
work yeah voice recognition isn't at the
star track computer level just yet that
your tech news update for cnet in New
York I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
