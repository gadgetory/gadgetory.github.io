you how to use EFT to get creative with
home automation if you don't know what
it is if there's a website that connects
social media sites and online tools like
Gmail and Facebook and Twitter and
Instagram whatever you can think of it
combines them and makes it so you can
have one thing happen on one and another
thing happened as a result somewhere
else now if that sounds confusing don't
worry just pull out your smart phone and
download the app IFTTT so right from the
start as we pull the app up we can see
this really classy kind of animated
design that shows us what it does and
how it does it and it's really easy and
intuitive once you get a look at it once
you get your fingers on it one of the
really cool things about it is that it's
compatible not just with web sites also
with actual physical products and we've
got two of them right here this is the
Philips hue light bulb and the Belkin
Wemo motion detecting switch both of
these have their own channels on if you
can say if the motion detector detects
movement then post this on Twitter or if
something happens on Facebook change the
lighting and if you combine them you can
do cool things like this right here in
the app I can go to my list of recipes
that I've turned on and I can hit the
plus sign to create a new one what I'm
going to do is say that the if will be
the motion detector switch I've got
right here so scroll over there it is
right there the mostly protector switch
select that anytime there is any new
motion
then the result will be that the philips
hue light is going to change colors to
something random now this is a pretty
impractical and not terribly functional
usage of it but imagine at a party
people moving around the light keeps
changing colors might be kind of fun
there are much more practical uses you
can do - suppose you have a motion
detector in your yard and you want to
know if someone is prowling around your
backyard at night you can set it to
change your lamp bright red if that's
the case and so as you can see now if I
trigger the motion detector and the
little blue light goes off sure enough
in just a second or the lamp changes
colors I can do it again and again and
again and it'll keep changing now
remember you're not limited to just
syncing your devices up with each other
like we have here you can sync them up
with websites online and tools online
like Twitter Facebook Google Documents
is a great one suppose every time the
motion detector is triggered you want to
have a new line put into a spreadsheet
to keep track of who's coming and going
in your house or something like that
that's all doable if you can think of it
it's probably possible on IFFT so get
creative and give it a shot thanks for
watching you see that I'm right Chris</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
