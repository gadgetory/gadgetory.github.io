I'm Kara Tsuboi cnet.com joining me is
senior writer Stephen shanklin hey
trying a Stephen today what we're
talking about Moore's law why don't you
very quickly give our viewers a quick
description of who Gordon Moore was and
his law that he created several decades
ago sure Gordon Moore is a co-founder of
Intel and one of the pioneers of the
development of computer chips micro
processors in 1965 he wrote a paper
that's now famous where he described
Moore's law for the first time although
he didn't call it that and in that first
paper he observed that the number of
transistors on a chip that's the number
of little tiny electronic circuitry
components is doubling every year and in
1975 he came back and revised that view
he figured out that is that's actually
no actually every two years and it's a
law that actually proved remarkably
prescient the industry is stuck to it
ever since that's why we have ever more
you know transistors on a chip and
that's why computer processors can do
more and more what used to fit on a main
frame that fits on a PC and it's a
smartphone so it's a it's basically the
march of progress rule for the computer
industry exactly that's the reason I can
have a very sophisticated smart phone in
my pocket today but what are some of the
problems facing Moore's Law I mean can
this really continue and keep up well
it's to be clear it's had problems just
about every year since its existence and
yet the industry just keeps on going
clearing hurdle after hurdle so it's
there are plenty more hurdles to come
looks like we have you know at least a
decade left in the current technology
and that uses silicon for a very
important part of the transistor what
happens after silicon runs out of steam
is kind of wide open right now and there
are a lot of options out there and I
think what's most interesting is there
is a huge industry that is maniacally
focused on making sure computing
progress continues even if Moore's Law
precisely defined doesn't continue what
are some of the solutions that they're
coming up with like are they completely
rethinking materi
rules are rethinking construction like
how are they going to do that well
currently the leading contenders use the
same basic structure for transistors as
we have today but one of the most
interesting ones is a material called
graphene so you leave a lot of the
transistor the same but for one little
silicon channel you could replace that
with a little piece of a substance
called graphene that's a sheet of carbon
atoms it looks like chicken wire
hexagons all stuck together and under
the right circumstances graphene is a
semiconductor which means that it can
transmit electricity or not depending on
the situation that's the key thing that
you need to have happen in order to make
a microprocessor so that's I think one
of the most interesting possibilities
but there are a lot of challenges in
getting that to work and getting to the
point where anybody can actually
manufacture a chip economically so what
happens if the chip industry runs out of
steam and can't keep up it's a very
interesting question right now most of
the people I talked to are not panicking
by any means that that that that might
happen but you have to ask yourself what
would happen and the most likely
situation is not that there's some big
cataclysmic moment where the industry
falls off a cliff but more more as if a
gradual tapering down or fizzling there
would be a lot of warning in advance if
things if the train was going way off
the rail so it wouldn't be a sudden
thing and there would be a lot of things
that the industry could do to help pick
up the slack improvements in software
improvements in how the processors
actually work and lots of other things
so I think that if it did happen it
would probably be a gradual transition
and when it was over there would still
be a lot of innovation I think a good
example would be the automotive industry
you know internal combustion engines
haven't changed profoundly in decades
you know you get extra things you get
anti-lock brakes you get you know fuel
injection and you get maybe electric
vehicles are radical changes but you
know for the most part that's a mature
industry it doesn't change very much but
it's still a very big and very important
and very lively industry fascinating
well Moore's law I guess reaches its
50th anniversary in a few years we'll
definitely be all watching with interest
to see if the industry can indeed keep
up thank you so much Steven I'm Kara
