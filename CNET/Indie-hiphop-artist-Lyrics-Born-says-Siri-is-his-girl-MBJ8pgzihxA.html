you doing so my new album real people
was produced and recorded in New Orleans
by Robert Furio and Ben Ellman of
galactic and it's the first time I've
actually left the Bay Area to make an
album and super organic super funky to
me New Orleans is probably perhaps the
first and last true music town in
America for everybody to contribute it
to the IndieGoGo campaign a portion went
to help Oxfam and their efforts down in
the Gulf region in New Orleans in
Louisiana I literally did the whole
album probably on my iPhone you know
just between Dropbox Siri voice memos I
went to the studio very very little I
find that sometimes theory doesn't
understand me you know I find that
sometimes Siri can be a little
culturally illiterate you know but yes I
love Siri that's my girl you know I will
literally sit there and say Siri I'm
about to start rapping so please take
this down you know what I mean and then
I'll have to go back and correct certain
things obviously but you know that's how
I write songs then well technology i
mean it's it's absolutely transformed
everything we do I mean it's no longer
about you know me giving you a stack of
12-inch vinyl singles for promo anymore
it's like boom here you go let me get
your email address i'm going to shoot
about 5,000 people all at once my new
song along with a video along with my
newsletter along with this along with
that and that's just something that we
weren't able to do you know 10 15 years
ago so I think just to be able to create
this community you know your fans are
all right there in front of you on this
screen you know and i can reach
everybody obviously i tweet them on
facebook them on Instagram I do all
these things myself I think streaming
services are absolutely necessary you
know I just think that in a lot of ways
the laws that govern publishing art are
just so
archaic and outdated I mean they were
done they were created in an era when
people were writing music for player
pianos you know what I mean they had no
way to predict you know Spotify or
Pandora or tie the Lord or even compact
discs you know they mean so I just think
that you know I think we need to make a
change there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
