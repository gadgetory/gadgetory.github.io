configuration a chalky white top with a
gray fabric base like Alexa it might not
fit in with your decor
if white and gray aren't your choice in
colors there are two easy ways you can
customize the appearance of your Google
home speaker while you can't configure
colors of Google home at the time of
purchase Google did make the fabric base
of the speaker removable official
aftermarket bases which come in six
colors and two different materials are
available for purchase from the Google
store the fabric options come in mango
marine and violet while metal bases are
available in carbon or black copper and
snow white the fabric bases start at $20
with free shipping while metal
configurations will set you back $40 a
piece to install an aftermarket base
first unplug the power adapter from the
speaker grab the base and pull downward
giving it a gentle twist will help the
magnets release a little bit easier to
install the aftermarket base line up the
hole for the power adapter with the back
of the speaker once you get it near the
speaker magnets should pull it into
position if changing the color of the
base isn't quite enough there is another
option you can purchase a third party
skin to give the white top of the
speaker a little more pizazz in addition
to basic colors popular smartphone skin
producer slick wraps offers vinyl skins
for Google home in various color
selections with carbon fiber metal wood
leather glitz stone and hemp patterns if
none of these suit your style there are
plenty of other options online which
will run you anywhere from ten to thirty
dollars some even come with skins for
the power adapter which is a nice added
touch if it can't be hidden behind
furniture instructions verifying skins
on Google home will vary just take your
time and make sure to properly align the
wrap before pressing it firmly into
place a skin will give you the
opportunity to truly make your google
home speaker yours although some white
from the original color will ultimately
show the bigger problem however is that
the light ring on the top of the speaker
will be completely covered decide step
this you can enable sound cues in the
Google home app under devices settings
accessibility and toggling on start of
request and end of request to take it
one step further try mixing a skin and a
different color
this walnut skin and the carbon metal
base look really great together</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
