I'm rich demuro with Cena TV and this is
the Q don't stop believin just yet let's
take a look at our must click moment
Yahoo giving a new meaning to the term
Power Lunch small business owners who
won their ultimate connection contest
found themselves eating lunch suspended
150 feet over new york city's Harbor
Ivanka Trump hosted the high-powered
lunch no word if anyone was actually
able to stomach their food why spend
your time searching BitTorrent and
peer-to-peer file-sharing sites for the
latest high rated movies haven't you
heard of google the national legal and
policy center asking is google promoting
video piracy the organization says their
video arm not YouTube apparently hosts
major films without linking to the
actual files the site posting a weekly
top 50 list of what you can find
including the days the material has been
available and tell me views it's gotten
there's fahrenheit 911 with nearly a
million views blood diamond with under
three thousand and even spider-man 3
with four hundred thousand views the
Electronic Entertainment Expo or III
celebrates everything video games but in
recent years the conference has gotten
too bloated so this year's affair is a
bit slim down so lots of e3
announcements if you're interested find
a mint newscom but here in the queue I
bring you retro video game commercials
the site retro thing going through the
trouble of scouring YouTube to bring
vintage clips from the early 80s there
are videos for Atari patel's in
television the colecovision with
built-in Donkey Kong the vetrix
featuring razor-sharp white lines and
the granddaddy of them all to me the
Nintendo Entertainment System time for
the site I don't know about you but now
that I'm carrying around an iphone
everywhere I drool at the opportunity to
latch on to some free Wi-Fi yes the edge
is horrible open Wi-Fi spots helps me
find it share your computer's built-in
Wi-Fi program can tell you what networks
are available that's after you plop
yourself down and there's no guarantee
the hotspot will be open open Wi-Fi
spots is dedicated to free web there are
coffee shops restaurants hotels in
public areas listed searching is as easy
as pumping in a zip code or dragging a
map anyone can add information or
comment on a location thanks to Claudio
for cluing us into this one finally
there's a new word in town ginormous now
I've been using it for years but
apparently others have to the dictionary
reject finally making its way into the
latest merriam-webster dictionary along
with 100 other first time entries so now
DVR will happily live alongside some
other d words while Smackdown will mean
even more to those of us who don't watch
wrestling and according to merriam
webster's publisher blending to existing
words to make a new one is pretty
popular shows her that means this show's
over I'm rich Demuro would seen that TV
in new york city have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
