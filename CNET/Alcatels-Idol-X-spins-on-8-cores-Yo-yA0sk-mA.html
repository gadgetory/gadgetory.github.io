CNN here at CES 2014 in Las Vegas this
is our first look at the alcatel one
touch idol x+ this is a new phone that
updates the one touch idol x device it's
about the same size phone 5-inch 1080p
HD screen what's different about this
one is what's inside there is a 2
gigahertz octa core MediaTek processor
as for the other specs you've got
android 4.2 jelly bean running the show
but it will be upgradable to android 4.4
kitkat on the front you've got a 2
megapixel camera that is capable of
capturing 1080p HD video and on the back
you have a 13.1 megapixel camera with
flash this device here is dual SIM you
press pretty hard on the sides to open
up the sim card slots but then after
that it is very easy to close in
addition to upgrading the processor
alcatel has also done a lot of work with
internal sound you've got dual speakers
here and in our demo the phone did sound
very loud as for the look and feel this
one will come in three different colors
there's this black version there will
also be white and a sort of silver
version fun feels pretty good my hands
alcatel is known for pretty nice design
for a very low price point we can expect
to see this sort of in the three hundred
dollar range i'm guessing off-contract
one thing to note is that there is no
LTE it is hspa+ compatible this phone is
already available in China you can
expect to see it coming to other markets
worldwide in February look for it in the
US in late 2014 4 cnet I'm Jessica doll
