but we got an early demo copy to check
out the latest features after spending a
few days of it I can tell you it's not
going to change the way you use your mac
but it does add features across the
finder and apps that will be welcome
upgrades will start with Mission Control
with a three-finger swipe upwards
suddenly you can see all the windows on
your screen and El Capitan keeps them
all separate so they're easy to find but
you'll also notice a change at the top
of the screen where you now have easier
access to desktop spaces for Mission
Control you can drag a window to the top
to add it to an additional desktop or
just hold it at the top to create a new
space use the top bar to quickly switch
between desktop spaces speaking of
windows you'll now have an easy way to
work in 2f side-by-side with split view
all you need to do is click and hold the
green full screen button then drag the
window to either side then you can click
on another app on your desktop to get
the split screen view you also can
adjust the size by dragging the bar in
the middle to the left or to the right
these split view windows act as full
screen apps so you can use the
three-finger swipe to move to different
full screen apps and desktops spotlight
search also got some enhancements to
give you more results now you'll be able
to quickly get the weather check sports
scores and even search for videos
without leaving the spotlight window now
let's talk about apps the Notes app has
remained unchanged for years but in El
Capitan you get a bunch of new useful
features you have text formatting
features at the top a button to quickly
get to your photos to add images to
notes and you can drag and drop images
PDFs links and videos when you want to
create a checklist just highlight a list
of items then go to the top and select
checklist now you have radio buttons you
can tick off as you shop so far I got
some welcome changes as well with new
pin sites just hold down control and
click to add a pin site and now all your
most visited sites are handy in the
upper left and another fix for one of my
personal pet peeves you can now easily
see which tab randomly starts playing
audio and mute it instantly by clicking
on the indicator at the top in maps we
now finally have transit directions in
lk
tan just in our location as you usually
would and hit the directions button
choose transit and now maps will give
you options for taking the bus or train
when available and it gives you options
for your trip over on the left that's
all the time we have today but there are
many more features in apple's latest mac
operating system El Capitan is coming
this fall's of free upgrades all mac
users i'm jason parker for cnet and this
has been a first look at mac OS 10 El
Capitan thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
