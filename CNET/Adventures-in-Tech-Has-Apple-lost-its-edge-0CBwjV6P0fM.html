looks a lot like last year's model
coming up because Apple lost its edge
has Apple lost its edge short answer no
long answer still no but I can see why
you'd think it has I mean look at the
iPad air
it may be super skinny and super
powerful but like the iPhone 5s and
everything Apple is currently selling
it's a minor upgrade to an old product
in fact we haven't seen a completely new
kind of device since the very first iPad
back in 2010
since then the aggressively modest
tweaks to Apple's most popular gadget
have become more and more tiresome
Apple's weird hyperbole gets
increasingly grating and you start to
wonder hang on what exactly is Johnny
ive talking about true simplicity is
derived from so much more than just the
absence of clutter and ornamentation and
I think with great intent you disconnect
from the past all that you would be
aware of was was everything that was
just missing you can see why people say
that Apple is in decline but if you look
back over the last 15 years or so that's
how Apple has always been perceived
Apple is a company that relies on making
breakthrough tech products but each time
it manages to craft one of these
earth-shattering gadgets the assumption
is that there won't ever be another one
in the late 90s for instance there was a
concern that the novelty of Apple's
colorful iMac would quickly wear off but
of course back then we didn't know that
the iPod was just around the corner or
cast your mind back to 2004 when it was
predicted that Apple would soon be
crushed by increasingly sophisticated
low price iPod rivals like the Dell DJ
though I think we can all be glad that
that never happened
it's the nature of the industry that no
matter what it creates Apple will always
be perceived as being in decline and
desperately in need of new stuff and if
you look at the timing of Apple's new
stuff you'll see the situation isn't
that desperate yet the first iPod went
on sale in 2001 but it took Apple nearly
six years to get to the iPhone the iPad
followed three years later but did have
a head start as it was in development
since before the iPhone and shared much
of the same technology going on past
form you'd expect to see something new
within the next year or two but it's not
the case that a new product from Apple
is long overdue you and I may be bored
by every modest upgrade but the iPhone
5s and 5c sold nine million in their
first weekend on sale while in three and
a half years iPad sales topped one
hundred and seventy million Apple is in
no hurry and this industry watcher
agrees I think if three and a half years
time they're still just putting out
iterations of the iPad then yes they're
going to be in trouble but I think
they've got that kind of grace period I
think they've got another three and a
half years to come up with whatever the
next big thing is and actually I think
they will finally apples tech may feel a
bit stale but it still has plenty of non
Hardware tricks up its sleeves awake I
don't have sleep
apples whirlwind of movies music and
apps quickly ties you into the company's
ecosystem making it tough to leave
meanwhile big shiny Apple stores and a
good rep for customer service mean
Apple's products appeal to more than
just the tech hardcore when it comes
down to it Apple strength actually
nowadays isn't necessarily in innovating
the newest precious thing it's about
making something reliable and convenient
and aspirational that converges with the
things people already
you might be bored by Apple's latest
products but that doesn't mean it's in
decline do you agree that Apple still
has its edge or is it circling the drain
like a bath invading spider let me know
and check back next time for another
adventure in tech</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
