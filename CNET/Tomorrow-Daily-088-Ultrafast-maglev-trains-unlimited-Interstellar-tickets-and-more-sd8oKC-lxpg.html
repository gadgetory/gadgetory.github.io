that goes 300 miles per hour starts
public testing AMC and paramount unveil
on an unlimited pass for interstellar
and I've got details on it oh and an
artist creating 3d printed sculptures so
small you need an electron microscope to
see them stir our daily
greetings citizens of the internet
welcome to tomorrow daily the best geek
talk-show in the known universe I'm host
Ashley Skeletor meet as always hey sky
punch or kill anonymous sky punch
professional sky puncher that's what
they called me in high school I didn't
like it so let's talk about names yeah
we got some really good headlines today
guys so let's let's get to it
you know if there was one technology
that I would want for this country it
would be maglev trains like I love my
speed yeah I love high-speed rail so
this is like very exciting to me that in
Japan they just started testing this
maglev train that goes 500 kilometers an
hour that's it it doesn't beautiful it
was amazing so here are some of the
people who got to ride it first
there were invited on't really look like
they care on us oh no no watch you're
gonna see them get very excited these
are very look at they're like whoa
because they're moving now they're going
really really fast so these are a
hundred people who got to ride this
maglev there it goes it's going up - it
can get it can reach speeds of up to 311
miles per hour which is oh my god look
at it go freak all right where is it
going - okay so it is going the the
testing for this maglev is gonna run it
when it's done it's gonna run between
Tokyo and Nagoya so there you go five
hundred five hundred and one kilometer
oh wow it's going through the limit
miles per hour right there which is very
very quick and obviously this is a
really cool little upgrade for maglev
trains I mean they already have
high-speed rail in Japan yeah but this
is like another even like if they just
keep getting faster and faster of course
I always have that fear of like what's
gonna happen when one of these trees
like flies off of the magnets and
crashes but but it's actually safer as
far as I am aware uh-huh as far as I've
read its it's safer than having wheels
on Rails like it there are more things
that could go wrong mechanically then as
opposed to okay so your fears are
irrational although not super rational I
mean of course there's always the chance
that something will happen
I mean I think that the odds are less
than writing in a regular train so this
is real this is a brand-new one and it's
open to the public now I don't know that
it's open right now they just started
doing their testing but the testing only
lasts for eight days so they're doing
eight days of testing and then and then
it'll be open so it might be open right
now or it's going to be open very very
soon how much is it ticket cost oh
that's a really good question I don't
have an answer to because we haven't
been in Japan but hey listen
hey Japan Japan call us we're totally
ready to ride the maglev is Japan's
number still the same I think it is okay
I think it is well give them a little
tinkle a while since I've called Japan
yeah all right it's the same number okay
cool just one I do want to ride that I
do any of you that are watching this
have written a maglev I haven't please
tell us how your it feels is it feeling
different than riding away but it's
really smooth because you're on magnets
you're not you know bumping on our
railroad yeah it's kind of cool yeah so
the problem is like it's very expensive
obviously compared to traditional trains
so I don't know that we'll be seeing
these like cropping up all over the
world in in a couple years but I mean
over time maybe who knows we'll have
maglev trains will be the new sort of
standard yeah hoverboards no why not
yeah we're gonna hoverboard next year so
uh some yeah that's pretty good um
speaking of unlimited movie passes AMC I
did just say that I did just mention all
right so there there's been a recent
development in the film and the theater
industry called movie pass in which you
pay a certain price and you can go see a
movie yes as many times as you want
well AMC and Paramount have worked
together to focus on one specific movie
and that is interstellar now what I'm
saying here is that you pay one price
and you can see interstellar in theaters
as much as you want but I think it's not
an IMAX its regular why would you want
to oh wait you would want to see what is
the idea I saw it in IMAX yeah yeah
which is the way you're supposed to see
it apparently guys see it in IMAX if you
haven't seen her so I'm not explaining
but if you haven't seen it apparently
it's worth multiple views you know as
with most Christopher Nolan's films yeah
you always want to go back and see a big
movie with some maker really big ideas
in it and a lot of people even when I
the theater there were some people
behind us for like I need I feel like I
need to watch that again like I need to
I could watch it again and think about
it and then come back other people's
conversations well they were just really
excited so here's the details of how
this is going to run by the way I love
the b-roll through this is what I looked
up I looked up people watching movies
and this was what I came up with a
fantastic b-roll I'm sorry if you're
listening you're missing some great
great old timey cinema so it's gonna be
available in a330 AMC Theatres so not
all of them and the prices are gonna
vary from $20 to $35 so move to a place
where there are not very many features
let's go people
you also have to be an AMC Stubbs member
so add the cost of $12 fun to that and
then if you've already seen it and your
Stubbs member you'll have to pay $15.99
to upgrade but you get to see it as many
times as you want
not in IMAX that also it comes to the
commemorative Pez that gives me an idea
for a hashtag of the day I think it's
gonna be a really good one you didn't
think about that before the show no I
just thought it up right now I magically
came up with this hashtag TD movie life
and we want to know what movie would you
buy a lifetime pass to see over and over
again in theaters meaning that if you
had if you went to a theater they would
have to load it up no matter when you
say listen I want to watch this movie
and they would have to put it they would
have to load it up in the projector
regardless of whether it was playing or
not in theaters okay right they'd have
to load it up for you all right you go
first this time I feel like the movie
that I would watch over and over and
over again oh there's so many
oh so many that I watch over and over
again but I feel like I would watch oh
my god I have like a little handful of
movies that I would watch over and over
again I'll let you pick two you helped
me pick two what'd you pick two but he
has to come quick because people are
sitting here listen are sitting here
being bored okay I'm being really I'm
being extremely fast with this I would
watch die hard over and over again okay
good choice
there's die hard over and over again is
a good action movie and then I would
watch what's another what's another
great film I
momento over and over and over oh man
yeah pretty good you could get them a
plant in Reverse - yeah baby
that would be my second play backwards
mine will be Jurassic Park of course
yeah that'd be great and just a movie of
Pizza
coming out of an oven and I want to say
this is gonna sound weird but the room
oh that's a good tummy was those the
listen that's a great camp that's a
that's a cult following thing because
that one I feel like I could take other
people to go and see it in theaters yeah
I have to wait because they have made
what is that if you haven't seen the
room and you enjoy bad movies if you
understand that sort of logic it's a
terrible you shouldn't you should watch
that one yeah but yeah that would be
cool to be able to just go to the
theater yeah see the room and it's like
I probably like put in the room yeah
they're like oh all right so tell us
which movie movie or - movies I'm gonna
break water - Marshall sometimes is hard
so which two movies you'd you would pay
to go see lifetime pass oh my god that'd
be amazing so there you go interstellar
I think I'd switch out diehard for The
Avengers because it's a really good
action movie or like yeah I'm it's a way
I like if I wanted a good action movie I
might change that all right I know it
might change okay so uh I always like
nano art I was like looking at like
these crazy sort of nano sculpture type
things that people scientists come up
with and there's a sculptor out there
who caught my eye
his name is John T Hurwitz jaunty jaunty
hmm he created a series of sculptures
that can only be seen with an electron
microscope and there are some really
insane images so here's here's one of
them so that's it look you see this
arrow its theis on the head oven yeah
it's on I of a needle it's so tiny these
sculptures could fit on the forehead of
an ant that's how small they are that's
how small they are the detail is so
impressive because they've been created
from 3d scans of people and statues so
there's a one of that's a person that
was scanned and then the other one with
two people is actually a sculpture in
real life a very large life-size
sculpture that was scanned and they
range in size
from less than half the width of a human
hair to about the width of a human hair
that's that's there yes this is very and
not-safe-for-work
well no it sit for the exams yes for the
art female bodies female sorry yeah
everybody's got one but it's really
amazing it's printed with photosensitive
material they take all these pages and
there's so many cameras that they're
able to capture really detailed images
of these people but blur his face out
well he may be he is he was he didn't
wanna be on camera okay so okay so then
and then what they do is they use this
technique called multiphoton lithography
and that creates fine details in the
sculptures and then they make them in
their kitty bitty tiny and you said 3d
printers
well they so they print yeah they 3d
print out on this photosensitive
material like it's it's 3d printed on
this material and then they use that
that technique see this is the one with
the sculpture with like this so they are
able to do that and like get all these
crazy details very very small obviously
I mean it's so soda and then they go and
they like put it on a hair so you have
okay so where are they now
well so this guy is he's got a whole
series of these you can go over to his
website you can check them out I feel
like takes pictures of them I I would
imagine they're probably pretty easy to
lose cuz you know I lose my car keys and
they're like way bigger than half the
width of a human hair right and you
could sneeze so he probably yeah I was
gonna say like a little gust of wind
like if the guy farts like they're just
it's over oh yeah they're just they're
gone sorry sorry everybody can have to
look for him it's like Honey I Shrunk
the Kids look inside your Cheerios even
then does a huge compared to these like
sculptures that's that's pretty cool so
you said you like you like Nano or is
there a lot more of that well there's a
lot of stuff like this where you see
people who will like carve the tip of a
pencil into something or you'll see it
like I really like yeah yeah like I
really like this sort of idea that
people are working it like it's so
detailed and it's so there's so much
skill that would go into this and
obviously so much education and
learning like I just really like that
concept yeah that's totally cool I'd
love to see it yeah but I can but you
can't not with your own eyes we'll have
to buy an electron microscope can we tax
write that off yeah but let's say hey
Japan call us let's take a break and
find out if we can write off an electron
microscope
let's take 30 seconds we'll be right

but yeah got the outside world but yeah
it looks it looks fantastic now we just
wait for the PC release very very trail
and then of course Dragon Age
Inquisition yes which is getting amazing
reviews yes I've been hearing nothing
but great things
I wasn't a fan of the second one but you
played the first one I did and I loved
the origins is fantastic second one they
kind of phoned it in a little bit but
I'm hearing this one they totally not
the case this is a really expansive
beautiful game lots of options lots of
great story lots of great everything so
that's what I've heard I can't I can't
speak from first-person experience but
that's what I'm hearing I'm very curious
to see how many people because there's a
lot of games out right now yeah I am a
little worried about Dragon Age I don't
know
when do you play it how do you choose I
don't know halo you tell us okay so okay
okay so and then in theaters if you're
looking for a little a little respite
from your gaming if you want to get
outside and then go back inside you want
to go see Hunger Games Mockingjay part 1

Jennifer Lawrence yeah Jayla super super
hero Jennifer Lawrence
you have Julianne Moore you've got Lee
Chris Hemsworth little brother Liam you
had Thor's little brother in this movie
so obviously part one part yeah Peeta
literally gets a paper cut and bleeds to
death and every single like I feel like
he just literally just always getting
hurt like it's really there's a lot of
little girls that are watching the short
who are upset with yeah team gale yeah
team gale and then also lastly and maybe
my favorite goat simulator is getting an
MMO expansion screw Super Smash Brothers
get it go play go go Jay you guys have
to see this video it is the most
ridiculous thing I've ever seen I think
yeah coffee stain studios announced I
believe earlier this week or late last
week that they were adding a module to
their goat simulator game which was fun
enough but now they're they're making an
MMO and there are different classes
including so there's like warrior mage
like things like that and also microwave
is a classic microwave clock you can
literally be a pair of legs under a
microwave that that is that is a thing
that you can be and go simulator MMO
let's think now and this is a patch it's
not even really like you don't have to
pay extra right like eight bucks or so
go get it
yeah it's PC check it out looks so good
but those are your new releases that we
were excited about this week which means
that
not enough for you it's it never is
enough the world is never enough worlds
never enough uh but that's it for new
releases which means this time for your
user feedback guys we asked you to use
the hashtag TV uber spot to tell us what
playlist you'd play and who you would
ride with musician and you guys had some
good you guys had some very good
suggestions Tony wrote to us and said I
would have country play I would have a
country playlist and I would like to

then Rick says I need my ride to be
thrilling
so Daniel Craig and Skyfall by Adele
this this I like yeah he's already he's
playing a fantasy it's a whole like
alternate realities you're Daniel
Craig's love interest in this rides
which means I mean or for the better I
don't know you're pretty much a redshirt
when you're Daniel Craig's love is yours
when you're James Bond's love interest
or the red shirt that's your job Matt
wrote to us and said willie nelson
greatest hits and wouldn't mind a ride
along with George Strait Oh Brad that's
a that's a country lovin man right there
after it and then the last one it was
from raw dead fish on Twitter and he
says I'd hop in an uber town car with
Joey Ramone and crank Beastie Boys no
sleep till Brooklyn so I should how's
that you were going to Brooklyn yeah in
the car which would be even better long
ride real expensive well here from here
would be a long ride but maybe you live
in like maybe live in the borough's
maybe you live in Queens and then it may
be not so much of a not so bad but that
is that is what you guys wrote and that
brings us to our very last piece of user
feedback our phone tahg refer the day

didn't say but I think it looks lovely
it does it looks great I'm just very
yeah contrast great it's really neat I
just I thought that was really creative
it's a really creative way why does it
say let me attend 20 / iPhone so he used
a 1020 to take the picture but then used
an iPhone 6 to edit it so maybe a little
clean up full contrast but very good
you're a very good viewer yeah Kel loves
