autopilot and and bring it bring its
market faster than originally
anticipated it consists of four parts
the first part is the long-range radar
which you can see through basically
anything and then the next element is a
camera with the image recognition so
it's able to read stop signs distinguish
pedestrians look at traffic lights and
and also serve as a backup system to the
radar the third system is 360 degree a
long-range ultra sonic sonar so this
this this basically establishes a
protective cocoon around the vehicle and
it will attempt to make whatever the
sort of smart move is from a safety
standpoint looking at the ultrasonics
and then the final element is
integrating that with the navigation and
to basically GPS system and real-time
traffic so we integrate those four
systems and the car can do almost
anything but it is at this stage still
what we call autopilot as opposed to
what autonomous so that even though the
cars are capable of being autonomous the
the level of safety and redundancy is
not quite there for full autonomy so
it's not at the level where you could
safely fall asleep and arrive at your
destination okay because that may be
what you wearing so we're able to
obviously do lane keeping on freeways do
automatic cruise control active
emergency braking so that it'll break if
it sees any object that you're going to
collide with little self park so you'll
be automatic parallel parking
automatically going to a garage in fact
it would when you'll get home you
actually be able to just step out of the
car and have it park itself in your
garage including it'll it'll open the
door and it'll go in and park itself you
can actually some the Cardinal the car
will come to wherever you are and it'll
it'll it'll use the ultrasonic sense is
kind of like a insect antenna because it
can it can detect even small soft
objects with the the ultras with
with the ultrasonics and and just it'll
sort of slowly make its way to you and
then it stopped and be ready to go it
can actually go even a step beyond that
which is if you have if you have your
calendar turned on it'll it'll meet you
there okay and so if you if you're
getting ready to go to work something
and it knows so you're going to need to
leave half an hour before work you can
say okay I'd like it to just come out
and have the air conditioning done and
everything done your music playing
everything's just ready to go and we'll
just come in and be there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
