here with the Plantronics backbeat pro 2
the next generation of the company's
over-ear wireless headphone with active
noise-cancelling the original backbeat
pro was a good headphone for the money
but it was a little bulky and just
didn't look all that slick well with
this new model Plantronics to slim the
headphone down by about 35% and it's now
much more attractive headphone than the
original but still costs $200 it also
sounds really good for a bluetooth
headphone with relatively clean
well-balanced sound that rivals the
sound from higher priced models from
Bose and Sony the headphones comfortable
to and has sensors that pause and resume
your music when you take off or put on
the headphones and while the noise
canceling isn't as effective as boses it
does a decent job muffling ambient noise
without creating an audible hiss control
buttons including a ring for adjusting
the volume levels are in the left ear
cup on with a button that you can switch
on to activate an open microphone mode
that allows ambient noise into the
headphone and lets you hear your
surroundings better as you might expect
from a Plantronics product the
headphones is designed to take and
receive calls and works very well as a
headset with a side tone feature that
lets you hear your voice in the
headphones as you talk battery life for
music playback is rated at a healthy 24
hours at moderate volume levels with the
included cable you can use this as a
wired headphone and a nice cloth
carrying cases included Plantronics also
makes a special edition model that cost
$50 more and includes a hard carrying
case and NFC tap tap air technology for
devices that support it all in all this
is a significantly better headphone than
the original backbeat pro and an
excellent alternative for those who
don't want to spend 350 or 400 on
full-size noise canceling wireless
headphones from bose Sony or Sennheiser
I'm David Carr for cnet.com and that's
the Plantronics backbeat pro 2 thanks
for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
