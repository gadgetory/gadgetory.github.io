delaying buying an iPhone possibly
because of anticipation building over
future phones like the tenth anniversary
iPhone expected in the fall that could
explain why the number of iPhones sold
in the second fiscal quarter were below
last year's sales Cook made the comments
during a call about the company's latest
earnings report which included sales of
products like the new nine point seven
inch iPad pro and product red iPhones
even though Apple sold 50 point eight
million iPhones and reported revenue of
52 point nine billion dollars the
company fell short of analysts estimates
it's also only the fourth time ever that
iPhone sales have fallen but the focus
has already shifted from the iPhone 7
and 7 plus to the iPhone 8 or whatever
the new iPhone is going to be called
Apple generates 2/3 of its revenue from
the iPhone so the pressure is on for it
to Wow with a possible redesign the new
iPhone could include a brighter oled
screen swing down frame around the
display and while it's charging some
features its main competitors already
have Apple didn't break out numbers for
other devices like the Apple watch or
the air pods but Cook said if you
combine sales of both with the beats
line revenue in the last four quarters
is the size of a fortune 500 company and
if you want to know how much cash Apple
has in the bank two hundred and fifty
six point eight billion dollars now
that's got to buy a lot of iPhones</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
