entirely and now we get our first look
at the new Samsung Galaxy Note seven
which has a stylus this s-pen here is
the thing that makes the note a note
without it it's just a reworked s7 edge
because of those slightly curved sides
and all those edge menus but pop out
that stylus and you can navigate around
the phone draw and write pretty much
everywhere
one thing that's new is one single app
for all of your chatting which is really
convenient you can also write a memo
when the screen is off and pin it the
phone's always on display if you're
traveling around a new translation
shortcut can help you by lunch and if
you're jealous of everyone else's video
clips online you can use the s-pen to
make a gift from a video all on your own
but the phone isn't only about the pen a
new iris scanning option means that you
can unlock the phone with your eyes or
even unlock parts of the phone like the
contents of this new private folder or
you can put notes and photos like for
example a picture of your passport you
can even add entire apps that are for
your eyes only
the note builds on top of the s7 and s7
edge which means that you're getting the
same Android software processor and
cameras as those phones and it's
water-resistant too but you can now
swipe inside the camera app to pull up
filters at modes we even switch between
cameras Samsung has also tweaked the way
that the software looks on the screen
which is a refreshing change here's
another one this is the first Samsung
phone with the USBC charging port which
is the new hotness and charging that
port is the sole reason why Samsung made
a new gear VR headset which has
exchangeable parts so it will work with
the new note 7 and with earlier phones
that use the micro USB port the note 7
is an attractive solid and actually a
rather compact phone despite its big 5.7
inch screen and just check out these
colors I mean check out that coral blue
expect the new note 7 to sell this
summer at the top of the price scale</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
