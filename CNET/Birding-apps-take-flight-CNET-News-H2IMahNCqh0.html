and I'm on the hunt for this a great
horned owl I got it in Northern
California along with these American
avocets I shot this video with the help
of some seriously expensive photography
equipment but apps running on ordinary
phones are really helping to bring
birding into the digital age all right
so let's look at the white pin tool see
if this looks like the female it's got
the right shape beak right colors
according to the US Fish and Wildlife
Service there are 47 million birders
that's short for bird watchers in the
United States I'm one of them I'm not
nearly as hardcore as some but I've been
burning since I was a kid the biggest
change has been an explosion of new apps
in the past few years one app I like
Merlin asks a few simple questions to
help you ID your bird
it's very easy it's like a five-step
process you start start bird ID and then
says okay where are you what time you
saw the bird how big the bird was we'll
say it was crow sized here what were its
colors well that cormorant was pretty
black so we'll go with black where was
it it was in the trees and then it'll
generate a list of possible Birds and
there it is so there's the
double-crested cormorant and if you want
to test it you can play the calls it's
really handy playing audio of bird calls
is something no bird book can do that's
a huge help for identifying birds you
often can't see hiding in the bushes so
here's the belted kingfishers and it's
easier to download an app than to buy a
bird book and remember to bring it with
you I have bird books but I fairly
quickly started using apps and I found
one in particular the Audubon Birds app
that I really like I don't carry a book
anymore no thanks to the apps which apps
do you use I have the Sibley in the
National Geographic in the u.s. serious
birders blocked every year to Ohio for
what's called the biggest week in
American burdened I went this year I
came here for one reason
a little bird called the Warbler each
year in May thousands of these birds fly
north on their migratory route to Canada
but they stop right here at Magee marsh
because they're freaked out about the
idea of crossing over Lake Erie which is
about a hundred yards behind me
I only got a handful of decent Warbler
photos but I did run into Noah Stricker
he's a professional birder who set a
record in 2015 so I ended up going to 41
different countries for 365 straight
days and saw more than 6,000 species of
birds how many species of birds are
there there's about 10,500 recognized
species in the world
Stricker kept track of his sightings
with eBird an app that taps into an
online service used by thousands of
birders do you keep track of the birds
that you see and then you submit your
sightings either through the website or
through a phone app which is mostly how
I use it now and that all goes into one
big database you can also look at the
data and see what birds have been seen
in other places and by who and when
while the tech may be changing this
popular hobby
Stricker fears a bit for the future the
day that we invent a pair of binoculars
that just automatically identifies a
bird for you I think that's gonna be the
end of birding as we know it just
because it's too easy the throw the
challenge of finding birds and
identifying them after all instant
gratification is not what birding is all
about the fun is in the chase so until
the apps take over I'm staying on the
hunt
