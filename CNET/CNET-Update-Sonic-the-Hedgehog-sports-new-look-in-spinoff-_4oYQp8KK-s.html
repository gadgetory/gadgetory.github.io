and Sonic has a new look I'm Bridget
Carey and this is your cnet update
lawmakers in California are pushing for
a new law that requires all smartphones
and tablets sold in the state to have
software that would completely disable
the device if it's stolen it's what many
call a kill switch regulators are doing
this to crack down on the growing number
of stolen smartphones because if the
device cannot be used when it's stolen
well there's less motivation for thieves
carriers say they are reluctant to
provide kill switch software because it
could be abused by hackers critics say
carriers don't want to put a kill switch
on because they'll make less money on
insurance plans we'll hear more about
this bill when the hearings begin in the
spring amazon has integrated a new
product scanning feature into its main
iOS app you could always scan from
barcodes to see the price of something
on amazon but now the app can use the
iPhone camera to scan what the product
looks like and then it pulls up the
product on Amazon for you to quickly
purchase it with the tap of a button
this technology is called flow it used
to be a separate app but now Amazon
folded it into the search tool of its
main iphone app amazon wants to make it
easy for you to quickly restock your
kitchen cupboard by just pointing your
camera at the products but right now
it's more of a cool tool than a useful
one because many household products are
usually sold in bulk when you do this on
the app I don't think many folks would
want to buy a hundred and forty six
dollars worth of tissues there's
something different about Sonic the
Hedgehog and his friends Sega has
redesigned the blue hero to go along
with a new video game and cartoon series
airing on cartoon network both called
sonic boom and there's a toy line to go
with it not only did sonic just get
taller but he's sporting a scarf and
bandages like a lot of bandages bandages
on his hands and his ankles bandages all
over the place does he sprained easily
in this new universe but the most
drastic change is with his friend
knuckles who was the same size as Sonic
and he went from this to this
I think knuckles has been taking
performance-enhancing supplements but
you know what back to sonic boom here's
a look at the game trailer Sega released
Saiga is hoping the blending of a CGI TV
cartoon series that shares the same
narrative and style as the new games for
the wii u and nintendo 3ds will spark a
whole new generation to get into the
sauna craze that's your tech news update
but you can find more details at cnet
