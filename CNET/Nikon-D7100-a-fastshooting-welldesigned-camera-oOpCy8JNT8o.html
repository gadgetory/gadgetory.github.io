d7000 doesn't stand out from the crowd
as much as it probably should for the
money don't get me wrong the d70 100 is
an excellent camera but with missing
capabilities and an excellent but not
class-leading image quality it's not a
no-brainer buy especially over the
cheaper d50 200 while there are a few
control layout changes overall the d70
100 has the same look and feel as the
d7000 including the nice grip and a
solid build quality the new model is of
sturdier construction it's composed of
magnesium alloy and it's weather sealed
much like the d300s overall it remains a
well-designed camera with a fluid
shooting design general highlights
include dual SD card slots stereo mic a
lockable mode dial and increased access
to settings without having to jump into
the menus but there's one facepalm
worthy low-light no aperture control in
video mode while the viewfinder is
effectively the same as the d7000 the
readout now uses an OLED display for
higher contrast text there's also an
overlay on the bottom inside which
depicts off level tilts to the left or
to the right
unfortunately because it's overlaid on
the scene rather than in the display
area it's hard to see against a dark
subject or in dim light nikon has also
added a useful spot white balance
feature which is available only in Live
View mode it operates by letting you
select a white point in the scene to set
the white balance with one click other
tweaked features include a two-shot
tripod free automatic HDR feature which
works well for bringing out mid-tones
and shadows in low-light exposures the
cameras fast with zippy phase detection
autofocus and faster contrast AF than
the d7000 and it delivers a
class-leading tested frame rate of 6.3
frames per second for an unlimited
number of JPEGs I do wish the raw buffer
were deeper than 6 shots though the
image quality is still good with some
extra sharpness thanks to the lack of an
anti-aliasing filter on the sensor but
it's not
gee-whiz Wow better than the cheaper d50
200 which uses a different sensor the
d70 100 s advantage over its lower-cost
sibling isn't about photo quality
it's speed and build quality but for her
a lot of folks the G 5200 is fast enough
and you're better off putting the money
you save towards a really good lens if
you don't need the extra speed or
whether sealing the d70 100 is a great
camera for still photography but doesn't
feel like a must-have upgrade unless
you've got a significant investment in
good nikon mount lenses and need speed
and durability on a budget right now I'm
Laurie Brennan and this is the Nikon d70
100</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
