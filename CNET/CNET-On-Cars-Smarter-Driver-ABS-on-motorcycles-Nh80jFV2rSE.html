you go faster so learning about ABS at
the Marin speed shop makes sense ABS
anti-lock brakes have been universal on
cars i mean literally since the 2012
model year but turns out motorcycles are
picking up the technology at a very
rapid pace now ABS on a bike works very
similarly to the way it works on a car
let's look at the apparatus this ring
right here with these holes punched in
it is rotating with the wheel obviously
and this little detector back here is
looking for a very smooth rhythmic
passing of those holes if that changes
that is telling the abs pump and
computer that it detects some stutter
when there's a skid then the pump begins
to modulate pressure up here to the
caliper the whole idea is to back off a
little bit in little micro slices until
you've got traction again and then put
the pressure back on in those respects
ABS is very similar to the way it is on
cars where it differs a lot is in the
ways you can set it up as a writer for
that matter the fact you can set it up
at all settings like these let you grab
preset driving modes with varying levels
of abs or you can dial that in
specifically from level 3 all the way
down to off and remember bikes differ
from cars in that they have two discrete
brake systems one for each wheel okay
some numbers our partners at State Farm
tell us the research indicates up to
thirty one percent fewer fatalities on
bikes that have abs highway lost data
institute says up to twenty three
percent fewer collision claims from
those machines
now but the best numbers i can find
indicate that around a hundred models of
motorcycles industry-wide have a BS
standard or optional but here's an
interesting trend look at this ducati
1199 2012 that bike had ABS optional
2013 it's now standard and on bikes
where ABS is a discrete option expect to
pay somewhere close to or at a thousand
dollars the highway lost data institute
and the Insurance Institute for Highway
Safety have petitioned Nitsa the
National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration to require a new rule
that says every new bike sold in the US
has to have abs soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
