for CNN I'm here at CES 2012 in Las
Vegas and today I'm taking a first look
at the LG spectrum for verizon this is
one of their new 4g LTE phone and it's
pretty impressive it's got a 1.2
gigahertz dual-core processor running
the show it also has android 2.3
gingerbread is the operating system it
will be upgradable eventually to Android
Ice Cream Sandwich as for the phone
itself it has a 4.5 inch HD display it's
very bright it's very colorful and one
of the benefits of HD is that if you
zoom in on a picture it will still look
good it has an 8 megapixel camera on the
back a 1.3 megapixel camera on the front
and there is support for hdmi out so you
can watch videos with look at pictures
on your TV from the phone itself there's
also support for 1080p HD video capture
on the camera and videos will play back
in 720p HD now HD is definitely thematic
on this phone because you also have the
debut of two apps that take advantage of
HD specifically the first is ESPN Sports
Center that's definitely going to bring
up all of the videos by default in HD
for and of course it's supported by LTE
so this video should load much more
quickly there's also netflix HD which
will do the same pulling up HD videos if
they exist and showing you those first
now if this phone is looking pretty good
to you you can pick it up on January
nineteenth for 199 dollars and
ninety-nine cents that is with a new
two-year service agreement I'm Jessica
Delacourt you're watching CNN and this
is the LG spectrum for verizon
