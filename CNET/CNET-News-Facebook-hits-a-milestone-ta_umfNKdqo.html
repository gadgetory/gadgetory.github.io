dorm room with Mark Zuckerberg and a few
friends has grown into this the largest
social network in the world
headquartered on a sprawling Silicon
Valley campus employing 6,000 plus
people and connecting 1.2 3 billion
users worldwide despite a shaky 2012
initial public offering the stock is now
trading around sixty dollars put in the
estimated net worth of 29 year-old CEO
Mark Zuckerberg around 30 billion
dollars not bad for a college dropout
whose story was made into an
award-winning movie people want to go on
the internet check out their friends the
company has succeeded where competitors
like friendster in myspace failed they
were not afraid to just kind of rip
everything out and rebuild you know they
did that a bunch of times with these
radical redesigns but constant facelifts
for facebook may not be enough to retain
younger users who are increasingly
turning to other social media sites
according to a new I strategy lab study
there are three million fewer teens on
Facebook than there was in 2011 not as
big a deal as it used to be mostly on
Instagram and snapchat and stuff like
that Facebook's 1 billion dollar
purchase of Instagram in 2012 hinted
where the company is heading in the
coming years the focus will be heavily
on mobile including the creation of
stand-alone apps like the new paper app
the idea is to give the user an
experience that they wouldn't maybe even
think of as Facebook this is an original
Harvard Facebook made of real paper it's
filled with students photographs names
of high schools and home addresses it
was also the inspiration behind Mark
Zuckerberg multi-billion dollar website
one that he presumably hopes to attract
a billion more faces in the next decade
