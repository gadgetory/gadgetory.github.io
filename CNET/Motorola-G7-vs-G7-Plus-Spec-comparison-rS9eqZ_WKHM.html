phones but they're all called the g7 so
to help you work out the differences
we're comparing two of the big ones the
g7 and the g7 plus the first thing
you'll need to know is that the g7 Plus
won't be available in the US here's the
breakdown of the specs both feature the
same overall rounded design with a small
notch for the front-facing camera the g7
plus is a tiny bit thicker than the g7
and weighs a few grams more but not
enough to notice when you're holding
them both have a headphone jack these
phones are water repellent not
water-resistant this means they're only
designed to withstand light splashes or
accidental spills rather than being
dunked in water and if you like colors
you'll want the deep indigo or red
options on the g7 plus rather than the
white or black finish of the g7 inside
the g7 uses a Snapdragon 632 processor
while the g7 plus uses a Snapdragon 636
both share the same 64 gigabytes of
storage microSD support and have four
gigabytes of RAM they run Android nine
pi and the 6.2 inch full HD display is
the same as well at 403 PPI coated in
Gorilla Glass but if you want stereo
speakers that's only on the g7 Plus and
it's also the only one with the newer
Bluetooth 5.0 onboard moving to the
camera both have two lenses at the back
with one being a 5 megapixel sensor used
for capturing depth information the g7
has a 12 megapixel main sensor with a
maximum aperture of f-18 the g7 Plus
looks like it will be more interesting
for photographers it ups the resolution
on its main rear camera to 16 megapixels
with an F 1.7 maximum aperture it adds
optical image stabilization for less
shaky shots and it has a dual LED flash
around the front the selfie cameras are
also different 8 megapixels on the g7
and 12 on the g7 plus that said they all
have the same software features like
portrait mode and HDR
both share the same 3000 milliamp hour
battery which Motorola says should last
you all day when you want to charge them
up the g7 is compatible with a 15 watt
turbo power fast charger which will get
you around 9 hours of use in just 15
minutes
but the g7 plus works with a 27 watch
charger that gives you 3 hours more use
for the same 15 minute charge plus it's
compatible with Qualcomm snoo a quick
charge for technology so while they look
the same on the outside there are a few
key differences between the two main g7
phones to find out if they actually make
a difference in the real world stay
tuned to CNET for the full review</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
