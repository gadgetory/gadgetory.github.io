holy crap did you see that she was dad
yeah I see all of course you don't see
it
the knot
what's good Bryant on here and welcome
to the Apple buy for everything good and
bad inside the world of Apple and yes
that affinity board trailer is via
especially without a notch and don't get
all mad about that come on lighten up
we're just messing with you all right
this week it's lots of software news and
it's important apple just released a mac
OS high sierra security update to fix
the reported root password vulnerability
now only high sierra users are affected
so get on this ASAP after developer
limit or gonna discover the bug that
would allow anyone to type in root as
the username and leave the password
blank to get access to pretty much every
file on your Mac including your personal
collection of dig pics like this one now
the fixes out so just do it see they
turn a bad apple into a few Apple so I
guess we could just call it a fap --all
now it looks like there's another
autocorrect error in iOS 11 and later
after hundreds of users have been
complaining when they type in the word
it the iPhone an auto corrects that to
capital i dot t-- for reals come on
Apple get your it together now a video
online is showing the same thing
happening when someone is typing the
word is that auto corrects is to I dot s
another one huh you know that's a bad
apple and we're still waiting to see if
and when a fix will be rolled out now
app will also release v beta of iOS
eleven point two to developers and
public beta testers we've talked about
the increased wireless charging speed
for the iPhone 10 eight and eight plus
and Apple pay cash being the two big
things here but I didn't realize I
missed this one eleven point two will
also add a small bar underneath the
icons on the upper right side of the
device on the lock screen to make the
location of Control Center more clear so
your lockscreen will have a bar at the
bottom and the top right hand corner
like holy crap our Apple users really
that dumb that we need this you know
what I don't actually want the answer to
that because I'll just read the comments
and curl up into a tiny ball while
crying instead
okay in happier news the new sports
section in Apple TV's app on iOS and the
Apple TV is appearing on devices running
early previews of iOS 11.2 and TV OS
11.2 it was showing off in September and
right now ESPN is the only app it's
integrated with that will offer
suggestions to watch live sports games
additional sports based apps will most
likely be added in the future and guess
what that's a good Apple
and maybe this is even gooder to you
Apple recently filed a patent
application for a foldable display to
stir up the long-standing rumors that
Apple has been working with LG on a
foldable iPhone playing catch-up after
reports that Samsung is already working
on their own galaxy X or 10 they'll call
it the X the right way they're working
on their own folding phone that will be
ready sometime in 2018
now Apple's patent describes a display
that can be opened and closed like a
book and it's the first patent that
lists the new thinner micro LED
technology display as one of the main
types for this foldable phone the patent
also calls out liquid metal being used
in the structure of this phone as well
all right Black Friday and Cyber Monday
sales were huge like I saw some killer
deals on iPad pros and Mac books
analysts from rosenblatt report that 6
million iPhone tens were sold over the
weekend with the 256 gig model being
twice as popular as the 64 gig model
just like Apple wanted us to do now
according to Adobe data Cyber Monday was
the largest online sales day in history
with a record 6.5 billion dollars spent
that day that's a 16.8 increase compared
to 2016
now Adobe said the best selling
electronics on that day included the air
pods and Apple's iPads but no other
Apple products were on that list but one
of the best selling products overall
Apple's air pause but you know what
think about it there weren't too many
killer deals for them out there so
people were just buying them straight up
that's right you'll be seeing a whole
lot more of this this and this can't
wait for the future and the future of
the Mac hey it might involve using hand
gestures Apple was granted a patent
originally filed in August
2016 describing a method where users
would be able to control a Mac computer
and potentially other devices using a
non tactile three-dimensional user
interface remember Apple acquired
primeSense the team behind Microsoft's
Kinect way back in 2013 and some of
prime senses tech now lives in the front
facing true depth camera of the iPhone
10 the tech is expected to come to the
next gen ipad pro's and other future
Apple devices now this patent describes
a variety of gestures like a push or a
waiver or up basically turning you into
an Apple Jedi where you could swipe up
to unlock your machine or do other more
complex gestures again these might not
make it into the Apple products anytime
soon but it's a peek into what we could
see and am I able to go off the rails a
little bit here like have you seen that
new Apple commercial of the girl that
looks like barb and stranger things
using the iPad everywhere including a
quick shot of her using it up in a tree
come on like who uses an iPad up in a
tree now that's before our nice neighbor
asked about for a computer and
too-cool-for-school barb says what
you're doing on your computer what's a
computer yeah I'm sorry
no more about apples here that's just
straight embarrassing all right that's
gonna do it for this week's show you can
email me at the Alpha bite at cnet.com
or tweet me at Brian Tom thanks much for
watching we'll catch you all next time
for another bite of the Apple
aren't you excited I'm hella I'm super
excited dude but but you missed half of
it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
