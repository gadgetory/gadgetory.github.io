search edit score with jellybeans we
took a hard look at search and
redesigned it from the ground up first a
new UI second faster and more natural
voice search and third a new feature
we're calling Google now let's start
with a new UI last month we introduced
the knowledge graph in Google search the
goal is for Google to understand that
the words are used when you're searching
are not just words but real things in
the real world in jellybean we're using
the power of the knowledge graph to show
you search results in a new richer way
for example if you want to know what
movies Angelina Jolie has starred in
we'll show you this card or if you ask
how much the earth ways you'll see an
answer like this if you're searching for
the weather in New York will show you a
card with the weekly forecast if you
want to find a nearby starbucks will
show you a card with a quick map of some
stores close to you and a shortcut to
take you to google maps now let's show
you what we've done with voice search
you know sometimes you'd rather just
speak your search query or ask a
question in jellybean voice search is
much faster it's also better
understanding natural language and it
speaks answers back to you using the
power of the knowledge graph let's go to
the device and show you this life
Randall why don't you show us a few more
examples you can talk okay I'm gonna ask
a few questions and Google will respond
who is the prime minister of japan the
Prime Minister of Japan is yoshihiko
noda
alright crush your boy we'll try another
one what is the definition of robot
robot a machine capable of carrying out
a complex series of actions
automatically it's pretty appropriate
okay try another how tall is the Space
Needle space needle is 600 4 feet tall
okay we'll give it one more try show me
pictures of pygmy marmosets
okay that's great now notice that if you
go back to the results if you swipe away
that card there's a wealth of additional
information from the web on pygmy
marmoset switch as I'm sure you know are
the smallest monkeys in the world Google
will always give you web search results
for all of your questions thanks Randall
let's go back to slides
now the third part of the new Android
search experience is called Google now
today's smartphones are powerful they
can do pretty much anything you ask
search the web give you directions
traffic info anything but smartphones
are only as smart as you tell them to be
they rely on you to do everything you
have to enter a search query you have
the type in a street address and you
have to ask for traffic in a particular
area but with google now that starts to
change google now gets you just the
right information at just the right time
and all of it happens automatically so
how do we do this if you choose to
google now uses things like your search
history your location history and your
calendar to figure out what information
you might need and win let's see a few
examples on slides traffic google now
figures out when you when you commute
from home to work and back it will then
tell you how long the commute on your
usual route is going to be and it'll
give you a faster route if there's a lot
of traffic next public transit when
you're near a bus stop or on a platform
at a subway station Google now tells you
when the next bus or train will arrive
places Google now we'll show you bars
restaurants and places of interest
around you as you walk down the street
and when you're in a restaurant trying
to figure out what to order Google now
will tell you what's what that
restaurant is best known for next
appointment when you have a calendar
event Google now will help you get there
on time for example if you normally take
the bus to get around Google now will
tell you when to leave based on how long
it will take you to walk to the bus stop
when the next bus arrives and how long
that bus right we'll take so we get
there on time
twice if you have an upcoming flight
that you've searched for google now
keeps you up to date on the status it
tells you which terminal to go to and it
updates you if there's a delay all
automatically sports Google now keeps
you updated on your favorite sports
teams in real time you'll see scores and
upcoming games and the best part is you
don't need to set up your favorite teams
you've already done that by searching
for them on google travel Google now
knows when you're traveling and if
you're traveling internationally Google
now will give you interactive cards for
currency conversion and translation it
also conveniently tells you what time it
is back home</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
