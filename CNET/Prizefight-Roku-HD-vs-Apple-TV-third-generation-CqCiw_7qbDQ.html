and we have another blood match grudge
match in a battle between two seenot
editors choice streaming media boxes is
a prize five put out between the Roku HD
and the Apple TV 3rd generation our
judges for this fight are executive
editor John Game of Thrones falcone
senior associate editor Matthew the Big
Show Muscovy AK and myself Hong Kong Tom
I will take each round score and avens
them out to the nearest tenth of a point
the final prize fights for the mean
average of all rounds is in the same
system let's get this party started
round one is designed the Roku HD is a
little shiny black box rounded corners a
purple accent edge and it has a fabric
tag that still belongs on a t-shirt now
the third generation Apple TV is a
little matte black box with rounded
corners near these guys will get in the
way and we're giving them both vibes
next round as interface and navigation
Roku HD keeps it simple utilitarian
interface with its single row navigation
setup is more of a pain requiring a
credit card it won't wow you visually
but it gets the job done and it's easy
to customize by adding channels for your
favorite content with a straight Ford
remote but the best part of its remote
is its quick access buttons dedicated to
Netflix Pandora and crackle to jump
directly into their apps now the Apple
TV's revamped interface is still the
clean and elegant experience that you
expect animations are smooth and its
interface feels really polish there's no
real customization here but its sleek
silver remote is easy to use as well the
Apple TV gets a 5 and the road
HD gets a 4 so after averaging 2 rounds
the big a lose by half a point round
three is features Roku has always
tripped down their products to the bare
bare essentials it connects to any TV
with HDMI for up to 720p output
there's composite video for analog TVs
as well there's 802 11 and Wi-Fi but no
airplay and if you're looking for more
you'll find it in its bigger Roku
brothers but just not here now the Apple
TV 3rd gen brings HDMI with up to 1080p
support and 802 11 and Wi-Fi but you'll
also have options for optical audio out
and an Ethernet port then you jump to
the software we're having an Apple
device pays off airplay support allows
you to play and display content directly
from your iOS devices and airplay
mirroring allows your Apple laptop or
computer screen to be mirrored onto your
TV with just one click if it's supported
and that's just huge now if you pay
$24.99 a year for iTunes Match you can
access your entire music collection and
if you use the iCloud you'll also be
able to view your photo stream plus
Windows machines and Mac's can share
their music collection through home
sharing and iTunes the Apple TV is
feature packed even if you have only a
few pieces of the ecosystem and Apple
takes this round with a 5 and the Roku
HD gets a 4 next round is content
you've heard the same content is king
and it holds true here bow streaming
boxes have access to Netflix and Hulu
Plus
but Roku shines with over 100 channels
of content like Amazon video on-demand
and HBO Go which cover your movies and
TV shows
there's Pandora for music discovery and
social services like Facebook and Flickr
have apps there's also on-demand sports
for the NHL and NBA and specific content
like our own CNN channel or the stuff
for the kiddies with the Disney Channel
really the Roku's media options are
endless and customizable now apples box
has access to content from itunes to
purchase TV shows and movies and they
have support for on-demand sports but we
are talking Apple TVs additional online
services like YouTube and Vimeo it's
pretty skimpy now the new loophole is
that you can actually play more content
through airplay mirroring if you have
the right Apple hardware but it's
limited to specific machines from mid
2011 and higher and that's just not a
big group the roku punches back with a
perfect 5 and the Apple TV gets a 4
after averaging 4 rounds
Apple still holds its lead by three
tenths of a point the final round that
decides it all is value the Roku HD is
an amazing deal at $59 that offers tons
of value 59 bucks guys that's all I have
to say now the Apple TV sticks with this
$99 price point and it might be more
than what you're looking for but it's
finally worth the price of admission
especially if all you do is eat apples
in the final round we're calling it even
at 5
so let's average out all five rounds
in a battle that really went back and
forth the Roku HD just came up a little
short and the Apple TV
finally the Thrones the champ in this
face-off four point eight to four point
six and is your prize fight winner
now you guys can't go wrong with two
seen at editors choice streaming boxes
and the Apple TV reign supreme today but
if you don't know any Apple products the
rogue who may still be the winner for
you
I'm Brian Tong thanks for watching and
thanks our sponsor eBay and we'll catch
you guys next time for another prize
