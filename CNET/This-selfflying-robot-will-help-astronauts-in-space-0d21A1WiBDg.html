International Space Station and it's
used as a research platform for Space
Exploration and living in space it's a
robot that can be used to study how to
program satellites to operate how to
program robots to interact with
astronauts so it can monitor different
things like radiation sound it's a
mobile camera platform that can go
anywhere inside a space station to
visualize what the astronauts are doing
or what different parts of space station
are doing and it can also support the
astronaut and doing procedures and
different types of a maintenance tasks
on Space Station it's very much like the
Roomba of space station to be as is is a
next-generation free flyer that builds
off of a current free flyer operating on
the space station called spheres spheres
was first built by MIT and as the origin
story goes there was an MIT professor
who challenged his senior design class
to build the same type of droid robot
that you see in Star Wars
Astra B's being designed to be a lot
more automated a lot more
self-sufficient so it's got a docking
station they can go recharge go back out
do what it needs to for hours at a time
and then go back
all without astronauts being around so I
can do these things all by itself so
what you see here is an air carriage
holding an Astra B prototype on the top
we have co2 cartridges here that send
out compressed co2 between the air
carriage and this table so that's a
little cushion of air that it floats on
top of and it can move anywhere on this
table with almost no friction you can
see the a touch screen there is the
intake for fans that keeps the circuits
inside cool different cameras on the top
that help it navigate where it is on the
space station this is where the
batteries plug in on the bottom and then
this whole area is open for other
hardware to plug into it and in the back
on the top is where the perching arm is
so this little arm can pop out and it's
got this little gripper that can grab on
to an handrail at the blue handrails
that are all over space station that
astronauts actually use to move around
as it turns out astronauts do spend a
lot of time repositioning cameras they
do spend a lot of time taking
measurements and samples all around
space station they do spend a lot of
time looking for things and trying to
find different things on Space Station
so these are all things that a robot can
do all by itself and save astronauts a
lot of time there are concepts of
sending spacecraft to the moon or to
Mars without astronauts so that it all
gets brought together and astronauts get
there later so we need robots there that
can maintain and do these things even
when astronauts aren't there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
