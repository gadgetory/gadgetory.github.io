Los Angeles at Microsoft's professional
developer conference where one of the
topics is internet explorer 9 with me as
d nakama vet who is the general manager
for an internet explorer so what's
Microsoft thinking as far as I a 9 well
today we gave developers a first look at
some of the progress that we're making
in high nine we showed three things in
particular we showed some progress on
performance we showed progress on
interoperable standards and we showed
hardware accelerated graphics and text
briefly on the performance front we
talked about all the different
subsystems that are in the browser and
how different sites have got different
profiles in terms of how they exercise
the browser and we were we were specific
around some of the progress we've made
on one of those sub systems particularly
JavaScript performance and that's an
area where Microsoft had come under some
criticism some of the other browsers had
been a little faster considerably faster
right and that's as I said one specific
subsystem we showed some progress you
can see some detailed charts and
commentaries at blogs msdn calm / ie
where we go into detail about the
performance progress we need we showed
some progress around interoperable
standards you can see that our asset
three test score has gone up in the
three weeks since windows 7 general
availability and more importantly you
can see how ie9 supports other standards
in richer way standards that that
developers rely on to build very rich
websites for example we showed some
improvements around selectors or we
showed improvements around rounded
corners and borders the thing that ena
and I spent the most time talking about
was actually the hardware accelerated
graphics and text and just to make sense
of what what's going on here we're
moving ie from sitting on top of GDI
which is the old graphics infrastructure
of Windows 22 moving and working on top
of Direct X and the powerful amazing
thing about Direct X is that it taps
into the hardware and so if you have a
great graphics card and a great GPU
DirectX let's Windows programs take
advantage of that
so what you see in ie9 what we
demonstrated and you can find links to
great videos is how directx gives much
clearer and smoother text in the browser
and how directx gives amazing graphics
rendering and performance inside of the
browser and we have a few examples here
and I really hope the flip video
captures it and if it doesn't I'll make
sure you get a link to the to the screen
captures so this is an example of text
so we're going to start down over here
and you'll see that as I increase the
letter spacing I go through you'll see
that it kind of chunks forward chunk by
chunk by chunk and that's using the
standard just using GDI and now I'm
going to do that again and I'm going to
do that with d2d and you'll see it's a
much smoother experience almost like
you'd expect out of an animated movie or
an xbox game let me give another example
of how text comes in here we are in GDI
and as the fonts animate in there's a
lot of left-right wiggle as it comes in
and it comes in at a pretty slow speed
when I do that again on top of d 2 d
it's a lot smoother and just for the
viewers I want to say it is a lot
smoother my hands still shaking just as
much so it might not be as obvious but
basically the idea here is that graphics
and text are much sharper and I think
give one more that you show with bing
maps where right you get a lot better
frame rate because of this yeah and so
let's let's go to the Bing Maps example
and I'm going to bring up a couple of
interesting tools here there we go here
is something that will show frame rate
you'll see frames per second there and
I'm going to start scrolling i'm going
to start panning this is just a plain
old ajax site you'll see i'm getting
about seven frames per second it will
vary between five and ten and when i
flip over in 2d 2d you'll see the frame
rate will go way up here to about 40 or
so typically eight we can get well over
60 frames a second and you'll also
notice it's not in the video right now
but down in the corner there's a cpu
meter down here and you'll see that the
cpu meter goes from being the cpu goes
from very high utilization
when using GDI to being just about
nothing under D to D so these are just
some of the early things we're seeing
with Internet Explorer 9 obviously it's
not ready you've just been working on a
short time it's early in the development
cycle we thought it was important to
show some of the progress we've made
with the development community there's a
blog detailing this and we're excited
for feedback and more conversation about
this thanks team thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
