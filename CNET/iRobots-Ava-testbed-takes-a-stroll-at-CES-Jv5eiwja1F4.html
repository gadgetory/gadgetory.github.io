telepresence robots called the ava and
Ava drives from an ipad control unit and
it's semi-autonomous you tell it where
to go and it goes right let's scratch
detect it can be also operating a fully
autonomous all right let's see this a
they call it a she lets the air take off
by eva if i click on a waypoint she's
gonna plan a path from where she is now
to the way paint that i clicked and she
will go there all bottom asleep if her
way gets blocked she'll automatically
reap lot a new path in an open this
ominous-looking guy walking up to the
robot here he was going to go around him
that's correct if he wants to go that
way so why don't we send her with air MC
see how she sort of sidestepping
obstacles because that's the most
efficient way
yes I will
next click on the way point and it
planned the path around the corner
and there she goes where she because
say goodbye to your prototype
you can see you my record talk long
let's bring in for a little bit close up
yeah
so ava has a ipad for a head and a bunch
of sensors here she's got the laser
rangefinder down there for obstacle
avoidance mood lighting I'm told if you
bump her apparently she changes colors
yeah all these little holes here for
various other sensors also touched rinse
it well may help sorry but that touch
were there
nothing happens I'm not aggressive
enough all right so ava is not a product
we buy right that's correct it's a test
bed so you're testing out what it's it
we're testing out navigation concepts
and high fidelity human-robot
interaction right on so maybe you've
seen this in a hospital near us soon uh
you never know all right bounced a
harder ship within touch shelter oh
right on okay so say goodbye Ava by you
but I</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
