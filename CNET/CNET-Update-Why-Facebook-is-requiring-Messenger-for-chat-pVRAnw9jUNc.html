Facebook apps are better than one I am
Bridget Carey and this is your scene
that updates in social media there is a
universal truth that we all could agree
on Facebook is annoying it's constantly
making drastic changes to its design and
privacy it's a hassle to keep up with it
all and they feel like you can't walk
away because everyone you know is on it
we don't want to feel cut off from
friends so that's why we put up with
Facebook's bad behavior well CEO Mark
Zuckerberg is at it again but this time
the change will be a bigger annoyance
and it could drive some people away in
the coming days you will no longer be
able to send private messages in the
main Facebook app if you want to ever
have a private chat with someone you'll
have to download a second app it's
called messenger Facebook has been
pushing this app for some time now but
it used to be optional for those of us
who didn't like jumping back and forth
between two apps Facebook is putting us
through this headache because it's
facing pressure to better compete with
chat apps Facebook buying whatsapp the
most popular private chat app was not
enough it has beefed up its own
messenger app and last week messenger
added the ability to make free Wi-Fi
calls to anyone on Facebook that's a
nice feature for folks who want to avoid
the high cost of international calling
last year the free Wi-Fi calling was for
Android only but now iOS devices can
join in and if you don't have Wi-Fi a
call on the app will use your 3G or 4G
data connection messenger may be
important to Facebook but Facebook has
not been very successful at making its
own secondary apps home for Android was
designed to take over your Android home
screen and that flopped there's also the
news centric app called paper but that
has not been a hit either
I don't need Facebook editors picking
what news I should be reading thanks but
no thanks so this just continues the
trend of Facebook wanting to take over
your phone with more apps let's move on
to news about an even bigger headache in
the last update I explained the serious
nature of the heartbleed bug that
impacted countless websites it's a
security flaw that could have
potentially
exposed your personal info your
passwords and your credit cards
to hackers for the past two years and
now everyone's patching it up so if you
want to be safe log out of all websites
and before logging back in check to see
if the site has been fixed CNET has a
list of the status for the top 100
websites but you should still do some
homework for the smaller services you
use like perhaps your community bank
website there are few tools to test a
website one is at SSL labs calm and if
the site is patched up then you should
change your password
that's your tech news update you can
head to cnet.com for more details from
our studios in New York I'm Bridget
