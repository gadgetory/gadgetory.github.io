Bridget Carey on sina com and it's time

of the PC thanks to strong ipad sales
apple shipped more computers and tablets
in the fourth quarter than any other pc
vendor Apple knocked hewlett-packard
from the top spot by a wide margin apple
sold 15 million iPads and five million
max and that makes up seventeen percent
of the total 120 million pcs shipped
globally in the fourth quarter and
that's not the only shake-up in that
time amazon shipped more than 5 million
kindle fire tablets so if you combine
kindle fires with other kindle e-readers
then amazon rivals traditional top PC
makers also an apple news the iphone
maker has snagged a new retail chief
from across the pond john browett the
CEO of European technology retailer
Dixon's is Apple's new head of retail
strategy and will start the job in April
the previous head of apple's retail Ron
Johnson left to become the CEO of JC
penney President Obama addressed online
piracy legislation in his first Google
Plus hangout session with voters Monday
the president didn't agree with the
contested SOPA and protect IP act but
said there should be a way to protect
Hollywood's interests without affecting
the fundamental integrity of the
Internet as an open transparent system
the Google+ Hangout allowed Obama to
have a multi-way video chat with five
people selected to join him and he also
answered a few questions that were
submitted through YouTube last week
about a hundred and thirty five thousand
questions were submitted in total the
president has added a few other tech
tools to his campaign he joined
Instagram a month ago and now his
campaign is using the mobile payment
tool Square to take donations Politico
reports that Obama staff field
organizers and volunteers will all be
given Square mobile credit card readers
so they can take donations through their
smartphones this will be the first time
a national campaign has used square
starting on april fifth t-mobile
customers will have limits on how much
data they can use while roaming hit the
limit and data is blocked until the
phone is back in range of the t-mobile
network or user can connect to Wi-Fi the
limits depend on the customers plan for
example the starting plan of 2 gigabytes
a month can only use 50 megabytes while
roaming outside the network and if
you're picking out a new cell phone plan
check to see if your bathroom is in
range of the network because 75 percent
of Americans with mobile phones say they
use them in the bathroom sixty-three
percent answer phone calls on the loo
forty-one percent make a call
sixty-seven percent read texts but men
do more work related calls in the John
than women and it's not just work many
said they also make an online purchase
