the iphone so the iphone has quickly
become a number one mobile device for
accident even the modest fire experience
is great we want to bring the best
possible mobile experience to our
customers so five weeks ago we decided
to create this application and the ease
of developing with the iphone sdk allow
us to rapidly integrate with ebay web
services so you can see here we're on
the home screen you've got easy access
to search we show the users personal
avatar and a summary of their activity
whether you're a buyer or a seller you
can easily see if you're winning or
losing and how much you've been selling
so let's search from the new Wii Fit
where the hottest selling items on ebay
and add it to our watch list these are
all lot of listings you're going to see
running on ebay production servers you
just touch on an item to bring up the
details you can see the picture all the
bid amounts and everything like that if
the buyer wants to see more information
we've also integrated WebKit into the
application so they can view the sellers
HTML description going back it's just
one easy touch to add this to our watch
list and if we go back to the home
screen let it refresh we now see we're
watching one additional item but we've
also been a bid on something just touch
there and it'll pop us over to my ebay
where we can get more details here are
the red and green bit amounts let us see
what we're winning or losing let's try
to win that item that we're currently
losing by placing a higher bid fittings
really easy just enter in your bid
amount confirm it and the bid is
instantly placed on our system the
confirmation screen slides in and hey it
looks like we're back in the lead
finally I'd like to take a look at one
last item on my watch list it's a 12 and
a half million dollar home in golf
course in Mexico
let's take a look at the photos to see
if it's really worth it so here the film
strip viewer allows us to see all of the
photos you can scroll through them we
can zoom in and out using the standard
touch controls to see more details looks
pretty nice but I don't think I'm going
to place a bid on it thats it for our
demo it's been a great experience
developing for the iphone the ebay app
will be available for free on the App
Store launches thank you and happy
bidding</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
