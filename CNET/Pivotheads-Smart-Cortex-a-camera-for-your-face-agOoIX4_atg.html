was pivothead this is the company
startup really that's making glasses has
a camera right in the center for you to
shoot photo video and possibly even
stream live events I'm just developer
Christina here at CES 2014 in Las Vegas
take a first look at the next generation
there are two different models the one
that I'm wearing now is called Colfax
there's another one called smoke same
thing it is a sunglass luckily I am a
contacts where these are not
prescription you're out of luck if you
are a glasses wearer now the second
generation has a camera that takes eight
megapixel photos 1080p HD video there
are sixteen gigabytes of flash in this
version suppose to the eight gigabytes
of flash over the previous version in
the Durango these camera classes are
very easy to operate there are two
buttons on the side one here in the
front to operate video you simply press
down to start video and you press down
again when you want to stop shooting
there's an LED indicator light on the
inside but I can barely make out my head
might be a little bit too small for me
if they are pretty big unless however of
course this is a prototype model so
later models might fit a little bit
differently to take a photo I simply
press the button in the back right by
playing the video button and that will
take a picture now there's no head-up
display on here so I'm not seeing
anything about what I'm taking unlike
Google laughs I can't see direction
there's no sensitivity and the arms here
so I'm not controlling anything
a camera and video one thing that is
really neat about it is that you can
flip off the ends of the device here and
you can attach these extra modules so
you'll have normal end caps this is by
the way where you also charge the device
using the micro USB port pivothead is
working on several different modules
that you can add on and one of them will
have Android in it so that developers
can create apps for example you want to
take a panoramic shot you'll just slide
on that module press a button turn your
head might get uploaded might get saved
to your file there's another one that
will extend battery life even triple it
every life on here on its own is pretty
small it's about 400 milli ampere hours
that will last you about one hour of
video this will ship around April for
IndieGoGo backers the whole kit and
caboodle including all of these modules
will run you about $650 if you are a
backer I'm tough developers Percy bet
you have to taking a look at the exhibit
of headers smart fold back camera glass</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
