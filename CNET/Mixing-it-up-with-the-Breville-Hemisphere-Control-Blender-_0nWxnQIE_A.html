standing next to the Breville hemisphere
control blender the reason it's called
the hemisphere control blender is
because of the shape of the base of the
pitcher which is rounded unlike
traditional blenders that have flat
bottoms where things can get stuck and
miss the blades and therefore not get
blended if you are like certain members
of my family and friends and only use
your blender as a margarita maker this
is probably not the machine for you as
it costs 199 dollars but if on the other
hand you're looking for a multitasking
blender that can replace other small
appliances in your kitchen and do pretty
much anything you need it to then the
Breville is actually a really wise
choice it was a top competitor and held
its own against $400 blenders like the
Vitamix and the Blendtec and the
identically priced ninja like other
blenders that have departed from the
glass pitcher the Breville is made of
bpa-free plastic so if you're concerned
about your plastics and how your family
accesses them and knowing that this is
bpa-free will give you a little extra
peace of mind and we all know how much
that's worth a lot like other blenders
we looked at the Breville has a lot of
really nice preset options that make
blending really fairly mindless activity
and they take all the guesswork out of
it they are thus no function for
crushing ice into a fine snow mixture
but there's mix blend liquify and pulse
I genuinely believe that this could
replace a food processor in a lot of
ways given how well it processed through
raw almonds and turn them into some
pretty delicious almond butter which
defied all of my expectations with $199
price sticker this isn't the blender for
everybody if you are looking for
something that can just do day to day
typical blending this is probably not
your best option as it's capable of
doing so much more and therefore you pay
for that but if you're looking for a
multitasking blender that can do a lot
and give you a lot of bang for your buck
then I would recommend the Breville
hemisphere control for seen at I'm Katie
