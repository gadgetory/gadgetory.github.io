take a walk with me to the Apple demo
room this is what it's like to exit to
Steve Jobs theater and actually go to
the demo rooms this is what we do every
year this year Apple design a couple of
new iPhones three of them I've thrown
10s iPhone 10s max - 10 are Apple watch
and we are in the holding area well
about to go in in a second and there's
also the Apple watch's big feature is
that it gets into Excel it gets into ECG
so I'm being held right now
so here we go I'm gonna walk over to one
of the tables and check out what we got
here is the Apple watch Series sport now
the big features here are the ability to
take ECGs electrocardiograms by
completing a circuit and being able to
measure that for more accurate heart
rate Apple watch series 4 also has let's
bezel around the display and a larger
display so you can see here there are
more complications thinner it's also got
a haptic digital crown this time and a
lot of the features really are about
heart rate and improve fitness tracking
through accelerometer and the gyroscope
battery life is really basically the
same with a little more on battery life
for workouts 6 hours but there was no
watch faced or announced although there
are new dynamic watch faces that Apple
is making and some new looks but if
you're looking to download some other
customized watch face there's some sort
of store you're out of luck the apps are
redesigned to it's interesting to see
how those will play out on Apple watch
as a 40 and a 44 millimeter watch this
time so that's Apple watch and we're
gonna look for the iPhone 10's the 10s
Max and the 10 are because I believer
right over here which everyone is
looking at
here's the news that
here's the tennis tennis match now if
you have last year's 10 I don't think
this is going to be an upgrade that
you're necessarily gonna want it jumping
up and down and that there's a lot about
better speed better camera functions
faster face ID battery life looks to be
pretty much the same you know it's it's
an S conference so you're looking at
faster things the max is gonna be the
one that's intriguing because if you
really like the plus and it's larger
display that might be the one for you
6.5 inches and basically the same specs
as the iPhone 10s but you're going to be
getting a bigger screen which means for
games or perhaps things like that that's
probably where you're gonna want to
if you get in here we're gonna see the
iPhone 10s but also the 10 are the 10
are doesn't come out until October the
10 are is more affordable
meaning 749 and up then it kinda looks
like a hybrid of the iPhone 8 and the
iPhone 10 I've got a glass back and if
you take a look here at the colors you
got coral yellow blue white and it still
has face ID it's a fast pace ID that's
an LCD display so that is different and
still has the 812 processor so how good
will this be compared to the 10s Max and
the 10s which we can see all lined up
here well you're gonna have to wait till
October to know these are coming out in
September at the 10r it's coming out in
October that decision is going to matter
for a lot of people because if you want
an affordable new iPhone you're enough
to be spending 1099 and $9.99 for the
tennis Max and the 10s I am curious to
compare them all and I'm not gonna be
able to do that too a little further
down the road if you look at this place
right now
it looks fine in Apple's LCD displays
have always looked really good and again
having face ID on it is great one
notable omission to the 10r no 3d touch
which a lot of people don't like anyhow
but it has a haptic response that they
say is kind of like MacBook Trackbacks
and on the back it only has a single
camera not too old but it's going to be
able to still do portrait mode effects
we'll see how that works now the battery
life they said on the 10r
is going to be an hour and a half better
than the eight plus so that sounds
really promising battery life on the 10s
max is supposed to be like an hour and a
half better than the 10
and I believe on the 10 as its 30
minutes better so you're not really
looking a battery game per se if you've
been waiting to get an iPhone 10
there's probably once to get but your
are you gonna get the 10 our I don't
know there's a lot of decisions here
Apple watch is a lot clearer the iPhone
landscape not as much we're gonna follow
up with more impressions here
I'm Scott Stein here at the Steve Jobs
theater taking a look at Apple's new
products</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
