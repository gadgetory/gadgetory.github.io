macbook I'm just kidding it's the lenovo
ideapad u410 a lot of people are going
to think I'm sure Lenovo knows that but
that's not such a bad thing in fact this
is one of the nicest idea pads that I've
seen in quite some time now if you
remember the IdeaPad u310 San ultrabook
that we reviewed last year this is not
an ultrabook there's a regular old
laptop but it still has some really nice
features for its price that'll probably
make you want to consider it including a
slot-loading DVD Drive AMD graphics 750
gigabyte hard drive six gigs of ram and
a core i5 processor and it's you know
it's thin as a macbook pro does it do
anything special does it fly through the
air does it do any magical laptop things
no it's a basic windows 7 laptop aside
from that but you know the fact that it
has bluetooth and has all those basic
features that you're looking for doesn't
have a higher res screen it doesn't have
any SSD storage or anything like that no
blu-ray but if you're looking for a
laptop like this that is less money than
a macbook pro 13-inch and also has AMD
graphics well then you may want to take
a look the battery life we're going to
wait to see how the full review goes but
it may be a little bit of a letdown if
you're expecting something like 6 hours
this didn't get it on our test this is a
14-inch laptop but it kind of looks like
a 13 incher it also has a very nice
keyboard somewhat apple-like and a huge
multi-touch trackpad where have we seen
that before it also has a slightly book
like design with sharpened edges that's
different and a nice solid metal feel so
again if you're looking for a non
ultrabook laptop that has a distinctly
apple flavor check out the lenovo
ideapad u410</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
