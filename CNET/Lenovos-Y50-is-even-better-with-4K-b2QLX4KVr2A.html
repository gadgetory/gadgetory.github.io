upgraded with a 4k screen I'm Dan
Ackerman this is the Lenovo y50 4k
Edition a couple of months ago we
reviewed the Lenovo y50 I was a 15 inch
gaming laptop that had mid-level two
decent components could do some very
nice gaming but it was in a small
reasonably attractive case the screen
however was not our favorite part a
little bit washed out not the better not
one of the better displays that we've
seen the I was regular 1920 by 1080
display we have got however now an
upgraded version with an optional 4k
display that's a full 3840 by 2160
display and besides just being a higher
resolution this version actually just
plain looks nicer than the regular 1080p
display it's it's brighter it's less
washed out looks better from sort of off
angles and that's all the important
things that you want in a multimedia
laptop especially a game playing one now
if you want to drive games at that full
4k resolution that's gonna be a little
bit tough this does not have the
Supertop and mobile graphics card it's
got an nvidia 860m they're actually up
to the 900 series now although that's
brand brand new you're probably not
going to see that in too many products
until 2015 that's it this is fine for
casual and mainstream gaming we even
knocked some games all the way up to 4k
by dialing down the detail settings a
little bit and I think that's actually a
more fun resolution to play at and I
would trade the higher resolution for
some lower texture and detail settings
but you can find that perfect balance
for you maybe even going back down to
1080 and cranking the detail settings
further up it's still a fairly
inexpensive laptop considering that it's
an attractive touchscreen 15 inch laptop
with a graphics card and with the 4k
screen the original version was about
eleven or twelve hundred dollars this 4k
version gets your core i7 CPU that
Nvidia 860 m chip and the 4k touch
display all for $14.99 I'm Dan Akron and
that is the Lenovo y50 4k Edition</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
