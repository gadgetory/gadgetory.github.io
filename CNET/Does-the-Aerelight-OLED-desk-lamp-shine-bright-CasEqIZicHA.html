I'm standing here beside the air light
Oh LED desk lamp and this is a pretty
fancy light cost it's two hundred and
forty dollars plus a little extra for
shipping and the reason it cost so much
is it's gotten Oh le D flat panel light
up here it doesn't use a bulb doesn't
use a typical LED or incandescent it
uses that flat panel Oh led most other
LED desk lamps and lighting fixtures in
general will cost thousands of dollars
so at two hundred and forty this is
actually a relatively inexpensive LED
product but in the world of desk lamps
still clearly a very very expensive lamp
now to help justify the high cost of
this lamp air light packs in some cool
features like touch to turn on so just
touch it anywhere on the capacitive
aluminum body and you'll turn it on
through three brightness settings era
light also boasts wireless phone
charging smarts by way of a Cheech our
geing unit hidden right there in the
base so you set your Chi compatible
phone down and it'll automatically
charge which is very cool especially if
you have a phone that's got that built
in if you're like me and you use an
iPhone or another phone that doesn't
have cheap charging built-in you can get
a special case that'll add that
capability to your device so all in all
that's a cool feature but it's not one
that's unique to err life you shop
around you'll find other lamps including
ones that are a lot more affordable than
this one that have G chargers built into
the base so this is not your only option
for that kind of functionality something
else to consider is that the lamp isn't
flexible it's a single piece of metal so
you can't bend the head you can't
reposition the light and you also can't
adjust the charging pad up to prop your
phone up if you wanted to watch a video
or something as it charges so unless
you're a big-time early adopter and
maybe looking to encourage a little bit
of desk lamp Envy from your neighbor at
the office I say pass on this lamp and
wait for this to become more of a
developed category with more options
thanks for watching check out the rest
of our lighting and smart home reviews
at cnet.com for seen at appliances I'm
right Chris
