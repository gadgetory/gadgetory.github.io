the Apple bite it's all the good and bad
inside the world of Apple so let's get
to it
we haven't talked about this because of
the timing of our show but OTR global
reported last week that Apple is
planning to manufacture a world mode
phone that will be compatible with both
of our eyes ins cdma2000 network and
current gsm UMTS carriers like AT&amp;amp;T now
you can think qualcomm for its hybrid
chip that will enable the iPhone to work
not only on the two carriers but pretty
much every other carrier outside of the
United States as well nothing is
confirmed but the report also says
production will start in q3 of next year
conveniently around the time a ents
exclusivity with Apple is believed to
expire the Droid is out now and it's a
great phone but there's still plenty of
you Verizon people drooling for Apple's
crown jewel and I would switch over the
second it happens what you Apple biters
think let us know now if you've been
debating about jailbreaking your iPhone
you might not want to after new malware
called iPhone privacy a is allowing
hackers to access users personal data
non jailbreaking phones are not
vulnerable so you guys are all safe but
people who have installed SSH to gain
remote access capabilities and have not
changed their default password you guys
are open to an attack so change your
password mine is on all my accounts now
Mac OS ten point six point two has been
released and after a bunch of
back-and-forth
it's now been confirmed that support for
Intel Atom processors is gone so those
of you running Mac OS 10 on your
notebooks do not update anyone running a
hackintosh pretty much knows what
they're doing but it's such a small
percentage of users and there's no way
it's really affecting Apple's bottom
line the big a is just turning people
off to OS 10 they might have wanted just
a little taste of it on a lower-cost PC
before making the jump down the road and
you know what this smells like people oh
yeah a bad apple but hey that's how
Apple rolls you can love it leave it or
just hate on it like we do all right
let's check out our iPhone App of the
I thought we'd do something a little
different and I know a lot of you love
taking pictures especially with the
holidays so I wanted to focus on a few
photo apps that will enhance how you use
your iPhone or iPod Touch for existing
pictures now the first one is snap sure
there's no zoom on the iPhone but this
$1.99 app gives you the ability to zoom
in and then touch the screen to take a
picture it is a digital zoom so it's not
gonna be as clean as an optical one but
it's better than no zoom and a feature
that takes three rapid shots in a row is
really nice now we also know there's no
flash on the iPhone to check out
i flash ready for $0.99 it adds a
software-based splash and typically it
will give you better results by focusing
on the shade of individual pixels
instead of adjusting sliders after the
photo has already been taken I got to
tell you I think this thing works pretty
well there's also a lot of editing apps
out there but I like this one it's free
it's called Photoshop calm mobile and it
comes from you from Adobe you might have
heard of them and it's really a bunch of
simple adjustments like cropping
exposure and preset color effects with a
simple clean interface and it's free so
try those out and I'm sure there's
plenty of others that you all use and
feel free to send them along so we can
showcase your favorites as well and
finally we'll keep on taking care of you
with a special giveaway for three Apple
biters our good friends at Kensington
have hooked us up with three nightstand
charging docks so ditch your alarm clock
and use your iPhone instead it comes
with a free rise and shine app with the
really cute name with three different
display modes you can tap to find out
the weather and the dock keeps the
iPhone standing upright while charging
so really cool stuff and to win you guys
have to watch last week's episode and
tell me what is my beloved game from
Angie moco and we'll enter you in the
random drawing to win all right that's
gonna do it for this week's show send me
your questions or comments to the Apple
byte at sea Netcom i'm brian tom they
should watch it I come back next time
for another bite of the Apple
