finally here and it offers plenty of
features to make it worthy of the price
hello everyone i'm jason parker prasina
and this is a first look at mac OS 10
mountain lion the latest version of mac
OS 10 comes with more than 200 new
features that make several actions
easier and make it more connected to
your other Apple devices in the interest
of time I can't cover everything today
but will show off some of the new
features as the first Apple operating
system to be announced after the
introduction of iCloud mountain lion
offers much more I cloud integration
than past versions of Mac OS 10 the most
notable new feature documents in the
cloud gives you a window upon launch of
an app that shows all your current
documents this means that whatever
device you're on you'll have the latest
version of all your documents everywhere
note how the iCloud window offers quick
look preview features like in the finder
next messages is now on the Mac and
mountain lion now you'll be able to send
instant messages to friends and
co-workers from your Mac directly to
other iOS devices running iOS 5 or later
you can also send multimedia message
with a simple drag-and-drop don't forget
that as long as you're chatting with
another mountain lion or iOS device user
your chats won't count towards your
texting plan with your service carrier
mountain lion also offers reminders
originally added in iOS 5 for Apple's
mobile devices the reminders app syncs
up with iOS devices through iCloud so
your reminders are always with you a
mountain lion reminders aren't just
about time-based alerts you also have
the ability to send yourself reminders
based on your GPS location very handy
when you have to remember something when
leaving work for example in Safari
Apple's web browser the company has
adopted a unified smart search field
similar to what you have in Google
Chrome so you can type out a URL or just
add a search term Safari also has a new
way to browse tabs with tab view an
iCloud synced feature that shows you the
current open tabs on your Apple devices
even better with a pinch gesture you
enter a new interface for tab browsing
mode that lets you swipe between open
tabs and reverse pinch to go back to
regular viewing mode sharing is much
easier in mountain lion as well with a
new share button that shows up in many
interface elements across the operating
system in Safari you can touch the share
button a mountain lion will list the
most appropriate share actions for the
content with this website for example
the sharing button pics appropriate ways
to share our URL that brings us to
Facebook and Twitter integration just
like the one time sign up you do with
Twitter and iOS 5 for iphones and ipads
you'll soon be able to sign up once on
Facebook or Twitter and mountain lion
then have easy access to sharing items
on both social networks unfortunately
Facebook integration won't come until
this fall is an update but Twitter is
ready to use right now an online simply
touch the share button choose Twitter
and you get what Apple calls a share
sheet where you can type in your message
add an attachment along with your
location and send the update directly to
Twitter for the mac and iOS gamers out
there mountain lion now also includes
Game Center and it synced up with the
same account as your iOS devices not
only will you be able to view your stats
leaderboards current games and friends
across all devices you'll also be able
to play multiplayer games on your Mac
against friends on iOS devices of course
the games will have to be made ready for
the Mac but I imagine a number of
developers will jump on board now that
game center will be included in mountain
lion for security Apple is added
gatekeeper that ensures you'll only
download safe apps that are confirmed as
such by Apple as a demonstration I'll go
into the security settings and set it to
only accept Mac App Store apps you'll
also notice you can include identified
developers but for test purposes I'll
leave it like this now if I try to
launch an app downloaded from another
source a dialog lets me know it can't be
opened seems a little odd to me that it
would let me download the app at all but
as a last line of defense it's good to
know that users will be warned before
opening a questionable cloud as I
mentioned earlier there are more than
200 new features in mount lines so
that's all we have for today but I take
a deeper dive in my written review on
scenic mountain lion is available right
now at the mac app store for 1995 and
with the many conveniences it adds i
think it's a worthwhile purchase i'm
jason parker for cnet and this has been
a first look for apple's mountain lion
thanks for watching
