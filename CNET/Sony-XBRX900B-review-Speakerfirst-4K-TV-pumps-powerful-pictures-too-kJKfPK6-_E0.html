and next to me is probably one of the
widest TVs you'll ever see this is
sony's 65 inch XBR 65 X 900 B this is
Sony the second most expensive
television for 2014 it's still extremely
expensive it's a 4k model but really the
thing that sets it apart are these
gigantic speakers to either side you'll
see there's three speakers there's a
3-way system with a tweeter and pair of
woofers there's also built in sub in
this TV so it takes advantage of the
sort of wedge shape seen to the side
here to amplify the sound
the real improvement of sound quality
that I was having those large speakers
facing the viewer I'm not a gigantic fan
of this look but if you really
appreciate audio quality Stevie will
sound better than pretty much anything
else on the market but the picture is
really what I'd like to talk about I'll
get to that in a little bit of course
the design on this TV being extremely
high-end is really great fit and finish
the speakers actually blend beautifully
into the screen here it's all glossy
black there's nice rounded edges the
sides are actually chromed but you can't
really see that the little feet below or
chrome as well and you can either mount
them as you see here in the middle or
you can spread those feet wide for a
little more stability if you have the
kind of credenza that can handle this
that width of course the 65 inch TV is
very wide there's also a 55 and a 79
inch member of the series the X 900 beat
comes fully loaded there's a built in
camera here on the upper right-hand side
that works with Skype and maybe some
future apps
aside from Skype you get all the
standard apps on the smart tv suite on
this television the Smart TV is designed
to sort of put Sony services and video
front and center and if you by Sony's
special 4k video player with this
television and you connect it you'll get
a special screen for 4k videos course
sony has more 4k content than anybody
right now their players proprietary you
can connect to this TV it's about 700
bucks connectivity on the Sony is
excellent there's four HDMI as well as
three USB and a component video input
two of those HDMI or HDMI 2.0 compatible
meaning that they can accept a really
high frame rate 60 frames per second 4k
signal the set also has the new Netflix
app that allows 4k streaming another
plus on this TV is the second remote you
get a standard multi button remote
there's also this simpler remote with a
little touchpad and just a few buttons
that enables you to actually use the
browser or the web browser built into
the TV a lot easier of course it's not
as easy to use as a web browser
found on your tablet or phone so general
I'd pretty much recommend skipping it
Sony's picture adjustments are a little
less extensive than most the other TVs
out there you do get a couple of cinema
modes in addition to control over the
local dimming on this television and
local dimming really is the reason why
it's picture quality is so good this TV
is among the best performing LCDs we've
ever tested and actually achieves that
from using an edge lit not a full array
LED backlight so that's pretty
remarkable in a darkroom the picture
quality gets extremely good the blacks
are nice and deep you also get excellent
color out of this TV and of course being
an LED TV you can get extremely bright
so the resulting picture has a lot of
pop and contrast of course one of the
downsides of a 4k TV right now is that
it has to be really big and if it sit
really close to really appreciate that
detail that said the picture quality
here is really not about the 4k
resolution it's about that excellent
contrast and this TV really does deliver
of course is extremely expensive that's
a quick look at Sony's XBR X 900 B one
of the most expensive and best
performing else you need TVs we've
tested this year under the cat smile
