the instruction manual probably never
come out of your car's glove box and
there's probably a lot of things about
your vehicle that you're feeling really
sort of mystified about well Hyundai's
got a new functionality as part of its
car care app that's going to help
drivers interact with and learn about
their vehicles
it's an augmented reality function and
it works simply by pointing your camera
at your car so the weight of the app
works is that you select an area of your
car you want to learn about and then you
point your camera at the car after it's
recognized if you get an augmented
reality overlay of various things about
your vehicle that you can learn right
now we're looking at the engine bay so
if you want to for example learn how to
check your engine oil level you can
click on that and get an animated 3d
overlay that shows you exactly what to
do though these are all going to be very
basic maintenance things like checking
your coolant and washer level maybe
changing an air filter but there are
things that you can do to basically
maintain your vehicle that your average
user may not be comfortable with and for
those who don't want to necessarily get
under the hood of their car the
augmented reality functionality also
works in the cabin you just point the
phone at your dashboard and after it
recognizes what you're looking at it'll
give you these again animated overlays
of the various functions of your car
these things like the steering wheel
controls your instrument cluster and
what it can do very complicated things
like the infotainment system actually
link out to youtube videos that will
explain for example how to pair your
smartphone via bluetooth it's all very
easy to use and pretty much anybody can
pick this app up and go Hyundai says the
augmented reality function is going to
roll out as part of its car care app in
the next couple of months so December or
January 2016 the first car supported
will be this one right here the 2015
Hyundai Sonata but the automaker says
that it will be rolling it out to all of
its 2015 and 2016 models across the
brand</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
