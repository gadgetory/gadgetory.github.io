headphone market by making relatively
inexpensive headphones that perform as
well or better than other cheap
headphones at forty five dollars the
impulse duo Wireless is toward the high
end of its in ear bluetooth headphone
line and features dual drivers in a
lightweight design that's comfortable to
wear like iFrogz earlier Wireless in
ears it's built around the company's
signature wireless hub which features a
magnetic clasp and houses the battery
microphone all the electronics as well
as all the controls the clip serves a
dual purpose not only does it allow you
to attach the remote to your shirt but
it keeps the cord wrapped around the
remote when you're not using the
headphones this model hasn't been
designated as a sports headphone but it
is sweat resistant and can be used at
the gym it comes with a few different
size tips and the buds stayed securely
in my ears with the larger tips and I
managed to get a tight seal that
maximize sound quality battery life is
rated at 10 hours at moderate volume
levels which is fairly decent thanks to
the dual 6 millimeter drivers as
headphone sounds better than both the
summit and the single driver impulse
what holds it back a bit is that you can
tell it's a bluetooth headphone by that
I mean it sounds a touch dull also it
only performs OK as a headset
I could hear callers well but a few
people I spoke to while I was at the gym
complain of hearing too much background
noise those small gripes aside the
impulse duo is a likable in-ear
bluetooth headphone that packs up well
and is easy to carry around in your
pocket I'm David Carnot for cnet.com
thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
