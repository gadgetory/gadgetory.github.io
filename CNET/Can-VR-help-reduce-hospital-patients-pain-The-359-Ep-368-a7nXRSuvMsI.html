episode 360 of the 359 podcast I'm BVG
and your host today are Alfred and Ben
I'm back I'm Alfred sorry for being gone
for a little while everybody I lost
power for four days but I'm back in the
office I didn't realize I had four whole
days of that yeah it was pretty
miserable but you know I held down the
fort did okay and now we're back talking
about tech so let's jump into what we're
talking about today we're gonna be
starting off on hospitals using VR as a
useful distraction or a way to reduce
pain for patients our co-worker Abrar
wrote about that today we'll start off
with that also on the MMA front Trump
blocked broad comms effort to try to buy
Qualcomm this was expected to be the
biggest tech merger ever so that's why
we wanted to talk about that and then
last we'll round out with Alfred telling
us about an AMD chip security flaw yay
so let's get to the podcast send in your
questions and comments BVG we'll get to
as many as we can at the end of the show
and let's get moving here we go for the
recording of the audio podcast and we'll
be back to see in the chat in 3 minutes
and 59 seconds from 3:00 to welcome to
the 359 I'm Ben Fox Ruben I'm alfred
hang the medical industry is building
more virtual reality into its treatments
using VR as a useful distraction for
painful or uncomfortable procedures it's
another way for VR to grow into the
mainstream and become a useful tool
beyond just entertainment or gaming so
obviously the medical industry has been
using virtual reality for I think it's
like decades now for quite a few years
but VR was way too expensive before for
it to really be used significantly now
with cheaper headsets folks can use it
much more often yeah I thought it was
really cool so the her story leads with
a ten-year-old boy who he was
experiencing so much pain that he had to
be sedated to like just get dressed and
the idea was they tried out this like VR
headset for him where
would go on these like underwater
adventures or anything like that or like
be like a penguin
yeah edging pebbles yeah so he would be
basically distracted in VR instead of
having to take like like drugs to like
stop the pain like for him just to get
dressed and I thought it was really cool
I I think you know I try to avoid any
kind of like painkillers or anything
like that whenever I have a procedure
most of the times I end up taking it
anyway cuz just cuz I feel like there's
no other alternative and I think
something like this using technology as
a way to get around that is really cool
obviously it's not for everybody and you
know this isn't this yeah this isn't
gonna replace like all medicine but like
or something like that you know you want
to try out I think it's it's a really
cool like alternative that you can yeah
so from from our story that we published
today about that it mentions that maybe
could help reduce some dependence on
opioids obviously we don't over promise
on that but it could be used as a first
attempt before actually using
prescription drugs
one other thing from the story there was
the see nurse I died cedars-sinai study
that talked about how VR could
reportedly reduce pain much more than if
you just watched like a like a regular
video on TV of like calming stuff you
could instead watch it in VR and it
would actually be way more effective
they should just have that instead of
the the clown that's supposed to come
cheer you up and say laughter is the
best medicine I don't know I like the
clown keep the clown's going
next up president Trump weighed in on
what was expected to be the biggest tech
merger ever with Broadcom trying to by
fellow chip maker Qualcomm Trump though
killed the 117 billion dollar bid
claiming national security concerns this
had a lot to do with 5g actually
Broadcom is currently based in Singapore
Qualcomm is in San Diego the argument is
is that if Broadcom for whatever reason
was going to reduce Qualcomm research
and development on 5g China could then
get ahead on 5g and that was considered
too much of an issue too much of a
concern for the trumpet minute rump
administration has been very protective
of 5g they had also there were rumors
before about them trying to buy their
own like
portion of the 5g Network we now haven't
really seen that go anywhere from the
FCC but yeah I mean it makes a lot of
sense this is the second time now
they've pointed to 5g as like a security
concern issue yeah last stop we also
wanted to touch on an AMD security flaw
alfred tell us a little bit yes so some
reach researchers from israel pointed
out these security flaws of AMD chips
today so AMD is probably Intel's biggest
rival in computer chips they take about
like 22% over the market and they're
found in phones laptops and on servers
and they found 13 vulnerabilities with
them that essentially affect the chip
where you can infect the chip itself
with malware that's different from like
a virus on your computer in general
because that usually affects your
software so if it is on the chip itself
that means that they get access to all
the sensitive data that's like usually
stored there that like it's supposed to
be secure there and they can alter it so
that they can infect like a lot of your
devices now the catch here is that they
only notified AMD like within the last
24 hours a standard vulnerability
protocol is to tell them like within 90
days in advance so they can think so
they can actually respond yeah before it
yeah so AMD doesn't really have a
response right now but they said they've
they've gotten the report and they're
like Reese Bob looking into it now all
right if you want to read more about
these stories check us out on CNN I'm
Ben Fox Ruben I'm Alfred Inge
thanks for listening I love hearing
stories about this VR stuff when it
comes to actually it's fascinating is
the right word tricked it's it's
fascinating what you can trick the human
mind yes you could say tricked one one
so a one piece from of our story a
simple distraction is believed to be at
play the brain is so busy processing
signals from VR that it has a harder
time processing other signals like pain
that's at least believed to be what's
actually happening obviously the brain
is so complex that strapping on a VR
headset it doesn't fully explain exactly
how the brain responds to it but that's
expected to be one of the primary
signals yeah I used to be really
skeptical about this VR in
cooller like I remember uh did you see
the commercial during the Super Bowl or
like the Olympics for Samsung VR nowhere
it was like they were showing all the
things you could do in VR and one of
them it was like a woman going through
rehab with like learning to walk again
even like with crutches and she couldn't
do it but them and she puts on the VR
set and it looks like she's walking on
the beach and then she all of a sudden
she's able to walk again yeah a very
skeptical of that a problem with like
over-promising some of this stuff so
like it obviously sounds positive to
help people reduce the potential
dependence or future dependence on
opioids tonight anytime the tech
industry really dives into medical you
do have to cap yeah this kind of stuff
and say let's not say that this is this
is gonna solve everything right so yeah
and I you know from like the few VR sets
that I've used it's like I look at and I
always think you know who would believe
this is real kind of thing well that was
like you know Apple came out with a
commercial that talked about how the
Apple watch you know saved the little
kid's life that sounds really positive
but I would love to delve into that a
little bit more to be like okay well you
have a SmartWatch that somehow like all
right
what I was gonna say though is that like
so from Claire Riley story out in Las
Vegas with the the VR zombie shooting
thing that we did I was there for that
and that was like stupid realistic like
there was a point where so the whole
room is flat like they do for all like
VR sets like gaming rooms I guess the
whole rooms flat and there was one point
where we're supposed to be on a roof and
I'm like walking on the edge of the roof
and I'm like what if I just like I just
jump like this nothing's gonna happen to
me like what happens to me in the game
it's all flat I'm not really gonna fall
but I'm like looking over the edge and
oh yeah
that's pretty high up the rules of
self-preservation sure that you're not
getting a job that's like that's what my
point that was like VR does a pretty
good job now or at least the really good
ones do a really good job for like
tricking your mind yeah the problem too
is is that with VR you're so immersed in
VR that that's why a lot of folks expect
AR to take over because AR you're not
completely shut out or the rest of the
world with this use of VR it actually
makes sense for you to get shut up yeah
and be in that world so that actually
makes a lot of sense to use it for
medical purposes it is just hard to
imagine that you could be so distracted
something like chronic pain you know and
then it with plenty of warrant there are
skeptics Danny Green being one of them
he says if I'm hurt and VR is not gonna
help certainly not just absolutely I
don't around with a video game but if
they immerse you so much
like I don't I've never experienced
anything where I can even begin to
measurably consider what that's like to
be so let's detach from the real world
so going back to the seniors side I it's
cedars-sinai study excuse me
it talked about the the patients that
used VR reported a 24 percent drop in
their pain scores other patients that
just use like a standard 2d nature video
it was a smaller reduction in pain it
was about a 13% reduction those are
those are very specific numbers
obviously so like I didn't see that
study I'm reading this from a borrower's
piece but that is that that is a notable
percentage difference but at the same
time it doesn't get rid of pain entirely
I'm probably know and we're not trying
to say that VR is medicine itself but if
it can give you relief holy cow yeah I
think it's more so of like a distraction
than like an actual yeah total
medication kind of thing yeah I don't
like I think if you know if you're
experiencing like chronic pain or
something like that then oh yeah it's
not good yeah yeah and it's not it's not
like some like magical hocus pocus oh
it's good it's good to totally caveat
that kind of stuff that's interesting
for us to write about and talk about but
let's definitely not over promise that
it is something that it isn't certainly
certainly it is nice to see actual
practical application of this though for
the longest time like fears a gimmick
it's just a silly game it's like it's
yielding some pot like measurably
positive results so one of the things
also in the story that I think maybe
might help Dana Greene be less of a
skeptic about it is like let's say
you're really like you have a needle
phobia if you strap on a VR headset
you're not looking yeah then yeah anyway
yeah cuz that's not gonna hurt that much
yeah cuz the lead of the story was
talking about how like most of it like
wasn't the pain that he felt from
getting dressed it was more so like his
fear of like experiencing that like let
that like small like ish nuts
I don't want to discount like what the
kids going through but yeah mostly bored
that like fear of that right and and
reduce like the compounding problem yeah
every single time he sees the doctor now
he's now he's like freaking out about it
no yeah I wonder how many people you
could really get to it excuse me adopt
into this certainly the younger
audiences more adept and acclimated to
the concept of virtual reality but you
think the elderly could possibly be open
I don't see why not especially in a
medical environment it's something where
anybody would get you know walked
through the process and you're not just
doing it on your own that's a lot of
what I've seen I'm where VR is enabled
as successfully where there's somebody
that actually is experienced and knows
what they're doing to like actually help
you walk through it as opposed to you
just having a headset and fumbling
through and trying to figure it out on
your own right Suren drawing the chat
says not a replacement to medicine but
why aren't we seeing more VR in a more
widespread measure for therapy there
have been success stories of dementia
care or paralysis therapy therapy but
not so mainstream yet and then he goes
on to mention a company named tribe mix
who has a dementia of virtual reality
project now I have definitely not heard
about this but he says their videos are
extraordinarily joyful and I definitely
have to go look this up if you heard
anything about this no but I would
probably say to answer string Joy's
question that everything in VR is very
new and it's all just really in
development and it's all it's it's
starting to trickle down and cycle
through in a lot of different ways so
especially in the medical industry
anytime new technologies get involved
that aren't medical technologies like
they're not specifically medical
instruments medical devices it's going
to take a long time for those to get
approved and for hospitals to get them
so I would say that some cases this is
going to be available but it's going to
take a while for it to really start
becoming more readily available in the
mainstream certainly yeah I remember
reading this story about a VR startup
based in New York called virtual rehab
where they try to help prisoners like
really like you know get back into
society we acclimate yeah react I mean
using like VR so they duh our sister
website as Z denied actually wrote
this in 2016 but it would be just like
helping them like learn like useful
skills and things like that like
learning how to replace a car battery
like through VR so like they could
probably try to land a job when they
when they get out or anything like that
yeah in training is an interesting
opportunity there I mean I'm like
replacing a car battery you could do
that in like the real world you don't
necessarily need to use VR for that I
would probably also argue that AR has
been found to be in general more useful
in a lot of ways for training because
again you're not taking yourself
completely out of the world that you're
surrounded in but so you could overlay
instructions on to whatever work you're
currently doing points well-taken all
around let's take another question from
the chat shall we
Matthew doctor says I wonder if there is
a solution that combines VR with
techniques like Lamaze and goes on to
note Lamaze is not reserved just for
childbirth is i yes that's true I have
you realized that it's a breathing
exercise to help again curtail pain to
an extent and focus concentration and
that's an interesting thighs because
that's not very great I'd kind of
replace Lamaze in a sense since it's
more of a mind over matter thing yeah I
think I I like catches idea of
potentially using both at the same time
as like potential dual treatments
because and and and the other way to
think about it too is is that some
things won't work for some patients so
having multiple tools that doctors can
use sometimes you want to use both
sometimes you want to use one or the
other
I think having all of those tools at
doctor's disposal to help patients it
has the potential of creating some level
of pain reduction on the edges you know
not you know the disappearance or
elimination of pain certainly not and I
mean we'll probably never figure out the
ultimate end-all be-all to that but to
see technology getting implemented in
very very unique new ways is always
fascinating to see I think yeah
definitely
I like this consideration from all
things Austin he says I'm really excited
for a are to help the medical field in
iron at Man esque methods totally yeah
the potential of doing this
specially in surgery where there are you
know like where two type of forms of
surgery that a doctor might be able to
utilize where they would get augmented
to reality like like instructions from
the best in the field wherever they are
located internationally there's a lot of
potential there and that's why a lot of
the major tech companies and major tech
CEOs talk about the potential of a are
being much broader and much more
mainstream than VR rayar is expected to
be in general more targeted but it's the
one that came to the market first got it
another comment from Danny Green saying
may be useful to release or relieve
anxiety disorders yeah and that's a dead
arm application VR has definitely been
used for phobias and anxiety disorders
many times in the past with cheaper VR
headsets that's now much more prevalent
than it used to be so I hate being the
guy to do this but we might need to talk
politics for a hot second because I
think I'm one of the very few and it's
well documented I don't agree with the
administration on a lot of things but I
think blocking the Broadcom Qualcomm
merger was the right choice
yeah as reporters I can't say when I
edit or Eli's personally as a not
reporter for Cena and comments not
supported by C net ever I think it was
good to block any further monopolization
of the 5g yeah and if I didn't make this
clear during the podcast this was an
unsolicited offer so this was a a
aggressive effort by Broadcom to try to
take over Qualcomm Qualcomm has been in
a weakened position because of multiple
lawsuits that rock has been down
Broadcom makes less revenue they're a
smaller company than Qualcomm but
they're they were going after them while
Qualcomm was like kind of a wounded
beast Apple is currently suing at
Qualcomm there are a lot of issues there
in Qualcomm maybe five years from now is
going to be in a much stronger position
and potentially a bigger company by
market cap it's a broad statement on my
behalf I know but I in a case like this
in a technology that is still young and
developing we need to encourage more
competition not less
yeah that's my two cents yeah I mean
it's usually we don't talk a lot about
business on the show I thought it was
really important because this was really
expected to be the biggest possible tech
murderer ever it's over a hundred
billion dollars and the possibility of a
chip maker controlling that much of the
market it's it could have been a very
big deal for consumers and it's and it's
now it's not gonna happen so yeah you
don't have to worry about that from like
a competitive perspective anymore let's
give a quick shout out the syringe Roy
again he says when are we have in the
Martian cocktail party elfrid I don't
know we don't have a he's the only
person that entered I'd like to give it
let it be more of a competition but I
don't know when do you want to do it I
don't know you've been snowed into a
barricade yeah yesterday is a podcast we
talked about Elon Musk and his
appearance at South by Southwest and how
he talks about oh we need to go to Mars
and you know preserve humanity also we
should have some great bars there as
long as the music is like those guys
from Star Wars Cantina band yeah yeah
yeah so we we did like put a call out to
our viewers basically asking you know
what what Mars themed cocktails would
you drink and like submit the recipes
for us and the best ones well if any of
them aren't red I'll be shocked so I was
the only person that that like energized
great yeah enjoy is great hey you
remember when I invented a CNET cocktail
yeah yeah it was no red ball that was it
was it was delicious I liked it cinnamon
II it was cinnamon and what cranberry I
got to drink it during work hours or
something I forget what I even did it or
by the way with the time we have left is
it is it cool to you like a hard pivot
and talk about your tattoo oh yeah sure
sure okay so we Brian got a tattoo like
a couple weeks ago and we finally
published the video it's like this
awesome nine minute video of BVG getting
this really cool tattoo where it's a
sound wave that if you point your phone
at it it'll actually play a clip of a
song I'm potentially butchering this
whole explanation so maybe I should
pitch it to you because it's your tattoo
I mean it's it's just kind of what it
sounds is it magic no but it's kind of a
unique new way to implement AR it's
essentially turning a tattoo into a QR
code
but it's letting you get really really
personal with it and that's the kind of
thing that appealed to me yeah I can't
believe you got the whole 359 podcast on
your arm like that no I really love this
I'm truly dedicated truly dedicated I
know that it's totally not for everybody
but you hear some of the stories behind
it I talked to the guy who invented the
app his name is Nate Sigurd and there's
people that he's like this was the last
voicemail my mother left me before she
passed away just really like my baby's
first cry you know in the degree bro guy
got tattooed yeah that people got
tattooed and just the ability to keep
that with you I think is really really
endearing and heartwarming and you know
I was gonna I was a sound I'm a sound
junky I'm I've been a production guy for
a long time I wanted to do a wave form
tattoo and then when this kinda came
into the fold it all just kind of lined
up so you were gonna do a wave form
already but this way you could actually
have the wave form play if you pointed
your phone at it yeah like I toyed with
the idea of trying to write my own code
so I can make a QR code that opens like
a Spotify playlist but then I was
restricted to the Spotify library and
who knows where Spotify is gonna be next
year this way like I own this this is
mine I pay for the storage for this file
through the app and I granted that's
probably a non palatable solution for a
lot of people out there it's like you
gotta pay to listen to your tattoo I'm
like then they can stop paying and I
still have my tattoo that I like mmm you
know this way it's always with me and
Merida ways and yeah I'm very happy with
the way it turned out so what song is it
it's a song called 43% burnt by The
Dillinger Escape Plan some of you may
notice I tend to wear a lot of black
t-shirts on this show I'm a old crust
punk from back in the day so yeah so
it's heavy metal right it's heavy metal
quite quite the opposite of what I
listen to
but I celebrate your love of tattoos and
I thought it was a really cool video I
think everybody check it out on CNN or
you could see it on YouTube whichever
and it's a really cool video all about
BVG and
yeah now shoutouts to see net for
letting me take them along for the ride
and to experience this this is something
that kind of hit home pretty good for me
so thanks to everybody yeah very cool do
we have any other questions or we could
take it home no I think it's about time
we got to wrap it up or right at the end
of the day okay cool so it's over here
now the 3:59 podcast is available on
itunes toon and stitcher Feedburner
google play music the Amazon echo and of
course cnet.com what is this stuff you
can also subscribe watch and join the
conversation weave day mornings unseen
up on the scene at periscope livestream
and YouTube channels the script actually
it tells us to yell what is this stuff
what is this is on the script it's right
over there if anybody ever accused us of
being over scripted anyway thanks
everybody for your questions really
appreciate it we'll see you again
tomorrow take care everyone see you
tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
