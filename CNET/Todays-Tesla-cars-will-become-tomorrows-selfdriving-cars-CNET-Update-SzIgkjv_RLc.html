tomorrow's self-driving cars Tesla
announced that all of its cars be made
now will include self-driving Hardware
technology but the actual software for
the car to drive itself will be coming
later maybe in a year or two the company
is essentially future proofing its
vehicles so when the software is ready
owners don't need to buy a new car that
means the Model X the Model S and the
upcoming Model 3 all will be loaded with
eight cameras 12 ultrasonic sensors and
a forward-facing radar it'll also have a
new on-board computer to process all the
data and make driving decisions
Tesla posted a video demonstration where
the car did everything by itself
traveling through city streets to the
highway and then finding a parking spot
it can even read signs to make sure it's
allowed to park at a certain spot so it
skips over handicapped spots in the
video a person is sitting in the
driver's seat for legal reasons but
they're not doing anything in reality
these features will be rolled out over
time pitched as ways to enhance safety
to assist drivers and the goal is to
have a car that can go from coast to
coast LA to New York by the end of the
year oh and one more thing
musk also said the car will be able to
find the owner anywhere in the world
just press summon on your phone app and
the car will eventually find you so
basically Tesla's are gonna be just like
the Batmobile that's it for this tech
