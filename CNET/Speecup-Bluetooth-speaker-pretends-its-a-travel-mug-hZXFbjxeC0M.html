I creations speak up now the speak up is
a Bluetooth speaker system you can put
this in your car it's kind of designed
to fit in a car's cup holder and it's
designed to look kind of like a travel
mug I've brought a travel mug here to
show the difference they're pretty much
the same zeiten half inches tall which
could be a little tall for some cars am
I getting the way of your shifter or
something like that but in the shape it
should fit most now as a Bluetooth
speaker it can play music from your
bluetooth phone and also work as a
hands-free phone system I've actually
got my phone paired to it right now and
without touching the phone I can play
music answer phone calls got a
microphone in it so I can talk to it and
it also connect to voice command systems
like Syria s on the samsung galaxy in
the back here it's got these ports it's
got a charging port micro USB this has a
20 hour looking my own battery in it so
you can just leave it in your car you
didn't have to plug it in for extended
periods of time I also take it though
tell rooms wherever you happen to be
traveling and use it as the Bluetooth
speaker it's also got an auxiliary
output right here so you can plug this
directly into your car's exit or input
or maybe home stereo if you want to
broadcast the sound through a larger
sound system the controls for the speak
up sit on top here you've got this ring
for raising or lowering the volume of
the music this side stops the music this
side plays the music the site answers
the phone so if I hit this it's now
playing the music that I have streaming
from my phone these buttons will skip
music back and forth but the really
interesting thing is actually has
gesture control with some sensors here I
can wave my hand across to make the
music either skip back or skip forward
or if I have an incoming phone call I
can wave my hand across to answer the
phone pushing the center of this
activates siri-like so play artist
frightened rabbit
and it starts playing the music I asked
for can also use that for navigation
placing phone calls anything and it be
convenient if there's sitting in the car
and the cup holder near me I could just
press down at it a couple things I'm not
crazy about the controls on the speak up
by of this sitting in my cup holder I
reached down to change the volume by
turning this well I either have to use
two hands to keep it in place or it's
just going to turn all all around the
power switch is on the bottom here so I
don't want to keep this turned on all
the time every time I get in or out of
the car I have to lift this out of the
cup holder reach down here pull the
switch on or off like so but I do like
the sound quality that comes out of this
device it's got a little dome here to
make the sound radiate outwards so
they'll come out of these ports it this
is a pretty full sound decent bass but
it is only a single speaker so you won't
get stereo sound out of this it's good
but not as good as a decent home storage
system or even a bookshelf system at one
hundred thirty dollars the speak up is
kind of pricey but it is a high quality
bluetooth speaker and phone system you
can take it pretty much anywhere in the
car hotel room traveling in the home I'm
