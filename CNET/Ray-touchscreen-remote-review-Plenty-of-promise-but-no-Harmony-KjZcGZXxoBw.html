thick phone with a small screen it can't
make calls or play music or snapchat the
main thing it can do is control your TV
and home entertainment gear this is the
Wray super remote and it competes
directly against devices like our
favorite universal remote the Harmony
home control the first difference beyond
the design between harmony and Ray is
Ray's easier setup you don't need to use
a phone app to get it to control your
gear instead everything happens on the
screen
I appreciated the helpful hints and
simple language another difference is
that you'll need to keep ray in its
cradle because just like a phone the
battery will run out relatively quickly
it lasted a few days of normal use
before having to be recharged which is
better than a phone but much worse than
the harmony which lasts a year a bigger
deal in my testing turned out to be
raised lack of a hub with harmony the
remote itself doesn't send the signals
that turn on your gear instead the
little hub does it which is much more
reliable especially if your stuff is
inside a cabinet with Ray you have to
aim the remote at your gear just like a
standard remote trust me once you go hub
it's tough to go back I also prefer
physical buttons to raise on screen keys
they're easier to use by feel and
although Ray does have a swipe interface
for menu navigation it's not as
efficient as buttons raised screen does
allow one extra feature harmony can't
match
you can browse TV shows and movies on
the screen itself and tuned to them
directly with a tab unfortunately it
doesn't allow you to easily record an
upcoming show in your DVR for that
you'll need to use the on-screen menus
the final knock against raised price
this clicker costs 250 bucks about twice
as much as a harmony home control and
it's just not worth it to most people
Ray has promised that the harmony is
simply better for now I'm David Katz
