quite a lot about the Samsung Galaxy S 9
and s 9 plus including the dual cameras
on the back of the S name plus the dual
aperture lens on both new phones and the
relocation of the fingerprint reader to
somewhere really sensible but I am here
to tell you some things that you might
not know about both phones one of the
best new features is being able to
respond to a notification when you're in
any app just by swiping down to reveal
the entire message and then responding
within it if you don't want to see the
message just swipe it away another
feature that's new to the s 9 and s 9
plus is selfie focus this is what a
regular selfie looks like but if I press
this new button here on the side it will
actually blur my background if I hold it
at about arm's length so there you go a
new feature it only uses one camera and
not two for usual portrait modes so that
means this is using software not
hardware to create that soft focused
effect both new phones come with a
really high maximum screen resolution
but did you know that they default to
sort of a mid range it's still going to
look really clear but if you want all of
that detail you can go into the settings
and adjust it yourself the Samsung
Galaxy S 9 plus has a portrait mode you
can blur the background to make your
subject pop but did you know that you
can actually save two copies so that
when you take your picture you can
choose the close-up or the wide-angle
version decide which one you want to use
or maybe even keep them both the S line
and ask nine plus are Samsung's first
phones to support a horizontal mode when
you flip it but it isn't turned on by
default so you're gonna have to go in
the settings if you want it from the
settings menu select display scroll to
home screen and then at the bottom makes
sure that portrait mode only is turned
off and now you'll have a horizontal
home screen this is really good for when
you're watching video and you don't want
to turn the phone and if you want to
turn it off again it's pretty simple to
just go into the quick settings and
deselect auto rotate if you already have
two accounts for one app and you don't
want to switch between accounts there's
an option called dual messenger which is
hidden in the advanced feature settings
that will download a second instance of
that app for example Facebook that way
you can flip between both accounts
without having to switch your profile it
will work with Facebook facebook
Messenger whatsapp Skype viber and
snapchat for example if you use a screen
protector you might want to increase the
touch sensitivity so that the phone can
register your prints and track your
actions through the thicker screen</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
