2013 in Las Vegas i'm here with amy
cotton from sony and we going to be
talking about this it is sony's concept
consumer 4k camcorder okay so what's the
basic idea behind this device well one
of the big buzz you know you're seeing
here at CES is 4k and the idea that
there's tvs that allow you to display
stuck content in 4k but you want to
create your own you know you just don't
want to watch movie so obviously with us
introducing high-def years ago and now
you know 3d a couple years ago 4k is the
next big thing in video but not
everybody can afford a studio camera
production piece so we want to bring 4k
consumer high-def to the masses I said
but this is just a concept at the moment
that that's right there's not many
details on this when do you think we
might see this thing become a reality
that you can actually buy I would like
to say tomorrow but that is definitely
not the issue or the case on it I don't
I don't really know it's like you said
it's a concept piece you know there's
some things that have to be figured out
but it would be a form factor like this
because with shooting 4k you want
control or you know you don't want it a
little consumer point-and-shoot piece
you want something that's going to give
you a massive amount of control over
your contacts way I was just taking a
look at it's obviously quite sizable
quite chunky so you don't think there's
any chance that in a couple years time
it actually goes on sale we might see
the size come down for a slightly more
holiday friendly or jacket probably not
the first generation piece you know when
we introduced high-def years ago this
was the form factor because your average
consumer just didn't know what to do
with it or didn't have the processing
power on their computers to handle it so
I'd like to say you know if we're back
here in five years you know doing the
same thing I'd love to show you a full
lineup of 4k pocket camcorders but first
one you'll see is probably going to be a
more robust piece if you will okay thank
you amy that's fantastic so confirmation
at least if nothing else that sony is
thinking about ways to bring 4k stuff to
your 4k TV because let's face it there's
not an awful lot of 4k content out there
at the moment but you don't
anymore you can just make your own
thanks very much Amy I'm the West rave
scene at CES 2013 we sorts check out the
