here's what's happening this week on
scene at scribe blog kingi is a small
flotation device that you wear on your
wrist while enjoying watersports
or a day at the beach the wrist
mechanism is lightweight and doesn't get
in the way of regular water activities
and deploys easily by pulling a small
lever the balloon inflates using a
replaceable co2 cartridge
Kinji can remain inflated for over 48
hours and comes equipped with a compass
and an emergency whistle for signaling
help
Kinji is currently raising funds on
IndieGoGo and has already blew well past
their goals you can pre-order your Kinji
now for $69 washing dogs is never easy
and it's almost always messy well maybe
this product can help the wolf washer
360 great name by the way
blast your dog with 360 degrees of soap
and water to clean every inch of man's
best friend and it seems to work ok
based on the video I saw it looks like a
silly product but according to the
website it claims that you can wash your
dog in under a minute by simply sliding
this hoop along your dog's body as soap
and water blast your pet with
cleanliness the woof washer 360 connects
to any garden hose and has a small
canister attached for dog shampoo simply
hook it up to your hose and boom your
dog will be clean in no time you can get
a woof washer 360 now for twenty dollars
for small dogs and 25 for larger dogs
when you wash a dog this part you don't
want to touch
now with the wolf washer I don't have to
use my hands at all user Daniel Diebold
and analog boy on reddit posted a
YouTube video last week of a very rare
video game console from the early 90s
they are calling the PlayStation
Nintendo Super disc the console was a
collaboration between Sony and Nintendo
to create a cd-rom based gaming system
in the video we see a controller that is
branded with Sony PlayStation on the
front and Nintendo on the back and looks
almost identical to a Super Nintendo
controller the cartridge in the console
was dated 1992 with Japanese writing on
it and a lot boy posted photos the
console on reddit a while back an
interest grew until users were calling
for a video to help prove that the
console was real
