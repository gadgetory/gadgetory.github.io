tracker with a splash of SmartWatch it
can measure all of the basics like steps
distance sleep and heart rate which it
does so automatically every 10 minutes
it can also display notifications from
your iPhone or Android device this
includes things like calls text messages
emails and pretty much everything else
other features include stand reminders a
silent alarm and always-on touchscreen
display and seven day battery life it's
also waterproof up to 50 meters and can
be worn in the shower or pool now Huawei
is positioning this watch as a fitness
watch there are workout profiles for
running walking biking treadmill running
and swimming but there's no built-in GPS
so instead you will have to use your
smartphone to see real-time distance and
pace metrics but the most interesting
features inside the huawei app in
addition to seeing all of your Fitness
data you have the option to build a
workout program for a 5k 10k half
marathon or full marathon
it tailors the program specifically to
you and will adapt to B start to fall
behind
overall I kind of like the fit it's
lightweight and comfortable to wear but
I wish that GPS since I don't really
like running with my phone I also found
the display a bit dull and the touch
beam can be annoying to use during
workout there's also no automatic
exercise detection like we've seen in
trackers from Fitbit and Samsung at $130
it is cheaper than both the Fitbit
charge 2 and Samsung gear fit 2 but I
think both trackers provide a better
experience for more information check
