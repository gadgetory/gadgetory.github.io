category that started with the first
Amazon echo show has blown up over the
past couple of months so with all of
these options how do you pick first
here's a quick summary of what these
gadgets can do think of smart displays
as the next iteration of smart speakers
like smart speakers they respond to a
wide variety of voice commands you have
options with Amazon's assistant and the
competitive google assistant on top of
the usual voice commands smart displays
have a touchscreen check the weather and
you'll see a forecast search for a place
to eat and you'll see pics of nearby
restaurants the screen can also be a
handy visual reference when you want to
cook most smart displays will now let
you control smart home devices from a
control panel plus you can watch videos
on the display itself and make video
calls as most have an embedded camera
now let's walk through the options to
find the one that fits you best unlike
with smart speakers where the quality of
assistance is pretty even I actually
prefer Google assistant smart displays
to those from Amazon they're better at
multitasking better at walking you
through a recipe they're better at smart
home controls that said they're not so
much better that you should jump ship if
you already have a lot of Amazon echo
devices at home if that's the case go
with the second gen $230 Amazon echo
show it sounds great
has great mics and it is a much more
polished smart display than the gen 1
version if you're neutral go with Google
on this one which narrows your options
to these for the 150 dollar Google Home
Hub is your best entry point it's cute
and more affordable than the rest with
all of the same smarts unlike the rest
it doesn't have a camera which might be
a negative for some or you might
appreciate that if you intend to put it
in your bedroom it also has great
adaptive brightness so when you're not
using it it can show off your family
pictures in style the Google home hub
sounds fine when you want to play music
but if you want a smart display that
emphasizes sound quality go with the
$250 JBL link view it has all the same
features
I don't like the look as much but it can
blast your favorite song with a lot of
bass and
decent quality the 250 dollar Lenovo
smart display is the most well rounded
of the bunch it has the biggest screen
it sounds pretty good plus look at this
design the bamboo back looks like a
cutting board and fits particularly well
in the kitchen where the home hub is
cute the Lenovo smart display feels like
a premium and elegant gadget which
leaves these the $300 LG smart display
isn't the best at anything and it's too
expensive so it's out the $200 Facebook
portal and the $350 portal plus aren't
as smart as the rest they're primarily
video chat devices with some echo
capabilities go with a portal if you
primarily want a video chat device with
a camera that can follow you as you talk
so you have a lot of options but based
on what you need whether it's sound
quality or design whether it's Amazon or
Google you can narrow your choices
pretty quickly and jump in on this
booming and helpful category of tank</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
