intercom for $250 you can use it to make
video calls it's a pretty simple device
but it has Amazon's assistant Alexa
built-in and it plays its role as an
intercom well you can call other units
in the house and get a video feed
without waiting for someone to pick up
perfect for a quick announcement if you
don't want that you can turn on privacy
mode you can also call devices outside
of the home or even make a call to a
cell phone via the app but throw the
other functionality out for a second if
you don't have a need for an intercom
specifically you don't need this device
make a Skype call use FaceTime if you
have a large family you want to check on
especially if you have elderly parents
who are uncomfortable with the tech this
device will make it simple to keep in
touch and that auto pickup feature could
really come in handy in that case even
as an intercom it's not perfect
you can't page everybody at once for an
announcement you also can't adjust the
angle of the stand though you can mount
it on the wall despite those faults I
recommend the nucleus is a handy smart
device if you have elderly parents or a
big family</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
