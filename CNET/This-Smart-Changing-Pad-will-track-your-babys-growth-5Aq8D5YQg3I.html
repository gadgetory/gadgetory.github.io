changing pad that tracked your child's
development over time by recording
things like wet diapers dirty diapers
feeding pattern sleeping patterns etc
today we're taking a look at the hatch
baby smart changing pad which does all
of that for a price tag of $250 so I
brought in my eight week old son to test
out this changing pad and see if it's
really worth that price now just from a
design perspective this changing pad is
actually really nice it's really durable
it's got a great pad that's really soft
for the baby I really like it a lot it
also features a really accurate scale
which is especially helpful during those
first few months when you're trying to
track your baby's growth I also really
like the hatch baby app it's really
flexible and it allows you to track
different data with his diaper habits as
feeding habits sleeping habits etc now
all of that said you can actually
accomplish most of it through the free
app which kind of begs the question why
you would want to spend $250 on a nice
changing station that really doesn't add
any smarts of its own really the only
thing that the changing pad itself
offers is the scale that allows you to
weigh your baby but beyond that it
really doesn't offer very much smarts</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
