very much for joining us on another
edition of open tab my name is Jeff
Bakalar and with me this week is David
Katz Meyer our television expert
actually expert expert is doing you a
disservice though sir Wow because I'll
tell you why I'll tell you why because I
like to refer to you is the best TV
reviewer on earth Wow is that Earth
spontaneously created by a computer I'm
you launch into it we'll get to that
you're right proceed okk i like where
your head's at ha so yeah best TV review
on earth you have that kind of power
here make sure you take advantage of it
by chiming in in that little box below
wherever you're watching this thing and
ask questions you got comments bring
them on Mike Sorrentino is here and he's
going to be watching the chats and
tweets and the and the snapchats and the
intagram stories around the YouTube chat
Alaskan chat i'm chatting with some of
you all right now in the YouTube chat so
please please please join our show by
talking to us and I'll bring you in as
much as we can please three pleases
three job to make sure you do that
hashtag open tab you can do that if you
want or just type into the chat field ah
we are going to cover a wide gamut of
topics today this week we're talking
first off about rivalries in the tech
industry and what that means for you
right that's when you bash them rivals
together birds like the mortal kombat
fights green olives are all so format
Wars like Blue River bluray versus HD
over that old me that old chestnut yeah
uh let's talk about something that
you've been dealing with for some time I
just dealt with recently with the xbox
one s review and that is HDR so so cats
yeah that was a trial by fire huh
explain took us like two hours ago
thinks it was crazy what is HDR for
people who don't
no what is HDR 10 what does Dolby vision
what is all that jumps so the first
thing now HDR is high dynamic range okay
just like the HDR setting on your phone
the name but very much nothing like it
in reality okay don't confuse it with
HDR on your phone or photography or
whatever with those crazy effects and
you know they even have video games back
and a that at HDR effects you turn on
are like why could they use a different
three letter combination no super high
dynamic range is what I told him to use
and they didn't want to you well I don't
understand that um so anyway HDR that
we're stuck with and right now in the
market there's actually two different
formats of HDR there's a HDR 10 which is
just called HDR generic HDR and then
there's Dolby vision which of course
everybody knows Dolby right kind of runs
the show with audio and theatrical video
and pretty much everything in Hollywood
so they have a big name brand advantage
these two formats are not mutually
exclusive so you can have a TV that
supports both or you can have TV the
sports one or the other right now Sony
Samsung and most everybody else except
for vizio and LG only support HDR 10
Vizio and LG support Dolby vision they
paid you know Dolby you know their their
licensing fee they have this ability to
take these global vision titles and play
on so right now you can get HDR from
netflix ok if you have one of these tvs
right you can also get it from amazon
they support as well both guys support
both formats good if you have a sony TV
you just get a little thing that says
HDR but if you have a vizio or LG TV
it'll say dolby vision because they
prioritized over vision akasha can do
both and then voodoo which is a service
at walmart runs that's similar they only
have bold vision right now which is
interesting huh so there's different
studios for different ones I've looked
at both the difference is really hard to
tell right now I think we might see some
more differences emerged as the master
studios figure out how to make it pop a
little bit more but the real thing to
know is that any HDR really is a good
picture quality improvement right and
you an are watching it yes tell the
difference there is a difference yeah
it's subtle yeah it's there though it's
not going to blow your mind if not I
mean remember when people when HD first
came out people like will standard def
and HD or not that different or you know
why blu-rays local
like my DVDs it's not as drastic of a
difference is that there's a diminishing
return sort of absolutely because at the
end of the day regular blu-ray looks
freaking phenomenal yeah so nhd our
blu-ray looks even better provided that
your TV is good enough to make it look
bad right and that's what it gets a
little cloudy right like it like we just
discussed every TV manufacturer seems to
have like a different sort of idea of
like what they want to support so is it
possible that like someone could buy a
TV and get screwed out of the format
that ends up maybe winning this sort of
situation oh I think what's going to
happen and this is pretty pretty
standard HDR 10 is is required by the by
the sorting the camp with 4k blu-ray
okay so it's it's if there's a 4k
blu-ray disc out there which is the only
way to get HDR you know aside from
streaming right now it's gonna be HDR 10
so and every TV out there Vizio
literally last this week we want
relative firmware update that allow
their TVs to work with HDR take out all
these HDR TVs all work with work is you
can't get screwed right so you're not
going to get screwed but there is a
possibility that for whatever reason
dolby vision stuff might look better or
if for example you want to watch
something on voodoo that's all we vision
only right for as long as they maintain
that exclusive although i think it's
going to be very long so you might
actually end up if you have a TV that
can't do dolby vision not being able to
see all the available content that's the
case right now from sony and samsung
viewers but it's not that big of a deal
because that stuff is also available on
other services and non dole division so
i think these two are going to coexist a
little like DTS and dolby digital which
are the two audio formats that every
receiver codes list yeah and in it and
it all works you know but there isn't
there's very few receivers out there
there only one or the other right now so
I think next year the year after you're
going to start seeing TVs that little do
both like LG and Vizio do this year so
okay so this doesn't necessarily have to
do anything with HDR but it is in your
realm the question I get asked a lot by
people who are the sort of laymen of the
tech world my basically my friends yeah
um why night people what's that
wonderful people wonderful people don't
necessarily know which side of the
blu-rays has the data on it okay that's
fine um
question I get asked the most is when do
we stop being able to see difference in
resolution me like how close you have to
be no no like after 4k will be 8k right
oh yeah what's that teen gang we're
already there well no I feel like we're
there I feel like 8k from what I've read
a few sort of like ophthalmologist you
know expert sort of your brains just
simply not going to know the day after a
lot HR thing is it 8k like eight point
seems to be well the threshold the thing
is H it's actually already happening
because if unless you're sitting really
close to a 4k TV you're not going to see
the difference right between really good
1080p which is blu-ray right and 4k
because your eyes are not sharp enough
to resolve the difference right plus
moving video is a lot more difficult to
resolve and the fact is you know it's
not going to be the very highest quality
anyway sure so if you look at netflix
for K versus 1080p bluray often the
blu-ray looks better because there's
less compression and you know it's it's
it's not about the number of pixels and
so we say like we have a 65-inch TV
unless you're sitting like 6 feet 7 feet
away from it which is hella close
gigantic TV like that you just can't see
the difference for most people if you
have great vision sure you'll see the
difference you're watching really high
quality content show see a little
difference but again 1080p bluray looks
work an awesome already people I feel
like people want that feeling they got
when they went from SD day Jessica can't
have you just like you'll never create
that first time right at taste which is
like yeah pulling off the clouds never
can I oh this is amazing and the other
thing is right now even 4k is never it's
going to be really long time for its
broadcast yeah so right now TV
broadcasters are barely doing 720p and
1080i yeah and those are the high def
formats and once you know when we're
going to get there's some smattering of
4k stuff you can see on TV but it's be a
long time before they change all the
trucks the camera the progressions let's
just skip and go to 20k and just yeah at
this point it you wouldn't see that for
us either but that's not gonna stop from
coming out with it yeah sure how long do
you think agents and managers are
wondering like how long do you think
even this HDR thing would last because
he wants to buy TV he wants to make sure
that it's actually a good investment for
him and I guess you'd be worried that
like it's just always the next best
thing yeah HDR is a
big deal the thing is we spent a lot of
time crapping all over 4k because you
really couldn't see the difference with
HDR you can see a difference there is a
difference because it's not resolution
which is basically limited by your
eyesight and see there's more colored
eyes too yeah it's you mentioned wide
color gamut that's a really it's a
difference you can see it when you look
at you know the trees look greener
there's right now that HD standard is
pretty limited in the color it's based
in like you know the 70s and earlier
right what the TV's could reproduce
there a lot better now then get a lot
wider color that's in HDR and then the
dynamic range which makes you know
highlights glint and it makes the clouds
look more defined yes like that better
again relatively soft subtle but instead
it's much more of an improvement than
from going 1080p 24 k absolutely I
totally agree with that you showed me a
scene in in the revenant that is very
very likely the revenant is the best
home video content i've ever seen period
Wow where k blue area the revenant is
unbelievable cut yeah cuz he just did a
great job of filming it in HDR yeah out
in natural lighting understand haven't
seen that film treat yourself well even
on a 1080p you know regular t it looks
normal movies are filmed like
specifically in HDR do you think they
film like a couple resolutions above and
then bring it well again HDR is not
necessarily a resolution it's about the
capturing of the dynamic range which is
again the range from from absolute white
to dark and it's also capturing the
color and all these cameras now all
these digital cameras can Eris and Sony
all these the Halloween cameras are way
capable of capturing it's that transfer
yeah so getting that whatever the camera
could see right to your screen is that
is the question that's what HDR comes
closer to than current 1080p correct me
if I'm wrong HDR in a nutshell when it
comes to the dynamic range shortest up
the analogy I tried to give somebody was
like okay let's say you had like ten
shades of darkness right like 10 shades
of grey okay HDR gives you a thousand
yeah for for all intents and purposes
like that you're basically getting the
ability to see that much more of a
difference between total white and total
black and and and it created it expands
the range and expand it increases the
number of steps in that ring like
f-stops on a camera or one of the
analogies that they use but it also
makes the top end of that range
potentially a lot brighter sure and so
what you can do is have like if you
invision like Sun as it as a plane turns
Sun strikes that the wing of the plane
and it this bright kind of pop yeah HDR
captures that much better than I mean HD
can't capture it and and and the whole
format is designed to transmit those
highlights and give you that sort of
feel that's why I revenues so good
because it's all outdoor natural
lighting sure that you're used to seeing
and it's one of these things where if
you see it side by side it's like wow
you know it does make a difference well
get two more that when we get to the
xbox one s stuff that we'll talk about a
little later in the program because
there is some relevancy there with what
that console can do but first we're
going to introduce our new segment that
we did a couple weeks ago it's our drink
segment our nerd concoction segment Mike
made up a drink after trying out the no
man's pie yeah at the loading bar in
London yes it's a great video gaming bar
look at this thing consoles that drink
tastes like a strawberry cheesecake Oh
has like actually has semi-soft cheese
in there and jelly oh it comes together
really really nicely yeah I did not make
that you did not make that but you wait
to drank and ate that instead I've made
the no man's sky breeze so I'm calling
it so the no man's sky breeze has one
ounce of vodka 1 ounce of Malibu one
ounce of orange juice and 1 ounce of
raspberry lemonade with a splash just a
splash of strawberry margarita mix or
you can use grenadine for the coloring
yeah will help make it reach arounds
pink so it's equally some alcoholic
definitely sugary yeah that's fine
everyone's goal in life is to is to get
that from about this this is the you
want that pink ya know I'd might my
goals I don't give a good deal that's an
exact opposite right here okay so there
you go the port so we're gonna I love
the color you really did capture the no
man's sky pink that was the goal dieser
spacey sky that all you gotta hold it
with a pinky alright we're going to
taste test this live right now or you
check out my pink hot pink e action
while we're here
hi will I'm not playing runescape just
cuz that's what the chats Carly saying
they're like all red shoot dudes playing
runescape uh-huh up taking your
questions I like that it goes down to
the state goes all the way down the stem
there's a high-class plastic there's a
plastic additives here sweet all right
Cheers chair to no man's sky breeze okay
hmm that tastes like a beach punched me
in the face wow it's extremely sweet oh
wow to the beer but you know what if I
started with that that would be the task
no this is a vacation drink yeah it is
it's like little little a by the pool
right here your maybe through space oh
yeah a little bit about that for first
go over atmosphere there you there you
go up there you go now now we're on
vacation absolutely can we get a little
Hawaiian there you go we've discovered a
new planet it's called Aruba planet
Arriba well thank you for that Mike
those are good welcome guys thank you
for trying it oh thank you make any bags
for this yeah do we have more things in
the Chairman right now what do you want
to shout out some people let's do a few
more shoutouts thank you guys so much as
YouTube chats really active today so
continue our questions we're heading
into the xbox one ps4 and no man's sky
said we have in our captions but thank
you to is on 8 and 79 Dustin Joe who
wants a shout out for his newborn and
his wife baby Jojo yeah baby Jojo Raj
Raj on hello nice my performance also
asked about hgr gaming which we'll get
to it yes hi bass polo Nick Amarillo who
was wondering we're talking about so
we're moving at the game consoles in no
man's sky and donahoo said he's going to
subscribe thank you alright thank you so
much you ever take apart one of these
umbrellas oh yeah you're the dumps in
there no they don't stand up too much
close examination yeah there's a next
time though this is they do do that you
can do this for a long time it doesn't
get old no next I'm serious everybody
next time you get one of these open it
up well first enjoy it right enjoy for
the sir
it provides but then open it up and like
there's some stuff in here mm-hmm I'm
serious it sounds crazy you'd be like
Jeff what the hell you talking about
trust me all right sony has invited
press to an event on September seventh
in New York City to announce obviously
the PlayStation neo this is the step up
console from the ps4 which was dubbed a
PS 4.5 nerdiest name I didn't do it or
did you do it no it's not your fault not
my fault yes five it's not the PS five
or point two five could be feels like it
leave it like a point three seven
something like that so check out the
rumored specs where respects for the
PlayStation neo 4k graphics for games in
Ultra HD 4k blu-rays it'll right it will
rock a 2.1 gigahertz AMD processor
processor with Jaguar cores or our which
I guess we'll just that's like the cat
like yet quite leopard course right not
we're not there ya know eight gigabytes
of gddr5 memory which is pretty good all
16 would have been better support for
all current games existing on the ps4
right now so you're not going to buy
this thing and not be able to play a
game that had been on ps4 and vice versa
I was super worried about that thanks
for clearing that up well it's a big
deal right that's a big deal like people
like oh I'm not going to play a ps4 neo
game on my ps4 know right don't worry
they're all going to work yeah the catch
though is that PS 4.5 / neo games
probably going to look and perform
better okay so there's that the events
coming up there's really not a ton to
talk about with that just because we've
known about this for so many months
going in my biggest question is will
this impact / improve PlayStation VR and
I feel like that's something they're
holding back the messaging has been a
little cloudy yeah whether or not
they're going to do that so for me don't
forget PlayStation VR comes out October
13th what's that going to look like is
this going to be really the system you
want to play it on
maybe not so much on standard ps4
especially the specs for oculus rift and
HTC vive are I think considerably higher
than what a PlayStation 4 if it places
where the piece absolutely are way
higher yeah so you would imagine maybe
that ps4 point five catches up it's
still nowhere near the modern
state-of-the-art GPUs but maybe it
narrows the gap just a little bit yeah
and you got to say if they do make it
you know slightly better is that going
to be now immediately or develops going
to take a while right to implement that
extra VR horsepower and maybe Lee a
couple years down the road before you
start see differences between the two
totally and there's there's a lot to
unpack here it's not something we can do
in the few minutes we have here but but
the way you got to think about it is
Sony basically told all the developers
who make video games they said look we
got this more powerful thing coming out
in a couple months they're kind of
decree that everything that comes out i
believe it's october or September
anything that comes out that month and
beyond must support both sort of spec
sets right so like this games got to
work a certain way on neo and it's got
to work a certain way on ps4 vanilla I'm
carries they can get it to actually make
regular games you could love you are
make regular ps4 games look really good
right there's some like trick things
like backfill that yeah I do ASAP ec
gaming rig can do right and and just you
know up the and and make it better with
4k obviously sure take advantage of the
fact that's got 4k resolution instead of
just you know make it look exactly the
same as ps4 will see how it all shakes
out September 7th not that far away if
your questions are for samedays the
iphone 7 thing I swear to god these guys
just want us dead which one's more
exciting games I felt like they should
oh that's the less what's the lesser of
two evils right there someone jerry
wants to know if why should he should he
buy knee if he doesn't own a 4k TV which
is a relevant question yeah it's another
question I think you're still gonna you
are still going to get graphical
improvements on your regular TV like
that's something that it's tough to sort
of suss out you know I think we can out
so we can trust them yeah what's that
won't until we can actually look at yeah
yeah for sure um you know odds are
you're going to get better performance
are coming from a ps4 to a neo that
doesn't necessarily mean you have to get
it so what will sort of be able to suss
that out once we get our hands on it but
the on paper the reason you'd want to
upgrade is to get that graphical jump up
from a ps4 plus possibly future-proof
yourself if you do one day want to buy
their you ok TV yeah we all do xbox
oriented assurance to agent wants to
know if you guys think Microsoft's right
now hyping up their plans for people
though he doesn't want to go to xbox one
Aspen II I guess he's thinking about the
one after that for next year right then
Nick wants to know if he should switch
from PlayStation if you only play is
your question read those are machines so
ever floats your boat yeah likes you
know switching consoles that's kind of
to you you got to go by like the value
and the games really for me it's the
games like if the games that you want to
play are on one platform go to that
platform and if all your friends are on
one platform that's another big exactly
being able to play with them with your
friends is a big deal so most people
like to play on the same platform their
friends are on uh when it comes to what
was the first one if xbox is ramping up
there if they are trying to hype up I
guess by putting out like yeah hey we're
doing this but next year we have this
bigger system yeah it's definitely
strange that xbox one s kind of was was
out with the knowledge that Scorpio is
on the horizon I think their hand was
forced a little bit in terms of having
to be transparent about what their
roadmap looks like nevertheless any kind
of publicity for those guys these days
in this generation of consoles is
probably good they have not been able to
sell as many consoles as sonia's so yeah
we're going to just a good segue right I
mean Scorpio seems to me like you know
the question mark here because it's
still the one nobody's defined yet right
and that really is the way it's sort of
shaping up right the landscape is
Scorpios coming out late next year the
current xbox one is likely going to drop
in price playstation 4 neo seems like
it's going to be a thing this year so
it's like well how does it all you know
kind of shake out yeah i guess another
question we're getting a lot is
should buy the xbox one s and kind of
said no nobody well they did it the
thing is we were talk about HDR before
so the xbox one s is currently the
cheapest 4k blu-ray player hmm so this
happened the ps3 it was the cheapest
blu-ray player right and it was by far
the best at the time and it helped
really make blu-ray decent you know
relevant format for a few years I think
Xbox one s doesn't really have that same
sort of opportunity just because
streaming is so much more popular now
than discs but if you're that guy that
just bought a 4k TV and you want to have
the best you know video quality
experience the xbox one s is less
expensive by you know 7,500 bucks then
the other for cable recovered by Samsung
it's out right now so that's that's one
reason sure but it's a pretty niche
reason it's pretty nice reason and you
know you and I had certainly an
interesting time trying to get it to
work the right way took a really long
time to get HDR to play right yeah even
even things as simple as like getting
that 4k resolution to first sort of show
up yeah involved a bunch of updating and
unplugging and handshaking what not
playing in the settings menu something
there it's tough to comprehend you're
gonna have to dive a little deep it's
not very user-friendly right um ah you
know someone brought up before about HDR
in games and is that a thing it is but
Xbox is only going to have three games
that support it kind of out of the gate
and I believe that's forza horizon three
gears of war 4 and then next year again
called scalebound so that's three games
that are going to support HDR is that
worth the new TV the new xbox probably
not unless you have a kind of disposable
income yeah yeah so think about it like
that Xbox one s weird kind of system
it's the best-looking one they've ever
made there you go give you that too sexy
little box if you're into that so yeah
that's where we're at any other
questions yeah agent wants to post you
guys with so much news about the future
there's always room or speculation
surely on who do you think would be the
victor if we can declare one I don't
it's a little early
doesn't really matter in the long term
future of gaming well I think it does if
you're looking to see like where these
companies go next are they talking about
a victor between xbox ops project
Scorpio and neo uh yeah that's sounds
like they're targeting the future yeah
well I mean look you gotta look at the
way it is now these are not brand new
consoles they're simply step up consoles
so ps4 right now is the better selling
console in my opinion it is the better
experience and they do seem to have the
better library of games so I would
imagine that trend would would follow
through in the next you know four or
five years however long we're headed
with this sort of you know lifespan but
the wild card and Scorpios advantage is
the fact that's coming out later they
can give a better specs right and they
can tell the developers like take
advantage of these better specs and
maybe we'll that manifest more NVR right
exactly which is a big part of this and
which is such a crazy you know resource
hog yeah I like to make a good VR
experience requires you know crazy good
hardware so yeah I think at least
there's that that xbox is later release
date with Scorpio gives them a potential
advantage on paper for sure I think they
are a little further out yeah intern you
know I think calling it a holiday 2017
thing is sort of wishful thinking I hope
it comes out then and it sees the light
of day then but you're betting man no
holiday 2013 I think it would really put
them at a disadvantage if they weren't
able to meet that so so I'm out no
matter what I'm hoping it comes out even
if it doesn't have a fourth wall it
doesn't matter that bring that thing out
David about how much do you think the
ritz a question from earlier but it
bridges over now somebody wants to get a
television that would take advantage of
the 4k gaming and maybe if HDR color can
get into their how much do you think
they'd be spending about now they wanted
a TV well there's there's a huge range
so right now my favorite TV for the
money is a vizio p series that starts at
1,000 bucks for 50 inches and it's 4k
it's got both HDR formats great picture
the very best picture though is OLED
which is a lot more expensive LG's OLED
TV but man that thing is good I mean
it's so good you're like yeah maybe I
can't afford 24
maybe I should remortgage yes so the 65
inch OLED is between you know five and
six thousand dollar ya know for the for
this generation and spectacular picture
but way out of most people's price range
so let's we were buying LED lcds that
visit it was really good you know like
the vizio there's a samsung that's
pretty decent a sony that i reviewed
recently to go on the website you'll see
them but yeah i mean all those tvs are
as future-proof as they can be they've
got the hardware there the hardware
still ahead of the software the TV shows
and movies at this point and the games
you just cited only three HDR games so
you know it you buy one of these TV gon
be set yeah i mean and also i feel like
we always have to kind of like pepper in
these disclaimers xbox one s right now
you cannot play native 4k games that is
not a thing all that's happening is an
upscale yep so keep that in the back
your mind one of the question we got a
bit more kind of a judge but a good joke
um do you own a tube TV I actually still
do because it's the only one that my
playstation 2 will connect to my parents
have more than they should in their
house Wow yeah there's lighting- I think
they have to yeah and I've tried it's
just a lost cause but then just one day
just take it out to the curb and don't
tell them it's heavy don't you get out
hey they are man they've got like a 40
inch and that's not light no 40 inch
tube yeah you she right yeah that's nice
increase was the largest television made
I'm pretty sure I was like turning into
a fish tank or something yeah I know
that thing that's that that's it that's
you can't even get that out of the house
right you just I just a lake house we
have to like start sawing it and happen
now taking it out by pieces that's a
beast it's crazy alright let's let's
pivot into no man's sky that's the big
news this month in terms of gaming from
know people who don't know what no man's
sky is it is a very ambitious space
exploration game that kind of took the
gaming world by storm if only because
people kind of projected these may be
unrealistic expectations on what this
game is gonna wind up being including
David Katz mine so excited he's very
excited to play taking off right
the show running home and downloading it
because the steam is actually able now
so on Twitter people are asking people
to go to their houses and download the
game for them so it's ready when I
really work yeah okay it's not that big
of a game gonna be one of those weekends
yeah yeah I've been playing it for about
15 hours it's it's different I think for
a lot of people it's a game that they
weren't expecting and again that is not
a throat that's not throwing shade at
the developers I think this game kind of
got away from everybody and once that
big sort of e3 demo happened a couple
years ago it kind of blew everyone's
minds and completely changed the
perception of what this game actually is
and what people kind of wanted it to be
so I get that knots understandable at
its core no man's sky is really just a
resource survival Matt of a survival
game inventory management game I know
that was that's like the trio kiss of
death there are moments in this game
that you will literally you know not
believe what you're seeing yeah but
after a while you kind of understand
what this games about I feel terrible
saying this because I'm sitting next to
someone who is very excited to play for
the first time I am still excited
regardless of how many tiny yes which is
great and you should be because the
first couple hours are great i will
offer my own disappointment ya know like
I died I think it likely sat on monday
when i come in i just kind of rest for
you the whole AC version might take
advantage of better specs that's that
might be but the game might look better
yeah that might be it though it's not
going to change gameplay it's not going
to bring you to a level you're like oh
this game offers a different feature set
on pc at least not at the beginning i
mean it i don't know if there's modding
or whatever but at the end of the day
these guys are also saying they're going
to improve aspects of this game a big
selling points for me was like that
there it's a community it's a vibe
basically like a big moma poor even
though you can't actually you know
interact with people right environment
wherever there's so many cool things
about the game that made me really
intrigued I mean it's it obviously the
biggest thing is every plan
go to is spontaneously created for you
which is kind of cool and right and for
me that like the reason I'm going to go
back and play some of that again this
weekend is because I just like rolling
the dice I just like seeing what the
game spits out it's something
technically no one else will ever see so
that's kind of fun just the notion of
like hey the math that this game is
relying on allows it to create stuff
that odds are no one else will ever see
so you know you have dice so it's like
you know you roll a six it's a blue sky
you roll a 1 it's a yellow sky putting
it on down the line so it is part of
your beef it is not enough dice there's
not yeah stuff that can be different
about each world like is it too similar
it despite the fact that they say
there's whatever 19 quadrillion possible
worlds that people can get to and that's
yes simply put like yes that is the
complaint it's because the the asset
pool that this game continually draws
from doesn't allow and I get it like
it's in it it is an achievement what
these guys have done at hello games like
this is a technical achievement at the
same time though because of that and
what they did you know the game does not
allow for the variance that people kind
of project where it's like Oh every put
this could be anything like it's just
not that there's different terrain the
first time I laid it on like what was
mostly a water planet that's pretty cool
yeah um so I think like that's what you
got to kind of keep in the back your
head because after you play for about
five six seven hours to see the same
kind of you get it you understand like
what's happening here every now and then
I'm like allina is uh there's this here
yeah that's interesting okay again the
sense of scale for me is the best part
of this game this game treats you like
you are this a small atomic little thing
in a gigantic seemingly endless endless
universe so for me that sense of scale
they nail it amnael it's so actually
because that's like the thing that video
games kind of have done recently like I
always think a Witcher is like largest
game world I'm sure experience where you
you're like all of a sudden you're in
this other island that's huge right and
and some dude
went out and made all of that by him
right every little turn on the on the
trail as you're riding along and and
even the dlcs gigantic right at game and
it's so big that i still haven't
explored every part of it and i'm
wondering you know it and it seems like
every time you go to something new and
different right with this it's obviously
infinite basically yeah it's essentially
infinite and when you look at something
like the witcher you're right every
square inch of that map was drawn and
render and put together and preconceived
gigantic and it's gigantic where no
man's sky it's sort of just like hey
here's this you know blender we have
let's stop it and see where it stops and
that's kind of like the best way I can
explain it Harold's wondering if you
guys think it'll be too taxing on pcs
which your to discover you did you think
it was just texting when you're playing
on ps4 there's a couple times where you
hid some pretty significant framerate
frame rate dips pc it's gonna be fine
it's going to be fun it's not you know
it taxes the ps4 hardware and i think at
points you're like okay yeah maybe Neil
will do a better job with no man's guy
but i don't think the way to think about
it is like oh this is going to run super
smooth on pc either i don't think the
the sort of like ecology within the game
is open to like very variable perform
you know sort of improvements just based
on the hardware running it I don't know
that's sort of the vibe we get there's a
lot of like texture drawn that you'll
probably wind up seeing in the ps4
version that maybe you won't see in the
pc stuff i don't know yet and it's amin
labs all usually a pc release you know
there's gonna be bugs sure no and
there's budget is passed yeah exactly so
i'm not expecting a totally smooth
weekend yeah because obviously there's a
huge day zero path right i think is
baked into this team it's definitely
bacon so like i want to worry about that
but you know it's it's still not i don't
think it's going to be the smoothest
experience and I don't expect most day
one games to be perfect yeah I'm we spat
rooms I'm definitely curious to hear
what you're saying Monday morning yeah
sure there's a few people asking about
availability for the games that they are
wondering about them if it was available
on early access for steam ID no
and consoles which is ps4 just ps4 and
PC that's so Xbox announced right yeah I
would that's gonna power not be a thing
really yeah that's crazy i could i
remember reading that going wat why
that's yeah I don't know you got you can
infer what you want maybe Sony paid for
some of that development that's just
speculation and hell followed up peace
was wondering if it's essentially a
pretty walking sim uh you know you're
walking for some of it in the beginning
but then it's kind of like flying soon
mm-hmm for a lot of the rest of that
game warping sim it was that warping
warping sent warps else in that yes so
there's a no man's sky if there's
anything else or no do you guys think it
was overhyped one of the persons one of
people earlier chat was wondering why
are we doing so much news about no man's
sky and it was a very big a very big
driver of news this week do you think
over the course the last three years it
was overhyped versus what you put your
playing now definitely everything's
overhyped like let's not it's not
exclusive to no man's sky everything is
overhyped it's the things that supersede
expectation that really are the
remarkable things right most things are
overhyped goodness to assess what so I
feel like you have to really take it for
what it's worth like this game I think
it's more remarkable that this game had
that reaction and again like we talked
about earlier you can't fault anyone for
it like you can't look at the developers
bill you guys made something that seemed
to cool you should have talked down your
games ya can't believe in joyed those if
everybody or the roller coaster that was
you know leading up to the release no
was it over hyped absolutely so you're
saying knock game of the year it isn't I
do not believe that will be game of the
year yeah no man's just then Dustin want
to see your leg tattoo oh right well
it's funny I I'm wearing shorts day
because it is a hundred and eleven
degrees in New York City today I don't
really wear shorts too much but today I
just had to do it I'm sorry it's steamy
outside it's steamy in Katz's house and
Jeff is an avowed cold person yeah your
ear you you should be like living in
or something I should be living in a
grocery store freezer right yeah that's
after all right we're going to wrap it
up thanks so much for joining us on
another edition of open tab have an
excellent safe and fun weekend keep the
conversation going in the chat and
