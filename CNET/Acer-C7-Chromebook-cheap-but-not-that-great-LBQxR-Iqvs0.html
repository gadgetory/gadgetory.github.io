time is pretty much upon us and we're
entering the holidays and you want to
get a bargain and you look in a circular
and you see a laptop that's 199 and it
sounds tempting what is it well it just
might be a Chromebook because
Chromebooks running Google's Chrome OS
are gaining in number and a lot of
people find them pretty useful for
pretty bare-bones experience that's
web-based and provides a lot of stuff
that a laptop might give you in a lower
price point question is why aren't these
Chromebooks better looking and
performing and I'm going to leverage
that onto the acer c7 the acer c7 has
been around since last year now this
Chromebook is 199 or 229 depending on
the tiny spec bump you get inside
whether you get two gigs of ram a
celeron processor and 16 gig SSD or
whether you go up to 4 gigs of ram a 229
this model is the 229 now keep in mind
that's pretty much exactly the same
price as the new Nexus 7 that little 7
inch android tablet that's pretty slick
why would you get this versus that well
of course this has a keyboard this is a
trackpad it runs full web environment
style apps so maybe if you want to use
Google Docs and not feel like you're
being truly hampered this might give a
better experience for that but chrome
while it's made advances is still not
really great for offline it's really
meant to be used online and the battery
life on this is still not great this is
about maybe four hours of battery now a
lot of tablets now we're getting 10 11
hours the new macbook air 10 hours 11
hours I mean you should be expecting 10
hours of battery life this doesn't cut
it although it does come packed with
ports that seem like they've come from
another time period you've got USB 2
you've got full Ethernet you've got vga
on the side that's because this thing is
actually pretty much a netbook this has
been an a retrofitted netbook through
and through that has been purposed to
run chrome OS and I think it's time that
we had models and designs that fit
chrome OS sort of flagship Nexus style
devices and we got the Chromebook pixel
but that is 1200 + dollars runs
beautifully but is way too expensive and
what about the three hundred dollar
price area why is it there something
like the Nexus 7 for Chromebooks it's
not here yet and pretty much on the
google play store your options might be
the acer c7 at the moment or the samsung
chromebook for two hundred fifty dollars
they're pretty similarly spect out I
might lean towards the samsung one
because the battery life might be a tiny
bit better and the design feels a little
more comfortable because of this
trackpad and keyboard and kind of subpar
display and speakers you're not going to
have a lot of fun using this unless
you're just using it to write emails and
documents but if you really really want
a bare-bones chromebook netbook type
experience i'm not going to hold you
back go for it just before warned i'm
scott's time and that's a look at the
acer c7 once again with 16 gig SSD last
year we looked at the one with a 320 gig
hard drive happy shopping</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
