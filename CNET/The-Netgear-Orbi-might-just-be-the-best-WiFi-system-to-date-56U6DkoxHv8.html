from Netgear they say router
I liked it actually a Wi-Fi system why
because apart from this router here you
also have this add-on Irit the two work
together now hard work
well first you connect this router here
to your modem or any internet source
through this one port right here and
then turn it on after that take this
add-on unit here move it away from the
first one maybe 60 80 feet away and also
turn up now you will have a very large
Wi-Fi network which is the combined
coverage of the both units now the two
of them here are configured to work
together so if you make changes to the
router network it will be replicated to
the add-on units ooh so in other words
the add-on unit here is the wireless
Wi-Fi extender of the first router now
personally up to now I'm not a fan of
Wi-Fi extender because they tend to use
the same band to receive and we podcast
the Wi-Fi signal resulting in a huge
loss of signal up to 50% but the orbit
is different the two of them here use a
dedicated quad stream band to connect
the two after that they will have
another tube and one on five your hood
and another on topographic hood to
podcast signal for Wi-Fi clients so
client connect to the router here or the
add-on unit will receive the same result
no signal loss now the tricky part to
find the right spot to place the add-on
unit too far from the router here it be
there be no signal to extend and to
close well it cannot optimize the
coverage area to help with that it comes
with these color-changing ring on top
here make sure the ring shy solid blue
during setup process now in type of
performance these two are actually
excellent in my testing it has the
sustain speed of some 400 megabit per
second which is not the fastest on the
market but faster than many other
routers and the Wi-Fi range is also
excellent I tested it grid a house of
almost 4,000 square feet and I got
signal to every single corner now of
course it can actually handle a larger
house or maybe smaller
depending on how your home is shaped you
can also get more add-on units here up
to two more to extend the coverage but I
would not recommend that because these
two right here already cost $400 and
each of the add-on it here gonna cost
another $250 so if you add more units
and be too expensive maybe you just
think about moving to a smaller home you
know this is a great Wi-Fi system that
quickly give you large Wi-Fi coverage
without compromising the speed
I like Leola in fact like it so much I
get to here we go grace a - I lied I
actually have a 3 that's how much I like
it and that's because I'm don't know and
with all these three here I sure have an
OG Wi-Fi system from that gear</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
