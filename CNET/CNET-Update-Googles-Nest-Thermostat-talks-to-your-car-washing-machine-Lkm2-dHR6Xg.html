will take control of the AC system I'm
Bridget Carey and this is your scene
that update if you want to cool the
temperature of your home air conditioner
just ask Google to do it for you the
nest smart home thermostat is evolving
to automate your home in new ways it
will be able to communicate with various
other appliances and apps Google is the
parent company of nest so for starters
you will be able to use Google now voice
commands on your smartphone to change
the thermostat settings but the nest
will work with more than just google the
device can talk to whirlpool laundry
machines to activate energy saving modes
and certain mercedes-benz models can be
programmed to tell the nest to set the
temperature when the car is heading back
home and if the nest protect detects
smoke well the lifx color changing LED
light bulb will turn red and start
flashing now if all this connectivity
and shared data has you on red alert
nest says it's aware of possible
security concerns it programmed in some
safeguards and it will not share emails
names or home addresses with other
companies now if you want to truly live
in the home of the future you're going
to need a robot but don't worry it's
really easy and affordable to print and
program your own robot buddy thanks to
Intel this is Jimmy the robot he's an
open sourced walking talking machine
that anyone can program and build
starting at sixteen hundred dollars his
plastic body design is printed from a 3d
printer but you don't need to have a
printer at home Intel can mail you the
pieces to snap together you don't need a
college degree to program Jimmy that
will be apps to make it easy to give the
robot different commands the goal has
always been to get it into schools we've
really been talking with makers and
roboticists who will go and build it
themselves but really the goal is to get
as many kids imagining designing and
building robots as possible you don't
have to have a PhD you don't have to
learn artificial intelligence use
download apps you can go to the App
Store and download apps too so your
robot will do whatever you want it to do
Jimmy is powered by Intel's Edison ship
which is the same processor that Intel's
using for small wearable devices
the goal is to have him and other
designs available for purchase in
September intel has a few other
innovations coming out this year it
created a camera for laptops and tablets
that can understand distance you can
have a conference call on skype that
crops out the background so it only
shows you on the screen and then you can
back away to disappear the camera also
can create a 3d image of anything to be
turned into plastic on a 3d printer I
think I'll need to use this to scan my
face so I can replace Jimmy the robots
head with my head and I shall create a
robo Bridget that's your tech news
update from our studios in New York I'm
