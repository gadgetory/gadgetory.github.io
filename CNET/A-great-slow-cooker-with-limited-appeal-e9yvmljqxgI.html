appliances here with the crockpot we mo
smart slow cooker this crock pot isn't
available yet in stores but it's coming
soon and will retail for 130 dollars at
first glance it looks like a plain old
crock pot it has the stainless steel
finish the see-through lid and the
stoneware crock inside pretty basic but
it has something that no other crock pot
in the world has Wi-Fi connectivity it
doesn't really bring new features but it
changes the way you use them and when
you can use them so instead of having
the timer and the adjusters only
available on the display all of that is
transferred to the Wemo app the name
Wemo may sound familiar that's because
it's a partnership between the belkin
wemo home automation products and Jarden
brands who makes crock pots so actually
the functionality on the display has
been toned down I really like that a lot
of traditional crock pots look kind of
dated and cluttered this one has a
single button and that button turns it
from off too high to low and then back
to warm so basically all the other
features are available on the Wemo app
you can set a timer receive
notifications when your food is done and
make adjustments to the temperature
whenever you want it works over Wi-Fi 3G
and 4G so basically wherever you are
with your phone or tablet you should be
able to control your crock-pot the one
problem I had is that the app can't
distinguish between a power outage and
an issue with your Wi-Fi so if there's a
blip in your home Wi-Fi you're going to
get a notification that says this crock
pot maybe off your food may be spoiled
there's really no way of knowing if it
was a power outage or just a Wi-Fi issue
so while everything worked well I really
like the Wemo app it was accessible and
easy to use this really may not be for
everyone I really like that i can put
food in my $40 crock pot in the morning
and let it go all day and not worry
about it at all not have to check in on
it that's part of the beauty of it for
me and I'm willing to trade a little bit
of food quality for the convenience of
being able to just leave it all day and
not have to bother with it but if you're
someone who likes to check in and have
more control and say you're running late
getting home this is pretty cool you can
go right on your app from
ever you are change it to warm so it
doesn't overcook or whatever and then
you're good one surprising thing I
noticed is that if compatibility isn't
available for this crock pot now it may
be coming in the future but right now
it's not available but then again do you
really want to set custom recipes for
your crock pot it may not be necessary
it might be one of those times when if
compatibility really won't improve your
home automation experience overall
though it's great it looks nice it's
sleek and streamlined it's a little bit
expensive at one hundred and thirty
dollars but if you want that control
it's a great option thanks for watching
