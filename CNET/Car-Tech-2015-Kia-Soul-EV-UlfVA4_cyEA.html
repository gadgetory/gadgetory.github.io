rockstar in its category on a big seller
now they've got an electric version I'll
be able to take something that is of
special essence to the soul and make it
a great and different Evie or is it a
look-alike car with a big battery let's
drive that's 15 soul electric and check
detector now a soul Evie looks just like
any other soul the body is the same spot
one of these guys by the unusual grill
where the charging door lives these
aerodynamic alloy wheels some badges on
the side and obviously no tailpipes
the battery basically lays flat along
the floor but kicks up toward the rear
and therefore the rear seats do lose
three inches of legroom now a soul Evie
is thirty four five with destination
there are no tech options so that's the
price CNET style but take off ten if you
roll in federal and California tax
credits at least for 24 five let's see
what you get now inside the soul it's
like just about every other soul with
some differences in the instrumentation
let's start on the left there you've
obviously got your traditional gauge it
shows whether you're using power or
regenerating it there's your battery
level and your projected range and on
the right a digital speedo with some
bizarre band around it that shows you
what speeds apparently are more
efficient on battery usage though I find
it hard to believe that 50 and 90 are
equally efficient as it suggests in the
main head unit with the eight inch
screen you get navigation is standard on
this car also bluetooth streaming all
the major sources rear camera under the
UVO button there telematics system
you've gotten beyond just sort of the
OnStar competitor now you can add in
some meaningful apps like Yelp
SoundHound and iHeartRadio we've seen
most of this before what I want to go to
is this button here the evie screen
here's where you really get some
difference on the so levy obviously you
got your range indicator here which can
also give you a graphical map kind of
sack bomber style or put up a list of
nearby charging stations you can also
see these on a map low not from this
screen and the screen to show you what
systems are using juice to drive
obviously uses the most of it you can
also see what climate and other
electronics are sapping from your
all-important rain
eco-driving lets you play a silly game
like turn that tree all blue green
because you drive efficiently we'll do
that for about a week and you get bored
with it here's where you can program
your charging times tell the car to
charge automatically at certain times
and also set up its pre conditioning of
the Interior cabin and a setting here
for evey route that means when you
program a place on the navigation system
it's gonna indicate whether you're gonna
have a problem getting there on your
current charge and then of course guide
you to charging stations along the way
if need be now to drive this guy you've
got a traditional looking transmission
selector but of course no transmission
neutral Park reverse Drive and B is your
high regen mode below that is an eco
button so here's how it works standard
Drive is kind of your most power and
your least region putting it into Eco
mode
tapers back the power and increases the
regen drag a little bit you're a little
more efficient and then putting it in B
and eco gets you the least acceleration
forward and the highest region when you
decelerate now powering the sole evie is
of course an electric motor backed up by
a 27 kilowatt battery pack that's near
the top of the industry in the
measurement of watt hours per pound it's
very dense
horsepower is a measly 109 but torques
what you care about at 210 pound feet
front wheel drive only zero to 60 is
lazy on paper 11 point 2 we'll check it
on the road
you get 93 miles of EPA rated range that
may be the best out there sort of a
Tesla Model S this one costs a lot less
your mpg rating is 120 charging is done
up here behind this door
two outlets the one on the left it's you
household current at 120 volts to use
that you want to remake the longest day
because that's 24 hours if you put a 240
outlet in there you're gonna get done in
four to five hours and the one on the
right is a high current charger 480
volts if you can find one of those
stations you're looking at 33 minutes to
get an 80% charge now a so levy weighs
about 500 pounds more than a standard
sole give or take that's like throwing
out three passengers that's a lot so it
has that very planted very sort of heavy
footed electric car ride but it's got
that great torque it feels much quicker
than that 11 some odd seconds we saw on
paper
quiet inside with one problem this is
piercing like eight kilohertz wine
almost all the time you especially
notice that if you crack the windows
that's a good deal breaker for me it's
really audible I think an interesting
carryover from the standard soul is this
steering wheel mode button here on the
wheel for comfort normal or sport feel
which is going to give you a difference
in weight and assist you particularly
feel at a higher speed I'm just poking
around the city right now and it's
imperceptibly different but it's a nice
coupling to go with your drive modes the
Kia Soul is available only in a few
states so for the most part it's
somewhere between a compliance car and a
side bet it doesn't break a lot of
ground but does have the best range
anywhere near its price class and one of
those high level super fast chargers but
perhaps more importantly it doesn't lose
its soul illness as it sheds its engine</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
