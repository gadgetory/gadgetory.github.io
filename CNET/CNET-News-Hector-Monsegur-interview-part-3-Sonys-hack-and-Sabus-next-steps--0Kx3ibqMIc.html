with any facilities and Mallis allowing
to continue in those circles is in any
way state-sponsored hacking were you
worried about that's bringing any
retribution from from other state
entities no I was a sponsored hacking
there was no coerce meant there was no
you know hey can you hack into Syria it
would be really cool and it is really
bugged out that I have to sit here and
kind of like defend the FBI because the
FBI never said well we need you to hack
into Iran please do that we kind of need
some stuff they never told me that
mainly because regality issues and
mainly because I still had an open case
you know I could have been able to go to
court one of the judges say well they
they forced me to hack it so like I
don't know pick a country and you know
this is this is crazy I mean what can I
do provide in my case you know they were
pretty legal about it they just they
just said just do what it is that you do
or basically and regards the operation
and I said that was my doing law sec
died I was in a situation where they
just want me to keep doing what I'm
doing so I basically have some sort of
green light to just continue being me
well okay so we're gonna create an
operation anti security which is like
you know a shout out to the old anti SEC
of the 90s which are you know I loved
and really enjoyed those times so you
know I kept on with the hacktivism the
idea of hackers uniting I loved the idea
of getting Indonesian hacker and you
know the Brazilian hacker or a Pakistani
hacker and the a Chinese hackers all to
work together on operations I mean it's
wonderful like it goes back to when I
was reading the hackers manifesto we are
all alike it doesn't matter our
nationality our race or creed we could
work together for a common good in this
case it was trying to expose oppression
corruption within you know governments
around the world tyrannical or not don't
you think that message is a little bit
tainted though given that you were at
that point working with the FBI I don't
know it was tainted I was still still
doing what I was doing working with the
FBI is just you know a consequence of me
getting caught but it doesn't change
what
it doesn't change my perspective it
doesn't change what I was doing you know
I can have like I can I could continue
my operations by all means all right
guys come on let's do something yeah
there's a hole that's right in Greece
okay well let's see what we can do about
Greece let's move to present day
what sort of technologies are you using
today I mean are you still online or
using a PC no I you know I I technically
I could be online and technically I
could use a laptop PC whatever I choose
not to because I am on supervised
release and I don't want to complicate
that mm-hmm
I have a good relationship with the
people over there and you know Souls I
don't start getting online and I
basically it's to be real with you I
don't want to be in a situation where
someone could frame me and say well I
think Sabu is hacking again and then the
government's like the world he hasn't
been on a computer in a couple years I
don't want to be in a situation where
I'm online and someone frames me and I
got to get investigated all over again
you know what I rather just wait till
you know five or six months from now
it's not the live a normal life and then
I'll get back online and then I'll just
start you know whatever can I get your
thoughts on the most recent Sony hack
whoa
it's an interesting situation very
interesting is the interesting situation
because there's a lot of propaganda
evolve there's a lot of misinformation
and let's just say like this I don't
want to go to details but Sony has been
compromised for at least six years that
I know of the people that are claiming
to be GOP or whatever it is now I read
in the newspaper I want to be surprised
that those are the guys that originally
owned Sony way back one that you know
were in control of source codes that
were in control of you know movies and
access to you know developer networks
and all that this is not a new hack
think about it as do this let's let's
really think about it if you do a
penetration test and you're trying to
infiltrate a network the amount of
access that these guys access so the
amount of access that they were able to
obtain it would have taken them several
months maybe three years
especially since they were able to
identify a lot of the you know for
example the password files I don't
really know I don't know like from what
the newspaper says I don't know how all
that information was dispersed but what
if these files were all distributed
across the network tonight means they
had to go around penetrating the entire
network accumulating password files as
they went they had to access source
codes movies and all that which I'm
pretty sure was not hosted on one server
mm-hmm clearly they had to really do a
like a thorough audit of the entire
infrastructure so whoever hacked Sony
has been inside there for a very very
long time and we haven't seen the end of
it like I think the next step if they if
the people at Sony haven't done already
is the surprise start changing the
router passwords before these guys the
Lidl of the routes and bring Sony
completely offline now before this
interview I went online and asked for
some questions from people on Twitter
basically seeing if they had any
questions for you as you can imagine
there's still a fair amount of animosity
out there how does that make you feel
that so many of your former associates
have pretty bad feelings about this for
most these people were not my former
associates most these people are just
random people that you know I barely had
a relationship with or if I did have
some sort of conversation with them then
I was pretty minimal
you also have to look at these people
these are the same people that March 5th
2012 loved me oh my god sad boy you
doing some great stuff we hate the
government we hate Fox News now March 6
comes oh my god we hate Saboo Fox News
is the best the government is completely
right you have to believe this story
you have a major issue that I mean this
is too wishy-washy is to flip-flop it is
just you can't you can't beat you know
you can't have an opinion on on both
situations and just flip that quick and
expect me to take you serious you were
also saying around March 5th that you
hated the government - absolutely said
the feds of this moment are scouring our
lives without warrants without judge
approval this needs to change ASAP
wasn't that effectively what you're
helping them do at the time no I wasn't
identifying anybody that's one thing I
want to make clear you know because
there's there's like this big thing that
they keep pushing and mind you all these
ideas came from the fox news stories in
new york times which basically recycle
the fox news story you know that i
identified anybody okay
how can identify anybody that i have no
understanding of the location or
nationality where they are where they
live how do you think how they breathe
all I know is this pseudonym if you read
the large in the evidence and you know
if the people from the free Jeremy
campaign or some adamant that there's
proof in there evidence that I brought
him down or identified them then leaked
the entire discovery get all the IRC
logs out there and show the people but
you have a done song and they haven't
done so because it's probably got of the
issues but you haven't done so because
mainly what's in there and it's just
normal random conversations there's
never one single instance where I'm like
hey that's let's imagine you you know
you're your pseudonym is not a ninety
Tim all right hey a ninety Tim what's it
what's your address I want to send you
something really cool what's your name
yo case can you direct connect means I
want to send you a picture sort of funny
you know when you direct connect to
somebody you're exposing IP address
right hey do you have an email address
and they send you like a dump you know
like all this information never required
I never asked for and when anyone was
you know starting to like be get too
close to me I would push them away a lot
of people really call me like you know a
jerk right they thought I was a jerk
because you know I was so mean or
whatever you know it's just that just
leave me alone like I don't want to know
about your life cuz I don't want you to
one day say oh he entrapped me he got me
arrested look at this situation you know
it's a real shame and it's sad I'm
really against people going to prison
except for like pedophiles or whatever
murderers but there's we didn't shave
this guy's in prison but you have to you
have to think about the situation he
committed crimes he made mistakes it was
a rest by the FBI prior the FBI had a
profile on him
he fit the profile he got caught I never
put a gun up to his head to his head and
said hey you got a hack strap for her
what she didn't do any way someone else
hack staffer so you want to sit here and
judge me you once said here I say aw boy
he's a rat he's an informant well listen
I'm sorry you feel that way
I don't really care what you have to
think he made mistakes he got caught
man up I got caught I had him to do what
I had to do I did time in prison it's
not like I skipped through the entire
process I was in prison relax I became a
teacher in prison how about you become a
teacher in prison and stop you know
writing all this propaganda you know I
mean I know that's not the popular
opinion
all right people want me to sit here and
apologize and have remorse I'm sure
that's one of your questions you know
does he have remorse for he did well I
have remorse for my family that they had
to suffer do this and I have amours for
his mother that you know she's really
pushing for to him to get released and
have an appeal and all that I have a lot
of respect for that and I understand how
it feels to have a family member with a
prison I had three family members go to
prison for 10 years so I understand but
it's time that people see the situation
as it is we all criminals right we made
mistakes we got caught mm-hmm accepted
it's being a family is your family still
together were you able to keep custody
up here absolutely yeah it's great yeah
so what's what's next for you what do
you hope to do from here going forward
well I mean when I was in prison I had a
great opportunity to get to know people
from different walks of life and this is
actually a really good point I wanted to
make in regards to the whole topic we're
just talking about I've got to meet a
lot of really cool people from different
walks of life with different situations
being a prison for you know murder or
whatever the thing that I notice a lot
is people had no understanding of their
privacy rights or how to protect
themselves okay I'm pretty sure some of
them were criminals like murderers like
I'm not down for that that's not cool
but there were other people there that
were there simply got caught up in
conspiracies do you know how easy it is
to be caught up in a conspiracy I mean
you can have someone or more friend of
yours call you like hey you know I have
some
Foxy's you want some you're like sure
why not and you know it's illegal so now
boom you're part of a conspiracy West
soon as you go visit him to get the oxys
and the feds are listing they're gonna
pick you and him up I guess what that
conspiracy charge is a minimum of 10
years all right so I feel like I want to
help prisoners I feel like I feel like I
want to help people in general with
understanding privacy bringing privacy
to nonprofits I mean look I took it to
media and journalists in general I find
that a lot of companies news people have
no understanding of security whatsoever
I made a good point on you know another
talk that I had regarding a certain
interviewer who did it probably to
control his own email and this is a
common trait within people in media
where they have in terms of other people
controlling their communications when
you do that you provide us write us so
you can write hackers an alternative
attack vector right the same way the
government provides hackers an
alternative attack vector by hiring
federal contractors to essentially
handle all their security communications
so it's time that people start you know
getting educated they start getting
educated and have people like me and
others just talk about it
so that's what I want to do I'm a
teacher by heart like I want to want to
teach at some point and help people you
know with security because that's
apparently my forte is what I've been
through so I hope you have an
opportunity to do so Hector thank you
for your time thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
