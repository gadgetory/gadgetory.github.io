set of new features and settings that
drain your battery KitKat here on the
Nexus 5 is no exception so if you want
better battery life here are some tips
GPS is always a big battery hog even
when you're not using Google Maps when
you check in using Facebook or even take
a photo your phone pinpoints your
location to minimize the effects on your
battery head over to settings location
then mode and enable battery saving most
of the time you'll still get a pretty
accurate location reading and for the
times you need precise tracking switch
it back to high accuracy Google search
is also a culprit with its new hot word
detection anytime you're on the home
screen you can say ok Google to prompt a
new search or voice action but that
means your phone is constantly listening
and waiting for you to say those magic
words to turn that feature off head to
Google now then settings then voice and
disable hot word detection if you have
an NFC enabled phone like this Nexus 5
make sure it's only on when you need it
and same goes for Android Beam which is
based on NFC just head to settings then
more under that Wireless and network
section to disable it you should also
check to see that KitKat is only syncing
the data you absolutely want synced
general syncing options can be found
under account settings here you'll find
all the data that's being synced to
disable one just uncheck the Box google
photos in particular is a big battery
hog so if you don't need Google
uploading every photo you take be sure
to disable it and finally don't forget
to make use of the battery tool in the
quick settings menu just swipe down to
reveal the notification bar hit this
icon then tap the battery icon here
you'll see a list of processes and how
much battery they're consuming if you
see that an app is
consuming too much of your battery shut
it down if you have any questions along
the way it hit me up on Twitter and
