sitting in a 2014 Chevy Impala this car
comes out this spring and it's got the
next-generation MyLink infotainment
system now this is mostly a new
interface over the standard features
that Chevy previously roll that with
MyLink so you of course you've got
hands-free phone calling navigation
digital audio and also some apps like
Pandora and weather but the really cool
thing about this new interface is it
borrows a lot from the smart phone
similar to an iPhone I can actually
rearrange the icons on the screen you
only see eight icons per screen and you
could have multiple screens so plenty of
icons plenty of apps whatever GM offers
in the Chevy Impala I can also drag one
of these icons up into this upper bar
here and there's about four icons that
stay static in the upper part of the
screen when I'm on other screens so I
can have quick access to things like
navigation or phone or Pandora is what I
just put up there and to get out of the
edit mode I just push this home button
and beyond that customization there's
also my new favorite feature here
it's called favorites these take the
place of presets where you used to be
able to save different radio stations XM
FM AM now you can save pretty much
anything and Chevy actually lets you
save phone numbers destinations pretty
much anything that's included in the
infotainment system as a favorite so you
can have immediate access to it you can
just push the button and make a phone
call
switch a radio station we also see a few
other things in here like a new
navigation system this is stored on
flash drive and we got different maps
here to look really good and one cool
trick with this new MyLink system is
that say you have a radio station
playing here you can hold your finger
across here swipe it across the screen
and it'll send it to the instrument
cluster display and one funky thing too
is this whole screen opens up and we got
a little binnacle in here where you can
store your phone keep it out of side out
of your hands

MyLink system in the 2014 chevy impala
