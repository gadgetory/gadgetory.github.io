ball that chases after your pet instead
of setting up a regular security cam to
spy on your furry friend the pet sitter
will move around the house to keep a
closer eye or entertain him while you're
at work
put the Wi-Fi enabled tracking collar on
your pet and the Sphero like ball will
automatically figure out where he's been
hiding out depending on the setting and
the excitement level of the dog or cat
it will then initiate play or just
observe at least in theory because at
the time of our demo the feature was
still very much in beta the ball has an
HD camera with a wide-angle lens that
streams the image live to the peppy app
on your smartphone you can be a passive
observer or take control of the ball
yourself and use the app as a remote
when you want to interact with Fido it
has a microphone and speaker system that
allows you to speak to him or listen in
or point a laser at him if that still
doesn't get his attention which it did
that our test copies seemed to lose
interest pretty quickly
aside from tracking the dog's
whereabouts in the house the collar also
serves as a Fitbit for your pet so you
can see if he's getting his steps in or
what time of day he's most active both
the ball and collar charge via microUSB
or you can park the ball in this kennel
shaped inductive charger the heavy pet
sitter would seem like a good fit for
city-dwelling pet owners if the company
can get it to work seamlessly it
launched on Kickstarter for an early
bird price of one hundred and twenty
four dollars and will then go up to two
hundred and fifty once it's funded this
includes football with the design of
your choice a replacement cover the
collar and the charger now getting your
dog to play with a motorized ball might
be the harder sell</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
