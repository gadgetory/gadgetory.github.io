do some psychic readings for a change
that's because i have this ball right
here it's not crystal but it's super
bright anyway and look into it i can
have but seeing myself handsome smart
intelligent very good at english and of
course extremely modest but i can also
read your mind so let's see oh you'll be
to do some review on some storage device
instead got it let me do some magic here
let me turn this thing around and voila
that you have it this is the only Lucy
christov sphere external hard drive or
less spam scene let's see if friends
complete would explain a lot about the
unique design now the sphere is like no
other drives I've seen is handmade with
silver plated steel chassis it's more
like a piece of jewelry than a piece of
computer hardware is one of those things
you put on your desk because you want to
not because you have to and when you do
you can use it as a mirror to look at
yourself or check if somebody's
approaching you from behind but the size
or even from a bath and on top of that
is also offer one terabyte of storage
space that's right underneath here the
device has a micro USB 3.0 port this is
the only pod needed for it to work you
can use it with any standard USB cable
it does come included with this stylish
3-footer here on the front here there's
a small status light that blinks when
there's data activities and in my
testing the sphere was very fast
offering more than 100 megabytes per
second data speed when used with USB 3.0
it also worked with you speed 2.4 let's
see the sphere comes preloaded with
health phone software that helps you
format the drive or the max up pc backup
your computer and create a secure
partition to store important data it
also comes with two year warranty from
the sea so the question is how much of
it well it's not cheap as you might have
a guest at four hundred and ninety
dollars but before you start to get mad
yes I just wrapped in my own game
remember this is a piece of art deco and
most art deco has no part
to use this one does in fact most
jewelry has no practical use so maybe
you should start thinking if you likely
put a study ball on it and for that
purpose this thing is the deal and the
fact that it can keep the data safe it's
a bonus again this is the most expensive
one to buy extra hard drive I've ever
seen but for my money nothing scream
romance better than when you say hey you
here's my shiny ball will it be my
valentine I know I would say yes and I'm
not even French that's because I'm don't
know and this has been the first look at
the crystal sphere policy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
