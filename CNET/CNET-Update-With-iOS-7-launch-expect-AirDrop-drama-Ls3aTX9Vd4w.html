strangers I'm Bridget Carey and this is
your cnet update if you don't want to
upgrade to the latest operating system
on your iPhone or iPad you will not be
blocked from downloading new apps
anymore before some apps require the
latest version of iOS and if you didn't
upgrade you were out of luck but now if
you have older software Apple will let
you download an older version of the app
that's compatible this flexibility helps
people with older devices like the
iPhone 3GS which cannot get the new iOS
7 and it helps people who don't want to
upgrade by choice remember last year
when many people didn't want to upgrade
to iOS 6 right away to avoid using Apple
maps this time the new iOS 7 will have a
dramatic new look along with new
shortcuts and menus iOS 7 will roll out
to devices on Wednesday and are a few
noteworthy new tricks in iOS 7 a swipe
from the bottom of the screen pulls up a
control center shortcut for different
settings which is something Android
devices already could do Theory can now
be a man and can understand English
French and German it can store your
online passwords securely and even your
credit card info if you're shopping
online and you don't want to pull out
your credit card to type it all in
manually FaceTime can now be done with
just audio over Wi-Fi iTunes radio for
streaming music is making its debut but
perhaps the most interesting is airdrop
which can share files wirelessly with
other nearby iPhones and iPads so if a
complete stranger near you wants to send
you a photo you'll get a prompt on your
phone that someone nearby is trying to
send you a message so instead of buying
girls a drink well guys in bars send
photos to get a stranger's attention it
seems like an easy way to harass a
stranger or get advertisements on your
phone while walking through the mall
this could get interesting iOS 7 will
work with iphone 4 and later the latest
ipod touch and the ipad 2 and later but
not every feature will be coming to
every device like airdrop for example
it's only on the iPhone 5 and this
year's new iPhones along with the newest
ipads and ipod touch if you have an
older device you may want to wait a day
or two before upgrade to see if there
any bugs that need to be worked out and
be sure to backup your files before
upgrading to make sure it all goes
smoothly Android users there's some love
for you to this week the Google Wallet
app is rolling out to all Android users
in the US it doesn't mean everyone gets
that tap to pay ability but it does let
people securely send money to any US
resident with an email address and if
you're real wallet is full of those
plastic loyalty and rewards cards from
retailers the app will store those
barcodes digitally that your tech news
update but you get more details on these
stories at cnet com / update or follow
along on Twitter from our studios in New
York I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
