wish list for the iphone 5 hot new
phones from HTC and samsung perk up your
iphones puny battery life and the kobo
vox takes aim at the kindle fire it's
all coming up right now
I ever when I'm Hollywood and welcome to
the Cena tech review where we collect
our hottest videos of the week and tell
you what's good and what's bad in the
world of tech plus offer our own unique
tech wisdom in the form of the bottom
line let's start things off with the
good good news for those of you who have
been waiting for all the cool windows
phone phones to come out they are
starting to arrive samsung announced two
new windows phones this week and one of
them is even 4G have a look at the focus
s and the focus flash hi I'm Bridget
Kerry Wood seen it and we're here with
two new windows phones from ATT the
samsung focus s and the samsung flash
now their sister phones but the focus s
has a bigger screen its 4.3 inches and
it has a better camera in the back eight
megapixel the focus flash is your lower
end one it's a little on the cheaper
side smaller screen 3.7 inches and a 5
megapixel camera in the back now as
sister phones they both have a lot in
common they're both mango so that's
windows seven point five they both have
an internal 1.4 gigahertz processor and
I'm told they both of the same amount of
memory as well and they're both on the
ATT hspa+ 4g network the focus s is
going to be about two hundred dollars
with the contract and the focus flash
it's going to be about fifty dollars so
definitely for a more affordable phone
you're going to get a little bit in a
smaller package but internally it's
about the same now taking just a look at
the focus s this is a very thin phone it
has a plastic back but it has a nice
texture to it so doesn't feel too
slippery you have a dedicated camera
button on the top here and you also have
that in the lower end focus flash both
have a front facing camera this one is
1.3 megapixels design-wise there's just
a small differences as you can see in
the focus flash there's a little bit of
a button design on the windows home
button and you don't see that on the
focus s so there you have it if you're
looking for a Windows Phone this is the
latest and greatest from AT&amp;amp;T on the
windows side you have two different
options to go with depending on your
butt
 pristine at TV I'm Bridget Carey
Bridget Carey was on Sirius New York
phone duty this week because Samsung
wasn't the only company drop in new
phones HTC has another new Android
option and this one is all about the
beats hi I'm Bridget Carey with cnet TV
here at the launch event for the HTC
Rezound on verizon now this is a pretty
powerful phone it's going to be top of
the line you're going to have a 1.5
gigahertz ur inside you're also going to
get 16 gigs of internal memory and an SD
card that has another 16 gigs attached
to it but let's talk about the screen
this is a 4.3 inch high definition 720p
screen the first time you're going to
see that out of HTC so the cameras 8
megapixels with a flash and it record at
1080p HD and the camera itself has a few
extra little features in it like being
able to take action burst shots really
fast or playback your video in slow
motion and the cameras designed to
really in take a lot of light more so
than other cameras so supposedly you
should be able to take some really good
shots and low lighting takes a lot of
hints from the HTC incredible in terms
of design kind of a curved back kind of
this soft textured finish on the back
with some red highlights and the be here
is for beats audio that's the big
standout feature in this because they
integrated Beats Audio technology so
your music is going to sound a little
better and it comes with beats audio
headphones you're also going to notice
HTC sense 3.5 which has unique new
features like having your customizable
icons on the lock screen so I could take
it and just kind of drag it right into
there so it'll immediately open up my
messages mail whatever want to put in
there also when you go into leap view
you'll be able to customize the order of
each of these screens or just drag one
and delete it right from here overall I
can tell this is very smooth experience
and only had a few minutes with it but
just by looking at some of the videos
very sharp and bright imagery so well to
take it back to our labs to get a really
longer look at it but initially it's
pretty sweet it comes ice cream sandwich
ready so it's going to have gingerbread
to start but expect an update on Ice
Cream Sandwich say maybe
next year and it's going to be available
November 14 from verizon at to 9999
foreseen it I'm Bridget Carey so it's
got good sound video and photo editing
on the phone and a low light sensor for
better pictures in the dark party phone
people you heard it here first but for
some of you none of these new amazing
phones can fill the hole that was left
when Apple announced the 4s and not the
iphone 5 I know it hurts so in this
week's top 5 in addition to counting
down the features we're still waiting
for when the five does arrive Ryan
Cooley also offers a lesson in the
classic stages of grief
you know it's funny the release of the
iphone 4s was kind of like a kubler-ross
experience there was denial no I don't
mind it's not an iphone 5 anger wait
it's kind of knife owned five bargaining
come on Apple please just one more thing
depression whatever yes I'll get a droid
and then accept it hey iphone 4s rocks
well now we're through that neurosis we
can move on to what the iphone 4s
immediately makes us think of what we
want in the iphone 5 i'm brian cooley
here with the top five things in that
category leaving out the silly stuff
like removable batteries expandable
storage or flash support the stuff that
Apple's never going to do and taking you
right to the realm of reality we're
going to rank these by how likely it is
we'll get each feature here we go number
five NFC that's near field
communications this is that swipe to pay
with your phone technology that all the
banks and merchants and payment networks
are cranking up in 2012 and which most
consumers think is some kind of Voodoo
that will siphon their bank account
expose their ID or both that
notwithstanding it's pretty likely
apples gonna build NFC into the five
because they have a big stake in the
payment space due to itunes chances here
about forty percent number four is
better battery life the 4s pretty much
just did a lateral on this front so now
apples really on the hook to make the
five go longer on a charge especially
since the macbook air goes all day on
one it's a laptop and the ipad goes all
month on a charge that makes the iphone
the one apple product that doesn't
really have a standout battery story to
tell new cpus and gpus we expect in the
five are going to help out here and the
odds on this one about fifty-fifty
number three is actually the number one
thing cnet users like you tell us you
want that is a screen bigger than a
postage stamp the long-standing three
and a half inch iphone display is just
plain dinky these days you really feel
it when watching a video or if you use
the phone as a navigation device yet we
still rank bigger screen at
maybe fifty percent likelihood because
of the battery hit that a bigger display
might mean see number four and the fact
that the same users who want a bigger
screen also say they don't want a bigger
phone that can be tough number 2 4g if
the iphone 5 doesn't have 4g i will
officially whistle apple's golden era
dead you see 4g phones and networks are
little green right now but by the time
the iphone five comes out 4g phones are
going to be it and the 3gs are going to
be moving fast into the bargain category
also 4g bandwidth is going to do wonders
for iCloud which might dovetail nicely
with an expansion of that service to
finally work with video for the first
time odds here a solid eighty percent
okay before we hit number one remember
another reason for a lot of the
anticipation that'll be built up around
the five are the reports that it was the
last product Steve Jobs really focused
on reportedly allocating the limited
time he knew he had left to this product
it makes sense it's far and away apples
biggest thing in their entire lineup and
therefore it may be the last physical
evidence we ever get of jobs vision okay
the number one thing we think we'll see
and want to see in the new iPhone 5 is
gonna be a whole new design now we don't
know what the new look might be thinner
more sculpted wider longer curvier who
knows those are all in play as well as a
bunch of crazy ones that I won't even
bore you with but we know this in the
handheld phone space you have to change
up your design once in a while to keep
the coals burning under the hype machine
also consider patents we've seen that
suggests backside multi-touch is coming
this isn't that thing you try and get
away with in a strip club it's a
technology where you control the screen
from behind the device or perhaps we'll
get a completely button free phone both
of those ideas would create a more
spacious screen experience which answers
your number one request whatever it is a
new design is ninety-nine percent likely
with just one percent reserved in case
Tim Cook drinks a whole lot more than we
know if you're intrigued by this short
list and want to see the full one
including the stuff that everybody wants
and that Apple will never give you check
out David car noise full 15 item
slideshow on
things we want to see in the next iPhone
you can find a link to that and a lot
more top 5s like this at top 5 cnet com
I'm Brian Cooley thanks for watching
since Apple has now admitted that iOS 5
is causing battery problems on the
iphone 4s I wouldn't be surprised to see
that issue rise in the top 5 rankings
Apple set of fixes on the way but if you
don't want to wait that long Sharon
Vaknin has some tips to prolong your
battery life right now hey everyone I'm
Sharon Vaknin for cnet com here to help
improve the terrible battery life that
came with iOS 5 especially on the iphone
4s the issue is so bad that Apple's
investigating the problem and might
release a fix but until then I have a
few solutions you can try right now grab
your phone and head to settings to get
started one tip many people swear by is
resetting your network settings first go
to general reset and select reset
network settings enter a passcode if you
have one and your phone will restart
this won't erase any data but you'll
have to reenter your Wi-Fi passwords now
go to location services and turn off any
location services you don't need these
services drain a ton of battery since
they force your phone to constantly find
your location the biggest offender in
this list is probably reminders because
if you set up a location-based reminder
your iPhone will always monitor your
location as it waits to activate your
reminder so you can either disable it
here or hold off on using location-based
reminders until this battery issue is
fixed once you turn off these services
head down to system services and disable
location-based I ads and setting time
zone which you can turn on again when
you travel across time zones alright
we're done with location services and
the next step is to turn off diagnostic
reports your phone may be sending to
Apple periodically so now head to
general about diagnostics and usage and
select don't send this next setting is
Siri related and only applies to the
iphone 4s
go to general Siri and turn off raise to
speak this is a handy feature but it
consistently drains your battery by
monitoring your iPhone's light sensor to
activate Siri it's not fair that we have
to disable useful features for better
battery life but until Apple releases a
fix this could be the best solution if
you did all of the above and you're
still seeing crappie battery life some
users in the apple community forums say
you should condition your battery so let
your battery die which shouldn't take
long then completely recharged it by
using an AC adapter in general you
should do this at least once a month
with these settings in place you should
see your battery life improved but this
doesn't mean Apple is off the hook for
this issue if you have any battery
saving tips let me know on Twitter or my
facebook page and I'll repost them on
how to cnet com for cnet I'm Sharon
Vaknin even if you find that your new 4s
can make it through the day with plenty
of charge to spare these tips can also
help if you know you're going to be away
from a charger over the weekend or in a
remote area or you could just turn off
your phone and enjoy the scenery that
concludes the cell phone portion of our
show for today and now is as good a time
as any for a break we'll be back with
more tech review right after this
welcome back to the cnet tech review our
weekly video digest of all things good
and bad we've seen here at cnet TV
continuing on in the good the 2011 dodge
charger is more likely to turn heads for
its exterior styling but as Wayne
Cunningham shows us the charger is
equally impressive on the inside hi I'm
Wayne Cunningham lacina taking a close
look at dodges new infotainment center
here in the 2011 charger now the first
thing you'll notice about this system
it's got a massive screen this is eight
point four inches and there's no plastic
buttons around the outside dodge put all
the function buttons in a menu across
the bottom here now if i push the
navigation button i get a really
familiar screen here this is actually
garmin navigation software that dodge
integrated into the new infotainment
center now this is pretty good stuff
it's got really good route guidance if i
switch to this plus button here that
gives me serious travel link and the
serious travel link i get movie listings
sports scores gas prices and weather and
that stuff is integrated with a
navigation system so if i find a gas
price that i like I can actually just
hit that button and it was in the
address of that gas station to the
navigation system now if I go to the
stereo I hit this player icon here and I
get a lot of digital audio sources I get
bluetooth streaming audio I get USB
Drive I got ipod integration and even SD
card now I've got a USB Drive actually
plugged into the car right now and this
system used the integrated Gracenote
database to parse all the mp3 tracks
that I've got on there and now I can
browse the tracks on that that drive-by
album genre artists all the normal
things you'd find in an mp3 player with
the phone system here I can get an on
screen keypad and I can actually just
manually enter a number or the system
also copied the phone book from my
perdon to the system and I can search
through and find any name on there I can
also use voice command to call a number
just by hitting this steering wheel
button and saying call wayne cutting ham
which phone for Wayne Cunningham would
you like to call so the system actually
found three numbers associated with my
name in the contact list and asked me
which one of those I want to call so
this system brings dodge up-to-date and
includes all the modern features we'd
expect in a car infotainment center in a
nice big screen so this has been a close
look at dodges new infotainment center
here in the 2011 charger I'm Wayne
Cunningham frisina so that's a look at
the infotainment system in the charger
to see how the rest of the car fares you
can find Brian coolies video in the car
tech section at cnet TV com and now
might be a good time to do that if
you're an LG employee because the time
has come for the bat there are a lot of
amazing TVs out there and prices just
keep getting better which makes it even
more disappointing that LG kind of blew
it with this one hi I'm cnet senior
editor David Katz Meyer and this is the
LG 42 lk 450 this is a 42-inch LCD TV
there's also a 32 and a 37 inch member
of the series this review will apply to
all three this is one of LG's least
expensive TVs for 2011 it uses a ccfl
backlight which means that it's not the
LEDs found on a lot of the higher-end
LCD TVs this year seen from the side you
can tell it's not an LED TV it's a
little bit thicker but still plenty thin
the sets design is really not all that
inspiring around the bottom you'll see
this sort of sandy stripped sort of set
it off against the glossy black all told
we find the look a little bit uninspired
but then again it's an entry-level TV
unlike some TVs at this level the LG
does have a swivel stand however feature
set on the lk 450 is pretty bare-bones
it's a 60 Hertz refresh rate which means
that it doesn't have 120 Hertz found on
some higher-end TVs not a big loss in
our book the TV doesn't have the DLNA
streaming found on some Samsung models
but it does allow you to plug into USB
port to the side and look at videos
photos and music so that's one little
extra one area where LG didn't skimp was
the picture settings there's a slew of
picture presets in addition to a 10
point grey scale and full color
management system so if you're tweaking
this TV you'll find all the controls
found on many higher-end televisions
it's a real plus at this level around
back to find two HDMI two component
video a pc input and a third HDMI as
well as a headphone jack around the side
so all told is one of the better
equipped entry-level TVs in terms of
connectivity when we took the LG into
the lab we were a little bit
disappointed by its picture quality
compared to some of its peers the real
weaknesses it's very light black levels
when you look at his TV in the dark you
can see the blacks are relatively gray
and they don't have that punch that a
lot of the tvs at its price level from
sony and samsung for example can deliver
on the flip side we did appreciate the
accurate color again helped by those
extensive picture adjustments the TV
does miraculously handle 1080p 24
Kayden's correctly despite being a 60
Hertz TV so that's kind of a bonus leave
your blu-ray players at 1080p 24 we also
appreciated the matte screen but all
told thanks to those pretty weak black
levels as TVs one of the worst
performers at this price point that's a
quick look at the LG lk 450 and i'm
david katz meijer it sounded pretty
promising right up until the very end
you can tell your friends from LG to
come back into the room now as we move
along to this week's bottom line the
kindle is the undisputed king of eerie
ders right now and the Nook is trying to
be the prince so is there any room for
an upstart Kobo is hoping that the
answer is yes i'm david carter from cnet
i am here with a Matthew Welsh from Kobo
and we are here with the new kobo vox
ereader tablet this is a $109 tablet
that is powered by Android is it is
Android 2.3 and Matthews going to tell
us a little bit about the device and its
highlights yeah and you can see from the
beginning here that the device starts
with the home screen which is very book
centric beyond that you have all of the
other things you would expect in an open
android platform that's completely
customizable it weighs about 14 point 2
ounces and it comes with 8 gigabytes of
memory gigs and expandable to 32 so I
think it'll hold you know our normal
Kobo touch will hold a thousand books
this will hold eight thousand books and
it
you want to expand it with the 32 can
hold you know we're 30,000 bucks so it's
quite a large library 800 megahertz
processor very similar to the barnes &amp;amp;
noble nook color some of the other
features it has you talked about the
screen earlier what makes the screen
special compared to other screens
obviously people love our eating screens
because you can read them in bright
sunlight when you go to a color reading
device we looked around and we found the
ffs plus screen I don't know ffs plus
stands for but I think it stands for you
can read it outside because effectively
we looked around and we found that the
type of screen technology used in the
cockpits of fighter planes is this
technology there's no android market on
the device it is your own store your own
android store and it just has free apps
exactly so we have 15,000 apps and you
can also get you know our whole
philosophy is read freely so you can you
can basically get apps from anywhere
else side load them on here the whole
device is built around freedoms it's an
open android platform you can customize
the look and feel of it as you like in
fact the product itself comes in four
different colors you're free to use
whatever browser you want your free when
you buy books from Kobo to use them on
in the other device or if you bought
books from another device to bring them
onto a coma and so we're looking at
pretty similar battery life to the
nookcolor at around seven hours yeah has
the quilted back the signature Kobo
quilted bag we have a great social new
social feature called pulse and with
pulse you can for the first time kind of
books come to life again so you get all
of the things you would get in a in a
virtual book club now integrated into an
underlay within the book itself so if
you want to say that you like a page
that you've started reading a book you
want to make a comment in the book you
want to see the comments that other
people make on the book all of that can
then show up directly in the Facebook
ticker so obviously some of the
potential revenue stream is in doing
paid apps for Android you guys are just
doing free apps is that conscious
decision that you can't actually buy
paid apps from any store yeah it's just
it's the way it is right now it's
certainly not a it's certainly not a
great
t-check position there but its extent to
which people want free things we give
them free things right we don't have a
lot of people clamoring please take my
money for apps it also talked about
adding even more fonts is that a feature
in this or is that part of your apps
strategy as well in our initial version
we had you know a certain range of font
sizes when we went to touch we went up
to 17 font sizes now with this were up
to 42 font sizes and it turns out that
people appreciate if they have bifocals
and trifocals being able to put their
glasses down and just read a book the
old-fashioned way all right thanks
Matthew for all that that is the new
kobo vox tablet ereader and i'm david
cardo and thanks for watching the bottom
line this week enjoy third place Kobo
since the kindle fire and the newest
nook are due to go on sale in the next
week or two the future of the kobo vox
looks a little bleak although there is
something kind of tempting about all
that openness and the jet fighter glass
that is cool that's going to do it for
this time but come back next week for an
all-new cnet tech review and tell them
there are tons of great videos available
every day at cnet TV com see you next
time and thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
