visual quality these have full cinemas
quality displays the consumer version
has dual cameras that lets you share 3d
videos and images of what you're seeing

can do cool different games like a
racing game where you're looking down at
a table and the kind of racing track
shows up and it looks like you're racing
a car then you can push a button and all
of a sudden you become the car so it's
more of a virtual reality sort of
experience these glasses are lightweight

version make it look like you're staring
at a 90 inch screen about ten feet away

News stream straight to your headset the
r8 consumer version will be available in
the second half of the year and will
