the motor headphones and motorized errs
when it comes to buying celebrity
headphones you have two choices Gordy oh
god damn that's horrible but what if you
want something a little more discreet
something that says skanky dive-bar for
example
behold the motor headphones motorized
errs this is the British metal bands
top-of-the-line headphone and they
promised to transform you from lemming
to lead singer Lemmy though hopefully
without the attendant hearing loss these
are photo DJ headphones with a bit of
swivel in the ear cups but they don't
fall down flat they come with two sets
of chords a short one with a three
button mic and a longer one for use at
home bill quality is a little ragged
just like Lemmy himself I guess and the
ear pads attract a lot of gum lint is
not very rock and roll sound quality is
fairly balanced with more bass than the
band itself though it is articulate this
time unlike Lemmy and they have nicely
judged treble response the mid-range is
open sounding in detail but there is a
presence boost that's designed to make
vocals sound exciting but it can sound a
little too screechy with the wrong
material $130 the motorized errs look
mean and will certainly impress metal
fans but I recommend spending a little
more on the more balanced and better
built Audio Technica amphiboles this has
been tied Pendlebury for cnet.com</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
