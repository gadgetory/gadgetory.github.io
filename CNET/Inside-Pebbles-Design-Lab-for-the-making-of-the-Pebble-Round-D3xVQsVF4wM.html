like well a watch that means moving away
from bulky designs that look
particularly bad on small wrists pebble
which brought us one of the first iOS
and Android compatible smartwatches
knows this so they searched for a
solution and the answer was staring them
in the face the classic watch face we're
announcing the latest wash we're
announcing pebble time round it's also
the thinnest and lightest SmartWatch in
the world we had a couple in mind a lot
of like Scandinavian designs yeah a lot
of the ones that focused on simplicity
and design we went behind the scenes to
pebbles design lab to find out how they
tackled making a smaller stylish round
SmartWatch so here we are we're at the
pebble design lab super secret away from
the other private company
what you'll see here is a little bit of
the process of how we went about getting
to pebble time around what we're looking
at right here is this is the breadboard
so basically this is this is the watch
but in a larger size and so the
developers use this early on before we
have a watch this is what you had to
shrink into the watch basically okay so
what we see here is a whole bunch of a
variety of 3d prints it shows the very
beginning of the process we just built a
bunch of models we printed them out we
put them on the wrists put them on our
wrist we put them on other people's
wrist we were trying to just get
information and and feedback and what
felt good what was right size this from
this 3d printing process we're able to
really quickly iterate and move on to
the point where we'll start to build
something that's more harder in metal
here you can kind of see we we went in
and started to look at what material it
would be would it be a shiny silver you
guys ultimately ended up going with
three colors so did you already know
that at this point that you would end up
with three different puzzle colors or
bezel styles no so at this point at this
point of stage we probably had 10-12
multiple different three-dimensional
bezels as well as colors and decorations
on
this just kind of represents a stable of
rear covers or rear housings that at
various stages we evaluate what the what
we do with the logo
what detail the charging details are
again what what level of finish is going
to be involved so and how how far into
the process are we now is this how many
months then this probably represents six
months in so when I look at this I think
one third of the screen or one third of
the face is dazzled how did it end up
that way we're taking lots of high-tech
components and dealing with screams
buttons taking everything that is in
pebble time and time steel and and
minimizing it and putting it inside a
smaller form factor so there's a few
things that we can we can juggle around
and fine-tune at the same time there are
some limits to the screen and what we
can do and so that bezel helps helps
cover it what we ended up with is an
assortment of five watches black silver
and rose
and we're excited with pebble time round
we think it will get on the wrists of a
lot more women</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
