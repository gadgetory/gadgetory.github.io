sixth floor like we're used to first
it's the apple byte extra crunchy
podcast with your host mr. brian Tong
what's up everybody welcome to the show
it is episode 66 on the apple buy extra
crunchy bringing all that munchy again
this is our complimentary show to the
actual apple byte video podcast is about
a five minute weekly show this is where
we dig into it we unearth news stories
that have happened because it in a
couple days it things change and we find
out more details so again everyone
continues to call in we love our calls
we're working on even like a Skype video

optional actually I could be very
entertaining for me pants on the ground
pants on the ground lookin like a fool
with your pants on the ground if you
know if you know what that is from do
you remember that's wrong it's like it's
no Eric an idol is a Maryland it was
American Idol guy okay what's way back
from way back I gotta shout out that
America's Got Talent those American I
don't actually remember that that that's
that's it's what everyone knows what
that really covers us a long time ago
yeah there's tons of stuff so again i
forgot the number 1 806 162 638 is the
number you guys can leave your name
where you're from again we're getting
great calls try and keep him around 30
to 40 seconds and not a minute we got we
had like how many we have you people
doing like over a minute like three or
four calls that are over a minute like
we've got love for you you guys make
great points but a minute is too long
we're the only ones that are allowed to
talk more than a minute yeah we want to
put those on the air but that's just
like people are gonna fall asleep I'm
awake I'm awake I'm totally wake up wake
up wake up wake up let's get to the
first story of the show it's the first
of the show air pods delay potentially
attributed to multiple reasons this is a
report that just dropped from
Wall Street Journal talking about what
is taking the air pod so long we have
speculated we have gone back and forth
now there is not an exact reason for the
delay but here's the details according
to The Wall Street Journal a person
familiar with the development of the air
pods say that trouble appears to stem
from Apple's effort to chart this new
path for wireless headphones in most
other wireless headphones only one
earpiece receives a signal from the
phone via wireless Bluetooth technology
it then transmitted that signal to the
other ear piece Apple decided to do it
differently Apple has said the air
products earpieces each receive
independent signals from an iphone Mac
or other Apple device but Apple must
ensure that both earpieces receive the
audio exactly at the same time to avoid
any of the distortion and the person
familiar with their development this is
according to The Wall Street Journal
again said that Apple must also resolve
what happens when a user loses one of
the earpieces or if the battery dies
right so we have two individual pieces
getting two individual signals syncing
them up together as well as what happens
when you lose one of these earpieces now
another nugget from this article also
detailed another aspect of some of the
difficulty they might be facing with
these air pods and why again this is a
delay that we still don't expect to see
any time you know coming to us anytime
soon other wireless headphones work well
indoors where a Bluetooth signal can be
contained but in the article they talk
about how they struggle to deliver
similar sound performance outdoors so
we're signals can bounce off of nearby
objects a bluetooth expert basically
said when you're outdoors this is going
to be different so that's also one of
the aspects of why this might be
difficult they work well indoors but a
Bluetooth signal where when that can be
contained but outdoors it's a little
trickier that's crazy so phasing could
also be a problem too if you're getting
like a signal like a slightly different
times like the music could probably be
out of phase and there's so many I
didn't even think about all the problems
that could arise from this but that's
pretty sad that that hahaha that whole
issue of
you know again like I talked about the
chip inside those headphones in what it
can do it's pretty amazing to me from a
technology standpoint but it sounds like
remember this w one ship that is part of
the air pods is kind of an additional
chip that is a compliment to the
Bluetooth and now they're also trying to
split the bluetooth at least that we
know that is that i was talking my ears
home yeah I have it like okay underneath
a little tiny bit but again it's one of
those things where this just this shows
you how hard this stuff is hell yeah and
to be I'm not making excuses because I'm
the number one critic against the air
pods if anyone watches this they know
that but it just shows house difficulty
stuff can be based on this report I
don't expect to see us seen them by the
end of the year right it's what it's
almost mid to sem burr yeah even if they
shipped next week it's gonna take
another week for them to get here and
then to get on shelves I almost feel
like they would have to do like a
another press conference just to be like
we got the air pods working guys for
Christmas but it's not gonna happen
don't you think they should just hold
off and wait till next year yeah for
sure get it right which is what they
said they have done they're making sure
that they're ready to roll they're not
gonna give us an unfinished product and
I think it's a good thing that they're
thinking about it this way but I think
it's a huge mistake when they laid out
the roadmap of a wireless future and
shoved it down our throat and the key
component to make this wireless future
work isn't even available and now we
can't get periscope connected yeah
mixing board thank you iphone 7 because
of a dongle so periscope would have been
tight we would have been able to give
voice via our voicemails directly to our
scope errs listening live but that won't
happen so we'll wait and see how this
all plays out again we have what CES
consumer electronics show las vegas
coming out in january typically apples
very hush-hush mom during that time
these days in the past they tried to
upstage a CES a lot yeah they I it was a
few years ago when CES everyone's time
about what's going to happen there and
then Apple unveiled I believe the first
iPad like the week after CES and all
people are talking about is what is the
ipad going to be like this is years ago
where Apple still had that lab
Ridge right of something new that's not
the case as much anymore yeah so well or
not they're not even at CES anymore
right now David yeah they've never don't
even they've never been there yeah even
when it was Comdex a back in the day
when a Sinbad would be the host of
Comdex I'm serious sinbad the comedian
your your ambassador for consumer
electronics totally during his heyday
all right let's keep on moving along
with the show this story I find to be
pretty fascinating and really
interesting we know that Apple has
completely dropped the ball when it
comes to the TV subscription service
that again look I don't hate Apple but
they they just they mean to step their
game up this year's been probably making
some mistakes this is yours probably
been one of the roughest years in my
that I can remember from a standpoint of
Apple really losing its perception as
being the innovator yeah this your
specific yeah yeah 2016 was definitely a
down year for a lot of things Apple are
you gonna get me to press about just
life in 20 16 2016 you cuz I you like
why it's like a few 2016 I right after
this okay but according to this report
from Bloomberg Apple is pressing
Hollywood studios for earlier access to
movies that would be awesome according
to people knowledge of the matter a move
that would bolster the company's itunes
business so check this out Apple is
talking to multiple studios 20 20
Century Fox is one of them time warner
Warner Brothers and Comcast corporations
universal pictures they have all
confirmed in the past week that they are
looking to offer higher priced home
video rentals of new movies shortly
after they opened in theaters and what
is the time frame we're talking about
according to the report we're talking
about being able to potentially this is
not set in stone yet potentially watch a
movie that has been released in theaters
two weeks after their debut I am so on
board with that I'm totally on board
that because sometimes going in theater
is just you know it's not fun hey there
there's been plenty of times where I was
like oh how about this yeah view ever I
don't do it as much but have you ever
gone to a movie theater and just you're
like man I could've watch this one at
home totally oh there's a lot of movies
like that
I me you have kids something like uh we
just watch like cars 3 is coming out
let's just watch cars to be at home we
don't go to movie theaters but I mean
also you just don't want people like
coughing on you and like maybe someone's
talking in front of you texting what
about the nervous leg what about the
nervous leg behind you that shaking your
chair have you ever had that I haven't
I'm nervous leg dude you do the half
look dude you do like a full lid I
literally yelled through the gap please
stop shaking your leg yeah after I can't
take any more yeah the only real I
kicking my chair please I'm like I'm
like shaking my leg into my chair right
now you you you can feel it there's
there's times where movie it's cool to
go see a movie in the theater and it's
okay like Star Wars like everyone's
cheering and like having a great time
you know but if you're going to see like
a really like movie that you're they've
to pay attention to pay attention to and
like you know you're excited to see it
I'd probably want to watch it at home
stringent on periscope is what about
have to go to the bathroom during an
important time in the movie so true okay
so let me ask you this Beach uh what how
much would you and I don't want you to
read article so don't look at it how
much would you be willing to pay to see
a movie two weeks after its debut it
would be one price it the assumption is
you'd probably be paying more because
they assume that more than one person is
going to watch it as well yeah in that
household yes how what what would be
lets say the low end and the high end
that you'd be willing to pay I i would
say between fifteen and twenty dollars
okay homie a single ticket for imax like
20 bucks dude i know but that's imax
okay but your whole for like a regular
movie ok let me probably like ten
dollars a ticket now these days right oh
no it's more than that it's bad i
haven't been to a movie since i don't
even remember how about how was our star
wars what if i told you like 11 to 12
bucks for a matinee these days alright
that's that's expensive right yeah yeah
that is expensive for a matinee just for
a mat for matinee remember when Matt
names like five bucks yeah for four
bucks yeah oh my gosh I could take a
hell of girls to like back-to-back
matinees as I easy I'll meet you there
oh I'll jump theaters to see another
movie and only pay four bucks for two
dates yeah I mean to two weeks after the
movie comes out if you're still excited
about it I'm fifteen to twenty dollars
from
me I right home according to the report
studios and Apple are talking about a
price ranging between twenty-five to
fifty dollars come on come on I see I'm
okay with that I'm okay okay with that I
am okay with that I don't know oh you
wait you you at you and your lady and
your two kids straight up if you went to
theatre that would at least cost you at
least 50 GST but you're right it would
cost that much I'm just saying and again
you're seeing this at home two weeks
after releases in the theater yeah you
know toffee I mean you can like buy the
DVD like six months later saying like
I'm gonna pay that much and then I want
to buy the blu-ray the 4k version with
the 3d all that anyways up this people
with knowledge of this say the
possibility is very real in fact they
feel like a deal like this is likely to
happen within the next 18 months Wow I
mean they kind of similarly kind of did
something similar with Michael Moore's
film and Trump land or something that's
directly on iTunes right directly to
iTunes film and it was five dollars well
I didn't even I didn't want to watch
that I was like five bucks no way all
the way till netflix puts us on I wait
till netflix yeah I which I was curious
you know I thought it was like one of
his documentaries where he goes around
and like interviews people but he was
like on a stage in some place so I
didn't want to buy it but five bucks
always even like yeah people are talking
about also the food costs we will move
on to the next story but i think is that
I think that everyone has an opinion
about movie so much you're willing to
food costs is like poem aria no like you
want the popcorn you want the Raisinets
well that's that's the bomb bonds the
Baba's do it bottom I like that movie
there's like like I'm gonna like an
elbow there it melts in there gets all
oh yeah I'm a hot tamale guy and get the
hub a police yeah yeah Reese's Pieces
seriously if I'm a young person today I
don't even know how i even get enough
money to take a girl out to a movie like
that oh true I got young kid in junior
high or high school I take some lady out
on a date yeah uh yeah let's just not do
that let's just not watch movies I can
find a lot of more fun things to do that
are cheaper than that yeah haha freaky
deaky anyway so we'll see how this
happens but I think what this may
special for Apple is that they need
something some differentiator at least
from a standpoint of streaming content
we know netflix has binge-watching we
know that other companies have TV
streaming services why not be the first
company to be able to watch movies early
from home a lot of people have pretty
dang good setups at home now for movies
yeah like you can get like a 4k TV for
like around thousand bucks and a
surround sound system in a smaller room
that sounds adequate again it's not
going to be a movie there around like
300 bucks what's your in your house
you're in your pajamas you're Jimmy guy
you gotta get all cuddly we're eating
together oh yeah be like flirting
cupcake you little bit you know what
happens I mean but twenty fifty dollars
I'm not gonna do that do imagine I to
the hashtag hashtag itunes in chill
itunes and chill okay what do you guys
think about the Apple watch where you
out with that Beecham you know i mean if
if i get one for christmas i'm not gonna
be mad i'm gonna be stoked Makka am I
gonna go buy 1 i'm not gonna go buy the
new one at least because it's too
expensive right now Tim Cook just rips
old and responded to an email from
Reuters in which he you know wanted to
Pat himself on the back and so that this
was apples best-performing holiday week
ever in regards to sales of the Apple
watch now this is a follow up after
report from IDC a research forum that
sorry research firm not form come on
sometimes we're talking for an extended
period of time sometimes I make mistakes
with my words where the research firm
said that the tech giant sold roughly
1.1 million units of the Apple watch
during the third quarter of two thousand
sixteen if you match that to last year
though it's a 71 percent decline from
the year-ago quarter 71 percent that's
big that's huge we've that's a giant
fall off Wow research has shown how just
wearables in general have pretty much
dropped like a cliff but I do believe
that this might have been apples best
sales week I personally felt this was
the best time ever to buy an Apple watch
for these reasons the series one is
still out most of you quite honestly
don't need a series to with the GPS and
the swimming capability
the operating system is more than ample
the battery life is basically around the
same and so if you're gonna buy one I
told people that asked me go for a
series one watch on a black friday deal
that was like thirty dollars cheaper
yeah I was like does I'd be like 150 was
like a buck fitty right yeah for for an
Apple watch why not why not so those are
probably people to help bump up those
numbers for the totally I Tim Cook also
added that it's expected that this will
be the best here says quote directly
said sales growth is off the charts in
fact during the first week of holiday
shopping our cell through of Apple watch
was greater than any week in the
products history and as we expected
we're on track for the best quarter ever
for Apple watch he did not respond to
specific requests for sales figures yeah
he just dropped his he just dropped his
little talking point there's a red flag
there yeah still today Apple has not
released the actual sales numbers of the
Apple watch they continue to bundle it
in with like the Apple TV and the ipod
Lord I honestly I really wonder how many
ipods are being sold now like that's the
ipod touch from like two two and a half
years ago that they've never updated the
only so I'm everyone just it's just
integrated into your phone so we'll see
we'll see how it all plays out from
Apple this one though this is a good
story regarding just apples services the
Apple music store or Apple music I
shouldn't call it the Apple music store
the Apple music service according to
billboard has hit 20 million subscribers
wow yeah I saw that headline but it's
hit that number in a year and a half Wow
kidding so this is if you want to give
some comparison we know that Spotify is
the number one streaming service they
have roughly 32 i believe they might
have just hit 40 million but they're
around 38 to 40 million subscribers
someone can correct me on that with
spotify again the climate was different
but spotify started their service in
2008 to get to 40 million okay so now
we're talking about apple music 20
million in a year and a half that's
pretty insane so many people are on
iTunes like they've been on iTunes we
have probably more than 10 years so that
makes that makes a lot of sense
and and I would recommend people use
Apple music / Spotify because apple pays
artists more than Spotify does yeah yeah
so you know that's my argument I don't
use buffer I tried at one time but also
my phone just rang in the stream just am
I oh no I forgot to turn it on to you
like this curb that's a user error oops
sorry y'all oops I did it again anyways
apple also is responsible for helping
watch some of the number one billboard
albums of the year Drake's views DJ
Khaled's I got the keys keys keys major
keys missed that one didn't hear that
you haven't heard that song it's very
annoying okay let me see what is it
whose it is DJ khaled may oh yeah yeah I
got the keys keys keys so they have that
as well as Frank ocean's blonde so
they're really oh and hiss was an apple
music exclusive yet started off I'm
impressed I am impressed with what they
have done again they still have a long
ways to catch a spy but look Apple
basically just leverage their user base
that is so huge Apple music is basically
prompted for people to subscribe once
they turn on and set up their phone yeah
yeah and they have hundreds of millions
of users so this number is going to only
increase I'm not an apple music
subscriber I still not but I have been
on the verge of almost being like maybe
I should just flip that switch on I'm
curious how Apple connect is doing cuz
I've only launched that just seemed like
it just disappeared you know I don't
even know if I still in that I don't
even know if it's still me no it is it
is it is oh yeah I'm glad they buried
cuz I n look at that yeah but I don't
that track I don't even look at it it
was that point oh this one yeah yeah
yeah this will be doing here here's life
enjoying this okay now I know ya see ya
you the hook is what's really um
intoxicating and annoying and then
intoxicating and then annoying again
it's very it's very nice we also want to
talk about Apple's best app of the app
store in 2016 I enjoy this they always
do this recap at the end of every year
where the apps that stand out what do
you think the most lemon let me look at
this list what was the app that was the
most I think what would they call it
looking at it no no I don't want to tell
you I'm trying not to tell you what do
you think was the most surprising they
put it on here I can't find it but I
know it what was the most surprising app
of the year Michigan izing um my swim
pro just by lagaa yeah dude it was it's
not on this specific list oh it was a it
was if I believe correct it was they
have it posted on not only I the itunes
app store in the app but also on their
website it was pokemons go oh yeah yeah
yeah that's a phenomena that came out of
nowhere huge phenomenon iphone app of
the year prisma that's that cool app
where you basically take a picture and
then it does all this crazy artsy
filters not we're not timeout Instagram
filters I'm talking about art filters
like completely transforming what it
looks like prisma totally free I am down
with that the iphone game of the year
was clash royal i did not play that so
many people i always see that in the top
of like the favorite itunes you know in
the app store yeah hop of the it's
always like this one there's another
clash game or something like it's always
clash of clans yeah clash of the clans
that's a big one no it that one that one
would never play that hahaha yeah i've
got a life hell is that I have got I'll
Italy I literally have a life yeah I
remember seeing prisma when it first
came out a lot of people like posting
Instagram on the toppers know kind of
like it kind of fell off it always it
always does even even Pokemon go that
train has fallen off a little bit
anyways you can check out the best of
the app stores in
16 just really cool stuff they do it for
not only the iphone but the ipad and the
Apple watch as well I guess I could just
be nice and just tell you the ipad a
pedir was sketchbook motion it allowed
you to basically do animations page by
page ipad game of the year was severed
Apple TV app of the year was Twitter and
they also incorporated i believe the
live streaming aspect into it nice an
apple TV game of the year Riptide GP
looks kind of like that racing game on
water Apple watch app of the year was my
swim pro I do not believe that that was
the Apple watch I'm sorry I the Apple
watch series to just came out a couple
months ago how was at the app of the
year unless they decide maybe they
decided and they got they got paid off
or something like that Apple watch Game
of the Year field day there's so you can
just check out that list it's quite it's
quite nice just want to point this out
real quick that Pokemon go with such a
huge hit that starbucks now has
starbucks go which life i guess you can
catch different latte are you kidding me
than enemies so this is going to be in
and i did not know about this crap so
you could go to starbucks and I guess
you order different drafts and could
capture them and then collect all the
different drink cups or seem like it can
you just make me throw up in my mouth
and tell me what are the names of some
of these drinks I haven't read into it
that much but let's see is it like
loctite lity Kyo's I think it's just
like mocha roki on yeah I think it's
just like the regular names of the
starbucks drinks you know I don't know I
haven't I just saw the headlines with
funky no spy so like really vente
something or other I don't know Cara
rat-tat-tat ml @ @ @ @ she's so stupid
crap like that alright just some quick
software release updates apples released
the iOS 10.2 beta 7 for developers and
for the public what makes this
interesting is yeah we have all the
tweaks like the TV app the new emojis
things of that nature but it's expected
that the new actual fool 10.2 that will
be available for consumers regular
consumers like units that haven't you
mean that haven't signed up yet would be
rolling out sometime potent
even sometime next week is that the
rumblings are saying apples also seeded
the sixth beta for mac OS Sierra or what
we'd like to call come on stay with me
Michael's see ya beta to developers and
public beta testers as well and then
let's just wrap this up have a little
fun story we talked about games Pokemon
go so popular without Mario I'm down I'm
what about Super Mario run ok it's
expected to drop it will drop not
expected Friday December the 15th if you
haven't circled your calendars we know
that there's going to be a free version
but then basically you pay ten dollars
to unlock all the modes but here's
another tidbit you might not know about
the game oh we got it our team in New
York got actually play with it the key
thing about it is it's one-handed you so
you can do other things with your other
hand that's why it's just a tap thing
Mario actually had runs on his own
automatically yeah you're just yours tap
tap yeah when I saw that I was kind of
bummed out about that actually be kind
of cool if they're just like little
couple buttons you know but then you can
use one in you how am I gonna show you
know I gonna hold your kid and then play
with Super Mario at the same time now am
I gonna shoot fireballs at you know
they're thinking of your honor plans I
don't know if you can are there
fireballs in the game I don't even I
don't know I don't even know that anyone
would be cool cuz that's what I you know
that's classic Mario yo Mario ice balls
oh yeah oh yeah that's Mario to me yeah
Nintendo's Super Mario run for the
iphone though will require a persistent
internet connection for play ouch so
it's going to use data according to this
report and according to Nintendo
directly the Mario creator Shigure
Shigeru Miyamoto amazing incredible
genius he spoke about the decision to
require a constant internet connection
he says he wanted to be able to leverage
that network connection with all three
of the different modes to keep all the
modes functioning together and offering
the game in a way that keeps the
software secure they said one of the
things as they were worried about piracy
and people trying to hack into the game
that's also why he said that they
launched it on iOS first remember we
talked about why people develop on iOS
first versus Android secure a tie part
of it really more like they just
whole bunch of phones solely right and
people buy stuff the internet connection
though will consume 75 Meg's megabytes
per hour or less over your wireless
connection hmmm not the end of the world
that's not too bad seventy five
megabytes of data that's for constant
involved play I'm just gonna say right
now I don't know how many people are
getting playing Super Mario run for an
hour straight I don't is that it does
that feel like the type of game you can
play for an hour straight have you
played a game on an iphone for an hour
straight now you have to really have
some really powerful I SEPs do that I
mean I cept later I do I did used to
play words with friends for a long time
like on a car on a on a ride to work
standing in the bus but if we can't do
that we now have a Wi-Fi connection what
kind of met but an hour dude an hour I
didn't I didn't play Angry Birds for an
hour I never played fruit ninja for an
hour what were some of those other hot
games you remember doodle jump dude
you're ever doodle jump game was sick

was it called yeah raw with one of us
it's not was not work with friends what
was it called I'll draw something draw
something that's a yes they were
purchased for like a billion dollars and
then completely dissolved and beard the
people who basically made a look just
make a ripoff of classic games put them
on a phone and get bought out and then
enjoy life I'm working on do pref REO
hahaha it's like a little you perf REO
none do perf re oh yeah cool game a
little dirty runs breaks things with his
head did i do perf REO none i'm totally
done with that that sounds awesome
should we get to our voicemails yeah
let's do some voicemail all right let's
hear what you all have to say again you
guys and gals can call us at one eight
hundred 61 62 63 eight and to be a part
of the show we thank you so much for
helping us out and making the show pop
cool all right number one hey Brian it's
me Jade and I called in for the the
macbook pro coverage as you remember me
but oh we remember you want to know what
size do things better for middle school
child 15 inch or 13 inch okay see ya bye
what do you think
well if you're a junior high in middle
or middle school let's not say junior
high because there is that there is a
difference middle school 678 junior high
of 78 I that's the rest want to make
sure we all love this 678 ok yeah 67 it
right yeah that's right yeah so let's
just get that fact out of the right and
also can I just point out he said the
child young man can you call yourself
young man thank you young adult young
man young man Jaden come on a 13 inches
more than ample but if you rich you
could go fifteen i would go 13 algorithm
i was rich this is a very heavy 13 is a
perfect size you don't need anything
larger than that unless you want to
press ladies two inches does make a
difference next call I next call here we
go how's it going this is rhodium and
apple certified support professional
love the show and I just had a question
about the router business that Apple's
getting out of I know the last podcast
we talked about them having the highest
rating but as things are moving towards
the Internet of Things and everybody's
wanting home Kaname shin and everything
why is Apple trying to get out of it
when it's where the futures doing
possibly maybe an apple TV with an apple
Express Express built-in just curious
thanks love the show roadie this man
knows what he is talking about okay I
love a love the call call in any time
you'd like please there have been rumors
and stories in the past that have linked
the fact that Apple's home kit would be
potentially linked to the apple TV is
kind of the central hub and it would be
logical for them to integrate that in
some way shape or form and if that's one
way that they can focus and make it the
bread and butter that is a great idea
and a great product at least if you live
in the apple ecosystem it's also weird
because just this whole home automation
thing I'm starting to already feel like
whether Apple does an apple TV with this
central control they're already kind of
behind because I live in an apple
ecosystem but I use an Amazon echo to
control home stuff I have it controlling
my thermostat I have a controlling
lights I live in an apartment so I share
it but you know I have I set up like
basically a faux home like the hallway
of my room is the hallway my bedroom is
my bedroom
my bathroom so it's not like it's a real
true house but it's I wanted to really
feel what it was like and if I'd
actually use it all the time I use it
all the time yeah so now that Apple has
their access to you know in the new in
the latest OS and one of the swiping
panels you can connect smart devices
really easily because the Amazon echo
has done it for me so nicely already I
haven't even set it up so I've actually
never decided to set up my smart devices
even though I can directly do it on my
iPhone I just haven't done it and
control to Syria I haven't done it hmm
yeah I have a couple smart devices to
control my lights and there's no sirree
support yet so I'm just kind of waiting
for that to happen you know and when it
when it does quite honestly look at more
people are going to most likely have an
iphone versus having a amazon echo you
know right just in general more people
are going to so the faster that Apple
gets on this and makes it even more yeah
just eat the barrier of entry is already
pretty low it's still though like if I
told my parents to set up a smart home
they'd be like what the hell yeah so
well my my dad is pretty savvy I I got
him the nest and he's got some other
things you know the nest is a good
gateway drug into the smartphone for
suree yeah yeah cuz you're like what it
knows when I'm here it kind of creates a
pattern schedule and I can tell it when
to go warmer colder okay I'm down with
that Yeltsin you get like some lights
and then he got into it and then he
started like researching like cheaper
better ones yeah worth the nato be yeah
he's one of us got one for his house now
and you know so it's funny to watch that
happen yeah so uh love the idea thanks
for the thanks for the call yeah i just
ordered my echo dot today oh all right
next oh hey what's going on Apple biters
what's up Brian Beecham this is joe from
fountain valley california love the show
anyway i just finished the podcast extra
crunchy from friday and one thing that
nobody was to ever was talk about 14
whole you know the time capsule design
council the routers and all that stuff
but the one thing nobody really
mentioned was what is Apple is trying to
get out of the router business only to
bolster
iCloud backup and get more people to put
in revenue towards increasing their
capsizes it just makes more sense with
snowy phones tablets you know and now I
cut itself and your My Documents going
to the cloud it just makes more sense to
increase the size increase the revenues
through that cloud-based time capsule
back up and then it is to make hardware
from work so that's just my thought I'll
see you guys to discuss thanks other
guys peace I think it's a really
interesting point that you make because
also the thing that I have always
battled with iCloud storage specifically
is whether it's for a phone or even
looking to it as the computer and we've
seen how Apple is you know really trying
to feature it more were you in the
latest version of Mac OS Sierra you kind
of have this desktop folder that can
exist on all of your devices and you can
upload things to it right now if you
look at the plans of what they have for
still iCloud storage plans 50 gigs per
month is 90 was it 99 cents per month
200 gigs is 299 one terabyte is 999 two
terabytes is 1999 what's gone down yeah
it's definitely it definitely has gone
down I'm not at the point where i'm
willing to it sounds stupid but i'm not
at the point where i'm willing to just
give all of my files to Apple yeah me
neither so I still use a network
attached a story you know a hard drive
that is my backup which is my time
machine where I'm like okay I know
myself is there but I haven't relied on
that yet now in regards to just the
wireless router and the storage and
things like that we did it we did forget
to mention it because we were asking
like because I'm so used to just like
connecting a hard drive directly into my
computer someone who tweeted me that yes
and a network attached storage on your
network can also act as the time machine
so whether it goes through the airport
or not the airport express routers or
not airport extreme routers or not it
doesn't matter that time machine
functionality will still be there as
long as you have a network-attached sort
so we got that clarify which is good
that's why we asked people on the show
like uh sometimes we're doing this on
the fly we're like wait my brains not
working we just don't know it's like
every time you plug in a new
drive to computer past you it says do
you want to make this a time machine
thing so yeah it's easy to set up and I
never I never do that really I mean I
just have like little passport hard
drives that just back everything up to
every couple months or whatever I don't
lose anything knock on wood dude why did
you say that why did you say that beat
job I don't I don't yeah let's just
rewind this and pretend I never said
that yeah so I think I think it's a
great I don't know how many of you
actually would trust storing all of your
files on the cloud to Apple I know I
wouldn't know I mean I've got some
special folders on my computer if you
know I'm talking about hiii do I did do
like a massive backup of all my photos
to Amazon photo well that's okay that's
like gives you like free to like a
terabyte or some yeah or actually gives
you unlimited if you let them resize and
that's the only thing that's the only
thing yeah when it's specific to maybe a
category that you can control or manage
a little better although I don't want to
know what pictures are on your
collection Stephen but like photos is
one thing versus your entire computer of
files yes that's that's like we're
inviting yo yeah and just being able to
hand that over and give it to them that
that although you know whatever
encryption no matter how safe it is
there's just something about that that
I'm not comfortable with so and I don't
think you guys and gals should be
comfortable with it either yeah just
like the next headline like Apple
breached by hackers and la 60 million
customers information really you know
even even we've seen some of these
celebrity hacks where the files were
just on their phone what's her name the
actress other variety another I forget
for Lawrence I think Scala Johansson was
on that list and a lot of people that's
pictures from iCloud that they had ya
and ya habla sh yes yes so am i yeah so
if you're feeling comfortable that's why
i say i don't feel comfortable
completely doing that but photos even
with something like the google pixel
unlimited photo storage from your phone
yeah that's pretty awesome it is awesome
it's pretty a lot of companies are doing
that to now like dropbox yet but they
make you have to resize your photos yeah
but that's fine you have the photo yeah
not with the Google pixel yo full res
baby no
not that this is the Apple bite that
will stick sorry Austin Apple okay we
have one more call hello Brian and
Beecham I was wondering if Apple created
their own VR headset what would they do
to it or what would they add thank you
but thank you for the call now just to
rewind a little bit we've heard Apple
really isn't behind the whole idea of VR
they're really high on augmented reality
which is a are Tim Cook if you kind of
go search up online Tim Cook augmented
reality of three or four different
occasions he's told that that's really
where Apple sees the future because you
can still interact with others while
getting an overlay of information and
stuff and basically still be able to
interact with each other socially Wow
seen some of these cool things so I
really don't think Apple would release a
specific virtual reality headset the
other indicator of that is we've talked
about how virtual reality was one of
those big themes in 2016 but kind of
some of the latest reports are now
questioning is VR a fad was it a dud or
is it still have places to grow because
heads I don't think it's a dud it just
think it's a fat either I think it just
hasn't reached its potential because
it's still really early yeah you know
what I'm saying then people haven't
found the killer functionality for I
will tell you if you have battlefront on
a ps4 they put a rogue one mission and
VR on that thing damn Oh like I'm on an
x-wing son yeah I'm saying too i try i
still like think about the vehicle haha
are two outs are two handed me a
lightsaber and then i would fought
stormtroopers and it was amazing it was
like having a real experience in my life
no no it was real did what are you
talking about if it was totally real i
did that but i did that he's asking like
what do you think they would add i'm
gonna say rumble packs in rubble your
face rumble your face what about aware
you bring about what about a wearable
what about rumble wearables like me
neither gonna have it like no not on
your wrist row like maybe the Apple
watch can be on an elevator so low blow
the wrist it Oh rumble Rumble where that
would be completely immersive we might
we might we might even see that at CES
quite honestly oh yeah
what was it 50 cent was talking about
some like connected underwear when he
was there like all is selling I was
talking about his underwear that had a
pouch to basically cut the stuff so that
it wouldn't get sweaty it's actually
under attack yeah it's called free go
fri geo they're actually out there okay
it's like a pouch it's a me called a man
apple just i did this just in apple
acquired man pouch underwear kidding so
but yeah I think like they have like
really great vibration technology why
not when they put like some vibration on
that Rumble where you Rumble really
think of anything else all right ladies
and gentlemen boys and girls I think
that's all our calls right I think yeah
that's it okay we're gonna wrap this up
