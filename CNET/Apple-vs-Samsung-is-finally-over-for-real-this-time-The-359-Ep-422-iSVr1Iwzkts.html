Alfred Eng Apple and Samsung's
long-running legal dispute is finally
finally over the tech giants on
Wednesday said they agreed to settle
their beef though terms of the deal
still aren't yet clear Apple and Samsung
have been fighting over design and
functionality issues on their
smartphones and tablets since 2011 the
settlement comes just after a retrial in
May that resulted in Samsung needing to
pay five hundred and thirty-nine million
dollars in damages to Apple so probably
the most important thing that I was
thinking about with this because we
talked a lot about this on the show is
what's what do you think the consumer
impact of all this is gonna be I mean I
think the big issue now will be you know
sort of like patent issues goes with
Apple it's the the idea that like if you
try to take like one of Apple's ideas or
anything like that they're going to
they're gonna be able to sue you and
like in the end they're gonna be able to
like wait it out I mean this is like a
seven-year thing so I mean I don't know
what it'll mean for all the knotch
copiers out there but I mean it's really
interesting that it takes a you know
after seven long years and have being
for like it went to the Supreme Court
yeah and then you know it went to the
Supreme Court that's basically the whole
idea of oh whoa we have to pay half a
billion dollars to them but maybe we
should just settle this instead of like
having to continue this feud and
continue appealing it do you see any
possibility that having fewer of these
patent lawsuits around some of them are
frivolous that and they also invite
patent trolls do you see the potential
of having the bar raised on patent
lawsuits
maybe lowering prices for consumers I'm
not I don't think but like something
like this would lower prices for
consumers I think like cheaper parts or
anything like that would lower prices
but like as far as prices goes you could
probably expect it to continue to rise
even without like patent issues like
this no that's that's too bad and
unfortunately I think you're right next
up if you want to create a new delivery
business amazon wants to help the
e-commerce titan unveiled a new program
called delivery service partner
what a clever name that will help
entrepreneurs form companies to deliver
its packages so what is this like it
like uber but for delivery service or
something which they already have so
it's always broader than that it's
almost as if uber were not only to like
hire you as a contract worker but to
allow you to hire other uber drivers on
top of that so and they they plan on
providing branded vehicles for lease and
training they literally want to create
more like small and local delivery
businesses because they have so much
huge demand for from customers and so
would this kind of take a burden off of
like USPS then or maybe I mean the the
problem there is is that the demand is
surging so much that it's probably going
to use all of its traditional delivery
partners in addition to this as well
anyway last our own Derrick her wrote
about con artists targeting uber drivers
Alfred tell us a little bit about those
yeah so this this scam is pretty
convoluted but it's really sophisticated
the way that it works is that they'll
call the uber driver pretending to be
from uber and they're very professional
about and they basically say we'd notice
some activity on your account can you
give us your username us your
information username and your password
and then they and then they also ask for
your confirmation number because like if
you have two factor authentication they
ask you're gonna get a text message of a
code now can you tell us what that code
is like as a way to confirm that it's
you but what they're really doing is
using that to log into your account and
then like empty out your bank your your
earnings and and diverting your earnings
to their own basically yeah they they're
able to look at your transaction history
notice like oh this person like takes
their money out on Sunday so I'm gonna
divert it to my account on like a
Saturday or something like that so we
can get it first jeez yeah so if you're
an uber driver I guess anybody on the
internet probably the rules of the road
are biggest do not provide the devices
like uber would never call you asking
for your user name and password they
already have it you have it yeah so I
mean that's basically what uber has said
as well yeah so by the way for the next
two weeks we're going to be going to a
weekly podcast
Thursday's but don't worry we'll be back
to our regular schedule in mid-july
if you want to read more about these
stories check us out on CNN I'm Ben Fox
Ruben I'm Alfred Inge thanks for
listening okay thanks everybody for
joining us for the recording of the
podcast that'll be posted later on all
of those lovely syndication and
availabilities enough for right now I'm
gonna jump into the chat as I always do
and dig out your best questions and
comments yes even you trolls let's start
off with a question from a new name from
Swapnil welcome to the show
welcome welcome who is gonna earn more
from settling this dispute regarding
Apple and Samsung and exactly how are
they going to earn more geez that's a
good question I'm not sure what the
details of the settlement Ari I don't
think that's available yet I think to a
certain extent maybe the beneficiary of
the settlement could be Samsung in that
Apple was literally trying to use these
lawsuits to try to push Samsung's
products off the market they were trying
to gain smartphone dominance through
lawsuits
it didn't eventually didn't end up
working because both of these companies
have so much money that they were able
to just keep the lawsuits dragging on
for seven years but this at least takes
the threat of Apple kicking Samsung out
of the US market off the table so there
is that benefit there any other I agree
if everything you said oh wow that's a
that's a first thank you very much we
need to make note that today is our
loyal friend Josh Buddha's birthday
happy birthday Josh had a birthday just
so many birthdays and may you live to
120 and continue watching the podcast
with Laura these podcasts actually
increases your life expectancy right
it's totally true so on that note let's
take a question from good ol Josh at
this point does it matter who really won
the lawsuit apples still using Samsung
panels in the iPhone 10 that's a really
good point I would agree with
that'd nobody really it's a settlement
no what it really wins not only that but
like think about it even if Samsung were
to end up paying I think it was the the
expectation was that they were gonna pay
like a billion dollars that was one of
suppose that was what they wanted how
much money is that for Samsung it's not
really ours it's right but like
considering that it's such a big company
a billion dollars it's not gonna harm it
one way or another obviously it would
like to keep the billion dollars but
it's it's I I agree with Joshua's
perspective on this one I'm just it's
interesting that all these like suppose
it like blood feuds I guess from
companies and lawsuits are just like oh
we're just gonna settle this and said
like the Google way Moe and not Google
uber way mo mmm-hmm like trial also
ended in that way was so anticlimactic
realize I did some time not still going
alone yeah they settled it oh yeah yeah
yeah now I remember that but yeah that's
that's unfortunate but you know it's
there's a very good reason for this and
it's usually that your lawyers say that
like waiting for a jury or a judge to
determine the outcome is much more risky
and problematic but the thing is is that
they did trial after trial after trial
in this particular case and it just kept
going and this was expected to continue
going into appeals which Apple versus
Samsung so it's it's nice to see that I
guess it's finally ending the major
smartphone patent war this was the big
one that was finally sunsetting let's
continue on with another comment from
Josh does this suit affect current
generation phones
I don't think so this was this was
related and you know look it's I don't
think Apple ever successfully got
Samsung's products off of the market in
the first place so I don't I don't
believe that it affects current
generation phones and Samsung made some
design changes in the intervening years
to prevent further exposure it just does
feel like seven years of wasted fighting
now like the more I look back at it when
I'm like well this doesn't really affect
anything now well ok cool they just they
throw a lot of money at it yeah nothing
matters yep well
let's take one from Matthew - are the -
and the Chad did anyone see the news
that Washington DC wants to raise taxes
on uber and lyft to be able to give
money to the metro system now I haven't
heard about this we are in New York
dacher we rely on you can keep us up to
date with what's going on in DC did you
guys hear anything about this I know
there have been kind of like rumblings
around about how to exploit some of
these car share services to benefit the
local businesses in a number of
different I mean yeah that was that was
a similar plan that they wanted to do in
New York with like the subway fare stuff
or at least like subway repairs but it
wasn't uber and lyft so or like ride
shares it was just like anything from
like the TLC in general which would
include uber and lyft but also like
yellow cabs the the whole idea was that
like if you were traveling like in a
certain region or something like that or
at a certain distance that like they
would take some of that money and use
that for like repairing like the MTA and
like all the all the problems that like
the subway has so I'm not surprised they
pitched something like that for
Washington DC I didn't hear about it but
it does seem to fall in line with what
they've been pitching in other cities
yeah if if a revenue stream becomes big
enough the government will probably find
a way to go after it at some point so
I'm also not surprised by this and
thanks for mentioning a - here's one
from Tammy Thompson let's go back to the
patents
how can you patent common functionality
because coevolution happens with
technology as it does in nature with
similar develops happening with the form
factor following function and feature
demand she's got a great point it's hard
to really kind of pinpoint who is truly
responsible however if we look at
history everybody comes up with
something first and then Apple figures
out how to market it better yeah I think
in apples like patent dispute though
some of the things that they were
arguing for weren't exactly common
functionality like the swipe to unlock
stuff also like the actual like the look
of the phone yeah yeah so like there
were some very basic phone design
elements and you know features that we
take for granted these days that were
part of this lawsuit yeah
here's one from dray Faye what patents
exactly are we talking about like to
swipe to open or neither them even
and use anymore what specific things as
far as the smartphone functionality goes
it was Apple fighting the Samsung about
so by the way going back to Tammy's
question and I I definitely appreciate
your comments Tammy how do you know
which patent or whose idea it was first
I mean like this was the whole purpose
of like it took them seven years they
they went through multiple rounds of
discovery
it was super complicated and Apple you
know put its best case forward and
Samsung put its base case forward to try
to figure out well okay where did this
idea originated from as far as the
original patents the ones that I know
about and that you mentioned were you
know swipe to unlock features or like
the swipe and I think pinch-to-zoom a
mention in this one and also just like
basic that's like like the whole like
shape of it and all this stuff and like
where the camera wasn't on all that yeah
thank you
yeah I know it's it goes to a very
important point with tech patents too is
that there's been a lot of disagreement
that the government allows these tech
companies to have these very vague
patents that they can then use for
litigation and so that's that's another
issue that is hopefully being fixed we
invented touching buttons right okay
exactly but like if you could patent
something like that yeah then you will
so there are a lot of companies that
just you know push forward as many
patents as they possibly can hoping to
get them approved and then you can
utilize them for future litigation so
this was depending on what side you're
on one could argue that this was exactly
what was going on in the Apple versus
Samsung situation from Ryan Williams
wouldn't Samsung then make money off the
iPhone 10 sales if they provided that
display yes and they absolutely do yes
yeah they I mean like they're a supplier
for the iPhone 10 with the OLED screens
we all know that there was actually news
today that LG is now gonna be a second
supplier for OLED screens and yeah it's
an interesting storyline specifically
for the iPhone 10 where Samsung wins
whether you buy a Samsung phone or an
iPhone in this current cycle
here's one from APEC is Amazon
is the Amazon shipping program going to
add to the job market or add instability
with uber or even take away from other
shipping companies it's a great question
I'm hard to predict it's it's hard to
predict from Amazon's perspective they
claim that there's so much demand going
on in e-commerce that the PI keeps
growing and therefore the traditional
shippers are gonna have plenty of
business going forward so that's not
going to harm them whether it takes away
from gig economy workers that's a really
good question and we'll just have to
find out yeah I'm more curious if it
will it will actually take off because
like Amazon announces like a lot of
programs like I always think like that's
probably just gonna flop like I don't
know who's really gonna use this yeah
they do big splashy and I totally agree
they do big splashy announcements they
got a ton of press and buzz about this
what if they only end up with like three
companies that want to you know actually
use this service so we'll we'll
definitely keep an eye on that here's a
counter-argument towards a peg from Ryan
that I thought was a really fantastic
conversation and makes us feel
irrelevant to even have the podcast cuz
you guys have all the great commentary
APEC says would that decrease the cost
and shipping altogether since they're
using their own shipping service so
these are this is like a partnerships
shipping service but yes in effect if
you create this satellite of smaller and
medium sized delivery partners Amazon's
ultimate goal is to lower shipping costs
because their shipping costs are
skyrocketing I mean like everybody's
buying more from Amazon which is a good
thing for the company but they're also
trying to figure out that's what a
manager shipping costs for them right
like not people ordering stuff because
if if I have like Amazon Prime I'm not
paying for shipping anyway that's true
however they just raised Amazon Prime
this year by like $20 so you could
indirectly benefit from them lowering or
at least restraining there but I don't
think they're gonna lower Amazon Prime
no I said they lower the shipping costs
totally agreed the best case scenario
would be that they would hold back on
raising yeah I'm again in future years
unlike instead of doing it three or four
years from now maybe they would do it
five or six years from now yeah but
somebody's got to pay for the expert for
the expanse
and other Amazon Prime original series
like I thought that's what every yes
yeah I'm original shows it's the best
deal in retail ever everybody should
have Prime according to Jeff Bezos
according to Jeff Bezos one more from
Matthew dacher do we think delivering
for Amazon will be as good a job as
steadily working for an established
company like UPS or FedEx good luck with
that one guys you work for the
establishment company like UPS or FedEx
like half your time is already
delivering for Amazon I feel yeah so
there could be a bit of a complication
in starting a delivery company that's
like beholdin to just one company yeah
you know like there are risks associated
with that so like coming back to like
uber there's a very good reason why
Oberer drivers are also lyft drivers
they want to diversify their income
streams they don't know if like ubers
gonna screw them over one way or another
so the possibility of that happening if
you start a business completely through
this service Amazon is obviously trying
to make it very attractive but are they
gonna be a good partner in the future
what's what's the possibility of you
branching out and starting to work with
other companies like Walmart so those
are the things that people are really
gonna have to think about before joining
onto the service yeah I feel like it'd
be like if you only had you'll all your
like live shows and stuff like only on
Facebook or something like that like
you're not I'm like any other like
platform like promoting your stuff I
imagine like that's what it'd be like if
you were only delivering for Amazon yeah
yeah and there's probably plenty of work
to go around right now but like who's to
say what happens at five years from now
so that's that's definitely a good
question some good good insights from
the chat today as always one more from
APEC as far as patents go don't
basically all tech have patent rights
from so many companies that it's a
mismatch of who gets a piece of the pie
when it comes to the money maybe yes not
really sure the question we're not
business analysts now I'm not I'm not
really sure what that question is
I'm just here to make fart jokes man I'm
really into okay I'm gonna say yes we're
gonna try to research that a peck sorry
about that hey let's break them all with
a little bit we're at the end of the
show just about out of time let's help a
new friend Michael Lambert
they're just getting into podcasts what
would we recommend he has Spotify I
think as far as what's on our playlist
and what services we use you guys go
ahead I don't listen to podcast oh you
just start no I just star in podcasts I
I feel like the iTunes like the podcast
app on the iPhone is really helpful and
they have like top charts that you can
find all sorts of things on various
categories so there's a tune in stitcher
right but these are there's like a ton
of podcast stuff these days so if you're
interested in tech they're like so many
different tech podcasts like and you can
delve into like very specific areas like
crypto if you're interested in crypto or
listen to me yeah I mean like there's
there's a lot of stuff from like NPR
that you could listen to I also really
like guy Roz has a podcast called
how I built it which which I listened to
a lot so I recommend I used to listen to
a lot of them I listened like
freakanomics regularly and which is also
from NPR 99% invisible which both of
those are excellent yeah yeah you
totally slow played what the hell man
you listen to a podcast that's my move
here that's my move but no I don't I
don't listen I don't really listen
anymore just because it's like I'm not
interested in them anymore the new wave
is VR cast no that's not yeah I mean
those are two great podcast I would
start with if you like game show kind of
podcast there's a wait wait don't tell
me if I never miss wait wait and then
there was another one that's similar to
it that they do on Saturdays do you know
what I'm talking about Brian it's not
wait wait don't tell me what is
something similar to it's like all pun
based and stuff
oh shoot if you had an ass I would
remember the title hang on it's uh
no fear well I remember host name is
ephyra
hang on hang on go ahead you guys talk
so this is like also like considered a
Golden Age of podcasts obviously we're
not included in that I guess by either
way if you're asking me another ask me
not yeah that's a great podcast with
OFIR Eisenberg and it's it's shot here
at the Bell House in New York and
England yeah if if you're interested in
just like kind of seeing where like
podcasts like started to like really get
their energy back like I would listen to
cereal also because that's kind of like
the granddaddy you know we're all like
the excitement about podcasts really
came back yeah I'm gettin itchy waitin
for a third season here mm-hmm spin-off
I mean let's go ahead and self plug we
got us here on the 359 podcast it's
available all over the place we'll tell
you about that at the end of the show
Cena also has a book club now which Dan
Ackerman and Scott Steinhaus and they
talked to fantastic authors there is
also oh what's the one the Ian's hosts
Ben what's that called status update
status I wouldn't is not status updated
as often is the 359 but you could
definitely check that out show is
updated as often as we're the only Daily
Show from Cena yes that's true but we
also now have the the UK podcasting
backup that's right and those kids are a
lot of fun mm-hmm
as far as platforms go a lot of people
in the chat are shouting out google
podcasts which I did try out just as a
platform it really is the only reason I
haven't adopted it even being like a
mega Google user myself is because I
adopted stitcher 10 12 years ago and I
built out my library in there and they
functioned largely the same so for me to
migrate the whole thing that Google just
seems kind of silly since I've already
built it in to my echo at home and all
of my mobile devices so I'm sticking
with stitcher just because I'm
grandfathered in but Google podcast is a
fantastic platform to nice and I guess
that's about it for comment Arian
questions I do want to mention for a
little bit of trivia today on June 28th
6:28 is today the circle constant based
on the radius instead of the diameter
it's also international caps lock day
which
celebrated again on a why over 22nd I
know make sure I should have mentioned
that at the beginning so that you could
all use caps lock in the chat when
commenting very very bad idea come on it
make it easier to read my eyes are
starting to go anyways that is it for us
for the week like we mentioned earlier
on we are on a bit of a staggered
schedule for the next couple of weeks
Rogers traveling Ben's working on a big
project alfred is working on a project a

around doing projects ourself so it's
gonna be harder to get us all to sit
down and do a consistent daily show we
will be back a week from today live on
Thursday and then again a week from that
live on Thursday doing a bit of a weekly
recap for you and there also we've got
like a Monday show in the can so yeah
