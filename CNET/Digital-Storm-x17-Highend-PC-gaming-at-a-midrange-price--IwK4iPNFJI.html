look at the digital storm x17 now I'm
not gonna lie to you this is not the
prettiest laptop on the block although
it may look very familiar because if
you've seen some other reviews we've
done at boutique gaming laptops we've
got shopping for one yourself or maybe
from digital storm from origin or anyone
those other little companies they all
kind of the same because they're all
built around the same off-the-shelf
chassis in this case from a company
called cleveo and what boutique gaming
laptop and desktop companies do is they
get these generic cases then they open
them up put in their own high-end
components assemble it by hand
burn it in test it and then send it to
you so you're really paying for the
assembly the high-end components the
testing the really in-depth support that
comes with it not for the actual look
and feel of the laptop because this is a
very premium price product it's $2,000
doesn't really look and feel like a
$2,000 laptop all the value is really on
the inside rather than the outside but
if you're ok with that this is actually
the best price I've been able to find
for this particular set of components
which has a quad core Core i7 processor
the highest end of AMD's current
graphics cards and 16 gigs of ram which
is pretty cool
coupled with unfortunately a keyboard
that's backlit but not a fantastic
keyboard a touchpad that's pretty small
with little clunky buttons down there at
the bottom at least if you're gonna be
gaming a lot on the big 17 inch 1080p
screen you're probably gonna have an
external mouse plugged in all the time
so the touchpad shouldn't bother you too
much
some companies customized this case a
little bit like by putting a different
back panel on it in this case digital so
I'm just kind of wrote their name over
here and again on the back that actually
kind of takes away from looking little
bit more you don't want rather be sort
of you know generic and understated you
may not want to take this let's say to
the coffee shop not that you'd fit in
one of those little coffee shop booths
with a big honking laptop like this so
unlike some other gaming big systems
like I'll say the Razer Blade that a
very slim or or an HP Envy
they can also be reasonably slim this is
big its
it's chunky it's heavy however the
performance is fantastic and even though
it's still expensive at $2,000 it's a
couple hundred bucks less and you'll be
able to put the same system together
from from other boutique PC vendors I'm
Dan Ackerman and that is the digital
storm x17</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
