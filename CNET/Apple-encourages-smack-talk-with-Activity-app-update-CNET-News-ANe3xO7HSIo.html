activity sharing and it couldn't be
simpler all you have to do is swipe to
the right of your own activity rings and
there you will see your selected family
and friends rings as well now you can
sort by whatever metric is most
important to you so you can sort by step
so you can sort by workouts you can even
sort by exercise minutes here you'll see
that I've sorted by the move ring and
I'm right where you'd expect me to be
I'm getting my butt kicked by Stacy but
I'm a Niall 18 Jeff which makes me very
happy if you want to see more details
all you do is tap on anyone on your
activity list and you'll get an up close
look at their activity rings but you can
also see things like their daily step
count and their workouts even from third
parties but one of my favorite features
is that you can communicate directly
with the people that you're sharing
activity with right in the activity app
through messages and when you do you'll
get smart replies that are geared around
fitness and activity some are supportive
some are a little more competitive but
you can also do some fun things for
example at the end of a workout you
could send your racing heart rate to one
of your activity friends or your racing
heart rate to one of your activity
friends or you can also send smack-talk
in your own voice right through audio
messages so we think this is going to be
a great way for you and your friends to
stay motivated to keep each other active
and we can't wait for you to try it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
