making your dumb speaker smart plug it
into any existing speaker and you'll be
ready to stream music over Wi-Fi almost
instantly here's what you need to set up
and how to get started what you'll need
a chromecast Audio naturally plugged in
to power a speaker with a 3.5 millimeter
input RCA or optical input and an
Android or iOS device with a music app
supported by chromecast these includes
spotify and google play music plug in
the chromecast Audio to power then make
sure the 3.5 millimeter jack is inserted
into the device plug the other end of
that cable into the 3.5 millimeter input
in your speaker change the input on your
speaker so it's looking for the analog
or 3.5 millimeter connection this
speaker has bluetooth already but I'm
using chromecast Audio distri meso I
don't get incoming cool noises and
notifications
once you're all plugged in download and
start up the chromecast app on Android
go to the devices tab and select the
chromecast Audio on iOS if the app
doesn't automatically detect you on your
chromecast go to Wi-Fi settings connect
there and then come back to the app once
your phone has found the chromecast
Audio you can get it to play a test
sound through your speakers yes once you
hear that noise make a name for your
chromecast Audio if desired and activate
guest mode if you want to enter your
password to connect the chromecast to
the same Wi-Fi network your Android or
iOS device is connected to and you're
ready to go now you can use one of your
music apps to play music to the speaker
simply look for the cast icon and select
the chromecast audio device from your
phone you can control volume and change
tracks stop casting by going into the
chromecast app and underneath devices
select stop casting
you can also use chromecast Audio with
headphones but hey you'll still be
tethered to power and probably look a
little bit silly that's been a quick
look at setting up the chromecast Audio
I've Alexis Avedis foreseen it and if
you want to find out more about the
chromecast Audio see matcom is the place
to go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
