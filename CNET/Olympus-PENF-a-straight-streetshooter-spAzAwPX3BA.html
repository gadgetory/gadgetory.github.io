I've had for street photography with a
micro four-thirds camera to date it
delivers first-rate photo quality and
performance for the system I'm Laurie
Brennan and this is the Olympus PEN F
the first Olympus model to use the
latest 20 megapixel Four Thirds sensor
and to ditch the pen lines viewfinder
list design it's streamlined
architecture and relatively powerful
feature set squarely hits its target for
Street shooting and it's fast with
pretty accurate autofocus so it's no
slouch as a general-purpose model for
enthusiasts either the pen F based on
the film camera of the same name has a
front dial that Olympus uses to control
filters and color adjustments you can
operate it without taking your eye from
the viewfinder other perks include for
custom setting slots on the mode dial
and Olympus is live bulb lifetime and
live composite features Olympus is
high-res mode which combines multiple
slightly offset shots to produce a
high-resolution photo does produce much
better more naturally resolved to detail
but it really requires a tripod for best
results I'm a soft spot for Micro Four
Thirds cameras for street photography
given the significantly smaller lenses
they tend to be worth the trade-off of
slightly increased depth of field and
slightly crunch your look of the JPEGs
really it turns your camera bag into a
clown car full of lenses without
breaking your back
it does have some drawbacks the HD video
isn't as sharp as competitors 4k it
doesn't have a grip and it's not just in
weather sealed which it really should be
for it's rather steep $1,200 price tag</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
