more than just for games at the oculus
connect conference Facebook CEO Mark
Zuckerberg showed off how live chat will
work inside virtual reality with the
oculus rift headset when you're in a VR
chat the participants show up as cartoon
avatars and you can give your avatar
different expressions like happy or in
shock or confused right now you would
have to use a controller to change the
expressions but in the future it may be
able to animate automatically based on
how you're speaking or your gestures the
environment of the chat can be any video
or photo you want the demo was bouncing
between underwater seeing the surface of
Mars the Facebook office and Zuckerberg
home there's also some social fun built
in like the ability to play cards or
have your avatar hold different objects
and if someone draws a weapon on you
well just draw one of your own literally
take a marker draw a sword and swing
your doodle around you can also take a
video call in VR and have the whole gang
join in when Zuckerberg wife Priscilla
Chan called in from her phone everyone
could see her video and she was able to
see into the virtual world there was
even a virtual selfie taken and posted
to Facebook in 2014 Facebook purchased
oculus for 1 billion dollars before
there was any product and now two years
later we're seeing the social
possibilities for VR the oculus rift
requires a tethered connection to a
high-end PC but Facebook wants to lower
the cost of getting into VR by building
a cheaper wireless headset the prototype
is called Santa Cruz it's still in a
very early testing phase it's a bit like
microsoft's hololens which can track how
your head moves in the world the company
is also working with computer
manufacturers to create a more
affordable PC that can run virtual
reality like a $500 computer and for
those touch hand controllers well
they're coming in December with
pre-orders beginning October 10th for
$200 also coming at the end of the year
are $50 oculus earphones that's it for
