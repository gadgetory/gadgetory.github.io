style the Motorola RAZR could be making
a comeback this month a new teaser video
posted to YouTube hints at a relaunch of
the Motorola RAZR yes remember back in
2004 when it was the coolest thing to
have one of these flip phones cool like
high school remember high school wasn't
life better than no no not really and
for me the razor was out during college
but yeah yeah I get the nostalgia at the
end of the video it just has the
Motorola logo with the date of the
Lenovo tech world event
June 9th Lenovo is the new owner of the
Motorola phone brand so in two weeks
will we find out that this new razor
will look like the old model the razor
was popular because of its sleek design
it was the finished phone and I had a
satisfying flip snap feel in a pre
iPhone world more than a hundred million
razors were sold and they came in
different colors and designs you have to
wonder if a new razor will be updated
with a touchscreen or Android interface
the name razor has been resurrected
before for a line of Droid smartphones
but it's just not the same if they don't
flip maybe people will want something
like this as a secondary simple
going-out phone just for calls and
photos and with today's voice commands
you don't really need a large
touchscreen to type I'm Bridget Carey
