shout about and it's called the p9 the
p9 packs a whole heap of high-end tech
but here I specifically want to talk
about its unusual camera Huawei has
partnered with high-end photography
brand Leica for the p9 while Leica
hasn't provided any hardware for the
phone Huawei has said that the overall
quality is sufficient for like her to at
least certify the phone the first thing
you'll notice about it is that it has
not one but two cameras on the back
while they both have 12 megapixel
sensors only one of them shoots in color
the other shoots in black and white this
is for a couple of reasons first of all
quarry reckons this will let you snap
much more natural-looking
black-and-white shots than simply using
a black and white filter by pairing the
black and white and color sensors in a
single shot however Huawei claims the p9
can shoot vibrant colour pictures with
the high contrast provided by the black
and white sensor adding two lenses also
allows the phone to make a decent
judgment at how far away an object is
this enables the phone to pick out that
subject from its background and then
artificially blur the background
mimicking the shallow depth of field
effects that you can normally only
achieve with a DSLR you can alter the
amount of depth of field you want after
you've taken the image as well along
with being able to refocus the shot and
selectively apply filters to the subject
in the foreground you'll also find a
variety of other shooting modes onboard
as well including HDR panorama beauty
modes and a manual mode which lets you
set your own shutter speed and ISO it's
early days yet that have already been
impressed by some of the result I've got
from the p9 camera I am really looking
forward to getting to grips with it to
see if a like a branding lives up to
expectations</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
