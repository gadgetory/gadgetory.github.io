the results are in on automatic braking
technology and what capacitors are about
to modernize under your hood it's time
to check the tech EC cars differently we
love them on the road and under the hood
but also check the tech and are known
for telling it like it is ugly is
included at no extra cost the good the
bad the bottom line this is CNET on cars
welcome to CNET on cars to show all
about high-tech cars and modern driving
i'm brian coulis well deep sales have
been on a tear the last couple of years
nicely timed with a lineup that
emphasizes SUVs and crossovers right
about the time americans rush back to
them post recession and post soaring
fuel prices but to my eye the most
interesting story coming out of jeep
happens to be on the small end the
little almost pocketable renegade let's
drive this italian jeep and check the
tech the new Jeep renegade has the
undeniable appeal of a Hot Wheels car
it's cool
compact and craveable and we have the
top-of-the-line the trailhawk
let's check the tech
when I saw this Jeep renegade get
unveiled at the Geneva Motor Show back
in 2014 I was pretty sure we were
looking at a free quarter scale mock-up
so they could get it to fit up on the
stand there this actually shares a
platform with the Fiat 500x it's a
subcompact but with real all-wheel drive
as its passport into this very busy
sector of the auto bills these renegades
are made right alongside Fiat at an FCA
plant in Melfi Italy in a sense you're
getting an American icon and an Italian
car for under 30 grand can't do that
with a Pantera now inside the renegade I
get the feel if they're trying to
emphasize its cheapest to take your mind
off its Italian this and its smallness
the Jeep stick is everywhere it's here
it's here it's here and it's there
there are several available you connect
head units on the renegade ours is an
upscale six and a half inch touchscreen
also voice driven we've seen and liked
this guy before mostly for its simple
almost cartoony interface it's got
highly rated easy-to-use Garmin
navigation there a handful of familiar
apps you can load if the App Store
itself ever loads and a Wi-Fi hotspot
can be configured in this car as will an
interesting sunroof option called my sky
it powers back like most but then you
can also pop out the front and/or rear
panels entirely to get a really big hole
obstructed however by a structural bar
under the hood our high trim trailhawk
version has the big engine and even
that's only 2.4 liters and four
cylinders does 180 horsepower and 175
pound feet of torque through a 9 speed
automatic only average mpg is 24 in
addition to blind spot technology you
can also option a renegade with forward
collision technology that will actively
brake for you an active Lane Departure
technology that will steer you back in
your lane those are unusual in this
class on the road I'm afraid to report
now the drive behavior of this
powertrain is rubbery and loopy they
made a 2.4 feel like a 1.4 I made a 9
speed automatic feel like a CVT but
neither of those is ahead of course on
the positive side we have real all-wheel
drive underneath including on this
particular renegade a 20 to 1 crawl mode
of course you've got all-wheel drive
lock you've got real low range and it's
got a different approach departure skid
pans front rear even bright red tones
this is a serious off-road er not just
an all-wheel drive vehicle it's of note
that even a 4x4 renegade like this can
be a true front-wheel drive vehicle
unless you need all four driven it
physically disconnects the rear drive
until needed all in interest of less
drag and better fuel economy now under
our renegade we have the first use of
Kony's frequency selective damping
shocks these mechanically change their
firmness based on the frequency of the
inputs coming up through the wheels that
way they'll be ideal for handling on
smooth roads but be more comfortable and
forgiving on bad ones
all without expensive electronic
adaptive suspension I found the handling
on smooth corners was quite good the
ride quality on choppy pavement was kind
of choppy in some the renegade looks
great drives like hell but that's not
gonna hurt its sales prospects it's
entering just about the hottest category
in the US auto market and it's in chic
find our full review on that new Jeep
renegade all new models receive at cars
Dakshina
dot-com one of the most interesting
pieces of self-driving technology is
already here is the ability of many cars
to automatically brake when they detect
a collision that maybe you don't detect
saving your bacon and directly adding to
the bottom line of safety on the road
but how well does it really work we have
some early answers for the smarter
drivers you would see that on cards
in everyday driving nothing is more
fundamental to avoiding a collision than
stopping before you have one but too
often humans are well you and don't
brake in time or at all
that's where forward collision avoidance
technology comes in and ideally appears
in cars we really buy not just as a
pricey option on pricey ones the
Insurance Institute for Highway Safety
has been watching forward collision
technology come down to earth in three
flavors there's the warning warning you
of a forward collision pre charging the
brakes before a collision to increase
their effectiveness when you do get on
them if it detects a high risk of impact
the system will prime the brakes to help
you stop more quickly and automatic
braking so the car will pull itself
partially or fully to a stop even if you
drop the ball and there's the auto brake
vehicle stop by itself just two years
ago nearly three-quarters of new cars
didn't offer any kind of forward
collision tech just two model years
later the number lacking it is down to
under half though just four percent of
models offer it standard of a variety of
cars that offer this tech ten models
from Acura BMW Mazda and Chrysler earned
a superior rating with five or six out
of six points a separate study by the
highway loss data Institute found that
two models of Volvo's from 2010 to 2012
with automatic braking had insurance
claim rates that were 15 to 16 percent
lower and the latest Volvo's offer the
first automatic braking that will
intervene if you're about to make a very
ill-advised left turn against traffic it
pays to double check if your next car
offers forward collision tech what if
any degree of self braking it includes
and how well the whole system is rated
to actually work it's a fundamental
feature that could pay for itself pretty
easily the first time you don't rear-end

Bridge most electricity stored in your
car today
is either in its 12-volt battery that
runs the starter lights and ignition or
in a big motive battery if your car is
an Eevee or a plug-in hybrid but there
is another way in a capacitor capacitors
are caps store electricity like
batteries but differing in four major
ways first they charge really fast
second they discharge or deliver
electricity really fast both of those
behaviors because unlike your car's
battery capacitor store electricity as
electricity not as a chemical soup that
contains electric potential thirdly caps
are light no LED plates and acid
solution and fourth they laugh at
extreme weather but traditionally one
big downside has kept capacitors out of
a car's powertrain and that is low
energy density capacitors have usually
held a small fraction of the energy
found in a car battery and took up a lot
of space to do that
enter ultra capacitors these have a much
higher energy density so they can do
more work and yet still fit inside
today's tight engine bays and other
locations and their time seems to have
arrived on the coattails of new car tech
like automatic start/stop electronic
adaptive suspension and electric turbos
each of those demand a lot of new
current that is delivered in as little
as milliseconds yet to preserve
efficiency want their power source to be
recharged easily capacitors have that
written all over them
Toyota's Supra hvr hybrid race car used
a super cap in its powertrain to store
power for an electric boost motor and
doing so it won the tokachi 24 hour race
in 2007 a capacitor which is like a
battery but charges in seconds more
down-to-earth Mazdas oddly named ie loop
tech in their cars today uses a
capacitor but not to drive the car in
their case they use it to power
accessories and that takes load off the
traditional harder to charge lead acid
battery ie loop uses a special
alternator that freewheels when the
engine moves the car but the moment you
let off the gas it wakes up to turn
outgoing energy into electricity
capacitors themselves are nothing new
but super capacitors being found under
the hood likely will be in a moment your
email how to survive a rollover with
technology and nitrogen or air in your
time when CNET on cars returns
you
the Panamera has everything in it I want
from a Porsche
it's got performance handling power and
yes the looks as well but on top of that
it's got roof my kids in the back and
all the luggage we could possibly throw
at it this is the Porsche for the real
world buy more from the ex car team of
CNET UK @c Netcom /s car welcome back to
C net on car so I'm Brian Cooley it's
that time in the show when I take a few
of your emails first one I've got here
is coming up from Hari who has a
question about nitrogen inflation of
tires
he asked what difference does it make in
fuel economy and mileage the life of the
tire and the ride quality of the car if
you fill your tyres with nitrogen
instead of the more commonly available
and universally used atmospheric air
well are even nitrogen entire thing
comes down to two fundamental
differences from air the first is larger
molecules and this means the nitrogen
molecule is just bigger than the
molecules of air you get at the standard
pump those larger molecules have a
harder time escaping through the
microporosity the slight leakage that
every rubber tire has especially old
tires
that means they hold their pressure
longer without you having to refill them
the other key things is that nitrogen
has less moisture it's almost absolutely
dry what happens with regular air in
your tires is as you drive the tire eats
up from friction and deforming all the
time that causes the moisture in the air
to expand of course and that causes the
tires overall pressure to go up then
when you park on the tire gets cold it
goes back down you're always doing this
with tire pressure nitrogen doesn't
really have that problem it's very
stable on tire pressure and that
consistent pressure is good because you
want to maintain an optimal rolling
resistance to get better fuel economy
and at the tire handle and deform the
way it's designed to now reality check
this is not a really big deal the amount
of change in pressure from that moisture
and regular air has been factored in for
ages by manufacturers and tire makers
that's why you get this thing called
cold
si it tells you where to inflate your
tires when they are cold and have not
been driven a lot that freeway speeds
for example as far as those larger
molecules escaping it's definitely a
bonus but air escapes very slowly in
modern tires wheels valves and valve
stems it's not something you can't keep
on top of by merely checking your tires
once a month that's all you've got to do
once a quarter we'll probably do it
actually
and therefore my recommendation on
nitrogen is this if you get new tires
and they put it in great if you've got
an easy cheap source to keep adding it I
guess that's worth it but otherwise I
would just invest in a tire gauge and
check your tires just occasionally and
you'll be absolutely fine now it is
important to keep your tires at the
right pressure though if you have a 25%
drop entire pressure it equals over 16%
increased rolling resistance that's
substantial also an under inflated tire
gets a lot hotter when it's driving than
one that's properly inflated and that
causes more yo-yo effect of the pressure
in the tire that fatigues the tire
sooner and an under inflated tire is
dangerous when it comes to vehicle
stability on the road so keep those
tires pumped up at the right pressure
but you don't need nitrogen to get any
of this done Tomas de writes in with a
question about an accident he was in
recently and technology that could have
made it a little less grisly he says I
was a passenger in a car involved in a
rollover crash due to the seat belt I
sustained compression fractures in my
spine and says he had a broken sternum
as well I went back he says to examine
the car before they crushed it and it
appeared as though the back tire was
also under inflated which could have
contributed to the flip I seem to recall
on your show seeing a technology that
allowed the seat to absorb some of the
impact taken by pushing down in the seat
during certain kinds of accidents and he
wants to know what that technology was
well first of all Thomas you're thinking
about a Volvo technology we covered
recently in their new SUV and this has
got the kind of odd awkward name of run
off-road protection it uses a
compressible structure in the bottom of
the seat so that when a car leaves the
road and lands hard perhaps on a lower
plane or on any other surface that the
seat will crush
down toward the floor taking that force
that normally would be offloaded to your
spine as you know all too well it also
has a technology that snugs up the belt
in the milliseconds of the impact
keeping you from a any slop to the belt
you may have had a situation in your
crash where the belt was a little loose
it locked and then you slammed against
it
that often can cause chest injuries
helicopter seats have done something
similar to what Volvo is doing they've
done that for decades where they had
this variable crush zone underneath they
do with elaborate shock absorbers and
levers because sometimes helicopter is
coming on hard landings especially when
they auto rotate now you told me in the
subsequent email you were in a 2007
model year car I'm not going to get into
the make and model of it cuz I don't
think it's actually germane to the
discussion but I do want to point out
three model year milestones everyone
should be aware of three things that
happen starting with 2007 cars in the US
were required to have TPMS the tire
pressure monitoring system that means
that the tires and wheels monitor their
pressure and record it in to a small
display somewhere on the instrument
panel that's US law in 2009 we got the
requirement of new rollover standards
vehicles went from having to take one
and a half times their own weight on
their roof to surviving three times
their own weight on their roof that's a
big difference in keeping that vehicle a
safe cocoon around you in a rollover
accident like you were in and the third
thing I want to call out is 2012 was the
milestone when electronic stability
control became required on all new US
cars now it was very common before that
but required as of 2012 these three to
me sort of draw a line in the sand of
late-model used cars where I'm gonna
make sure I've got all three of those
which pushes me out to around 2010 or
later to get a car that's really loaded
up on these critical technologies
especially for the kind of accident you
were in
thanks for watching I hope you enjoyed

particular keep those coming it's on
