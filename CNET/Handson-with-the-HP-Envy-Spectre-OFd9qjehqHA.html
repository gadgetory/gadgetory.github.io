I've got a brand new friend this is the
HP Spectre is part of the envy lining
when we talk about innovative laptops
this is one that definitely does things
that no one else has it's covered on
three surfaces with Gorilla Glass that's
the top the screen as well as the pad
down here and including the trackpad as
well that supports multi-touch features
now you also have some other specs about
this this will be a 14-inch screen
packed in a 13.3 inch display and also
come with a 1.6 gigahertz core i5
processor or 1.8 giga hertz core i7
processor depending on the configuration
you get they'll come loaded with a 128
solid state hard drive as well as four
gigs around let's also talk about some
of the other unique features i mentioned
how it has a multitrack touch pad so
that supports more than one finger for
some really cool multi-touch gestures on
this side you'll also notice that you'll
have kind of this wheel for volume
control on the outside of physical
volume wheel on the side so that makes
it really unique it does come with Beats
Audio technology inside and you'll also
notice there's a little mute button for
a volume as well so those are 10 I like
the hardware buttons on the edge then if
I flip it over to this other side to
keep its sleek form factor it's only 20
millimeters thick when it's closed this
is an Ethernet port but what happens is
an Ethernet port is a lot thicker than
this so it has this hinge that adjusts
when you want to pop in your Ethernet
cable so I thought that was another
really unique feature about this now the
spectre will be available on februari
it'll retail for 1399 but this is one of
the hot items and really innovative
products that we've seen here at CES
2012
