Goodwin associate art etc taking a look
at the garmin hud a little device that's
supposed to make navigating your car a
little bit safer now HUD stands for a
head-up display and you'll actually
mount this little LED display on your
dashboard so that it will project those
turn-by-turn directions right up into
your line of sight where you can see
them without looking away from the road
in the box
you'll actually get a plastic reflector
shield and a reflective film that you
can choose from to reflect these
directions off of so they kind of look
like little Holograms floating in front
of you now this is the reflective
plastic lens and it actually with a
little bit of difficulty snaps on and
when you view the directions through the
shield you can actually see the
directions right side up and floating
sort of in mid-air right before your
eyes now the way the Garmin would
actually like you to experience the hood
is through this transparent plastic film
that they include in the box that you'll
actually attach to your windshield to
project those turn-by-turn directions
upon now they only put one of these in
the box and it's a little tricky to
install so you're going to have to get
it right the first time you're first
going to want to figure out where on the
windshield you want it to be the next
thing you're going to do with wet the
windshield down really good so that we
can move it around a little bit as we
install the next step is to actually
peel off the backing mark with a white
flag just kind of peel that off and then
start applying the HUD to your
windshield
now when the windshields wet you still
get a little bit of leeway and
repositioning it so here's your time to
kind of figure out where exactly you
want it to be once you've got it lined
up you're going to want to take a credit
card or something and actually sort of
squeegee all the bubbles out from under
it so that it's perfectly flat to the
windshield and then the last step is
just grab the green tab and pull off the
front protective film now the last bits
actually the easiest part just peel off
the protective backing to expose the
sticky back panel on the hood and then
you take it and actually just put it on
your dashboard so that the numbers
reflect up through the thing now the
hoods base actually has a little bit of
swivel and a
little bit of twist to give you some
flexibility to mounting this flexible
pad also bends a little bit to better
contour around your dashboard so that'll
actually help you get it good and secure
so it doesn't go flying if you actually
actually make a quick turn now on the
unit itself you've actually got a power
cable right here that plugs into the 12
volt adapter that adapter has a built-in
USB port on the back of it so you can
keep your smartphone charge while you
navigate over on the other side you've
got a small power button which probably
won't have to worry about that much
because when your vehicle turns on and
off when it's plugged into your
cigarette lighter the hood should
actually turn on and off with it so
generally speaking you don't really have
to futz with this much after you've got
it set up now on the front you've got a
photocell right here it's going to
measure the amount of ambient light so
that the display doesn't get blown out
during the daytime but it doesn't dazzle
you during the night it will
automatically adjust this brightness as
needed now what sort of information will
you see you'll actually see an arrow
that will show you where you need to go
and what direction your upcoming turn is
it's a pretty complex arrow beneath it
you'll see Lane guidance information
that'll show you what lane if valid for
the route that you've chosen so you
don't don't worry about very quickly
jumping across four lanes you'll already
know where you need to be on the road in
the next column we've got the number of
feet or miles to the upcoming turn as
well as your time for reaching your
destination below that you've got the
current speed limit and your actual
speed right there now if you run into
traffic or red light cameras you'll
actually get a little red LED right here
that will show you to expect those
things now while all of this is going on
the Navigon or Garmin Street pilot app
is going to be running on your smart
phone giving you the turn-by-turn
directions and supplying them to the
garmin hud the verbal part of those
turn-by-turn directions will either come
out of your smart phone or if your pair
to your car stereo via bluetooth or an
auxilary cable through your car speakers
so you can kind of get it both ways here
now the garmin hud has an MSRP of one
$49.99 and the garmin street pilot or
never gone out that you're going to need
to actually run it I'm going to run you
an extra 50 bucks so that's about two
hundred dollars to get going with this
head-up display navigation at that price
this is a bit more
and it actually is useful but in my
opinion any increase in safety no matter
how small is a good one
I've been in chuan gudem with cnet.com
and we've been taking a look at the
Garmin head-up display or the hood</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
