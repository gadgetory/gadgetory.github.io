promoted to chief design officer at the
company here's how the mastermind behind
the iPod and iPhone rose to become the
most famous designer on the planet
graduating with a first-class degree
Ives first big career step was helping
found tangerine a london-based design
company designing everything from power
tools to toothbrushes I also worked with
client Apple doing some early designs
what would become the PowerBook in 1991
I've joined Apple in 1992 where he
worked on the second version of the
Newton the message pad 110 Apple in the
mid 90s was a far cry from the apple of
today however losing cash and lacking
focus in its product lineup I was
planning on quitting but the return of
co-founder Steve Jobs in 1996 changed
everything with the iMac g3 Apple swept
aside years of Dulce me computers and
Ives work with jobs on this landmark
device thrust him to the forefront of
Apple I would achieve broader
recognition for his contribution to the
iPod in 2001 which I've insisted should
have the pure white color scheme from
the charging cable to the earbuds over
the next decade I would level his
legendary attention to detail at many
Apple hits including the iPhone iPad and
plenty of Mac's
following the death of Steve Jobs in
2012 I've took another major step at
Apple taking charge of software design
as well as hardware the following year
Apple's mobile gadgets got a major
reworking in the form of iOS 7 a flatter
more colorful look that since spread to
the Mac Ives latest creation is the
Apple watch unveiled in 2014 it remains
to be seen whether this wearable gadget
can have the same impact as Apple's
other products but what's certain is
that i've-- has become one of the
company's greatest assets and we're
excited to see what he builds next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
