called the ipad pro it measures 12 point
nine inches and there's an optional
Apple pencil stylus you can get with it
if you like but is this new kind of ipad
a waste of time or is a brilliant
reinvigoration of the tablet we're going
to talk about that now and with me as my
colleague returned home hello rich hello
now you are cautiously optimistic about
the ipad pro yeah i think so i think
it's got kind of an interesting idea
even if it might be more remark attack
sir size than anything else but by
marketing exercise well so the thing is
i bring your own device is a trend
that's been around a little while and
that's basically the idea of bringing
your smartphone to work or your or your
tablet and having your work email on
there and it's it's not separated at all
and that's been causing a bit of tension
with IT departments so i think in terms
of marketing what is quite sensible
thing to do is to make a device and put
the word pro on the end and even though
it's basically still the same thing
you've convinced IT departments around
the world that this is a business device
for business people to do business
things on so you're suggesting that this
is the device it's going to convince big
corporations with millions of employees
to gadget eyes they're essentially the
ipad is potentially because what it is
basically the same as as an ipad or a
phone but just by making it look
slightly different and giving it this
new twist it's like the emperor's new
clothes but that that is sort of has
always been apples raison d'Ãªtre in
fact they probably claim they wrote the
emperor's new clothes they be like hans
christian who who we wrote it well who
yeah exactly we invented that no no no
no Johnny I've wrote that yes exactly
it's fact um I think that what you were
saying about it essentially being the
same thing but that has pro on the end
could be the biggest problem with it
because it's definitely being presented
as like here is an iPad that you can do
a lot more with it sort of the next step
up it's sort of between your iPad and
your macbook creating even more
subdivisions of categories between
smartphones and macbook which
incidentally feels very uh Napa creating
more categories and more slices of
different kinds of Technology feels a
little bit like what Apple was doing in
the 90s where it split the Mac line up
into many many many many options and
different lines and stuff and all got a
bit confusing and frankly rubbish
so I wonder are they smart to create
something that is essentially still an
iPad because it doesn't give you that
much different to a like a normal-size
regular iPad I mean you can do split
screen apps right stuff like that so a
multitasking gets a bit more powerful
but i don't know i think if you bought
this thing expecting it to do bit to
replace your computer I think it'd be as
disappointed as all the people who
bought ipad 2 expecting it to do that
were possible yeah i mean i think the
multitasking thing is quite interesting
the idea of having two apps side by side
is fantastic and I've certainly gone
over to having a larger phone I have a
six-inch phone now I like I can I know I
couldn't live without having a smaller
phone now because it's just there's so
much extra stuff on the screen but one
thing that is missing is having to apt
next to each other because we aren't
really annoying when you're on your
phone and you're constantly having to
tab back between two things you know alt
tab and the kind of equivalent to that
switching between two apps and copying
and pasting and that kind of thing so I
love the idea of having these two things
side by side and I think you have to
have that if you could realistically
going to use it for work if it's that
important to me that I can see two
things at once why am I not just doing
this on a laptop because the laptop is
so good an apple makes such incredible
laptops like we both use MacBook Airs in
a sort of day-to-day working life and
it's brilliant and we're at a point now
where it's not going is not going to be
that much difference in price between a
macbook air and the iPad pro and I just
wonder is this is this a is this an
evolution of the ipad too far like
they're making it so much like the
macbook that I just think just buy the
macbook Lee it just seems to me so
obviously a better device it does come
with the option of the attachable
keyboard but if you're going to attach a
keyboard to a massive unwieldy tab book
you might as well like to say just get a
macbook air when when Steve Jobs
initially revealed the iPad he sort of
used it to have a go at netbooks and it
was a big on screen graphic which I'd
like smartphones and laptops and then in
the middle of like I think it was a big
question mark and into it dropped the
word iPad and it's like da da but I
think we can probably safely say a few
years later that the tablets haven't
really provided a whole new categories
we thought they would because
smartphones get big
and they sort of eat into what tablets
can do from that side while laptops have
got a lot smaller and lighter and you
know consistently more powerful and this
feels to me a bit desperate we know that
Apple's had trouble in recent years with
the iPad in terms of keeping sales
growth high and so something about this
feels not new and progressive and like
that would you buy it if out a keyboard
so apparently you like a keyboard do you
like keyboards what do you like tell us
what you like and we'll make keyboards
pens ebooks also the homely whatever you
want a tablet that's that's huge the
size of a briefcase I think well I think
if anything this sort of seems like
Apple is is is desperate to try and find
new niches right and this seems to be
trying to expand into a market that that
it hasn't been able to conquer before
the idea of a tablet you can draw on is
something that Wacom has been doing for
artists and graphic designers and that
kind of thing for it for a long time and
they've pretty much cornered the market
yeah and so for Apple to be looking
around and to suddenly go well you know
maybe we can try and take some money off
whack on then that feels like they're
they're getting into this sort of this
niche this kind of col de sac but having
had money off whack on how much money
can that be you know they have always
gone into areas where there is you know
people doing this technology but not
doing it in as kind of user-friendly way
as Apple good so Apple comes along and
they take mp3s or they take any other
take digital music they took they took
Internet enabled phones and they said
right how does a bunch of other people
doing it they're not doing particularly
well let's do this really really well on
the one hand it doesn't feel
particularly innovative but then on the
other hand that feels like a criticism
we make of lots of Apple kit that then
turns out to be explosively popular so
when you're saying why would they do
this when Wacom already does it so well
like that's something that you could
have been saying about the iphone like
why are they doing this when blackberry
does it so well and yet I can't shake
this nagging feeling that maybe this
time things are different and the rules
don't apply and maybe this one is just a
bit uninspiring let's talk about the I'm
not going to say the pencil i'm going to
say the stylus speaker because when we
talk about samsung things we rarely say
s pen and i feel we should in the
address of balance
we shouldn't give Apple it's silly
marketing name either talk about the
stylus absolutely what do you what do
you think of that what I mean Steve Jobs
did famously say Denis that if you see a
stylist they've they've messed up yeah
like you know you failed on the
interface level exactly yeah so I'm on
board with pencils generally head pens
Apple pencil styluses what everyone
they've already got to you on board with
pencils generally the day the pencil
died exactly and I mean the Apple did
say as well that you're perfect pointing
implement is is your finger but the
thing is the most important thing is
about what's inside it's already matter
what it looks like can you really draw
with it can you use it to create a
professional quality design in some way
if you're a designer to a comic artist
if you're an artist can you actually use
this thing to you know create this sort
of the nuance and the subtlety that you
need in your drawings are you going to
have those levels of pressure are you
going to be able to have I'm gonna be
able to vary the thickness of your lines
those kind of real kind of detail and
I'm not quintara sure that Apple can do
it but having said that you know there's
going to be a lot of people who maybe
aren't necessarily professional artists
or designers but they do have elements
of design in their work and they can
look professional because they've got
this ridiculous big pro tablet yeah they
can also look cool because they're kind
of drawing and sketching and that kind
of thing so you know I think maybe
that's where the cool factor will come
in okay now that's an interesting idea
it could be cool in a different slightly
non-traditional sort of work okay all
right well folks that's what we think
about the ipad pro but what did you
think of apple's latest tablet let us
know and do stay tuned to cnet com for
much much more</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
