see me - joining me is ian sure
executive editor for CNET thanks for
being with us okay there is a new site
that's getting a lot of attention it's a
bit creepy yeah tell us about it well
it's the websites called NCCAM and it's
basically broadcasting eleven thousand
of the cameras that we all put in our
little homes across the web surveillance
cameras it's everything right yeah
Families camera anything is connected to
the Internet they are they're showing
this to the whole world and the whole
point that they're trying to make is
that all these cameras have their
default passwords and the default
passwords because we can all buy them we
all know them and they said oh let's see
how many people are using default
passwords and seems quite a lot east a
thousand people eleven thousand people
in the US who are doing that yeah and
and this isn't just us this is worldwide
twenty five hundred in UK there's six in
Tanzania all six of them and I mean the
point that they're trying to make is
that it's huge right this whole
connected home stuff is very popular in
the US that's why there's so many of
them and probably also the specific
products that they know about are pretty
popular in the US as well but it is a
huge problem all around the world
um these people are clearly trying to
make a statement about you know
passwords and not using the default
passwords um do we know anything about
the people behind the site not much but
what's important to know is that this is
a long-held tradition around the
internet of shaming people about how
they handle security right people have
gone different lengths for example there
was a group called LulzSec which was
around 2011 and what they did is they
would hack into all sorts of different
places including the FBI and the CIA
okay and they would basically tell us
hey we hacked in these people don't have
very good security and then they would
do bad stuff with it but their whole
point was let's shame people into having
better security now those people ended
up some of them went to jail right but
the important part that insuk am is
trying to make a point about is hey we
all need to be very unknown
knowledgeable about how insecure a lot
of our stuff is and we need to do
something about it okay um there is a
pretty simple fix if you find that your
cameras live feed is being broadcast on
the insta camp site what is it let's
change your password right log into your
camera change the password we think if
you
that might not be simple for a lot of
people it isn't right and this is you
know the question of the blame right
who's responsible
obviously insta cam is showing these
video feeds and if someone doesn't know
they may be in an uncompromised position
are they being motive are people being
careless users being careless all sorts
of stuff and so the thing is we have to
think about it in many ways right this
is a reminder to the companies hey you
should remind people to change your
passwords once you turn on the product
because they only use default password
so it's easy for them to print out the
booklet once and send it all in the same
box
yeah so that's one thing us as users
need to be aware that this is a problem
and that needs to be fixed right and
then obviously insuk am at one point
needs to be responsible and make it so
that maybe you know people in
compromised positions aren't shown on
the one rate and one reassurance is if
you go to the site the feeds are pulling
up very slowly I mean I fortunately yeah
you've got some time yeah all right Ian
thank you so much for inside scoop I'm
