bestbuy get the right gift at the right
price all at your ultimate holiday
showroom hey I'm doll bell today we are
unboxing the apple ipad mini with retina
display the smaller ipad arguably one of
the hotter ipads of the season let's
open this up alright looking a lot like
the fuller size ipad air got these
little bumper protectors here there you
go that is the ipad mini in its box
looking beautiful looking cute glossy
covered in cellophane let's get that
stuff off alright so now for the big
reveal go looks like a white front with
a silverback very pretty and first thing
you'll really notice is that even though
there's the ipad air out there this is
the lightest of the iPads this one's
wang point 73 pounds looking very cool
very lightweight even lighter than the
ipad air also inside the box here you've
got a little sleeve even like a quick
little tour of the ipad mini josie where
everything is the ipad mini information
printed in point 05 von Taer no one's
going to read that and then you've got
your apple stickers just to prove your
worth what else is in the box you've got
your lightning cable USB you're going to
need this for both charging the ipad
mini and also just if you want to sync
any content over from your computer and
then finally a little power brick
where you're going to plug this into the
wall plug the USB in here and charge
your iPad that's it that's all there is
to it nothing else in the box no
headphones notably that's another thing
we noticed about the ipad air also so if
you're going to get this to someone
headphones would be a good thing to
include finally let's boot this guy up
and see if it can work right out of the
box look at that Apple logo coming up
hola alright so when you first boot up
your iPad you're going to be walked
through different steps for setting up
Wi-Fi syncing information setting up
your Apple ID to get into itunes and the
app store all that good stuff so that's
the apple ipad mini with retina display
a big improvement over last year's iPad
Mini because you're getting that faster
processor and that retina display a much
higher resolution display one of the
hottest tablets of the season also one
of my personal favorites</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
