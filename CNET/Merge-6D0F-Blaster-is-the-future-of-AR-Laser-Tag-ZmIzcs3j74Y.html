have a lot more things like the merge
six degree of freedom blaster this is
compatible with a arcade and a our core
and your smartphone and last year
smartphones released a lot of impressive
AR apps that were built into iOS and
Android and Elijah to float things in 3d
what the blaster does is it creates a
gun and accessory that's compatible if
they are ket an AR for there are three
triggers in a button and it's fully
moveable in space you can duck roll
slide around and the graphics in this
demo which are built in air kit work
astonishingly well the blaster is also
going to be multiplayer at lunch so if
you're thinking of some sort of
multiplayer phone laser tag you've got
the right idea that is the goal and
you'll be able to play it with multiple
people and Duke it out
now the AR here again is on a phone not
with glasses maybe that's where AR needs
to be for toys then you don't have to
wear anything that you're going to
stumble around with or recharge this is
using an iPhone 10 we don't know the
price head of the blaster but it feels
solid clicker and the triggers all seem
to work pretty well it looks fun and the
response rate is actually astonishingly
good it's meant to be open other
developers too so that this and even the
Manufacturing's structure of this would
be open for people to tinker with and
create other apps and maybe this could
become a platform I also think there
going to be more things like this too
much like lenovo star wars jedi headset
expect a lot of AR and mixed reality
with your phone in 2018</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
