cnet here at CES 2014 what I have in my
hands is a demo of touchless gesturing
using ultrasound this is from elliptic
lab it was launched at sea tech in Japan
this is the first time we're seeing it
here at CES what's interesting and cool
about this technology is that it's using
regular microphones and ultra sound
speakers to create a wider field of
motion so that means that you can
gesture with your hand above below
anything that you want another advantage
is that it is going to be using low
energy so when you turn gestures on it
should not SAP your battery as quickly
the advantage to ordinary users on their
smartphones and tablets with this kind
of technology that you'll be able to
have a lot more control over gestures so
for example your gesture doesn't have to
be quite so precise to be a little bit
sloppier it can also be a little bit
more complex for example you control
your fingers and that might turn up the
volume on your music or you might spend
your hands to do something else on your
device now elliptic labs isn't making
phones and tablets themselves they are
selling this to other device makers so
what we're seeing now in this prototype
is going to be a little bit different
than what we see on the actual end
product a lot of that has to do with
what those smartphone and tablet makers
want we're going to start seeing this
next generation touchless control
technology and devices very soon in fact
in 2014 I'm Tessa gevalt port for cnet
here at CES you can catch all of our
coverage at peanuts calm</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
