mercedes-benz is gonna show off a whole
new version of their new class model but
here at CES we're seeing what the
dashboard is gonna look like ahead of
time what we have are to twelve point
three inch LCDs one for infotainment and
one for the instrument cluster and
you'll notice down here we have our
normal command controller you'll see
this in mercedes-benz cars today but
we've added a new wrinkle here on the
steering wheel we have little touch
controllers that let me manipulate all
the menus on either screen so I'm on
navigation right now if I push this down
once I get this nice little control
screen for the map app I just move this
touch controller to the side
I go to my zoom can go up or down just
by swiping across here very cool feature
now if I hit this home button I get my
normal set of icons across the top here
which lets me look at radio media phone
or my new favorite here is a way to
configure the instrument cluster because
this is a digital instrument cluster
they've included different design
schemes so right now we're looking at a
classic design we've got a speedometer a
tachometer we expect to see that kind of
thing but what if I want something low
looks a little more sporty I just hit
this button here choose sport and it
reconfigures the gauges with these
yellow numbers which gives it more of a
racing feel so that's pretty cool I can
also go to this progressive one which
just has a single gauge in the middle
but that's not all it can also configure
information shown on the instrument
panel with this left hand controller
right now I'm looking at my trip display
and I can cycle through different trip
information like range eco things like
that but even cooler slide it all the
way to the left and also adjust what
shows up in this right-hand gauge so
right now I'm looking at an engine speed
regular tachometer but if I don't really
care about that I can push this once and
get navigation or I can scroll down and
get another gauge which is my eco
display this actually concentrates on
fuel economy so this is the new
dashboard we'll see in the mercedes-benz
e-class
it'll be shown in Detroit for the first
time next week</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
