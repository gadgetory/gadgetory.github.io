beer printer no it doesn't print beer
what it does it prints onto beer so
thankfully I've got a glass here I'm
gonna put it on the base on the top I've
got a selection of all kinds of items
that I want to print let's say it's beer
o'clock I so the base raises you can
hear it working little whirring sounds
like a full school printer and let's see
how it looks that's actually using a
malt based ink and they assured me at
beer ripples that it will not affect the
taste whatsoever let's see how it tastes
as long as there's a head on this this
printout will remain so unless I drink
this whole thing right now you're gonna
still see that so you can see it's kind
of decaying over time but then again its
own printed on liquid the machine itself
costs around 3,000 dollars obviously not
meant for the consumer market it's meant
to be more in bars hospitality areas I
bet you see this at conventions
everywhere and the idea is you can have
other messages printed onto these beers
just brew it and keep your trust
just drink it and they also have the
ability to flirt with other customers at
the bar if you wanted to but I don't
know how strong your game is so the
ripples printer works with a ripples app
any consumer can download the ripples
app it'll tell you where you can find a
location that has one the printers then
you can send your own picture if you
wanted to to that location you didn't
say hey that's my number there can you
give me number one boom you'll have a
beer with your face on it if you wanted
to if you're wondering how long will
this take will this add some horrible
time between you ordering the beer and
getting the beer that's not going to be
a problem this thing prints out very
quickly the only thing that changes the
time is how long it takes for this
platform to go up and down that's all
the printing itself takes about the same
time for any image the beer ripples
printer is going to be in locations in
the US and Canada again if you want to
find out what location has one you
better use the app you know I think I'm
gonna print out something
really really rich and I need a really
rich beer for that so I'm gonna put this
beer right in and I'm gonna select this
fellow now the moment there it is
Brian coolly I'm gonna drink it in man
sorry Brian
tastes like Roadshow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
