Apple watch I'm Bridget Carey and this
is your cnet update folks we need to
talk about the Apple watch I have some
news that may be hard to hear it may
even be hard to believe but Apple's
first SmartWatch is not going to be
perfect I know everyone's salivating
over the coming Apple watch in all its
gold trim glory but there's the
possibility it could be plagued with the
same problem of most smart watches and
that's battery life although Apple has
yet to reveal full battery life
information about the watch sources told
the news site 9to5 mac that the battery
life is falling short of apple's goal to
have it work for 19 hours of mixed
active and passive use but how much
shorter is unknown the report says it
may just last two and a half hours with
heavy a pues that's like if you can't
stop checking apps and four hours for
exercise tracking we won't know for sure
until we put it through battery tests
when it comes out in the spring and I'm
sure it won't be long before we start
getting battery pack cuff accessories no
seriously there are battery charger
wristbands right now on kickstarter in
other mobile news US carrier t-mobile is
stirring things up again this time it
involves your credit score when you see
a commercial for a discounted or free
smartphone whether it's t-mobile or
another carrier you can only get that
deal when you have a well qualifying
credit score it's all in that a TBD
print on those commercials well t-mobile
says more than half of Americans don't
have a credit score that's good enough
to get the deals and those folks have to
pay more upfront and overtime or go
prepaid but let's say you didn't have
good credit but you still signed up for
t-mobile well if you paid your bills on
time for a year you get upgraded and you
can qualify for all the best offers
without a credit check like a loyalty
Thank You of sorts t-mobile is the
fourth place carrier but with all these
recent wild promotions like data roll
over it's gaining customers and it's on
the path to passing Sprint t-mobile is
growing so fast that on Friday sprint
began targeting t-mobile Sprint has a
new promotion that promises to pay
t-mobile customers
two hundred dollars for a smartphone
trade-in plus up to three hundred fifty
dollars to cover switching costs in
other news car makers are paving the way
for more high-tech cars ford just opened
a research lab in Silicon Valley with a
focus on improving car internet
connections and self-driving vehicles
but before we get to those self-driving
cars other car makers are focusing on
getting us to buy electric vehicles BMW
and Volkswagen partnered with the
company ChargePoint to build out at
least 100 more charging stations along
the east and west coast which can get a
card to eighty percent power in less
than 30 minutes that your tech news
