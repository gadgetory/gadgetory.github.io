Facebook who announced a successful
launch of their new Aquila aircraft Mark
Zuckerberg shared a video on his
Facebook page this morning shortly after
9 a.m. Pacific time stating that after
two years of engineering I'm proud to
announce the successful first flight of
Aquila the solar-powered airplane we
designed to beam internet to remote
parts of the world the first flight took
place at dawn on June 28 2016 in Yuma
Arizona according to the video the plane
is designed to stay in the air for
months at a time beaming an internet
signal to some of the most remote places
in the world the aircraft has a wingspan
as long as a commercial airliner and can
fly on roughly the power of three blow
dryers the inaugural flight was to test
the aircraft's functions including
aerodynamics the batteries onboard
certain control systems and training the
crew for future flights Zuckerberg
shared his goals for Aquila in a blog
post which include launching a fleet of
Aquila's flying together at 60,000 feet
communicating with each other with
lasers and stating a lot for months at a
time something that's never been done
