speaker and while Google home has a
quickly growing list of features and
compatible services it still knows how
to have a good time here are some fun
Easter eggs to try with your Google home
speaker well they're pretty corny and
they're definitely not the funniest
around Google Home has quite a few jokes
to tell all you have to say is your wait
word and then say something like make me
laugh or tell me a joke okay here you go
did you hear about the new anti-gravity
book apparently you can't put it down
you can also play interactive
multiplayer games with Google home if
you want to play a trivia game show just
say ok Google are you feeling lucky nice
this is the part where the music starts
and I get to be a game show host welcome
to are you feeling lucky the game shows
that keeps you guessing Google home also
has the ability to sing a song or
beatbox just saying hey Google beatbox
ok put your hands together for MC sound
file sing happy birthday happy birthday
to you happy birthday to you Google home
is also pretty good about staying
up-to-date on pop culture you can say
things like Hodor or wobble of a dub dub
it also wants you science between a
great rivalry such as Star Wars and Star
Trek ok google' do you like Star Wars or
Star Trek the Millennium Falcon blown by
Captain jean-luc Picard and finally
there are a lot of random things that
Google home can do such as settling a
disagreement or making a decision for
you by flipping a coin or rolling a die
or you can have it tell you a totally
random fact by saying hey Google
surprise me this fact might surprise you
according to Wikipedia white beat
dolphins love to ride the waves of
high-speed boat jumping clear of ocean
surface to perform improv at a trip and
you can also have it play animal sounds
if you want to mess with your pets say
hey Google bark like a dog
this is a dog
in typical Google fashion there's a very
long list of Easter eggs for Google home
many of which most likely haven't even
been discovered yet
so they'll be afraid to ask the question
about your favorite show or just the
first thing that comes to your mind
