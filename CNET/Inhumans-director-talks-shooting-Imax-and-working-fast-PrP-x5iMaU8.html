coming
I heard all these horror stories are
working with marvels but I didn't feel
that way but for me it was very
collaborative you know these people are
very passionate about that product and
about characters and about doing the
best version of everything and I'm the
same way I'm so passionate about when
I'm filming on what I'm doing these
things but there was always like a
Marvel executive around me just to make
sure that whatever I did or whatever we
did together it would tie in with other
characters in other universes and other
comics in other series of movies because
they were very protective about that
everything works and it would not do
things double
shaky hands out stuff doesn't really
work for IMX so I kind of chose the way
to kind of move the cameras more forward
and backwards we build the sets with
more scope on top and higher biggest
ceiling so I could do low angles but
also you use the iMac scope what goes
higher up also the locations that I
picked for we based on how can I see and
how can I reveal the big scope of I mix
so that was really a blast I think they
really brought me in because their
lights the ideas I had what I would do
with the characters I think that we also
liked me for the job because I was able
with my action movies to shoot in a very
short of time or with very low budgets
scope action that looks like a
big-budget movie you always were looking
for fun you know I think that's also so
good about the Marvel franchise they
don't take itself seriously then luggage
or is one fun big beast and so but also
the other characters and even Carnac who
is kind of his abilities to see only the
negative side of things it's a very
comedic character because he sees all
the negative things of things the
scanner was super tight it was TV tight
and what is nerve-wracking so we have
seven Filofax companies working on 600
special effects shots for this first two
episode what was a massive amount of
number but also I had TV schedule time
to shoot it with IMAX cameras were there
is nerve-racking but I come from a
low-budget film world so 20 days for me
is a luxury</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
