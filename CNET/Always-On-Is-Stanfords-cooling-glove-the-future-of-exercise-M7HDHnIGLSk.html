marathon last summer I could have
actually doubled my performance capacity
all with the help of this funny-looking
love I recently visited Stanford where
researchers are developing tech that can
make exercise way more efficient no
steroids necessary
we have freshmen women doing over 900
push-ups in 45 minutes
what we've shown is we can get
equivalent increases in training
response in performance responses
without using steroids and the nice
thing about it is it leaves no residue
or extra nipples or whatever else it
works by letting cooled water flow into
a vacuum around the palm of your hand
then it helps draw that cooled blood
back into the rest of your body the
results a faster recovery and better
performance so what I'm feeling is
almost like a blood-pressure cuff a
little bit of constriction right so you
pull your hand out you can see your hand
is still warm right it's so fascinating
how this part is warm and this part is
cool yep
what we found is that the build-up of
heat is a major contributor to fatigue
onset and so if we can keep the
temperature from rising so fast people
can exercise for longer wait what in
God's name so of course in the name of
science
I had to put this cooling glove to the
test I didn't even know it was gonna
start off completely horrific or do I
have to do we're just going to stick
this thermocouple probe 2 feet up your
nose this is the most terrified ever
event and then I leaned my head back a
little nobody oh dear God
you find a little hole it goes down yeah
there you go that's going in your mouth
mm-hmm
and swallow
just keep following
like the taste of it yeah wonderful do
the best thing you were ever
Wow well that was awful okay it's all
uphill from here right better than just
about anybody I've ever seen do this on
your first pass just right through okay
well thank you that's good to know super
attractive to her but then it was time
to get me into the ultra ha exercise
chamber so I have a temperature probe
way deep down in my nose in the
esophagus I'm in a room that's about 101
degrees Fahrenheit and I'm gonna walk up
a 10% slope for 20 or 30 minutes and
just get all heat it up I'm sweaty
it's naughty there you go okay
so you've come up about how much did
agree now so your temperatures climbing
pretty quick now
what would this take your core
temperature up to about 38 and then put
the cooling device on one hand and see
if we can't change the trajectory of the
car cover drive okay it's time to cool
you down though so let's see what
happens here
so you feel anything
after about ten more minutes I was spent
I can't believe how hard that was like I
ran 13 miles two months ago and I
thought that might kill me so what we're
doing is just watching your temperature
drop here and the glove seemed to have
worked my core temperature went down and
more importantly my good mood came back
the glove has proven so effective that
Stanford is even using it to train their
own athletes and sometimes on the field
too what we'll do is when we're training
especially in the summer and the heat
we'll have it readily available and if
somebody is struggling they need a
little bit of recovery somebody might be
cramping a hydration issues anything
we'll put them on the unit is it kind of
in the meantime until it goes mainstream
is it kind of a little unfair advantage
it sounds like our little secret we've
presented to the pac-12 and there's a
lot of interest within other teams but
again they're still skeptical about it
so we like to keep it our little secret
I guess until it really goes mainstream
I can't believe how things I feel
actually I'm not ready for the football
team but my results were impressive and
then at this point we put on the cooling
device and you can see we have changed
the trajectory of your core temperature
rise right without the glove I would
have run out of steam at 15 minutes with
the glove I would have cocked out it
more like 30 minutes a doubling of my
performance and is that pretty
consistent across everybody who tries it
I mean do you find that yeah we always
see an improvement in performance a lot
of it has to do with what the fitness
level of the individuals are the
Stanford team says their research into
temperature control has all kinds of
medical potential from helping patients
with multiple sclerosis be more active
to getting obese people off the couch
for longer periods individuals with
multiple sclerosis you can actually give
them a degree of freedom be able to go
out and walk twice as far as they
normally be able to that to me is very
dramatic you know if you're talking
about exercise performance having guys
doing 600 pull-ups and a thousand
push-ups is pretty dramatic
for my part I'm probably not gonna get
to 600 pull-ups but I am ready to give
this love thing and try in the real
world as long as I never have to do that
nose tube thing again
watch someone Watkins what</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
