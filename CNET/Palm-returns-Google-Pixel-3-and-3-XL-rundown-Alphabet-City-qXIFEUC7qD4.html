show that covers everything related to
alphabetic alphabet just so happens to
own lots of companies including Google
I'm your guide Aya's Akhtar and you are
the spectacular audience today we're
talking about Google's problems with the
US government pixel stuff some intrigue
about Google Home Hub and your comments
but first let's talk about a new pawn
product really let's head on over to
Android Avenue palm is back sort of
there's a new palm device headed to
Verizon and it's meant to be a sidekick
to your current phone you cannot buy it
by itself instead it pairs up with your
existing phone number and requires its
own $10 per month plan look at this
little thing it's running Android Oreo
has access to the full Google Play Store
has a tiny 3.3 inch screen a 12
megapixel camera on the back with an 8
megapixel camera on the front now why
would anyone grab one of these palm
devices it's aimed to be used when
you're at the gym or just when you want
to sort of disconnect by the way the
palm name is being licensed by TCL to a
startup based in San Francisco if you
want the teeny tiny pond device it'll
cost you around three hundred and fifty
dollars do you think devices like this
will catch on or is it just gonna be
like a footnote in the history of cell
phones very curious to know what you
think in an interview with that
excellent tech site cnet.com Samsung CEO
DJ ko said that the company's future
folding phone will be usable as a tablet
once it's folded it can be a phone Co
all so explained that quote when we
deliver a foldable phone it has to be
really meaningful to our customer end
quote
Samsung's boss also said that the
foldable phone won't be a gimmick and
will be available worldwide
did we talk about the Samsung Galaxy 89
yet no well let's do it it's the world's
first phone with four rear cameras take
a look at it 128 gigabytes of storage
which can be expanded with a micro SD
card 6 or 8 gigabytes of RAM 6.3 inch
AMOLED screen fingerprint sensor it is a
mid-range phone so it gets a mid-range
processor let's run down those four
cameras H megapixel ultra wide camera 10
megapixel telephoto cam with
to X optical zoom 24 megapixel main
camera and a 5 megapixel depth sensor
now why would you put 4 cameras on the
back of the phone because 5 would be
ridiculous until it isn't next year time
to go to pixel part already if you watch
the pixel livestream you might have seen
this very show at the beginning
including our producer rich Peterson's
amazing leaky pixel artwork that was
neat that being said let's quickly run
down
well Google announced on pixel day
October 9th since we've had time to
digest everything that's happened we've
got the two new pixels and the leaks
were right
there's the pixel 2 XL mini and not
Zillah otherwise known as the pixel 3
and pixel 3 XL internally the two are
almost identical except for the battery
capacity both have the same features so
you get to choose whether you want a
bigger battery with the not screen or
not I try it out both and they were
zippy both have OLED screens made by a
manufacturer that Google would not tell
me about I will say that in my limited
time with the pixels they did not appear
to be any obvious screen issues like the
pixel to excel let's forget about the
hardware the software was the real star
of Google's presentation the new pixels
get some cool features first like call
screening dibs on new Plex and cool
camera features like top shot and night
site top shot essentially makes sure you
do not get a mistimed photo google says
you'll never need to use your flash
again with its night sight low-light
photo feature that's a bold claim a lot
of those features are heading to older
pixels - that should give people
incentive to pick up a pixel of knowing
that eventually it'll keep getting
improvements pricing info ahead pixel 3
starts at $7.99 for the 64 gigabyte
model $8.99 for the 128 899 we'll also
get you the 64 gigabyte model of the
three XL $9.99 get you the 128 I wish it
had more storage but them's the breaks
check out the full reviews at cnet.com
let us now talk about the Google home
hub it's like the Google home with the
screen here's the thing it's only 20
bucks more than the home without a
screen it's a smart display similar to
the Lenovo smart display and the JBL
link view those two devices
run a version of Android called Android
things meant for Internet of Things
devices
Ars Technica found out that Google Home
Hub does not run Android things instead
it is built on Google cast
Ars Technica asked why would Google do
this Google VP of Product Management
dear jolly said quote there's no
particular reason we just felt we could
bring the experience to bear with cast
and the experiences are the same we
would have easily given a third party's
cast if they wanted it but I think most
developers comfortable using Android
things end quote
yeah so that makes like no sense there's
something going on here with Google and
its hub something fishy 9:00 to 5:00
Google did some further digging and tied
the hub to Google's fuchsia operating
system fuchsia has been rumored to
replace Android in the future that does
not mean hub runs fuchsia but a version
of it might have at some point that's
intriguing there's also a new chromecast
and the pixel slate Chrome OS tablet the
slate is really well built its pricing
starts at around $600 and can blown up
all the way to $1,600 before you get any
accessories it runs Linux apps by the
way next up the garden of Google so
there was a security issue with Google
it turns out there was a flaw in Google
Plus that exposed the personal data of
up to half a million people between 2015
and March of 2018 Google did not
disclose the vulnerability when it fixed
the problem in March now why is that
according to a Wall Street Journal
report the reason Google did not tell
anyone about this issue was to prevent
scrutiny by lawmakers and to avoid harm
to its reputation Google said in a blog
post that it found no evidence that any
developer was aware of this bug or
abusing the API and found no evidence
that any profile data was misused Google
is planning to shut down Google Plus the
social network will head to the great
offline by the end of August 20 nineteen
thirty cent a letter to Google CEO
sundar Pichai that basically asks when
did you find out about this problem what
did you do to fix it why didn't you tell
anyone about it into way later
are there other incidents like this that
you're not telling us about and lastly
give us that internal memo that a
journal mentioned there's even more
government stuff Google CEO sundar
Pichai sent a letter to US senators
talking about dragonfly thus answer'd
search engine for China in the letter
pichai says we are approaching these
issues deliberately and whether we would
or could release a search service in
China remains unclear he went on to say
quote accordingly we are not in a
position to be able to answer detailed
questions end quote
Senator Mark Warner of Virginia was none
too happy with the letter senator Warner
said quote I was really disappointed
with Google's response to our letter
Google owes us some honest answers or in
risk losing the trust of Congress and
the public end quote
that is some heavy stuff time to go to
comet cove this is the part of the show
where we shine a spotlight at the most
amazing audience in the world
you guys 2012 big perm says of the
Google Home Hub no camera intentionally
for privacy concerns LMFAO you don't
believe that do you
it's cheaper period or just put a
shutter over the lens that's a good
point I'm sure Google brought the
privacy part to make the company look
good as for making a cheaper product I'm
sure that played a big factor too luke
says still sticking with my to excel but
I do hope some of these non Hardware
updates come down to last year's models
like top shot night sights and
adjustable depth of field thanks Luke
yeah older pixels will get plenty of
software updates I am curious how well
they will work on the older hardware
let's talk a little bit about that
slates at the keyboard accessory costs
around $200 the dire asks how is that
keyboard more expensive than the hub you
know what I asked the Google rep the
same question the response was something
like this well they're different
products that's all I got from them
thanks to everyone for writing in if
you've enjoyed your stay in Alphabet
City please like and subscribe also I
know we haven't cover stuff outside of
Google for a while we will handle that
in the next episode I Maya's actor and
I'll see you on
oh you're still here you want some more
news you're on YouTube TV is getting a
new feature a full DVR in the past if
you recorded a show using YouTube TV
after a while that recording would be
replaced with the video on-demand
version with on skippable ads now that
won't happen
oh also you know about that instant
translation feature in pixel buds it's
coming to other headphones that use
Google assistant including some from
Bose and Sony that's it for us</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
