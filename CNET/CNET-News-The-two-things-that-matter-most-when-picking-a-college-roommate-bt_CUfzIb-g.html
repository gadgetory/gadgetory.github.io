loved your rafts like it's like the
randomness things st. Mary's college
roommates
Samantha car Niro and Samantha Richards
joke that there's so much alike they're
almost twins it was like a big joke
because both of our names are Sam
obviously the pair was more than 80%
compatible according to star rez an
online tool that more than 400
institutions including Ohio State and
weiu and UC Berkeley used to match
roommates it organized on-campus housing
it works like an online dating site with
a proprietary matching algorithm fill
out a questionnaire find compatible
matches and then check out profiles
attributes might include whether they
smoke watch TV one when they're studying
do they like to cook schools can decide
which attributes to prioritize but Saint
Mary's with an undergraduate population
of only three thousand students has kept
the algorithms as broad as possible and
focus on lifestyle choices Lynne well
says star res has found that study and
sleeping habits are often the two most
important factors the combination of
those two things can really really say a
lot about how a student relationship is
gonna go but star ves is just the
starting point for future roommates
they're able to use Facebook or social
media outlets to connect with that
person and kind of get to know them on a
deeper level star rez says some
participating schools have reported
fewer rooms swap requests and roommate
conflicts st. Mary's says last year 7%
of first-year residents who were
dissatisfied with her housing
assignments requested a change st.
Mary's is hoping to see a decrease in
the second year of using star rez it's
working for freshman Cameron Wiggins and
Steven Hasbrouck they've requested to
live together again their sophomore year
it makes college a lot easier we're
actually a hundred percent compatible
one star says has a combated
compatibility meter and 100 percent
earning them an A and roommate matching
