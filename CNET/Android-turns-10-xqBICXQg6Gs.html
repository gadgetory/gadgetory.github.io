and today we have your first look at the
t-mobile g1 as most of you know the g1
is the first smartphone to run the
Google operating system and will be
available from t-mobile starting October
22nd so I didn't personally review this
phone Bonni cha did and I definitely
bugged her about it and until she let me
hold it I really wanted to see how the
design was you know we knew what the
design details were but holding it in
your hands and kind of playing with it
and taking a look at that stupid chin
that juts out I don't know it was part
of the fun bonding activity everybody
kind of crowded around how it's really
ugly
I remember the Open Handset Alliance
when they made that announcement in 2007
I think so you know it was right well
the iPhone is coming out I was there at
the original launch of the event in New
York it was out on the east side and
this event space the most notable thing
obviously Larry Page Sergey Brin coming
in halfway through the presentation on
rollerblades rollerblading up saying
that they had actually rolled blended
across town to get to the event the
thought my mind was how is this gonna
stack up to the iPhone was this gonna
Jub with the idea of the modern
smartphone that happened presented just
two years earlier and at some point I
remember we all crowded into a
conference room and somebody said what
if it's not a phone at all
what if it's Google's software that
lives on a phone and that wound up being
exactly what it was so here's our phone
here's our homepage I'm gonna pop this
open because this is really the money
right here the thing that I really liked
about it at the time was it wasn't an
iPhone it wasn't the thing that
everybody else had was a little you know
contrarian with my views if you say that
I remember the g1 being a little clunky
and bulky which is funny when looking at
it now it looks absolutely tiny at that
time physical keyboards you know they
were still pretty common you know we
haven't gone to this virtual only world
Apple came out with the iPhone only
virtual keyboard I know a lot of people
that it just couldn't get into that for
a long time and I tried typing on an
iPhone a bunch of times that screen
keyboard really messed me up so I loved
this larger physical keyboard with
buttons actual numbers you know a
spacebar the whole nine well I really
loved buttons at the time so this was a
big deal for me there is a physical
camera shutter button and on a phone
this size and on something like with
this sturdy hefty design it's actually
pretty stable one of things I really
liked about the operating system was it
was actually pretty easy to use I mean
all the apps are right there just like
an iPhone but you could slide down this
notification thing from the top and get
things for pop-ups for like your Wi-Fi
and when you had incoming email stuff
like that at the time that was pretty
revolutionary it all sides GPS what was
the first to have turn by turn
navigation which was fantastic since
most the GPS systems back vineya to pay
for and this is free I would have used
search I would have used maps Slacker
Radio definitely the Opera Mini browser
because the browser just had a lot of
you know extra features and I reviewed a
lot of browsers so I reviewed the
Dolphin Browser too that's on here
Android was really important because it
offered choice it offered a choice of
handsets so you know you could go all
these different types of handsets where
the keyboards what they didn't
whether they're big whether they small
it's because of Android
you've got smartphone makers you know
making $100 of smart phones not
necessarily thousand dollars smartphone
so really this Android brought the
mobile experience the full mobile
experience to the masses</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
