com and i'm going to show you how to use
scout by tilling navs html5 turn-by-turn
directions the interesting thing about
this is you don't even have to install
an app you just send the link to your
phone and your browser does everything
you need it to do so we're going to
start on their website on a laptop scalp
me and we're basically going to search
for a coffee shop in Oakland we've got a
couple of options here but I'm just
going to grab the first one in the list
because it's convenient and just take us
to the info page where we have address
phone number information there should be
some reviews here but there aren't and
in other information about the
restaurant you can also get static
turn-by-turn directions and a map that
looks kind of like Google Maps this is
one way to get directions from where you
are to where you want to be you can also
save this destination for later
retrieval and your favorites or share it
to any social network but what we're
going to do is we're going to navigate
we're going to click navigate click send
a phone and then enter an SMS phone
number now in the car we've got our
android phone in the cradle and we
basically open the message and click on
the link that came in that text click it
again and it should actually open up our
browser now we're using dolphin but this
should work in any html5 browser on
pretty much any smartphone click the big
yellow navigate button and it should
open the html5 map now this all happens
right in the browser there's nothing you
need to install they should show you
where you are where you're going and how
it plans to get you there then just
click the big yellow drive button to get
turn-by-turn directions now the accuracy
is going to depend on the accuracy your
smartphone supplies to its browser but I
found that after a couple of minutes it
was pretty spot-on in this case this is
a live updating map that should actually
follow you as you drive along the road
and it will give you spoken turn-by-turn
directions such as turn left on second
street the html5 version of scout is
pretty simple stuff but because there is
nothing to install it's a fairly simple
way to get turn-by-turn directions to
your less than tech-savvy print this has
been antuan goodwin wit cnet com</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
