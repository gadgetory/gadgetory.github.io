and we unravel the mystery of Alex from
Target I'm Bridget Carey and this is
your CNET update jawbone has revealed
two new fitness tracking wristbands
and the company is just barely making it
in time for the holiday shopping season
but these trackers could be hot
competition for Fitbit first there's the
up three it's the top of the line model
and it cost $180 it's an extra 50 bucks
than the current up24 model and with
that extra cost you get a new design and
the ability to track your heart rate 24
hours a day for a week straight on just
a single charge it also measures skin
temperature it's fully water resistant
so you can take it swimming or wear it
in the shower it's also able to measure
different activities like yoga tennis or
even Zumba and like before there's also
sleep tracking but it adds your
heartrate to the analysis of your
quality of sleep now if you don't want
to spend so much but you are interested
in health trackers there's a new
entry-level model called the up move
it's $50 now fitness devices are hot
this year but I also need to address a
social media crisis that's gripping our
nation the mystery of Alex from Target
the biggest viral meme on the internet
this week is Alex from Target a young
cashier with a good head of hair from
Texas two teen girls tweeted about him
on October 26th a few days later that
photo became a social media phenomenon
the photo was shared by other accounts
on Twitter and Tumblr a hashtag was born
and soon there were YouTube videos
making fun of the popularity of this
cashier Alex went from being an average
teen in Texas to having half a million
followers on Twitter and being invited
to go on The Ellen Show but there was
drama
late Tuesday when a marketing company
took credit for the mania claiming that
this became viral when the firm shared
the photo with a legion of its
influential teenagers on social media
the firm is called breaker and the CEO
wrote a post on LinkedIn saying that his
team helped fan the flames by
encouraging other popular teen girls to
talk about it Alec
and the original girls that posted the
first photo have nothing to do with the
marketing firm target also says it was
not behind the viral photo
it seems this all started as an innocent
girl crush and some marketing company
wanted to try and spread it faster as a
way to show off and win new clients but
did this marketing firm really create
the meme known as Alex from Target
that's hard to prove perhaps we all
created Alex from Target because we all
want to believe that magic of social
media that can turn anyone even a
cashier into a star that gets on
national TV so yes Virginia there is an
Alex from Target that your tech news
