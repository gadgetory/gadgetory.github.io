the cnet live hashtag for Google+ right
I got the Google+ window up here just
waiting for a hashtag question hashtag
question like a so obviously did
I tweeted a photo of all of the tablets
and stuff that I've brought in and it
led to like 15 tablet related questions
so if we run out and I don't think we
will I got some other ones ready to go
but hashtag to see the Twitter ones with
seen it live as well because then we'll
see them and then I don't know maybe we
could beat out liz and dick in the
trending their trendy new i know i don't
know but i had a google it last night I
finally was like what he'll the losing
good thing now I know a nigga lohan
movie right yeah yeah i'll letcha
googled it alright that's awesome yeah
oh you know obviously this holiday
season we know that some of the big
trends here gonna be 7-inch tablets
right I mean that's one of the hot
products we've seen streaming boxes
gaming is always hot and you know you
guys went through the top 10 list I
guess we can kind of we won't replicate
the show but kind of list off a few of
them maybe some that stuck out in your
guys's mind from the show but in your
opinion yeah well what're it doesn't
have to be the number one the number one
product but what are a few of them that
stick out in your mind from the top
cnet's top 10 list and we'll we'll talk
about the top 10 later but we want to
hear what you guys have to say first
yeah I mean not you know what one of the
things I really liked actually was
probably number 10 so I mean you know
toward the bottom of the list it starts
to get kind of obvious although I think
you'll be surprised that the iPhone 5 is
actually number five on the list
appropriate is strong the right
that's how strong go the list of
technology is in the end the phone
competition finally but for me because I
know that you guys are all geeks and you
kind of already have this or you know
it's all the obvious stuff sure isn't it
number 10 the 3m streaming projector
like it is coolest nerdiest little thing
and like Donald said in the show nobody
has this you know you don't even have to
worry that they already have this
because they don't have it right
yeah it's a it's a built-in and I think
we can throw to it or something about
yellow yeah we'll talk about a little
bit will throw to it built in Louis a
little tiny pico projector with a
built-in rechargeable battery built-in
speakers and the the real silver lining
on this thing is that it has a built-in
Roku streaming stick in the back so can
get streaming Roku right over the right
over Wi-Fi directly to the projector I
don't know what you're going to do with
it you know but you can take into any
room in your house I think if you have
kids it's a great way to you know watch
Dinosaur Train on the wall in the room
or something this case Louie CK I'm yeah
you can do that I feel like it's perfect
actually for um travel yeah and travel
with kids like if you you know you
already know you want that kind of uh I
could totally see you in some chalet in
tahoe like projecting the thing on the
wall lateral or if it again yeah i don't
know who's gonna use it but it is like
that's the one that they haven't thought
of yeah so for those you that are
wondering the 3m projector it's 299 i
think according to you know Arsene
reviewers who can play with this all day
long the drawback on is that it has one
and a half hours of battery life so
that's that's going to be a lighted
absolutely i mean you're gonna you know
if you have it set up in your home
you'll probably have it plugged in which
is fine but because it's so portable you
like the idea of being able to watch it
anywhere it's not it it's really you
know what the first of its kind really
and it's cutting it you know its cutting
edge but you know the battery life will
get better eventually maybe those add on
some huge battery backpack or something
right and the pico projector still
aren't very bright I mean you they don't
have a long throw starting at the room
pretty dark but I think it can be it's a
neat novelty if you wanted to just watch
something yeah like you said maybe like
a you know hotel room or something
I it sounded pervy when I said it you
guys just in my mind it was actually
pretty good i just said uh but i think i
think four kids do it is a fun way to
watch me b cartoons you know in their
room geek out and some good accessories
on the list i mean i think headphones
are kind of one of those perennial
favorites around the holiday season
they're just a there a good gift and if
you're not going to spring for the bose
quietcomfort to Luci Baines qc15 so the
qc15 there than you then you where it's
at that's true um that although let me
just be clear that's the gift I think
everyone should get because I bought
them and I want to live in them
traveling to the best however nobody's
gonna buy this so for 50 bucks we have
the audio technica ath m 30s on the list
and they're big over the ear cups like
studio style headphones that sound
really good and again are fifty dollars
and I think those are I mean now we're
kind of going down the list in order but
i do think that though that was a good
one too way to get started with just you
know things that people haven't thought
of or just a really good price on this
also like if your kid is asking for like
beats by dre $300 headphones wait anyone
i disappoint them but still get them a
quality ovaries my audio technica hates
my audio technica oh and they at least
like they look kind of hardcore even if
they don't have the style the super
super style they look tough at least
really tough anyway we add up each other
we have the whole list of 10 tickets you
know gets somewhat obvious after that
though we do have and i think this is a
lot of thing a lot of people ask like
what is the best TV we have a best
overall TV pick the panasonic TC what is
it tcp st50 yeah it's the st50 line
which is pretty much it's not their high
in line you have the UT 50 line that's
up at the top but the st 50 line is a
little step down but really what it
comes down to the image quality is
pretty much almost on par and also the
sweet spot is the pricing you're not
going to be dropping something like over
2,500 dollars for this TV and the st50
line image quality wise is going to
deliver pretty much for most of us when
you start talking about black levels you
get on the high end high tier TVs and
then just the step down you really don't
see that much of a difference in if you
put them side by side unless you're a
real video file that has to
the top line okay fine you could say no
way UT 50 blows the st 50 way but the st
50 is solid value and you're gonna be
happy with it either way and one thing
to know is that it's a it's a plasma
like our top pick is still a plasma that
the LCD still have not caught up in
terms of image quality and for the
things that most people do watch movies
have off angle viewing the plasmas are
still delivering the best performance
and this one I think is around twelve
hundred dollars and probably maybe on a
better sale here and there yeah and then
do 3d but it doesn't come with glasses
so it's not you know I mean it's not a
huge bells and whistles TV but it's a
really good value it looks really good I
think another thing when we're just
quickly talked about tvs and you've you
guys we see some Twitter questions I'm
sure you have some maybe some Google
questions but will jump to those in a
second but just quickly on the TV tip if
you guys a lot of people they don't
people still don't care obviously about
3d on their TVs people don't even care
if their TV is necessarily network
connected and the only reason I say that
is because now pretty much someone has
either an Xbox a ps3 a Roku maybe an
Apple TV and they're they're potentially
getting their video services from there
and although the connected TV with apps
is nice it's not really necessary for
everyone yet and Panasonic put out a TV
that is a plasma television set that
pretty much says you know what we're
gonna go different we're gonna strip
away all the internet features
completely it's there you 50 line okay
and no Donald did a top 5 of it about
top five TVs under thousand dollars it's
around eight hundred forty nine dollars
for a 55 inch TV that has none of the
internet features but the image quality
spot yeah are you gonna turn the call
the dumb TV it's like and all hail the
dumb TV because like you can buy the
smart stuff not to skip ahead you
completing smart if I your TV with like
a roku box or something like that and
get you know streaming options without
you know but to be able to save a lot of
money and get a really high quality TV
and just expect that you're going to
smarten up with with technology and like
external bax's throughout the next
couple years because the TV is going to
be something going to have around
presumably for like at least a window of
like five did it's a pretty slow refresh
rate yeah the technology that you're
going to want to have you know plugged
into your TV is going to change
more frequently not everything is going
to come up with an over-the-air update
this I so many over-the-air updates
these boxes can have before they can be
forced into buying the next thing do you
guys think 3d on TV is dead already no I
am back on the 3d trade wow that's
serious yes okay here's what happened my
brother got this sweet LG 3d TV and it
came with a month their passive glasses
it's not active shutter glasses which i
think is the key right they don't cost
hundred dollars you have to charge them
they're not having uncomfortable and I
watched Prometheus and Avengers on 3d on
that TV and I was just like oh my god
i'm in i'm in key to their own I mean I
I think it agree it looks cool but I
mean I buy all my blu-rays with 3d
because I have 3d TV and I have the
glasses and after a point in time I'm
just like I'm taking off these glasses
I'm just gonna watch him that's just me
that's me yes to me I totally SAT that I
mean it's me watch it over and over and
over I'm completely practical I
understand right cuz i said but it's but
i SAT there like upright you know in
front of the TV like nod off angle and I
laying down and I didn't even care she's
like yeah I want that experience now
which actually stop this cuz I need to
be convinced I suppose like I guess and
in the home if you can press pause and
whatever's going on and then provide
your own buzz however you feel like you
know legally you can do that 3d in the
home makes more sense than in the
theater but I'm not sold on tiny content
either so only it's because the 3d
content is getting better it's because
it was movies of the caliber of love
Prometheus and actually Avengers I
didn't see in 3d in the theater but in
on the on the DVD the 3d was really
really well done and I think that makes
a huge difference it's like never going
to be I'm never gonna sit there and put
on that and you know my brother and I've
kind of they have a new baby right so
they're never leaving the house that's
another big selling point for 3ds even
if you are never leaving the house but I
do you have children you are definitely
gonna sit at home and put these glasses
on and watch the TV but we're never
gonna do that first sports right I'm
never gonna switch over to 3d mode and
sit there it's it's more like
appointment viewing but that was the
first time I thought to myself you know
what I wasn't that is a nice feature to
have I think if they bundle it if they
bundle it
if the hobbit i'm in i think it's a nice
feature to have but i just i literally
maybe I got fatigued from it that's all
I literally have like you know 89 3d
blu-ray dvds and I popped in the Pixar
stuff looks hot but there's this a
certain point in time room like a
cabbage don't wanna wear glasses anymore
and especially with like some of these
movies the the quality of the image
quality of it is already good enough
where 3d can add a little to me it adds
a little not not enough but you know if
you if you dig it you dig it you're
having a press all right I don't well
but let me be clear I wouldn't shop for
a TV just for that feature it's not
enough of it because I'm totally with
you that it's a it's like a novelty it's
like sodastream like everybody got a
sodastream we were all excited like and
then the carbon monoxide thing ran out
and now it's just a really nice
paperweight and because I'm never gonna
order any one more cartridges of that
stuff that was a slight tangent but you
see where I'm going with that I'm not
gonna shop for a TV because of the 3d
however for the first time watching
those movies I I understood why you you
would want that especially if you were
really into owning movies at home and
buying them on disc which a lot of
people still are it was it's cool and
the 3ds gotten really good alright i'm
in a man now okay you guys Indian I've
been in but I'm out I've been in for
like a year and a half and I'm out so
texting my brother right now to find out
which TV it is because I'm a like I'm so
obsessed with this TV that I want to
recommend it to all of you I'm gonna buy
it all right look so good which that's
all we have because yeah I'm not getting
any questions here on seen a lot people
need to send their questions I have a
question a life you know what let's talk
about less let's talk about the big
debate that everyone's asking about and
we haven't covered yet is obviously we
talked about tablets but the whole ipad
mini vs nexus 7 debate I mean that's the
question that a lot of people here
asking on Twitter you guys brought in
the goodies body mint of that we've all
we've all used them at mini because we
broke the neck we've all used them and
had them and you know prizefight of them
and torture test them and tablet review
them and let's just go around you know
we can add on cuz we're gonna disagree
but your overall lets you know one
minute take on which one do you prefer
and why or who it might be for go Molly
Nexus 7 okay I'm done but but you know
okay I i do i'm gonna go
7 I think that the experience on I think
jellybean is finally baked it's a it's a
usable good easy fun operating system I
think it's still not probably as dead
simple as it needs to be but the Nexus 7
is so much better value than the ipad
mini and you know that an ipad mini with
retina display is coming in six months
to a year mm-hmm but i cannot in good
conscience tell anybody to spend that
money on that device right now i will
accept accept that challenge i accept
what she's saying but i would i would
take another another angle on it which
is that you you kind of rent the ipad
mini right cuz you can sell that thing
back i think i think this time that's
funny i mean when you go to resell that
because apple products hold their value
so well if you think about the the life
cycle of ipads and iphones you could
probably get a good return on investment
when you go to resell at the upgrade to
an ipad mini tuned next year whereas i
feel like the Nexus 7 as cool as it is
it's going to be like next year's kindle
fire where it's it well it will age out
there'll be something cool to replace
this an extra 7.5 yeah and I don't think
that people going to be x x 180 because
you can't sell it for as much I don't
think you're gonna be able to be solved
this thing for its ok kick it down to
somebody here they're willing to all
right I won't argue yeah well that's his
point yeah this is a lightning round
guys it's Kylie I mean I've I'm leaning
toward not even leaning I mean we did a
prize by with it in my mind hands down
its Nexus 7 but the only reason why I
say that is there's two ways to look at
it right if you live in the apple
ecosystem it makes sense to get an ipad
mini if you're willing to spend the
money now if i was someone who had no
tablet experience whatsoever and i was
said this cost X amount of dollars and
this cost X amount of dollars I would
push them towards the Nexus 7 and more
than the ecosystem and the ease of use
is what the ipad has going for it when
you talk about the features that you're
gonna actually use and function properly
when we're talking out maps I mean
that's something the maps actually works
the voice recognition actually works now
you may not use these all the time with
their features that actually work well
and work right you know you can navigate
the Nexus 7 it might have a slightly
bigger learning curve but like Molly
said is still simple enough and you know
we've gone back and forth I think
whoever's
to buy an ipad mini that wants one is
going to buy one no matter what that's
it that's just how I feel about that
kind of specific customer yeah or
someone who loves the ecosystem so much
that you're gonna stick with the iPad me
that's fine but for those you who think
that the Nexus 7 is not even a viable
option it's absolutely viable it it's on
equal footing if not higher in a lot of
regard so and I really think I mean
there been so many stories about people
who are saying that they're gonna spend
less this holiday season that they're
nervous about price like it's a price
conscious time and obviously Apple has
managed to transcend price consciousness
but they've done it by promising a
better product the iPad Mini is lovely
it's nice to hold actually this is
interesting though my parents were in
town um my dad and his wife are in town
and both of them told me independently
of the other that they felt like it was
hard to hold that they felt like the
size was so weird because there's not a
way there's not very much bezel on the
side and so they felt like there was no
good way to hold it without making
something happen on the screen or
putting a huge you know sort of thumb
print on it it's a little bit awkwardly
designed because it's wider than the
nexus 7 and I actually really like that
the thinner kind of 7 inch size I would
also say you know fall in love with it
but it's too much money for not enough
stuff if I'm getting the 7-inch tablet
is probably something that going to
handle my kid a lot and i would i would
rather hand them hadn't hand him the
199th our tablet and there he through
yeah but in you know everyone then
taught us about the other thing that we
didn't talk about is apps ABS absolutely
there are more apps on an iPad Mini then
a nexus 7 but it's a pen segen if you
have kids you're probably and you
already have iPads you're probably gonna
get an ipad mini honestly yeah i mean if
you're already in the ecosystem you
probably are i think that you know we
are definitely talking to those of you
who are willing to branch out who are
interested in shopping for a different
kind of tablet but i would tell my
parents that 100 99 bucks they could
have a perfectly good and i would
recommend the nexus 7 probably over the
kindle fire HD 7-inch yep because for me
like that the Nexus 7 is is the the best
value to be had for 200 bucks or 230 I
think the neck that 32 gig was on sale
today yeah 230 dollars um you get the
entire Android ecosystem which is as
many apps as the iphone it may not be
all the same one or iOS brother may not
be all the same apps but it's the same
number of apps you have all the power
you have the kindle stuff on there and
it's pretty tahsil yeah except i don't
mean like usable in the throwaway way
you need drop one once and it just
exploded to a couple different pictures
been yeah so you you want to be a little
careful when I was disappointed in the
durability I mean that is how you get
but that was the first generation maybe
it's better maybe they use a little more
reinforced plastic maybe you should when
you give it to your kids make sure
they're on the carpet yeah from even for
me like i'm looking to get install a
7-inch tablet in my car my console and
then I mean when i'm looking at ipad
mini vs nexus 7 i'm going to Nexus 7 for
that functionality for that use with
that use case just wait for the second
one really I mean I know you want an
ipad mini I know you do because it's
small and it's light and it's a really
nice size and or whatever too gracious
wait like this is the processor of an
ipad 2 with a screen that if you already
have like an iphone you're just going to
look at the single what the hell is
going on with that screen just wait when
the retina one comes out for the exact
same price and you know it will I'll be
okay if you want to buy that one this
one to me just feels like a little bit
of a money grab right now okay guys so
we talked about uh iPads yeah let's take
a quick little breather we have a cool
video um from Donald the man and he
today is cyber monday guess what cyber
monday is not even over yet you guys can
still find some great deals so he has a
few tips and tricks to show you how to
get the best out of it and then we'll be
back and a continued tweet us with
hashtag Cena live call us at one eight
eight eight nine hundred cnet and we'll
be back in a few minutes all right hey
I'm Donald Bell this is a crash course
in finding the best shopping deals
online for cyber monday these tools you
can say some serious money maybe you can
score some free shipping now the best
deals out there requires some patience
here a lot of talk about black friday
and cyber monday but the truth is
there's deals to be had year round if
you know what to look for and that's
really the first step know what you're
looking for there are plenty of sites
out there the Opera bargains on things
you never knew you needed scratch your
like this one if there's a good chance
you'll end up blowing your budget on
juicers and snuggies to name some
products you
if it's something generic like a new TV
or a new video game having a list will
help you stay focused next do some
research looking for a new TV or a
tablet or a camera but you don't know
where to start use a site like cnet to
check reviews and roundups try to become
an instant expert on the product
category that you're shopping for once
you've done your homework it's time to
get specific and zero in on the products
that you'd be happy with let's say that
I'm in love with this cannon sx260 point
and shoot it's got great reviews from
the critics and users but it's a little
pricey at three hundred forty nine
dollars retail so the next thing I'll do
is get a basic idea of what the street
price is sites like google com /
shopping or pricegrabber well let me
plug in the product name and show me all
the different prices from around the web
but to take things to the next level you
can install a browser extension that
will show you price comparisons for
anything you're shopping for on the web
two great options for this are invisible
hand and price blink I've got price
blink installed here on my computer and
it picked up an ebay buy it now offer on
that camera for 222 dollars plus free
shipping assuming it's new and the
sellers legit that sounds like a great
deal but what if you want an amazing
deal well if you've got more time than
money you can set up a price alert on
any product that will automatically
email you when the price drops below a
set amount sites like dealnews price
Pink's or decide will do exactly that
once you've tracked on a price you're
happy with there's a good chance you can
still nickel and iron that price down a
little bit more there's a place to enter
a coupon code go to a site like current
codes ebates or retail me not to see if
there's a valid code that you can use
another way to save some money is to
tracked on a site that will offer you
the best price with free shipping amazon
in particular offers free two-day
shipping on many items if you enroll in
there amazon prime program but it costs
seventy nine dollars a year unless you
know a few tricks there's a free one
month trial that can get from amazon.com
/ Prime but if you're a parent Ana's
on.com slash mom will give you a three
month trial and if you're a college
student amazon.com / student will give
you a one-year trial but the best way to
get on prime is to find someone in your
family who is already paying for it
amazon allows up to four family members
to share
one prime membership of course they bury
this feature under the account settings
but it's there if you look hard enough
finally counter to what I said at the
beginning of this video if it's the
holidays and the pressure is on and
you're stumped for ideas try a daily
deal site these are clearing houses for
random stuff but the deals are legit and
it can be great when you're at a loss
for what to buy someone so it's like
woot cyber monday got a deal slickdeals
and fat wallet they're all worth a shot

little I this is a snuggie liss home
that I live in fix that what type of
cold world is do you live now I know
yourself I don't want to live a little
but the the advice that I gave you right
there in that video about getting on
amazon prime account getting was it for
members on one account find your old
your uh your long-lost grandpa uncle or
something yeah within four families
absolutely also though you might run in
an awkward situation where someone you
added on amazon prime you're no longer
seen so you have to take them off that
can feel good that i can you take it
happens guys get over the break-up hi
happens guys sucks for her family I on
time uh yeah sucks / because you know
you actually allocate how they're
related to you so you can choose like
sister parrot significant other did it
it it a haha interesting little trivia
today so far just since it's cyber
monday IBM's digital analytics benchmark
showing a 25 point six percent jump in
online sales day from the same time last
year and iphone mobile shopping is
driving most of that sales increase in
fact the iphone is driving more retail
shopping than any other device there you
go 8.3 percent as for that report it was
helpful I've got a question here from
google plus actually is I've seen it
twice now for two different people wanna
know about the Chromebook is a
Chromebook a worthy gift to give a
receive I suppose the gift must leave uh
samsung chromebook new generation is it
is the Chromebook finally become a
giftable item you better explain exactly
what it does before you give it to
someone cuz they're gonna be like no it
one goes on the internet that's all it
does super easy goes on the internet
actually i have i well okay the one
person I know is thinking of giving
Chromebooks as a gift does work for you
of course they do all right all right in
case you aren't familiar with the
Chromebook i'm sure you are because
you're watching this stream right now
but just in case that's the google OS
operating system it's a google OS laptop
so it it just runs an OS that is
essentially a browser and I actually do
think that the Chromebook is a really
good gift idea for that person in your
life who only gets online for four oddly
enough for parents or somebody like
anybody who you would give a tablet but
the problem is then why wouldn't you
give them a tablet exactly the
Chromebook cost way more than a tablet
way more but more yeah yeah i think the
Chromebook is isn't as a good gift if
you maybe for a student or for you know
a parent but it's not doesn't scream fun
you know what are you talking about
least in the sense that tablets being
less expensive and also being more
optimized for games and kind of just
mobile entertainment 100 cells fun I
think you need a better battery life of
a tab with annual yeah yo yo you will
you will you will I'm just messing with
you I wouldn't want to Chrome if someone
gave me a Chromebook for Christmas I'd
say thanks and that re-gift it oh I'm
keeping it real no I know even the coil
I would do even though even the
Chromebook that we say is the one that
we've been waiting for as in like oh
it's finally here it's good and it's you
know it's lightweight its thin it's
inexpensive it starts at two hundred
fifty dollars which is cheaper than a
tablet starts it's a good extra computer
for people who are who
in the cloud already who have all those
google services I mean there are
definitely people who can really benefit
from a Chromebook it's just sort of hard
to understand why it's where is it where
does it fit now where does it fit
especially if you're okay with it fits
for someone who really needs to have a
keyboard right like they would love to
have a tablet but that touchscreen
keyboard thing is just super annoying
yeah I'll buy them a case with a
keyboard for like 50 bucks it's a tough
one and it feels cheap they feel cheap
that's our biggest complaint is like
it's two hundred fifty dollars and you
can tell well yeah you know here's the
nexus 10 399 doesn't feel that cheap
although one of our reviews that it did
yeah it's pretty it's pretty sorry
though I mean it may feel platt haven't
we're dreaming about the finish on the
back of it yea the fez a rubbery the
rubbery yeah you're Erik loves it man
but it feels like a weird yeah like uh I
was me taking the sticker off by the way
we got it stick the leather and some
like you know the unwrapping oh my god
we unboxed it a little tiny bit just now
so you got another another Google
question a lot of people asking about
video game stuff people asking about the
ps3 vs xbox which is going to be a
better purchase which one we go with
well it depends on what you want to do
it always it always cut right doesn't
always come down to that there's never a
clear answer but they to put it in the
you know three bullet points if you want
better online gaming
and you want a better motion gaming
experience with the Kinect get an xbox
if you want free online gaming that's
not as good but you want a blu-ray
player and arguably some overall better
exclusive games that are on the ps3 get
a ps3 that's I mean they're both great
machines you're gonna all the third
party tiles are gonna be on both but uh
that when i when my buddy says I want to
play online games the most then you want
to get an xbox even though you have to
pay for the service it's just better
than sony's a free online service from a
stability standpoint from the way that
you connect with people it's just a lot
cleaner better but if you don't care
about online gaming get the ps3 you get
a blu-ray player a player I really want
the best rated blu-ray players even to
this day because it's completely
firmware updateable uh it's it there are
no made there have never been any
glaring issues with it it's a top top
notch blu-ray player actually into space
not the question which is my dad wants a
3d blu-ray player which one's the best
the pissed is he yeah I mean yeah well I
think there's two answers either the ps3
or the cheapest one that you can find
because really I mean n you know not
like a $29 off Brad the cheapest
name-brand blu-ray player that you can
find between now and next week is
probably the best one to get if it's not
going to be a ps3 because they're all
pretty good now I mean there's some sort
of different years because it's probably
it's probably passing through the same
3d signal digital signal to your
television when your television to do
the decoding right like there's probably
I can't imagine as much of a difference
in 3d blu-ray and technology at the
player level correct correct to the
coating for the TV's probably be
different from her yeah the way the way
the TV displays it that's depending on
you know how much contrast ratio it has
you know some some of that technology
the anti-glare blah blah blah mom that's
good that's gonna do you know showcase
that the best but the signal you're
right is gonna be the same to be fair
are our highest to be give you a more
specific answer are our top rated
blu-ray player still is the sony
playstation 3 super slim but that's two
hundred and sixty bucks so if you are
looking at something that's a little bit
cheaper the sony bdp s 590 is has built
in 3d and then actually the LG BP 620
does
3d the best if that's really what you're
looking for both of those have built-in
Wi-Fi although the LG doesn't have an
amazon instant or some of the video
server some of the video services so if
you really want it all in one box sony
the BB ps5 90s probably way to go i
would say though I just personally
that's how I want to spend my retirement
is just getting addicted to games you
know I just wanna be plugged into
because I've been putting it off right
now I'm trying to like not get involved
in game addiction but i think my
retirement years that's gonna be the
perfect time to really go call of duty i
can tell you that he or whatever it is
gonna do that ecology sometimes i wish i
was where you are because it's like sad
when it's 1230 and you should probably
go to sleep but you're itching to finish
that game yeah like Assassin's Creed 3
right now man and you go and you play
that game til 230 right and then you
realize what did I just do and you come
into work around ten o'clock and then
and then you need to get scolded by then
you take a little nap ski in your office
there are there actually power naps that
are very effective studies of Priya a 15
minute power nap is a good recharger
which I do often here's a here's one
that's near and dear to my heart a
question from google plus Alton writes
in and says guys retina 13 or 15 for
portable use for a photographer or
should I wait for an air update instead
I know several photographers who were
super bummed that the macbook pro update
was not a 17 inch that's actually what
as a pro photographer you probably want
so then but then if you want something
portable 13-inch I would I mean add a
photographer friend who went for the the
most recent version of the ipad the ipad
4th generation just to show it off
because like for showing off like
wedding photos to like a client yep
that's kind of a better way to go
because they can see if they can kind of
run through the slideshow physically and
it it's kind of a better presentation
device but if you're actually doing
editing you know you're really using it
for the software yeah that's not i think
the other thing to consider is if this
person who's writing us in is actually
asking about not only for displaying
pictures but actually using it the big
difference between the 13-inch macbook
pro retina and the 15-inch is that the
15-inch has the discrete graphics card
that'll allow you if you're using
high-end media apps to be able to take
advantage of that
have more juice and horsepower behind
that to aid you where the 13 doesn't
yeah now there's a big cost difference
between a 13 and a 15 retina but if
you're looking at for not only
displaying your pictures on a Retina
display but also using the machine to
its best capabilities in your multimedia
person I would depending on how much
cheddar you got on that Bank I would
push towards the 15 a little bit for
those reasons I would absolutely
recommend the 15 over the 13 because i
don't think the 13 is I think the 13 for
one thing is way too much money for what
you're getting way too much money like
it's basically a six-hundred-dollar
premium over a standard macbook pro just
for the screen and that to me is not a
good value especially because like you
said it doesn't have the horsepower to
be a truly professional grade processing
machine machine I think that if you're
looking for a portable donalds
absolutely right the ipad is the best
way to show off your portfolio and then
invest in a really good editing machine
at home that doesn't have to travel with
you Donald bells writes all I heard I
didn't say that I think mom I to you if
you really do but if you do intend to be
affordable I think its tongue is right
you got it you got to spend the extra
money for the 15 because if you if it's
your craft it's a better machine for the
record she said tongue was right she
just said Donald mission oh right I did
now you're both right I like you both
equally you're both adorable you're both
super cute and the 13-inch macbook pro
with retina is a ripoff it's the I mean
if I was actually it was it was one of
those things they didn't mention in the
keynote when they revealed it that it
didn't have the same graphics processing
power and they're trying to push the
retina as their new Pro high on machine
but this 13-inch really isn't
necessarily a pro high on machine so
nope it's a ripoff is what it is okay um
Tech Talk 3494 twitter asks us what's
your favorite bluetooth speaker favorite
bluetooth speaker come on jambox the
jayhawks is nice and small don't want a
box oh yeah it's actually not I do I'd
actually the logitech boombox the less
expensive one bigger I think you better
audio performance uh yeah I really like
that I like to both I like to even
before when I have the dock connection
then I went bluetooth logitech boombox
that's it
what a you know one of the up-and-comers
that some people know about some people
don't we've talked about this sonus has
their bluetooth speakers now they're not
completely wireless because you have to
for at least the main unit you have to
physically plug it in but on what do you
think about sonos is the sonos three
line do we have it your ex got the song
I got it right here Oh though what a
look at that that it that is on our list
that's on our top 10 list yeah then one
of the cool things about this speaker
setup is that using an iPhone or an
Android phone it enables you to get
access to rate audio radio streaming
services like Pandora that you can
control directly through your phone so
not only is it a Bluetooth speaker
connection with your phone's library but
also these other third-party apps that
really give it a lot of extra power and
you know capabilities and functionality
and it's obviously pricier than well I
don't know even if it's pricier than the
jambox actually the boombox the logitech
boombox you mentions about a hundred
bucks this is the sonos is 300 but like
brian says you can get a lot more
functionality out of it and it looks
pretty the sonos is they've always they
don't have a single product that sounds
bad like they out there they really
maintain the sound quality throughout
the entire line now technically I don't
know if they work over Bluetooth at all
like I think the entire system is is
like a Wi-Fi like a mesh network Wi-Fi
thing there's an ecosystem is there
speak the speaker and talk to speaker to
speaker right right yeah that that one's
Wi-Fi it's really is the whole the whole
thing is like if you want to just take
yourself out of the proprietary like
each of the Apple you know airplay chase
which is probably going to keep changing
even though you got airplane now it's
still expensive and you never know what
they're going to do down the road
there's gonna be here play to worse give
up on airplane go back to bluetooth that
something that's like this is one way to
just like take yourself out of that and
just know that it's going to work over
Wi-Fi with whatever kind of phone that
you have your spouse may have it all is
going to work with this system and it
sounds great yeah and what Donald was
referencing when he talked about the
mesh network if you're not familiar with
what sonos does is you can have multiple
speakers in your home that are connected
via Wi-Fi and then through your phone
say play this on my bedroom speaker but
I don't want it on this living room size
you
move around your house you're able to
direct which speaker in that room with
the right appropriate label plays from
your phone so that's pretty cool and
there's some advanced stuff you can do
to like if you had if you had two of
these you can set them up as like a
stereo pairs right if you have multi you
can you can and from the app you can say
you know I want you know this playing in
the upstairs bedroom and I want his
playing downstairs in the kitchen yeah
you did wanta I'm on these idea to like
a stereo pair I want these so uh Hugh
caught all kinds of different products
well he's turning red guises she's mad
she should matching her little purple
because in my mind I made the worst but
yeah they're the stuff you can do with
these speakers that you can't do with
airplay at least not yet or Bluetooth
and they always sound you know the thing
you're talking about a airplay to point
o or whatever it ends up being you know
Google's working on their own open
standard for to kind of because Apple
has this whole airplay thing locked down
right there trying to do within their
own ecosystem but Google's trying to
build you know their own Center that's
open there's there's one that already
exists is like DeAndre yeah the deal it
DLNA but they have another one that
they're integrating into jelly bean
which allows you to throw to any TV
that's gonna be able to have this so
they're trying to work on their own
standard you know we'll see who wins I
don't want anybody to have their own
damn standard I just want either
Bluetooth or Wi-Fi to win like why is
this so why is this so hard why does
wireless streaming have to be a standard
and I almost one day like you almost
want to back away from Bluetooth even
because Bluetooth gets so complicated
and even that is something that should
be way easier it is and so I think the
fact that sonus is Wi-Fi has a lot that
suggests sore read that that is a big
check in the plus column for so knows
but i still i heart i don't care i love
the jawbone jambox i think it's totally
pretty little one is 130 dollars it's
super portable like you can take it you
can travel I mean it depends on what you
want the speaker for i'll also say on my
list of best in the section on seeing
this list of best gift ideas under fifty
dollars which is on the scene at Holiday
Gift Guide uh that you can buy bluetooth
adapters for your stereo your existing
stereo or maybe even like your old
iphone dock that no longer works with
your iphone 5 lightning connection you
want to do something with it
thirty dollars you can buy the little
bluetooth adapter it looks like a little
miniature you know Apple TV and you can
just have it hanging out in the back of
your stereo and then you can use as a
wireless Bluetooth speaker with whatever
you already got well you know what I
like I like where you're going with this
because we have the a few lists here
that you know we're probably winding
down a little bit that we want to talk
about just because we're always timeout
big-ticket 300-plus dollar items but
what about some of those other cool
things that are under fifty dollars
under $100 somewhere around there
because that's I mean that's that's good
enough for a lot of people if you like
someone a little bit but not three
hundred dollars get on one of these all
right I think almost nobody likes
anybody three hundred dollars this year
so so hack it I love that idea so I will
just take kind of take a look at this M
if we have once you're able to pull up
the under 50 under fifty dollars list
and one of the ones that Donald just
mention the first one on the top list
the belkin bluetooth music receiver yeah
like you said little mini apple TV
looking guy yeah Logitech's got 12
they're not telling me to not pay me to
say that but you can find a couple
different versions of that same kind of
they also have next I should get on the
grift and I could get skinny you should
ipod shuffles next one on the list we
all know about that yay sansa clip sit
sit the senses better way to let their
still kid there's still kicking best my
that's my burn after reading mp3 player
right there like you can get it for
audio recording is on that too I yeah I
mean it's the onion is the UH Nile you
can get a lot of features on there
seriously it may not be the sexiest
thing I think it's kind of cool but
getting a universal remote we have the
logitech harmony 300 under 50 bucks yeah
the fact that that's now under 50 bucks
i think is key because it's a eight this
is the only one that's even remotely
easy to use and i'm not gonna say it's
easy yeah yeah yes i have still although
they tout it as being super simple with
the web setup i have definitely seen
people cursing on Christmas morning and
there's a version of that like another
fifty dollars it has a little built-in
LED screen yeah so yeah yeah this model
starts at thirty dollars it only
controls for devices which is plenty for
most people a TV cable box xbox and then
like a streaming box of some sort you're
pretty much good yeah or a DVD player so
you guys kind of take a look at
those under fifty dollars gifts um let's
go check out should we check out like
little under one hundred dollars yeah it
was under 100 let's assume you're gonna
spend just a teeny bit more because
maybe this is someone that you didn't
get into a beef with or something like
that maybe you guys are actually cool
for the whole year I just I like the I
like the dramatic back stories that come
along with all the times my decisions
well one girl that I broke up with that
caveat i was on primary water she's
getting out under 50 but like my mom
I've never met her so like we're still
friends right where we we left on civil
you know on civil terms maybe I'll kick
her like a thirty-dollar logic logitech
harmony Ramon this is awesome use it
somehow get out of here alright so under
a hundred dollars this is now this is
definitely mom territory right yeah yeah
talk cuz I see let's be real like unless
you're awesome and you by your parents a
huge TV I don't know who would do that
some people will I'm sure my mom would
like a neat would use an e-reader a lot
more and enjoy the flexibility of it so
come on guy don't know if my mom would
use if she'd feel fancy though she like
I haven't even eater you need to get
your mom fancy that's all right I do
think if you have not gotten your
parents an e-reader yet it's the easiest
yeah its best possible gift in the world
like go get we done and done I know Lee
boom kindle 2012 69 bucks now this is
not the one with the paperwhite
technology on it this is just a standard
ereader still I would say that the
paperweight came up on our list of the
top 10 sure because that is a really
good gift if you've heard a category
that's been kind of like an for a while
that the whole backlit screen thing is
the only reason I think that's a big
selling point for people and that's not
that much more hundred nineteen dollars
not a bad price the only reason I'm
against the paperwhite is because I had
a glow light that I love and then the
paperwhite punk'd it the paperwhite you
know the contrast is good is better the
clarity of the text is better and I'm
sorry I just hate that don't you hate it
when you get one of those I don't you
hate it when you get one upped I don't
understand her okay well c'mon soon I am
I am but I'm just saying like you know i
love my glow light barnes and noble
holla at me you know showing his stuff
but the glow light on the glow light was
the first on the barnes and noble a
simple touch
and I was like oh my gosh this is
amazing and at the time I remember
Amazon CEO said we dropped the ball we
were behind on that and then they
started pushing are they they figured
out the whole paper I and then I saw a
paper on I'm like animals you're
basically mad because it's so good it is
it's really good so you know take that
in into account as you hear how many bad
about it I'm saying it's a great really
know it's a great product but you know
120 bucks is almost double what you can
get what you pay for the entry level
which is now $69 I mean that is a
freaking remarkable price and i gotta
say there are still the parents out
there who don't have my dad just i gave
him one last year just last year and he
was he still talks about how awesome it
is like the thing you know that Kendall
yeah me and if you just trying to date
someone that that's a good gift too it's
not too aggressive unless you preloaded
with other category of gift we don't
have to have that category on the scene
a holiday gift guide tonight can I great
BTW zzz holiday gift guide lady right
here please i recive gets to buy your
potential new girlfriend alyssa i like
you but I don't love you I like you but
I don't love you ding communities not
that much pretty neutral Apple to this
is a big commitment here apple TV ninety
nine dollars and the reason why is if
you're buying an apple TV you're telling
someone that I want to spend time with
you on a couch that's a big commitment
guys yeah so I will TV you might want to
be careful what you do with all right
just do the whole restless though stay
with Roku I assume Roku has the same
caveats same caveats I mean you know the
thing about the Roku's like pretty much
if you're already in an Apple ecosystem
and you're like I'm gonna get your Roku
think you're kind of like being chief
but if you're not in the educational
ecosystem you're saying let's snuggle on
the couch watch movies together but Roku
awesome videos more video services than
the apple TV could even know spit out
barnes &amp;amp; noble nook simple touch i think
says i don't want to be your tech
support take it to the store the good
one for mom then yeah like i like the
interface though on the simple touch the
most their physical and touch is awesome
it is really really good true but I'm
invested in a lot of kibble all right
Molly if someone gave you the logitech
wireless solar keyboard k760 that says
we're not dating that says like you know
I like you in
really practical way but I don't like
you like that it could be is a good dad
gift though cuz that's kind of neat

so that you can you know it's super cool
but it's definitely for family or
friends there's no this is not you will
not get any by giving anyway this is not
the gift that will give back if you know
what I'm saying oh sorry ah highly
inappropriate on the other hand the
logitech ue mobile boombox the one that

bubble bath while i scrub your back okay

some bubble bath using down with that
mm-hmm nothing says I love you more than

gift to get working ok my brother uh mr.
Beecham i actually have an update
because while we were doing the show i
asked our editor extraordinaire matthew
miskovic directly what was his pick for
the best stand-alone blu-ray player
because you know we should get sometimes
you can't get access to experts um Steve
and I put it right under our top 10 list
you can go to that link and according to
mr. Matthew miskovic as of April twelfth
editor's choice he calls it the
panasonic DMP BDT 220 really this is
right now pricing wise around one
hundred dollars he said I could find you
said I'm a note real quick and tell him
to update the best blu-ray player the
good built-in Wi-Fi 3d compatible issue
it's right there you know why I didn't
oh and 3d compatibility I didn't see
that about the 3d compatible get
admission we're just throwing something
on the list though it's he already
updated the list

in trouble no you're not you you almost
did but you he's fine I saved it the
viera connect all their other streaming
media services Netflix Hulu Amazon

or a human the TV by the way my
brother's TV that I was going on and on
about that has me like sitting on his
couch all the time is the LG LM six
seven hundred LG LM 6700 all right that
TV is so good-looking that it makes me
hate my TV which is a really nice TV but

Miss Molly wits probably amazing TV 8999

about it what would be a gift that you
would love to receive for this holiday
season that's a 10 gift by the way we
don't mean I've always on TV and then to
it I know by the way my brother's TV has
a terrible review by the way it's only
like uh huh it's like the worst 3d on
the market what you buy for an enemy
with ghosting effect so blah blah that
is the private good see that's what but
here's the thing right okay think about
what you said most people mhm and it's
not even that you're blind cuz you're
not know but that's you can't really I
mean you can't tell those eslam p is the
one that's in your time like once you
get it out of the store away from all
the other TV yeah then it's gonna look
fantastic definitely okay where's the
best Tekkit it could be any oh say how
about this under 500 bucks don't send
these to us by the way no no no honestly
I'm trying to get some out of this okay
for an hour you didn't even call us
today
I know hemel they're all busy shop I was
looking to make a new friend it did I I
know what I want ok be chimer you've
been thinking about this yeah I've been
thinking about it ok i wanna i would
like to hear your gift ok i would be a
gift that keeps on giving for you this
holiday season mr. Beecham I've been I
want a big-ass TV that 13 DTI let me to
the 3d thing so I mean that would be
something cool under under five hundred
dollars what wait wait a bigger be like
wet under 40 inches or so for three TV
under 40 inches under 500 bucks that's
not possible not possible ok I mean that
that's a fantasy it doesn't need to be
3d just ok good size well you know um
700 might get you there I'm gonna say if
you want a good size most people will
say like if they get a 45-42 they wish
they got a 55 I'm just saying for the
long run I really feel like it I'm not
even being like snobby guy here but I
think really a 50 55 is like for the
long run because you're gonna have this
TV 5 to 10 years ideally right yeah i
think i've had my current one is like 32
or some man you have a seen the world
yet the skills gentleness ya know i'd
recently just went even only 246 smells
like you I don't want to talk about the
size time yeah I got cuz people just
think I mature I thought you good huh I
thought it was a refrigerator I mean
your refrigerator God delivers the
Stevie was delivered during an episode
of bol he couldn't because he was he
skyped in but he didn't want anyone to
know that he was getting like a huge as
ourselves like I'm waiting for delivery
of my refrigerator and I remember
watching it when sky police unlike
scamper to the Dory like skip to the
door when the guy came oh cuz it was
still rolling yeah yeah yeah and then he
was like nobody like nobody like it's a
fridge it was a huge one and he still
hasn't shared with us exactly how big
that whether we don't even know this big
secret no sony made refrigerator
panasonic that's an amazing plasma
rumerator no but I mean seriously though
i would say 50 to 55 i think the long
run no you like with probably like seven
eight hundred dollars you could find
well if you want a 3d one honestly is
probably gonna be more like a thousand
twelve hundred but if you don't care
about 3d i'm trying to convince you to
not get about 3 D CIR see all he had me
sold molly was going
off about the Avengers amazing fun 3ds
fun but it's not for everyone so uh oh

making our number one gift pick this
holiday the Nexus step yeah it's kind of
anticlimactic when the screens i am the
screens it could be any of good oh is it
one wait this one wait is it this one
which tablet mean I was what goblet was
that I don't even raining tablets this
year have no idea what you're doing is
the amazing one okay my gift for this
holiday season that I really want I want
a nexus 7 32 gig with cellular
connection so I can throw it into my car
looking to get it customized into the
dash and Google should just jump on
doing like their own like like connected
GPS they shouldn't apps like just if you
could buy google maps for your car
that's what that's what I wanna should
just make a really sweet velcro mouth
for the nexus 7 because there are those
like if you get in some of those rigs
and you'd start to use the navigator
like a nice tape my phone here Yeah Yeah
right but it's cool just have an in-car
that's a good call yeah like that I feel
like paperwhite I would go that is both
a gift I would like to get and also a
gift I think would be good to give
Amazon but that means i more than like
you gentle paperweight look that's a
commitment I don't mind more things you
have to get it for me a four way I was
gonna be generous this holiday season
but you're kind of a jerk today so oh oh
I did turn on the screen on the Nexus 7
yeah uh you know what I would like to
get for Christmas this year actually is
a samsung galaxy note 2 oh you know what
I'm not even read on that I'm not even
hang on that i weirdly fell in love with
that phone i loved it i'm so sad that it
broke because i loved it no you know
what I'm gonna tell you we just did a
prize fight with it that phone like from
a Productivity standpoint sure there is
a learning curve involved but once you
learn that thing it's amazing I know you
can do so the split screen feature on it
that you could split screen a skype call
while taking notes like that's that was
what blew my mind a little bit yeah yeah
or Google call sorry is a google video
call right we'll video call the top half
and take notes or you know surf the web
so you could be like hey talking to
someone looking up some information
about like directions or restaurants
that's crazy yeah i mean i really do
think hey you know I've really realized
a friend of mine said
perfectly the other day she was like I
don't want a smaller tablet I want a
bigger phone and I was like yes they
make that's exactly what I want the
bigger full she wants like a six neck
she's like I would like a six and a half
inch with a built-in this is actually
really smart she's like I want a six or
seven inch phone that has a built-in
bluetooth headset that charges all the
time so you never have to charge it like
it's always charge and you just pop it
out and you put anyway samsung galaxy
note 2 I can't stop thinking about that
phone we had this little brief love
affair and that I dropped it out of a
car and broke it on purpose which was I
know a bad way for us to break up but
you're abusive come back to me note 2 I
loved you you're BN you know what this
size for you know I'm not being I'm not
gonna this is not sexist but you have a
person first you carry a purse I don't
know how big it is them no no no no the
note fits quite five also you know what
I wanted them I want those I want the
chief asked lightning connectors to come
out someday soon yeah i can buy myself a
car charger just ordered one for five
dollars on amazon Derek one yeah I was
otherwise all the reviews said that it
works with a lightning connector
lightning like a cable yeah yeah what's
the cable pardon my use USB I feel like
a loser I bought one of those $29 caves
example I got one for 550 three I do I
do um I must admit though that they
charge really fast yeah my phone charges
like in less than an hour I swear I look
at that thing I'm like whoa I was not
like discharge really fast not a serious
totally no I was out like 10 and then I
put it in for like maybe 45 minutes also
about like 70 I'm like what the hell
happened I'm definitely never I'm I
refuse I refuse to buy them from Apple
so I've been waiting for the third party
knockoffs to come out so I'm thrilled
that you told me that because I was like
I'm not doing it but all I want is a
longer freakin cable because really you
guys the way that you're going to
squeeze more money out of me is to make
a 4-inch bring a lightning cable connect
without that was where the things in the
review demo storage cable what do you
timeout I don't know the one that comes
with the phone is like this long like
it's just so well that was then they
charge more for the longer one that was
a thing in the reviews is that the
cables not as long as when you get with
the phone it's not oh I want a
clarisonic well
anyways but oh yeah since we're on the
talking about cables don't buy a thirty
fifty or sixty or a hundred dollar hdmi
cable this year don't do it if you are
oh yeah if you her you are I do do
your dumb you're like your doodoo and
your dumb like Amazon is there they
actually are started making their own
hdmi and digital optical audio games on
basic live 50 what are you gonna do
mm-hmm monster yeah get out of here
