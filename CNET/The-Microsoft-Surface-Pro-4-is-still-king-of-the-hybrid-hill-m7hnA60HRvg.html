even better I'm Dan Akron and this is
the Microsoft Surface pro 4 now the
surface line from Microsoft has been
around for a few years now it was
originally sort of a proof-of-concept
piece to show consumers so this year the
surface pro 4 they're not messing with
the formula too much we get a bunch of
incremental upgrades but together
they're enough that you really feel like
it's a fresh new product number one the
system is about the same size but it has
a bigger screen it goes from a 12-inch
screen to a 12-point three inch screen
they get a little resolution bump there
as well Microsoft calls these high
resolution screens PixelSense Apple
calls them retina it's all kind of the
same thing what's different about this
screen compared to a lot of others is
that the aspect ratio is 3 by 2 instead
of 16 by 9 which is standard for most
laptops and televisions and computer
monitors the reason they do this they
say is because that is the same aspect
ratio as a standard piece of letter a4
paper and one of our favorite things
about the surface line has always been
these keyboard covers and that helps it
be you know more productive than just a
tablet or a tablet with a really crummy
little mini keyboard it's actually a
full sized tactile keyboard with a touch
pad built in this year they made some
nice changes to it it's now island style
keys this is much more natural and
pretty much exactly like the keyboard in
any other laptop that you're gonna find
these days the touch pad a little bit
bigger and I really like the new surface
on it it feels much better against the
finger and you get better sort of
multi-finger gestures like the
all-important two fingers scrolling one
problem the surface even though it
starts at 899 none of those models come
with this keyboard cover even though you
really need it now right how much you
pay it's an extra hundred and twenty
nine dollars frankly it's worth it they
should just throw it into the box I can
never figure out why they don't you're
just gonna have to make the extra $120
investment to get that well you do get
however is the stylus pen that is thrown
in every version of the surface and has
been for years the new one actually has
a magnet in it and it sticks right to
the side just like this there are a
thousand 24 levels of pressure on the
stylist and it works with things like
OneNote or any kind of sketching
I actually use it with the New York
Times crossword puzzle app you can write
the the answers in and then it converts
it to actual text it doesn't feel quite
as natural as writing on regular paper
with a pen but it's a lot better than
many of the other stylus systems I've
seen a big competitor obviously is gonna
be Apple's iPad pro one of the things we
liked about last year's surface was that
they took the kickstand built into it
and they made it infinitely adjustable
to almost any angle and stiff enough
that no matter where you said it you can
tap on the screen with your fingers and
it's not gonna move it's a big
improvement over the earlier surface
kickstands
and ones on other hybrids and tablets
that kind of need to have one or two
positions and don't move all that much
when you combine that adjustable
kickstand with the keyboard that can pop
up and give you a little bit of lift
there you can get almost any angle
possible on this except for one that
actually works really well on your lap
but I guess that's why they don't call
it a laptop they call it a tablet or a
hybrid I'm Dan Ackerman and that is the
Microsoft Surface pro for
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
