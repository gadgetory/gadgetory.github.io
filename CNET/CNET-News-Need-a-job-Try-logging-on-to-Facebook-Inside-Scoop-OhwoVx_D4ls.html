welcome to the inside scoop my guest
today is Donna Tam staff writer and
Donna we're talking about a brand new
Facebook feature that was just announced
today and that is job searching through
Facebook tell us a little bit about this
right it's basically an app that
Facebook and its partnership with a
bunch of other organizations have
launched to aggregate a bunch of art
existing postings from other companies
onto one app so it just provides a
central location for job seekers to go
if they want to look for work and this
has been talked about for some time I
mean obviously Facebook has a lot of
users and so it makes sense to be able
to tap into those millions and millions
of users they provide them something
they really need like a job right and I
think that's the appeal for job
recruiters is that there's just so many
people in facebook there's a billion
users and those job recruiters want to
tap into that potential and yeah it's
been it's something they've been working
on since they launched their partnership
last year just focus on social job
recruiting so how does this have work
have you tried it out I've tried it out
a little bit so basically you can search
by keyword and location you you can plug
in a keyword and pull up a bunch of the
the open positions available it
someplace you know and it's basically
sourced from five different recruiting
or relations so it's from their their
own job listings that they've put on
there okay and so the this site or the
app is now available today so we'll see
if there's any real concrete jobs that
come out of it I guess too early to tell
what are your thoughts on how this
positions Facebook against the
competition for example linkedin another
social site a lot of people use for job
searching for sure I mean LinkedIn's
probably I mean they're definitely
watching as I'm sure because this is
their bread and butter being able to
connect people through their social
networks to find jobs this probably is
it's an interesting position for
facebook although the company is has you
know been saying that we're not making
any money off of this so they're trying
to put themselves away from that and
saying that we're not trying to get into
this space but that remains to be seen I
mean they could you know they could very
well jump into that space in the future
and it also seems right now with stock
roughly half of its value from when it
offered in May they can't do any harm in
trying something just to drive up
traffic increase ad revenue yeah that's
a good point zoo we'll see ya thank you
so much Donna Tam staff writer for cnet
com i'm kharece ooh boy thanks for
watching the inside scoop</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
