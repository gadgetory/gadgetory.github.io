to show you how to use Amazon's Cloud
Player with your Android device
sorry iPhone users you're going to have
to sit this one out
Amazon didn't release an app for you
first set up an account on amazon.com
and upload music to your account it's
pretty straightforward
you can upload almost any mp3 or AAC
files so music you've downloaded from
iTunes Amazon or other stores will work
you can also use music ripped from CDs
no matter where you got them
Amazon gives you the first five
gigabytes of storage free if you want to
get more storage through the end of the
year you can purchase an album from
Amazon and they'll bump you up to a
total of 20 gigabytes for free for a
year after your purchase now you're
ready to stream your music library to
your Android device download the free
Amazon mp3 app from the Android Market
once it's there go to Cloud Drive music
and sign in with your Amazon account now
you're ready to play music you've
uploaded to your cloud just remember
that your device must be connected to
your network or Wi-Fi to stream music if
you know you'll be off the grid but
still want to access your music the app
lets you download tracks directly onto
your device hit the green arrow next to
any playlist artist or album to download
multiple titles or long-press any song
to download a single track the player
also lets you create and modify new
playlists and access music stored
locally on your device you can also use
this app to purchase new music from the
Amazon mp3 store and save it to your
Cloud Drive for safekeeping since amazon
wants you to purchase music from them
purchases made from the store won't be
counted against your storage capacity
for now Amazon Cloud Player is only
available for Android devices Macs and
Windows computers expect to see more
developments around cloud storage though
Apple and Google should be jumping on
the bandwagon any time now for cnet.com
I'm Sharon Vaknin and I'll see you on
the interwebs</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
