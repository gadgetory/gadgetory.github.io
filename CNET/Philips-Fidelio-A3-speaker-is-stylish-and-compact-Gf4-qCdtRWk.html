CES 2013 in Las Vegas taking a look at
the Phillips stand this time we're
examining the a3 it looks like a nice
little wireless speaker okay so we've
got quite nice diamond-shaped design
here unlike this aluminium finish on top
and you get this rather nice sultry
black canvas II approach around the
sides it looks quite good for a speaker
that's quite modestly priced it's a 30
watt speaker it has wireless music
playback over Wi-Fi unfortunately that's
not Apple's own airplay system but
instead you're going to use Philips own
app to wirelessly transmit your tunes
the app works on iOS or Android if
you're a Windows Phone user then the app
isn't available but I have been told you
can have some success getting your music
playing anyway because the speak has
DLNA built-in I've had a quick go at the
app it seems reasonably easy to use but
it remains to be seen whether or not
it's easier just to plug your smartphone
or laptop or whatever into the speaker
and play over a cable so I like the size
of this speaker it's quite slender is
quite small it's not one of these
enormous affairs that's going to hog
your living room and mess up your feng
shui it costs two hundred and fifty
dollars or thereabouts and it's going to
be coming out in June stay tuned for the
full review I'm Luke Westerosi net and
this is the Philips Fidelio a3</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
