the apple pie for all the good and bad
inside the world of Apple now we've got
a bunch of stories for you and another
prize giveaway for the holidays and if
you guess fruitcakes you're wrong now
let's start the show off with the new
iMacs that are officially on sale this
Friday the 21.5 inch imac will be
available immediately and the 27-inch
will be available for pre-order and
shipping sometime in December now the
build to order models for both machines
allow processor upgrades ram upgrades
and the option for Apple's fusion drive
the biggest difference between the two
imax is that the 27-inch model has an
accessible slot for user upgradeable ram
which is a big big deal and you can also
upgrade the video card to nvidia's
geforce MX series which is their latest
architecture the 27-inch imac is also
larger in size now i'm excited for this
release i was waiting for a mac pro to
replace my dual g5 tower for the longest
time yep I said g5 tower but I'm not
waiting anymore and I'm planning on
putting in a pre-order for 27 inches of
imac okay I know well whatever now Mac
Pro lovers there's still some potential
good news on the horizon for you we're
expecting to see the new towers sometime
in early 2013 and with the initial beta
release of OS ten point eight point
three screenshots have capped of the
fact that it will support md's latest
7000 series graphics cards including the
high-end Tahiti line a similar discovery
was found with the release of 10 points
7.3 nearly a year ago but it's a sign
that new hardware will be supported and
is better than no sign at all now one of
the things I get asked a lot by you the
Apple biters is if you should wait for
an imac with retina display like this
guy James Fong who bugs me a lot now
Apple still hasn't even made a Retina
display for 17 inch two laptops and
right now producing one that's 21 or 27
inches is really too costly it will
eventually happen but
I wouldn't expect an imac retina for at
least another year but what about a
standalone display we'll check this out
sharp recently announced a new 32 inch
4k resolution monitor that uses its LG
zo LCD tech that's expected to hit the
market in February of 2013 now the
roughly five thousand five hundred
dollar display will sport a 38 40 x 2160
resolution with hdmi and displayport
inputs and the thinnest frame on the
market at just 35 millimeters now
doesn't this smell like the specs of a
next gen apple display it was rumored at
one time that Apple is going to use
Sharp's IGZO displays for its iPad line
but sourced its display components from
other companies instead and we saw how
that worked out for the ipad mini but
it's something to keep your eye on
possibly the next flag should display
for apple's pro customers is waiting in
the wings alright let's hit the quick
bytes there's still more fallout from
apple's maps and according to a
bloomberg report Eddy Cue now in charge
of Internet services and software has
fired apples Maps supervisor and is
looking for help from outside map
technology experts to get people to once
again trust and use the service now GM
recently announced that the eyes-free
mode for siri that will integrate
apple's voice control with car systems
will be included as part of GM's MyLink
system on several spark and sonic models
beginning in 2013 this is great as long
as siri gets better and adobe is
expected to release the retina version
of Photoshop cs6 at their create now
live event on December the 11 finally a
real app that can benefit from the
retina display and thanks to photoshop
we're able to create masterpieces just
like this one just for the show alright
guys now we'd like to show off some cool
independent projects once in a while and
if you're looking for the Swiss Army
knife of iphone cases this could
literally be it it's called the task one
and it's an IndieGoGo campaign that's a
case for your iPhone but it can also
carve sticks for roasting marshmallows
act as a screwdriver and cut steak
suckas alright check it out and support
it
if you guys you know want to impress the
girls but what about a crazy out-there
idea from will.i.am you know the guy
from The Black Eyed Peas that likes to
dress like he's from the future and
where's Lego hats will.i.am launched a
new camera accessory called d I am plus
I'll just let you soak it all in for a
moment now it will be available for the
iPhone 4 and 4s and two versions and the
high-end version will include
interchangeable lens for your existing
iphone camera and a slide-out keyboard
now a more advanced model for the iphone
5 will come with a dedicated 14
megapixel sensor and flash and a
companion app that turns the hardware
into what will I am calls a social photo
experience with a service called I am
think of it as Instagram without all the
letters in the middle oh yeah the
entry-level add-on will also cost around
three hundred and fifteen dollars now I
don't like judging things before I've
tried them but first impression oh no no
hell no this this just poopies its poop
alright let's do another sweet holiday
giveaway you know I'm a huge fan of
gelaskins and they just launched their
new iphone 5 hardshell case and skins
for the ipad mini so to celebrate
they're hooking up eight of you the
Apple biters with a twenty dollar off
gift card on anything from their site
and since it's the holidays all you have
to do is email or tweet me something you
want for Christmas this year it can
literally be anything the more random
