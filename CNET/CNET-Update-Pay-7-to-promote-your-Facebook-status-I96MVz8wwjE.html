your money I'm Bridget Carey and this is
your cnet update would you pay seven
dollars to get your facebook post seen
by more friends it's a feature that some
users in the u.s. can now try out
Facebook first began testing this
concept back in May and it's already in
20 other countries but this is the first
time that some in the US get a chance to
pay to show off their big news or
perhaps get more attention to an item
they're trying to sell Facebook hasn't
shared an official price for promoting a
post it's still in test mode but when we
tried it it costs seven bucks let me
know what you think of the idea and what
would be a reasonable price send an
email to update at cnet com expect for
future Android phones to be able to
automatically tag friends and pitchers
because Google just bought the Ukrainian
company butyl which creates facial
recognition software this auto-tagging
may also be seen on Google+ in the near
future where you know it'll just know
your face you may also see this on
Facebook because it also bought this
technology earlier this year toys r us
has launched its own streaming video hub
at toys r us movies com there are more
than 4000 shows movies start at three
dollars for a one-day rental or they can
be bought for less than 10 bucks and
most kid TV shows are priced at two
dollars eventually this will be
available through apps on Android and
Apple devices and of course it'll be on
toys roses new kid tablet the tabeo the
Mars rover is just a check-in away from
being near Mars NASA's Curiosity rover
is the first moving thing to use
foursquare to check in on another planet
for those of you keeping score at home
that's the second check in made outside
of planet Earth the first was in 2010
when NASA astronaut Doug Wheelock
checked in from the International Space
Station remember back in april when
microsoft and barnes a noble made a new
partnership well the two companies
announced that this newly formed
subsidiary will be called newark media
it will focus on digital reading and
will soon release a new cap for Windows
8 it appears some details have leaked
about research emotions next phone to
run blackberry 10 according to a
document published by rapid Barry this
device is referred to as the Aristo it's
thin and the computing power is
significant it's got a 1.5
a Hertz dual-core processor with two
gigs of ram and 16 gigs of internal
storage which can be expanded with a
memory card and like other top
smartphones it has two cameras the front
one can shoot HD video and the back
cameras 8 megapixels of course we'll
have to wait and see if this is the real
deal and if this Hail Mary attempt will
score against other smartphones that
