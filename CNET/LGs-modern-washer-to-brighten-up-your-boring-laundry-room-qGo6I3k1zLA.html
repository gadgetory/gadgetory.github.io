LG washer in the office first of all it
has this really cool integrated front
mounted panel something we've never seen
before with a top-load model usually
they have this back mounted display
that's a vestige of last gen models and
it's kind of old-school at this point
looks a little outdated so that's
something I love about this washer it
also has no knob as you can see so it's
a very integrated panel and it's super
easy to use the problem is that it's not
that great of a performer so while you
have this nice aesthetic it doesn't
actually do a great job cleaning your
clothes so compared to most of the other
top loaders it did just okay but it
didn't do nearly as well as the Kenmore
model we just reviewed that did
excellently so if you're looking for a
model that can just be a really nice
good-looking fixture in your laundry
room this is a decent option but I would
definitely look for something like the
Kenmore model instead that can do a
little bit better in performance</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
