courts in Pakistan won an injunction
against Facebook this week which
resulted in the social networking site
being blocked by Internet service

shut down in Pakistan for a month
versace has a high-fashion phone they're
calling it the versace unique it was
created by moto labs and assembled in
france where fashion comes first the
face has high-tech ceramic or handmade
lacquers and is framed with either an 18
karat yellow gold finish or stainless
steel if you prefer the back has
handcrafted leather it also has a 5
megapixel camera and I have no idea what
operating system it will run or how much
it will cost but I'm guessing it will be
wildly overpriced Google Street View is
now under scrutiny in Italy Google has
already been in trouble in Germany and
the UK for collecting data about users
Wi-Fi networks and personal accounts
when they collect street view images for
Google Maps now the Italian government
is looking into this and may order
Google to purge that data in the same
way that the UK has mandated at the
Google i/o conference on Wednesday
founder Sergey Brin admitted that this
was a big mistake he said in short let
me just say it we screwed up in nicer
Google News we have a codename for the
next version of the Android operating
