with sports like first person view drone
racing robotic motorcycle races and of
course giant robot battles will live
building a giant robot to battle your
friends seems like a huge pipe dream
then check out the new app controlled
fpv robots from gjs robot in china are
these the future of gaming ggs robot is
currently selling the ganker robot which
does battle using a large sword the
robot is very fast and agile and
connects to your phone via bluetooth the
ganker fighting bot has different skill
settings as well as preset moves and
fighting stances the scoring system
keeps track of how many times a bot
makes contact with the other bot using
sensors around the robot's body
geo is ggs robots next generation
fighting robot geo mixes first-person
shooting games with first person view
experiences much like some drone racing
slash battle games we've seen recently
geo bot uses a high-tech targeting
system to seek and destroy other enemy
geo BOTS in the game the robot is
equipped with an AI chip similar to what
is currently being used in some
self-driving cars that assists geo and
auto scanning tracking and recognizing
enemies on the battlefield the robot
connects to your phone via Wi-Fi and has
a built-in camera that displays the
robots fpv on your phone much like a
drone does ggs robot is currently
developing and raising funds for vr
goggles and will also connect via Wi-Fi
giving the user of view from inside the
robot currently there are three types of
users that gjs robot is focused on these
include normal hobbyists educational
users and event organisers who put on
robot battle competitions which help
with marketing the robots ggs robot sent
us a couple of their geo BOTS and try
out here in the CNET offices and we had
a blast the Geo BOTS are very easy to
connect via Wi-Fi and they are super
fast and durable a couple times we
accidentally crash them into a wall and
the batteries popped out of the bottom
so the robot lost power the AR and the
phone screen could be improved with
flying bullets or animations of
explosions and I was also missing some
cool sound effects which could easily be
added into a future update but we really
did like the tactile feedback when the
phone would vibrate much like a
videogame and you're getting shot which
gives you a sense of urgency to get out
of the line of fire make sure to check
out some more fun robots as well as some
terrifying ones at cnet.com</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
