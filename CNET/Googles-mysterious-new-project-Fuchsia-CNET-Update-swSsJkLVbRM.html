and no one is sure what it's for Google
put up code for a new operating system
online at github what do we know about
this new OS Google's description is
pretty sparse pink plus purple equals
fuchsia looking at what Google posted
online fuchsia is built using the
magenta kernel I know what you're
thinking now that's so exciting how are
you keeping it together is to answer
your question it's difficult buddy for
those of you who are not thinking that
let's try to break down exactly what's
going on Google's major operating
systems Android and Chrome OS are both
built on the Linux kernel a kernel is
the base of an operating system it is
the first thing that loads when you load
an operating system Google's
documentation says magenta targets
modern phones and modern personal
computers with fast processors so
whatever fuchsia is it should be able to
run on machines that are capable of
running Android or Chrome OS so why is
Google introducing a new OS that is
built on something different from its
main two operating systems that's a
great question and there aren't any
clear answers to this yet this has led
to speculation that maybe Google is
working to replace its older Android and
Chrome OS with something built with you
should maybe that guess is far too
pedestrian maybe Google is looking for
an operating system for a robot army of
elephants fuchsia elephants or maybe not
that's it for this tech news update I'm
Maya's act art and you can stay on top
of the biggest stories at cnet.com slash</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
