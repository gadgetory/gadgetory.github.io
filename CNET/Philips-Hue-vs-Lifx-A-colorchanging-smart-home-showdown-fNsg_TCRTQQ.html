and if you want ones that work with your
smart home set up your top two options
are Philips you and lifx both are well
reviewed both have a lot of fans and
both are pretty expensive so which one
should you get will unwrap it all in
this smart home showdown
now don't get me wrong
color-changing smart bulbs like these
are definitely an expensive novelty
especially when you can get tinted
incandescent for just a couple of bucks
apiece still it's fun to be able to
change the color of your lights right on
your phone or using an integration from
Amazon's Alexa or apple homekit to
control things with Siri commands
there's a lot of charm to all of it to
pick a winner let's take a look at how
these two options stack up in three main
categories hardware the bulbs themselves
software the apps that control them and
then platforms the connections they make
with third-party services and devices to
help build a bigger smartphone ecosystem
in your house so let's start there with
the platforms they both do a nice job on
this front they both work with Alexa
with nest with the if automation
platform online but I give you the edge
here you also works with apple homekit
so you can control them using Siri
commands another big win for philips is
that you can use that hue bridge to
control relatively inexpensive
third-party bulbs and expand your setup
without breaking the bank next let's
talk about the hardware the bulbs
themselves at the flagship level the
main Phillips hue bulb is its new third
gen white and color ambience bulb and on
the life Exide we've got the new third
gen lifx bulbs and lifx Plus bulbs lifx
bulbs are also much brighter than
philips hue bulbs and they offer very
accurate colors Phillip team caught up
on the color front they've got nice
greens now a nice blues if you have the
most recent bulbs but lifx is still the
better brighter bulb as far as specs are
concerned it only uses one more watt
than the philips hue third gen bulb but
at a lot of important settings it's
putting out almost two or three times as
much light
finally let's talk about the software
the apps that you use to control these
lights are really important they're how
you'll set them up they're how you'll
program your lighting changes or how
you'll make quick lighting changes on
the fly both of them do a nice job and
make it fairly easy to do all of that
but I prefer lifx because it's got a
nicer way of choosing colors that color
wheel there in the app it's a lot easier
to use and better than the ocean of
pixels in the Philips uf I also
appreciate that lifx has a couple of
extra features that Philips you doesn't
it has a music visualizer it has the
ability to do some limited color cycling
stuff you can't do that Philip to you in
that core app so I give lifx the edge
here as well now both of these bulbs are
pretty expensive Philips Hughes third
gen bulbs cost $50 apiece whereas the
lifx third gen bulbs start at 60 bucks
apiece Philips EU has a very strong
lighting platform in a worthwhile one
but if I'm spending that much money on
colors like these effects like these I
want the colors that look the brightest
and the best along with an app that's
really easy to use for me that's why
life x is the color changing smart bulb
of choice</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
