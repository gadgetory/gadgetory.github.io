stores more energy than it uses an
awesome way to check out the surface of
Mars from our friends at NASA and our
favorite things that came out of san
diego comic con this weekend I'm back
baby whoa smart daily
brooding citizens of the internet
welcome to tomorrow daily pesky talk
show within the universe I'm Ashley
scale adjoin me once again the master of
comic-con himself the king of San Diego
the sleek round just last weekend kill
anonymous I have the power when you said
master of comic-con master master
University affected we met action we
both went to comic-con it is you both
survived calm economy lives that we
should say it gangis still drunk still
hungover oh yeah where is Genghis he'll
be here tomorrow oh my god he passed out
I got it he's still looking for a my
back we saw his walk off with a bunch of
cosplayers very serious there was a
robbery robot cause clarity just took
off I don't know and what happens in
Comic Con stays at comic-con it's true
but as soon as I locate Genghis which
maybe is in a hospital somewhere I don't
know I don't know so look I'm it's a new
comic con's a big event has a lot of
releases and reveals and stuff like that
and it was a big flurry but we have
decided where we siphoned it down to
some of the big things that came out
this weekend at the vet as our top
headline here so let's hit the headlines
so so you you were there all the days
yeah I was there like even before it
started and I'm like after it left yes
the traveling circus leaves town he
kills is like box but rise for the fire
the whole convention center just takes
off on wheels you're like my eyes n
diego convention center um alright so
let's talk about our personal favorites
because honestly like the news is all
out there we don't need to give you guys
a recap there was so much stuff that
happened kale I we actually haven't even
gotten to talk about what we liked at
the show so this is a first for us like
we just sat down were like all right
call this all organic yeah this is all
organic socal what was your number one
favorite thing so there was two gigantic
like trailers that came out one isn't
technically a trailer and one is the
best trailer and the one I'm talking
about is Batman vs Superman they gave us
a trailer it was it's honestly our first
trailer the first thing was a teaser
yeah they show up so many storylines
what's gonna go on in this movie we see
uh we see Ben Affleck as Bruce Wayne we
see him as Batman we see Wonder Woman
there's a lot to behold here we also see
um we also see our Lex Luthor yeah Jesse
Eisenberg looks so good there's a lot of
really great like just shots and I think
a lot of people are now like not as
worried about this film but I want to
remind you and this isn't me being
defensive that Zack Snyder makes really
good trailers that's true even if the
movie is terrible so remember sucker
punch but again this was an incredible
fanservice trailer and check it out it
definitely had it'll you'll squee at
some point edge very true um but yeah ok
so again there's more from the Warner
Brothers Warner Brothers that came out
but that but i'll let you take that
because the other thing i want to talk
about is Deadpool yes there was a this
is one of the things I was excited about
going into Comic Con cuz I know anybody
that's really into comics typically they
like Deadpool cuz she's a little
different than most of the time he's fun
so we actually got to see some footage
from the Deadpool movie we've seen only
images up until now oh and it looks
pretty good like I'm not I'm thinking
about thinking off the second coming but
in right it's pretty good it was leaked
there's no it's like a weird like
imagine this whole frame this whole
frame
like you know this is the actual screen
it was like this much of a hollow lens
version the hall was filled again is
really behind he I pee picture in
picture um so interestingly enough with
that Ryan Reynolds tweeted yesterday or
maybe early this morning he said hey
really want to show you guys the
Deadpool trailer I'm really sorry but
the visual effects aren't done yet give
me three weeks so it looks like we're
gonna get the official trailer in three
weeks but at least he gave us a timeline
and was honest about it and said hey
like I get it I know you want it but
unfortunately what we showed at
comic-con wasn't totally done yet and we
want to make sure it's polished before I
give it to everybody so for what that's
worth I'm glad that he was honest about
it and that it will be done when I see
you because I'd rather see a finished
trailer like a fully finished trailer
than something that's half done and go
oh I don't know I think it's may just be
a strategy because yeah maybe they don't
want to get their trailer loss keep the
momentum going yeah yeah so yeah twice
we'll see but I interviewed him and he
said there's gonna be more of those
wacky photos on Twitter that he keeps
uploading of Deadpool thank you that's
very exciting so yeah I organized a
large group of deadpool's to take a
picture with ryan reynolds so that they
were very excited a lot of work yet
little Deadpool I've got a little
Deadpool and it was the best anyway so
where's there's still a bit more well so
for me uh obviously you guys know what
I'm gonna pick his star wars force
awakens we didn't see any actual clips
from the movie but we did see all this
great behind-the-scenes work in this for
minute long video that is so fantastic
it shows all the practical effects I
mean I got choked up just because I'm a
fan of film production like I love
watching movies be made and seeing this
just made me so excited and everybody
seems super thrilled to be involved in
this movie to be working on it you saw
animatronic stuff you see little
miniatures I mean they are really going
back to this kind of let's create a
spectacle with our hands and that feels
really exciting to me and i I'm I'm so
thrilled that Star Wars feels like it's
in great hands I need we've got all of
these practical effects aliens they're
not cg their actual people in costumes
and robots that are fully functioning
untethered robots like that kind of
stuff just is great I mean there's just
nothing I can say
and then of course the entire panel
where they took six thousand people if
you guys didn't hear what happened at
the panel JJ Abrams was like hey we're
going to treat you guys to a special
thing and so they gave everybody in Hall
H a pass a Star Wars pass walked them
down the street escorted them via
stormtrooper to a location behind the
convention center gave everybody in in
Hall H six thousand people a lightsaber
and then treated them to a full-on star
wars concert right there at sunset like
amazing people were so excited I saw
people openly weeping kale oh I'm trying
to show you something we keep going keep
it openly crying at the fact that they I
mean they were filled with so much
emotion and and that's to me what comic
con is all about to me that's it it's
like that there is your fireworks does
it they had fire this was from that show
I was in a hotel next to it so yeah I'm
sorry night way to death star explodes
was when they started doing the
fireworks they played like the music
from the trench run and then as soon as
the dust or blew up they started running
the fireworks and people were literally
just openly weep it set off car alarms
there was Carl arms and San Diego just
going off yeah but it was it was pretty
cool that's nice they really did it big
it's a shame that we didn't get another
trailer or clip or something but next my
entire cast was there and that's all
that mattered to people even Harrison
Ford Harrison Ford was there he came out
and he was usually he's mr. grumpy guts
that like all of these convention any
any time he gets interviewed seems kind
of like cranky but he even was in such a
jovial mood he was so happy to be there
and just and they all looked so
overwhelmed and excited and I thought
that was just really great but I know I
mean another one of the big reveals also
came from the Warner Brothers panel it
did it did that was suicide squad they
saw a full trailer and we should we
can't show you that either because again
it was just for Hall H they didn't
actually release that trailer which I
was very surprised by but we saw so
here's what it looked like if you
haven't seen the leaked footage it was
Amanda Waller so Viola Davis talking
about putting the other squad she's like
oh I put these people in a hole and then
I throw away the whole like that's where
they live like all his stuff and then
she goes down and Harley Quinn is
dangling from the top of a prison cell
with ribbons like like those circus
ribbons she's like doing gymnastics
there and then she asks me underwater
are you the devil which was cool and
then we saw a bunch of footage of Harley
there's like her yelling I hope you have
insurance like you know as they're
driving away and stuff so it looked good
I I was actually really excited about it
I more importantly more importantly more
importantly well do you want to do you
you probably want to discuss what like
The Suicide Squad stuff yep well yeah
Joker yeah we got our first look at
jealous Joker full face and he said yes
tattoos I'm not gonna hurt I'm not gonna
kill you I'm just gonna hurt you really
really bad yeah and I could fool tattoos
like the whole thing but people were
really impressed with it though people
were excited and I think people were so
scared after seeing that image that that
air had had posted they're like oh no
he's an emo bro yeah girl I think it's
terrible i think we kind of figured out
the breakdown which is that this so the
last Joker was chaotic oh the ones
before were playful and this one is just
psychotic yeah so it's good that they're
all kind of in the same sort of sort of
realm but I think a lot of people were
are now excited about the movie I'm on
board I didn't need any more i had
margot robbie he already knew he already
knew I know Margot Robbie you bet I only
heard her voice for a little bit he did
it was so short but it was it was enough
zelich me I was very excited about that
so yeah it looked it looked really good
i'm really excited I can't wait to see
that movie i would say more than batman
vs superman um that's but I'm a villain
girl i love villains i love anti-heroes
i love that that's like my jam i love
it's one of my favorite things so um so
like suitable just so well wonder woman
just I just want the Wonder Woman movie
I want her ole I want to see that whole
thing play out I can't wait gal Godot
looks Austin in that costume I'm gonna
I'm gonna go ahead and say and this is
just uh I'm fine fine with having this
opinion but I wish it was stronger I
wish he had worked out a little bit more
you wish a low blow maybe look Gina
Carano type yes like a little bulkier
yes somebody somebody was like know that
they don't need to be buff or whatever
I'm like but there's amazon that's yeah
yeah she's name is on a and b we haven't
yet had a female superhero buddy it
actually has a big bites have I get it
you know women can be the you know this
felt like Lena tumbling around the world
they need one that's different now like
we need one that's
a little beefier just to be like this is
okay this is beautiful as well so I
agree with we got our black widows wine
yeah I'm adding gray like they're all
skinny let's get a buff one let's get a
look anywhere ripped all right okay so
that was what we thought of comic-con
I'm gonna really briefly run through
these next two stories because we talked
about comic-con wat the first thing I
want to talk about is I want to discuss
the Stella lux this is a futuristic car
that looks insane this car looks crazy
it's actually an updated model of
something that already existed so here
it is the top of it is completely
covered in solar panels now one of the
really hard things about solar vehicles
is the more weight you put in there
obviously the is very difficult you have
to make these things as light as humanly
possible before they can actually move
and so to put four people into a
solar-powered car like the stella luck
scan is actually pretty remarkable and
on top of that it actually stores more
energy than it can use 0 which is
impressive so over the course of a year
they were saying and you can see it's
got this tunnel carved out underneath it
for aerodynamics like to help the car
get more aerodynamic on the road it gets
about a thousand and fifty kilometers
arranged on average so pretty far with a
little bit more in sunny climates a
little bit less is about 50 kilometers
swing either way if there's your skies
are a little more cloudy heavier people
in the car decreases the range obviously
yeah boyfriends they said oh like yeah
you had said no no heavy friends so
Logan can come cuz I'm controlling his
light belt so svelte um and then if you
hit top speed on it obviously you're
gonna bring down the the range just like
gas mileage like if you're running your
car at a hundred miles an hour not gonna
get the same gas mileage as if you're
just cruising at 55 same type of thing
and then one of the things that I really
liked about this car is actually it has
the navigation system is weather aware
so it knows what the best route is for
the Sun not for time or traffic like
it's like oh hey this is the direction I
need to go in to get the most amount of
Sun so I can keep going that's
infuriating that you'd have to think
about that as well where your car thinks
about it for you yeah but if it's great
but if it was like 20 minutes of
destination of you know miss riding
already toilet sorry buddy one hour cuz
we need that son
that sunlight got a the sorry I'm sorry
I'm late honey it was cloudy you're
driving to like from LA to the Joshua
tree and it takes you all the way up to
Washington effect down because that's
the most weather efficient route so and
it's going to compete I guess in a three
thousand kilometer race along the
Australian outback like in the ester and
out back later this fall so I think that
would be exciting i'm curious to see how
it performs obviously good whether
they're probably pretty sunny so
hopefully it'll do well but yeah that's
the stella luxe which actually I wanted
to be our hashtag of the day because we
did comic-con for like three days last
week and we'll talk about your comic-con
feedback today TD looks if you could
have a car generate anything for you in
that capacity what would it be and it
can't be money cuz like that's the easy
that's an easy out can't be dollars like
no you can't have money can't generate
money for it can generate some thing for
you what you want to generate
compliments ah just to you or to
everybody like you're here today kill
Thank You car mmm you sure a good person
that's not true but thank you in light
of me you're like litem yeah it's beyond
basically though I should change that to
lies then right yeah cuz compliments is
saying that it's true white lies so yeah
white light white lies just completely
like build me up before I go anywhere so
I like that you got this kale like a
great your number some kind it's like
all your interviews are gonna be amazing
killing everything's gonna be perfect
you ever have any problems you're
perfect okay just you're like thank you
thank you so much yeah you're the best
host on tomorrow daily I know you're
lying but thank you no no ah ok so I got
you the car explodes cuz it tells too
many little too big of life um i would
say i would want it for i would want it
to generate uh this is kind of a weird
like of course it's you yeah it's super
weird i think i'd want it to generate uh
like travel miles so like as I'm driving
in my solar card want it to generate
rewards miles so like if I'm driving
solar-powered car I can like you know
redeem all of the energy I saved for
like a plane ticket to go on vacation
somewhere hmm I think that would be kind
of cool that would be neat have like I
some kind of partnership this though so
in a partnership so it's like you know
Oh your energy company so like your your
electric company goes
oh if you buy this car like depending on
how much energy you store up like will
give you rewards plus super incredibly
bad for the environment like they're
giving you give me more so it's okay a
lot of to be able to like yeah so I'm
saying like if you drive this
fuel-efficient like or like zero
emissions vehicle whether it's solar
powered or hydro like whatever it's good
then again awesome rewards so they even
travel places I think that would be
really good on so the government would
do that yeah tix just like they do with
the electric car and a little carpool
thing don't take the carpool lane it's a
little reward I like solving problems
solving problems okay and then lastly we
have Mars trek which is really cool nasa
released this awesome tool that is a
little bit like google earth where you
can actually look at the surface of Mars
and explore different locations on Mars
and it's rad like check out this video
want somebody on YouTube put together
video of them checking out the service
it's really fun and there's some really
interesting things on top of just the
Google Earth aspect of it which is cool
you can explore the planet you get to
deve use 3d views you can search or
select places to visit so if there are
points of interests that are already set
up and there's like bookmarks so you can
say oh I want to see Olympus Mons and
you can go see that volcano or you say
oh I want to see the landing site of
curiosity and it will automatically take
you there like those are all pre
bookmarked and then there are overlays
of visual data that you can add to the
map to get like pictures from other like
flybys and surveillance and stuff that
you can add as sort of overlays to sort
of check out things and then the last
part of it that I thought was so cool is
you can actually select a part of the
map you can save it with a tool on this
Mars track you can save it as an STL
file and you can upload it and have it
3d printed so you can get a little piece
of the surface of Mars ah like a little
doubt scaled-down version of this piece
of the map that you print it out that
you could 3d print out so I thought that
was really cool and somebody mentioned
it being potentially used for board
games like oh this is the surface of
Mars and here's this cool board game
that we can put together Wow so like do
too and it's actually all scientifically
accurate like surface of Mars stuff cool
so Mars truck is what it's called you
can go over to I've used to look up
online Mars track tre k like Star Trek
of smart
um you cannot you can check out that
tool and it's really cool it's you can
kind of get lost in there and just like
you know if you're really into a horse
can get lost on Mars it's really really
fun so yeah that is those are our
headlines I know we spent a lot of time
on comic con and we kind of breeze
through the other two but too bad
everybody we're really excited about
comic-con and before we go we lost a
legend this weekend we just wanted to we
have a quick little graphic but I am
personally heartbroken and I'm sure you
are too over the loss of Satori Watsa
the president of Nintendo you will
sorely be missed sir and thank you for
bringing us so much joy over the years
owes as a game designer and as the
president of Nintendo's about 55 yeah
we'll be we'll be right back welcome
back in the jailbreaking you who's
everybody The Suicide Squad trailer has
officially dropped the full high-res
version so now you can see the joke the
new Joker and have an opinion on that
Harley Quinn it's three minutes long
it's what they showed at comic-con what
they leaked out wasn't even that whole
length so there you go what are you
gonna leave a link in the yeah it'll be
in the show notes and also if you're if
you're really curious I'm sure you can
just jump over to Warner Brothers a
YouTube page and we'll be right there
are we gonna edit this over the part
where you're talking I think yeah we
absolution yeah so you saw a little bit
of it and so now that now you see how
production works yes how everything's
kind of screwed up in time like magic
sorry hey it's Monday that means cole's
yeah we just poking holes in it we're
just giving you a backstage view it's
Monday it means we have to talk about
crowdfunding so let's talk back at her
Hackett um have you ever been camping
and said to yourself I wish this hammock
or a hot tub mm-hmm now it sounds I'm
sure that's I've thought that at least a
hundred times okay so this this hammock
is for you it's called the hydro hammock
I saw this this morning I was just very
confused but also so amused by this
entire idea it is literally a hot tub
hammock it turns it's a fully lined
hammock that
you put water in and it heats it up and
it's a hot tub I mean I don't know what
to say beyond that so uh here's how it
works there's two parts this contraption
you got the hammock part which is either
single or double layered you don't have
to hang it you can dig a pit out like
the beach and create your own hot tub so
that's the box that holds the hammock
there's a pub water pump in it there's a
heater there's a water heater apparently
this water heater can be bought
separately in the Kickstarter and it can
be used as like a shower system so if
you're out in the wilderness and you
want to take a hot shower like you can
do that um yeah so you set the thing up
you fill it with water and then you plug
it into this this water heater thing and
and that that's how it works heated up
you know you jump in and enjoy your hot
tub hammock so might be the most
important invention ever created of our
time one hundred percent forget the ipod
forget the computer good good idea the
internet forget it this is look USB
charging ports it has two USB charging
ports which is one more than my card why
would you that sounds dangerous it does
you're mixing water with like what am I
gonna yeah what am I gonna charge my
phone oh where are you Paul right get in
there ABS get yeah come on apps it is
blinkered on that shot yeah he's just
like a recycle look at me again never
mind no filter just in the in the desert
hashtag no filter uh this is a very very
very specific oh yeah or a device okay
wait so here's what I'm here's what I'm
very anxious to find out okay have they
already reached their goal uh they are
very close okay they are very close okay
and the next question always is how much
do you have to back to get one okay
you're gonna maybe not be thrilled about
this just more tea just an FYI you're
thrilled about it single-layer hammock
two hundred eighty dollars right now
because double-layer hammock three
hundred ninety dollars okay however and
here's the catch it doesn't come with
the water heater you have to buy the
water heater 4 for the hit for the hot
tub don't know for how much uh well a
hammock heater combo starts at eleven
hundred and eighty dollars for the
single air hammock no
no I don't know and it and okay so this
is made for jay-z and Beyonce pretty
much you know I'd rather a girl honey
guns like the money guns let me put in
your money and then it shoots it out
make it there make it rain Guns that's
what I need they make it rain guns um so
as of right now they are officially I'm
pulling up the the Kickstarter I want to
make sure it's like right up to the
minute they have 15 days left they have
forty-two thousand dollars out of a
fifty-thousand-dollar goal so they're
closed they got two weeks but i don't
know i don't think they're gonna make it
well all we need is one of our fans with
eight thousand dollars to hop in there
also true I like eight of these they
have a fondue pot that comes with your
yes that's ridiculous look at these oh
my god at least people having aa purpose
why people like it all these rich white
people having a great time god this is
first world this is like excess to the
excess extreme I've never seen anything
like it III mean it would be like I the
thing I haven't seen is it at a party it
looks like it's always like these rich
people are like me and escape nearly a
hammock where's my where's my hot tub
hammock party and I'm like to have
people jump in hello first language
about it's just smaller source of water
so you can add the water much quicker
you get one person jump in a little bit
of theirs to the next person do so by
the third person it's got to be a
different color yeah man you got to
start treating it with chlorine it's
just not but good luck I would love to
try this out I'm not I'm not going with
anybody else but it's just me just me
alone what is it bouncing town what is
it twelve hundred dollar what about
hammock for a single layer if you want
the dumb bellaire it's more but yeah so
that's a that's the hydro hammock guys
that's Hydra hammock I found it glad you
brought that one up that's a good your
mom phone one it's so weird I did I
couldn't help myself okay guys kill is
finally back which means we can finally
talk about your thoughts on Comic Con so
let's get user feedback
so we asked you guys to talk about like
what your favorite thing was out of
comic-con what you're seeing what just

the trailer went completely so bad and
it's still might cuz we haven't seen the
show but like the trailer they're really
got me excited about ash vs. Evil Dead
and that's a show yeah give me a show
which is really cool like that they're
kind of making it a TV series like it
feels like it could be really fun that
way hopefully Dom wrote in and said
Suicide Squad with Deadpool being an
incredibly close second yeah won't get
any argument really cool I I honestly
and just to go back to Deadpool trailer
I felt like they spent too much time
with him out of the suit because the
trailer was like two thirds building up
who Deadpool is and it's just Ryan
Reynolds being quippy and being like
look
but these experiments on me whip that up
but loop and I get it but we wanted him
just be in the suit like flying around
making jokes and shooting upside down
and they kind of like sprinkled that in
I don't know but excited anyway and also
Suicide Squad we can't wait to watch
that trailer once this is over yeah
we're gonna watch like a hundred times
once we're done taping the show because
we haven't seen it on a full screen
because i wasn't i wasn't in Hall H for
that we've already edited into this and
out this episode you're seeing it for us
and we haven't seen it yet it's weird
and then also and then lastly James
Roden said Batman V super squirt cut
jaws from Cavill and Affleck man that
was chin tastic so I said Chin's rub
together that's the real fight start
punching I feel like I could take I
could definitely get in that fight I'm
very the one be that they didn't even
talk about which is their bulges because
like if you if you look at their things
it's like a battle I don't know it is it
is that true battle of the bulge not
that I was looking Batman wins always
batfleck one hundred percent alright

comic-con let's talk about our very last
piece user feedback which is our photog

Georgia so that's four that's enjoyed it

own but I think I'd it's not as good but
that's that's pretty he ever talks about

east coast but I I guess a lot of people
go to the beach
