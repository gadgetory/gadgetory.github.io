that help you translate from one
language to another but for the most
part you're dealing with just written
text
but now the googles update to their free
Google Translate app for iOS and Android
users can now have spoken conversations
and have them translated between two
languages almost instantly to help
demonstrate I've enlisted the help of
CNET's multilingual dream team I'll be
playing the role of the monolingual
entitled white guy let's see if this app
can help me out to get started I'll open
up the app check that it's set to
translate between English and the
language I want to translate to and then
tap the mic right now it's listening for
English and when I stop it will
automatically translate to Spanish so
I'm gonna press the microphone a second
time and then I can have a conversation
with Vanessa all right so then how's it
going note entiendo nada lo que me estas
tratando de decir I do not understand
anything of what you're trying to tell
me notice haciendo followed SS
aplicaciones b intestacy endo sonar
comedy Otis as the application is doing
favors rather tests sounding like an
idiot right back atcha Vanessa to stop
things I'll press the mic button again
and now to change things up I'll talk to
Seth in Japanese and I'll change the
language setting from Spanish to
Japanese then tap the mic button a few
times to kick it into conversation hello
Seth how are you doing today
on YouTube this is I don't know you Lisa
de gallo dated mmm kill was ago you
sucka she does it it is amazing busy
today
I'm sorry that's close blows so sorry I
hope they give you a break soon yeah
watashi wa sushi ski doesn't I like
sushi well okay I hope this weekend you
get to enjoy some now for our last
conversation I'm gonna try Russian with
Boris take a minute here to get this
started
Boris thanks for joining me here and
testing out this app buddy spicy pasta
police minister - totally detectable
Iranian spicy pasta progressively minion
sudah thank you for inviting me here
how's the translation so far this year
period ah walnut which NASA be no truce
: on beef translation pretty meat
especially from Russian to English so
there you go that's how to use Google
Translate to translate conversations
between two languages on the fly I think
it's pretty cool
keep in mind though that we're in this
perfect quiet environment here if you're
using this at a crowded noisy restaurant
or using it outdoors you probably have a
different outcomes we also have a great
Wi-Fi connection here if your connection
is spotty you have to keep in mind that
all the translations happening in the
cloud not directly on the phone so that
data connection is really important
still on all great app especially for
travelers you can handle 90 different
languages it can handle translating
between text and scribbled input and
even you can even use the camera to
translate images of menus in written
text in real time it's really cool check
it out
for more how-to s visit
