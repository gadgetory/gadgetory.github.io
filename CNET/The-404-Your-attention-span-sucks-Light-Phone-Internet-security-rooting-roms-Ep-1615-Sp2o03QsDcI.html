hey what's going on ladies and gentlemen
thank you for tuning in to the 404 show
on this friday may 22nd 2015 very happy
to be here today because we're welcoming
for the first time ever in the history
of the show mr. Zack Whittaker good
mo'nin how are you hungry well thank you
how are you everyone I'm fantastic thank
you everyone's gonna fall in love with
your voice because you have no come on
the strategic situation I mean it's on a
level of charm that begin to whisper it
sometimes yeah are you talking yeah so
they can hear it in their ears later on
okay I could should i do one now like
you should good afternoon oh it's so
good really um I'm I'm like you know
people say to me on an almost daily
basis I've been in New York fair what
two years now more than two years people
say to me almost every day oh I love
your accent and it's like well it's I I
never get tired of it of course because
such a class is very flattering her
Americans have a fascination with the
British accent and I don't know what
more so than any other regional dial it
sounds more intelligent it's likely is
it the reverse southern accent it with
that and I believe if you slow down a
British accent it sounds southern is why
someone told me once if you'd slight
like the southern accent though I've
been to Georgia and I do I enjoy it yeah
that deserves me a great deal what is
it's very um it's what we considered to
be American I suppose that's strange
like you guys think southern well think
about it but I would think other
countries that are less familiar with
America would assume we all speak like
Cowboys yes like I would think everyone
in North Korea thinks you assume
correctly we're all John Wayne and Clint
Eastwood hear any much um today is an
interesting day in the office zach zach
is here joining us that's making it
interesting point one thank you you are
a writer for ZDNet and seen it yeah you
cover a wide gamut of topics mostly
nowadays security cyber security law
politics I've fallen asleep yeah it's
fine this boring no I find it very
interesting but not many people find it
right especially with the law and the
politics and the
last few weeks has been nothing but
Patriot Act there's an Patriot Act that
and NSA this and it gets very tiring I
enjoy considerably I love it that's
great alright as long as you enjoyed
your accent doesn't like translate to
the actual writing because I Jesus
nephew right is great but then it's like
see I reviewed all his stuff in an
accent that's what needs to be done
maybe it should say at the top of your
post read this in a British accent
weight is in a really charming British I
see the same employee with Morgan
Freeman you can say anything yeah and
it's that you just you see his face I
found yeah well hit him explaining space
is one of the great things your ears can
enjoy I wanted to also talk about real
quick so we have a silent guest in our
studio today little four and a half year
old Aldrin Akhtar is here hey sitting in
the red chair in the back if you haven't
seen the studio a little chair he's got
my iPad he's got a bard pair of 24-karat
monster headphones on I'm just really
old okay I'll even tell I just miss barn
from justice desk after has to put a
borrows medicines there's a five year
old here just chilling out watching bill
he's very happy it's amazing those
freakin headphones are like perfect they
block out everything was like that scene
in old school you could say anything
he's like dad Optimus Prime is here so
pulled a headphone away from his
earrings like oh oh they don't learn
that most people don't ever learn these
I gotta teach in that a little bit but
yeah so he's in and like it's the day
before a long weekend so there's a lot
of kids running around the office yeah
and there's no like there was no memo
about this mmm oh I thought as he
doesn't is hiring people very very young
not as proud of myself I start that
scene that when I was nineteen that was
did you actually as it turns out this
later this month I think May thirtieth
so in about a week will be seven years
from me and I'm 22nd grats thank you
very much i know i can't think of
anything else i've done you no longer
than seven years been at it for over
seven years I've had an accident that
I've been vegetarian longer than seven
years I've been I've been alive smoking
and now what I smokings been seven we
get I smoked for many many years as you
know I it's been about 210 so this is
something I always wanted to ask you and
I wonder if there's a correlation shoots
so
ack has Tourette syndrome drugs and you
smoked and I always and you'd stop
smoking cigarette did and I wanted to
ask and we never got because I'm always
very interested in your yeah very
flattering that you thought you'd pay so
much you know interest well no I'm any
good will do it helps create a certain
sort of awareness people have this very
stigmatized perception of of Tourette's
and I want to and my I always ask you
questions cuz i know you take medicine
for it I know it's it's it's a big deal
yeah did the smoking ever affect that
yeah actually made it to make anything
but it made life easier for me it did
the strangest thing is that for my you
know the symptoms are known as text you
know you have vocal tics you have the
physical tix where you lash out you you
hate yourself ya know flail your arms
sure I've got the whole range the whole
spectrum your opportunity yeah
absolutely and so I am I used to smoke
to calm myself down to feel like I was
calm really used to regulate my
breathing which is one of the things
that you very rarely have in in this
condition is the ability to shut
yourself you know shut the world out for
a few moments right just enjoy a
cigarette and you regulate your
breathing you calm down you get into a
little space for two or three minutes
and then you go back to the real world
again and it just gave me a few moments
of relief right in between shouting
swearing you know and I do have that
that symptom I do have the swearing tick
I have had that for years I actually
have the the quintessential condition as
it were but it's it's it's almost not
noticeable because of the medicine that
mod it really is amazing I mean the
medicine I'm on is it takes away maybe
ninety five percent of my position that
so how does it work like what does it
does she bloody magic it's just so it
just goes it's microscopic wizards and
they enter your bloodstream honest I
couldn't tell you how it works it's um
you know IIIi don't shy away from this
topic I actually wrote a piece some
weeks ago the medicine I take is the
most commonly taken
in America abilify and I take a very
small dose of it yeah but they generate
billions in revenue for vs yeah and it's
time for people with you know some
mental health issues certain illnesses
but for me it just it just takes the
edge off don't know how don't know why
it just does that's great yeah looks at
me and I hope it works for others
excellent all right arm we have a lot to
cover today not just Zacks Tourette's
which we could we could strange I
suppose we could spend a great deal of
time on it um but I want to talk about a
few things that's going on first off I
just have to I have to tease this real
quick for myself it's it's selfish it's
in nature okay but as we all know the
Giant Bomb people now share the office
with us and they started doing elisa so
there's only two guys here from from
giant bomb Oh is all dhryn okay yeah
cause little coughing okay fair enough
you good buddy he's not looking at me um
that thumbs up their thumbs up excellent
that's all Indian life so it's just
Vinnie and Alex and they're uh across
the cafeteria there I should go and say
hello say I should maybe she'll go let's
go it's a neighborly thing of this yeah
and they started a brand new podcast on
the east coast called the giant beast
cast the congratulations to them so I
got to appear on the first episode that
sounds sarcastic i can see it did but I
you know that's your nature sorry people
don't know you they they should know
that everything you say should be taken
with a gigantic grain of salt um and
yeah it's uh it's it was great it was it
was great fun and I was on their show
search on iTunes the giant beast cast
and i was on the thing for two hours
with them there's a lot of fun so the
best of luck to them and that's all I
got to say about that if you want to
hear me get into games like I want to do
sometimes on this show but kind of
alienate everyone else in the studio at
the same time that's my fault but ya
know it's not anyone's fault but go
listen to that we talked a great deal
about games okay enough of that I should
probably admit something admit it you've
never played over
no I have but I don't I don't yeah it's
not if that's my bad thing is okay no
sound come a lot of people don't play
games okay I would say so I just I feel
sorry I'm I knowledge ethic you
shouldn't be apologetic I wonder what
the numbers are like I wonder how many
Americans or have not even working
across the pond it how many people in
first world countries the percentage so
what are we were like that 25 to 40 demo
right who how many of how much per they
have what's the percentage of those
people who play games what's the game
definition is it like this casual games
on phones utama consoles console cuz i
saw one plays tiny Angry Birds handheld
ones about diac no talking about
conscious a whore's be almost a
console if you're playing vida you own a
bike honestly if you spent over like a
hundred dollars for the hardware I think
that might be there they'll want sure so
how what's the percentage what are we
guessing I'm thinking 60 I think a lot
of people at least i would say maybe 60
65 right I'll say 30 do you think thirty
percent including it's both male female
male and female I think a lot of people
do it and don't necessarily add not
admit to it but they don't think of it
as something that they should
necessarily does happen we haven't done
a time period is like I'll often they
plan for a week would never own a
console okay on a kind of play and they
play twice a month Frank Underwood the
the fictional President of the United
States plays video games and house of
cards does early he's the Beast of
President James he plays games you
played games didn't Lee I'm sure you
want to get to that season thanks a lot
there Zack oh gotcha makes me really
yeah it's not the biggest sport in the
world and breaking his on reddit without
knowing that I was it go he turns into
president how did you do that exactly I
haven't finished likes I'll just season
1 haven't bought any on season one I
haven't finished two or three I think
what season Leon sorry I know I think
they want a cigar yeah 3 it's so heavy I
just can't walk I don't play games and
you then watch house of cards two very
different than noble house of causes but
they requires a lot of attention at my
point come on that's why the reason why
I didn't finish house of cars the one
season of Kevin Spacey be in the
president who cares come on one
I'm sure it's great it's partially
spending through the west wing and the
the the funny thing is that the west
wing is almost exactly like I don't
there's no way that show is better than
a game of thrones when house of cards
comes over the Goodyear aim yeah i'd be
interested in i won't even i won't even
the Shaam when zombie president chose Oh
enough freaking zombies Jesus Christ
alright let's let's get into a few of
these stories we have here in our
rundown we've got good stories this week
this is going to be fun uh the headline
for this one is goldfish may have a
better attention span than you the
smartphone user it doesn't have the word
man it's this goldfish have a better ten
definitively once the wall is the
attention span of a zombie zombie it's
gotta be pretty good they just don't let
up right yeah they're persistent they
don't worry what their focus your fairy
folk they have they have one plan in
mind and that's it brains so so what's
the what's the way yeah how is this
possible because the quintessential like
awful attention span is that of a
goldfish or someone who watches MTV so
how on earth could this possibly be a
real thing yeah there was a study by
Microsoft and this print that came out
in spring 2015 but the results are from
back in 2013 and a bunch of Canadians of
doing research on so these might only
apply to Canadians okay okay just deal
with that one first of all historically
great attention and polite very polite
so the thing is the resort very nice
people they clock the average human
intent attention span dat just eight
seconds where are you talking about
exactly eight seconds now that's one
second below a goldfish in two thousand
it used to be 12 seconds we used to be
able to do that and of course the study
is saying that people are more easily
distracted in the presence of devices
with screens so basically our
smartphones have made us lower our
attention span now when a set like when
is the point of joy to my phone I even
think we know that was like no i didn't
i was looking at i got an email through
i was looking at that but i did trail
off at the end did you see the sign on
the door that says leave your phones
outside he's got his phone where's your
phone outside
wha now that's a joke um I think we're
like when did attention span necessarily
equate with intelligence like I get it
you having a long attention span is
likely a good qualit wait a sec I think
I think has to do with intention
intelligence if you can actually keep
track of what's going on in like I don't
know like a lecture in school cuz you
say second you like wait what did he
just put his dad with that moves because
someone who has a 88 second attention
span isn't watching a film and just mind
wandering every eight seconds there
there's gotta be some sort of his done
you've got a phone in your hand you can
expect I can spend all day on reddit
today i learned i get i can just go
through it you know that powers yeah you
as you're diving deep into the new
submissions i don't know i really do but
that I think that can captivate me for
you no good in serious in terms you know
20 25 minutes that's longer than eight
seconds so why does that why does that
mean you know any difference from
listening to a lecture right talking to
you or to anyone else so the question is
what environment were were these sort I
think the metrics more lately I'm not
sure exactly environment but there's an
upside this whole thing okay a positive
about the study sorry even though
attention spans are lower now with these
devices that because we have these these
screens that people who use these
digital lifestyle they called it are
better at simultaneously processing
information from different sources so
they can look down and listen to you and
put in more information than they used
to so multitask yeah my girlfriend
wouldn't agree with that well then she's
gonna argue with Microsoft and Canadians
know she has evolved with me I don't I
though is is too often that I i am in
grazing my phone and I need yeah I did
this a lot I I will I I do this I I'm in
the conversation as well I'll pick up my
phone and I'll scroll for an email I
will forget what the yeah that's bad you
can't do that you can't do that and you
can't maybe this is what they're trying
to get our is that they do you can't
keep a focus without having to check
your phone for something because we are
arguably in the most connected age you
know we've got facebook and there's no
doubt it text messages but I think that
I think that's where like the rudeness
factor enters because you there's
there's a
very big problem with people detaching
from reality yeah when engrossed in a
conversation like the second you have a
start a conversation with someone you
have signed an unofficial contract to
continue to continue until you either
gracefully exit either party terms right
whether or not it's amicable sometimes
that's fine its nature of conversations
on I was gonna end with a handshake and
a kiss on the cheek okay having
conversations with you oh um so I don't
what I don't understand is like that's
that for me that is the biggest sort of
issue with the end with with being
distracted by cell phones and you're
apparently a culprit I'm terrible at it
I I will admit that I can be on face
time with my parents who are in England
yeah and as Mike because I using my mag
on my iPad I will slide my phone
underneath the webcams that I can play
it on my phone that is pretty good there
is also a sickness as there is a
sickness so the bed talk to me and they
can under the thing is it's about
keeping it because my mum can tell when
my eyes are sort of like you know
wandering down to my phone she's like
she'd snaps her fingers and says it's in
the second window that's all you need or
you could attach it I saw like one these
little how-to so when these have two
videos if you hook up your phone to your
Mac and then you go to the QuickTime
Player you go do new movie recording you
can actually see the screen of your
phone right in the window so you could
do that don't make this easy for me I
should be I'm trying to make no of
course gonna make this easier I should
you know I should spend a bit more time
if you focused on listening to what
people are saying is that what is that
the way you commonly interact with your
parents facetime you know really it's
it's free and it's easy and it's I've
got to admit it's better than skype by a
long stretch oh I'm not talking about
what's better Scarface time but I
fitting for you but it's got it that's
got to be a generational thing how old
are your parents like 40 my parents are
in the I shouldn't say in case they
listened but they are in the early
fifties all right so they're young they
are young I bought them an ipad I think
three years ago when I was on my way to
your country and we've been face time he
ever since it's it's free and it's easy
right it's easy for them sure and they
get it near love it yeah money that you
like I wouldn't I feel like that's never
gonna happen with my parents they're
just I folksy space that long does for
the boy when he's over all right maybe
it's not maybe once Dylan is older and
that oh no why not just right now yeah
the things i have dogs and my mom's
allergic to dogs so like when he's
around she wants to see him without like
her eyes closing up so that's a lot of a
lot of face time with us too uh I did
not hear that correctly that sounded
like your mom was allergic to seeing
dogs to actual dogs yeah but you
differently I would face that I'm coming
to play for that that's why she uses
face time to see the boy when he's over
with oh because she won't go there she
comes to my apartment she basically will
be messed up with like a day or two man
that sucks sorry mom oh that's a bummer
dogs only have like five or six years
left so i guess so i guess that's a good
way of thinking about it just survive
don't worry mom come over soon the dogs
will be dead in half a decade Hey look I
gotta spend it positive somehow right
that's a truly sick way I look at it
sent to humor that's okay alright fair
enough so i'm going to learn to
somewhere you know right I get it did
you imagine that somebody taught me to
be this way I don't want to think about
that so there you have it thanks get the
gold now I'm just I'm just I'm just
silently judging once that's good that's
the best way to judge better I think um
yeah so there you have a goldfish are
essentially smarter than or our
superiors they are whoa hail goldfish
yeah soon to be our aquatic over Lloyd's
all right uh here is a fantastic idea
it's a Kickstarter for a phone that is
actually a phone so I'd be seen it's a
Kickstarter right it's this little
credit card sized phone I saw this a
couple of days ago and all it is is this
tiny look at those little Chiclets
remote you used to get you right about
like that old school watch battery
credit card sized remote that would like
control I don't know what a little
control like Ellie
the color lights yeah there's little
chance of things it's sort of that size
I didn't have the little bubbles for the
buttons resident bubble keys is only a
phone it doesn't do texts it doesn't do
apps it doesn't do anything other than
receive and make calls and I think a
speed dial for ten different number
right so it's for drug dealers but the
idea is you what I mean if I'm a drug
dealer I'm buying this phone if you
pledge a hundred dollars you can forward
your phone number your phone calls over
to it and the idea so you can disconnect
because it's called the light phone
because you know we're so connected so
you leave your phone at home you install
an app it'll forward everything over to
this phone that can fit in your wallet
they will show people putting in their
wallet but that only applies to phone
calls yeah only this is brilliant this
is what I want to take on vacation with
me you really what couldn't you just
take your phone and just not look at the
others no no no that's not how that
works we just covered we just covered
how impossible it is to get
notifications man do you know do you how
cool my phone is I do not will find you
did you sing everyone's phone is cool
man oh right so there's a lot of cool
stuff on there and it's distracting and
when I'm on vacation I want to be
enjoying the the beach or wherever the
hell I'm looking at okay this can't do
that I was expecting you to completely
hate this thing's a hundred doll it's
cool basically a second phone that's a
phone the iPhone this is great I think
it's smart I know I know this is mine do
not adjust your radio I don't think I've
ever heard him say anything nice about
and anything no oh guess what this
happened I love it has changed you man
that's not your about that but guess
what I'm the old Jeff Berg guess what I
possible can we come me I'm sure it'll
come back to in the middle don't worry
there's gonna be something that'll piss
me off enjoy this while you can okay a
broken clock is Right twice a day so
let's keep it at that is it not no he's
technically true he's right i more than
like white an analog clocks there it is
i love it i want it i want this fun it's
it's a tiny little thing and it to me
it's brilliant there are plenty of
instances where I only want to be
alerted at a phone call they wanted two
hundred thousand dollars and they met
their goal alreadies 222,000 I'm not the
only one opinion to go they got 1,700
backers a hundred dollars for this thing
Zack do you want one of these things uh
one
oh yeah it's cool I mean it's not
something I would I would take it I
don't know if I'm about by this but i
would buy i would buy if it was 50 bucks
maybe go on askin say here's my thought
who actually really calls people
nowadays I it's an emergency I dude yeah
I do like calling people um but we take
a lot of people don't and I found that a
lot of people when i call them they're
surprised or they don't pick up yeah
like what about yesterday see mind they
see my name come often think I'm not
gonna talk to her I'm gonna hold to that
jackass okay so but now I find that some
people don't like to talk and that's
fine maybe it's for people who don't
want to buy a phone can you can you put
your own sim card in there yeah it does
take a sim card odo but the thing is
this phone when you buy it has its own
prepaid sim so it's a second line
effectively so it can't brought you
can't buy it unlocked essentially i I'm
not sure because it's just still kick
star but then again couldn't you just
get a crappy little flip phone and
you're the same thing it's got like
snake on it and that's gonna be too much
of a distraction snake is too much of a
distraction you'd be surprised I get
desperate man there's times where like
man I need to play something you just
program sup to a calculators yeah I'll
play sudoku on the back of some stupid
magazine that's how desperate i'll get
wow you you almost as bad as i used to
be when it came to flying yeah well know
what do you mean when okay so there's
that is that five-minute period we can't
have any devices on okay sure i would
bring like an analog book an actual book
or like a notepad or something just so i
could not have any time where I have to
sit there all that psychotics that's
that simply so that's like how do you
would pay a hundred dollars for a stupid
said I'd paid 50 oh sorry they gave it
to you but you would use this thing yeah
I would use alright well look when when
i get mine over either of you drug
dealers uh not anymore anymore yeah what
year is it I know I not anymore no not
not anymore no I can I can see this
having some uses but I don't it's not
right I don't need for me as a burner
value to throw is a burner phone it's
the sort of thing that you see him just
do a burner sin like you could do you
can you can do that were sense
definitely or is there something
connected I'm sure somebody knows this
you're a drug dealer yeah already drug
dealers the
send us you would it was that with an
anonymous email lava email love bit the
other day no more Ramona okay security
expert where don't you send an anonymous
email you can use a number of white enum
you can use a push mail you can you push
now um p GP GP GP g I'm sorry I asked
all right so you didn't like yeah let's
move along to Scrabble while things are
really heating up let's move along to
scrap it had gone there from facetime
that's just gotta got added as one of
the words and scrabbles really there's
like 60 100 words or something they were
added to scrabble dictionary i saw this
because I've seen some of these words
and I've tried a mic on my phone is
whatever apps and like no this isn't a
word so can you so is the a scrabble
obviously if they were smart as a
companion app right where you can look
up if you challenge a word and uh it's
called a dictionary you know I don't
know addiction oak is apparently the
scrabble dictionary and the Webster's
dictionary would likely have different
entries in them so what I want to know
Beyonce now proper now yeah so what I
want to know is like is there a
companion app to Scrabble where you can
pop you know type in the name the word

welcome back to the 404 today we're
joined by Zack Whittaker from ZDNet and
soon it hello security expert cyber
security expert extraordinaire but might
be pushing are you stealing people's
credit card numbers online yes or no no
have you ever no I don't have a credit
card okay I'm not kidding adjacent to
steal them then oh that's why you know
is it's a perfectly good reason to
although I haven't how'd you get into
all this cuz I would imagine you have to
have some sort of nefarious backgrounds
and security not really um why are you
so fascinated with it because it's
seemingly mind-numbing Lee boring ya
know it is I find he's like that's what
it is is it to a lot of people is very
dull but it's this new intersection
between tech and law and politics and it
all all intersects in the middle and
it's a great new space to explore I mean
people are making laws about technology
about privacy and freedom on the
internet which is the same as freedom
offline as well what's the biggest
security issue facing the world the
inner
net today that most people have turned a
blind eye to honestly probably no I want
you to lie to me okay I'll learn to you
know in all seriousness it's probably
freedom of speech I would say that's one
of the biggest issues that faces our not
I suppose humankind why how is it being
compromised how is it being threatened
because so many companies and lawmakers
are pushing to enact laws that they
interpret for their own means and their
own lot you know the for their own
purposes a lot of it comes down to
intelligence agencies trying to gain
access to our information which you know
is what they do but in changing our
behavior is not a way of being able to
be free and being able to do what we
want to do you see citizen for I did do
you like that very good films very good
did you see it the ed Snowden I have a
teen it was a good film it's a good film
because you know and obviously it's
basically Glenn Greenwald and this um
filmmaker what looks waitress attorney
Laura Poitras she directed she won an
Academy Award for right he won an Oscar
yeah I it seemed to me like it was
almost too good to be true what was
happening what was unraveling before
yeah and she issued the whole time she's
probably like holy I got I got
something something's happening right
now and basically from a hotel in china
hong kong hong kong sorry same thing but
almost year they basically change the
world from hotel room you know that
laura portress lives in Berlin no
because she can't come back but she
can't come back she's an American from
where from from what I understand but
she kept being held at the US border
right comment we just keep screwing with
her yeah and but the thing is like she
is trying to do her job she's trying to
document and she said she's a journalist
she's a film major documentary maker and
she is being held up at the border where
even Americans have almost no rights
whatsoever the only right that you
really have is the right to silence
right
and that's that they can't refuse you
access to your own country it we've
turned her into this trader figure I
think some n we've done that to Snowden
as well yeah I mean a lot of people
think you know you know patriot or
traitor well you know what at the end of
the day no matter what you say or what
you think he has his actions have
spurred on a huge amount of discussion
and the laws are changing after the fact
I think he's important because and not
because he's basically fundamentally
changed the way people look at the
internet which they had which has
happened I mean when you look at you
know BS and AAS meeting before Snowden
and after Snowden people change the way
they search on Google exactly I things
have changed forever so if you have
changed your actions I'm not saying
necessarily you but if you have change
directions are you really free to do
what you want to do right and that's the
bit that's the thing is that freedom of
speech is an freedom of expression has
been you know it's been considerably you
know it's it's having some serious
difficulties at the moment you know
people are not being free to do what
they want to do and what they want to
say within the realm of freedom of
expression is it actually crazy that
people are paying more attention to like
Bruce Jenner then this stuff because I
know well now wait because the Bruce
Jenner thing is an important issue in
its own yes of course Jenna thing I
meant more when there was this there was
a magazine at the tabloid tabloid yeah
there was a magazine was somebody
actually put paint on his face right
airbrushed that particular sure sure
sure no offense to anything else there
but I'm saying like when celebrity is
discussed much more than like your
actual rights you does that bug you it
does well in interest rates it's a
cognitive novacane i mean it's it's
people don't want to deal with the real
issues of the laurel the thought of
people having what they think of rights
and then they don't you know take
advantage of them i supposed to a degree
it hurts I don't like the idea of people
posing on celebrity culture over their
own personal rights I don't like that
idea but again it's it's up to their own
you know
the funny thing is is that they have the
freedom to do what they want to do I
come from a country that doesn't
necessarily have freedom of speech
believe it or not it right it doesn't
exist it doesn't exist in a way that it
constituted us here right why they're
not in reality are certain things that
you cannot certain words that you cannot
say in the UK um and who's your biggest
freedom fighter Banksy oh but so you
can't say certain things you can be
arrested on the spot for saying certain
words how does that happen a lot it
can't I wasn't it happen it does yeah
like what kind of thing now obviously
I'm certain so certain words that are
what we call racially aggravated so
certain words so basically we have fair
speech and it's not a bad system but
it's not perfect either sure you can say
certain things I don't like this person
I don't like this I don't like that and
it's fine but you can't say something
that's going to offend someone and
because of something they can't help or
because of something they they have no
control over yeah but don't we have a
similar a slander you do but that civil
case this is criminal you can't say you
can't say certain work and you know I'm
okay with that I don't think you should
say certain words obviously but it says
compromise a truly free jersey because
it does so basically you know no one has
this quite right yet and you'd think
that after maybe no almost 300 years of
your country and God knows how many you
know years or might you think that some
would have this nailed know by now no no
yes that was too difficult just a speck
on on the under on the timeline there
all I know is that you can't I mean
having too little freedom of speech is
not a good thing yeah i'll for sure no
one's gonna argue with that unless well
well maybe I do know some people who
yeah all right what that's interesting
so that so there that's the interest
then again microphones results the same
country that you can you know you can go
to war at the age of 16 but you can't
buy call of duty until two years later
that come on you're preaching to the
choir there we go you can only not do
that here now you can you'll go to war
at 18 but oh it's 16 for us yeah you go
to word 18 and
uh you know you'll you'll pay taxes but
you can't you can't buy alcohol come
back you know and you and you can't rent
a car which is just the biggest how old
you have to be to rent a car 25 25 yeah
yeah well I know quarter century it's
ridiculous then that's what I fight for
um so that's important right so it's so
it's good to know what where you're you
know entry level is like why you're so
passionate about that sort of stuff and
I do think it's a major issue and you
know it makes me sick what people are
more interested in I mean just don't
ever go on facebook and you won't have
to deal with that upchuck reflex that
you get when you see what people are
sharing and interested in the thing is
you know I a lot of people say that I've
got nothing to hide that always cracks
me up Greg Glenn Greenwald he was that
the forefront of the Snowden leaks he
said some I think last year to a TED
talk he said if you've got nothing to
hide email me your passwords right and
no one has taken him up on the collar
and it makes you think we know what
maybe some people do have things that
everyone has something to hide well the
thing is is that and you know it's a
technicality but there's there's there's
a there's different levels of privacy
sure right is that of course because
there is buzz what's in your mind yeah
and then there's like what's tangible
yes so there's that's a that's a 2
system sort of like concept of privacy
there is but again you know privacy to a
degree more privacy privacy no matter
how you say is it should be absolute I
mean totally you have you know in in the
in Europe you have a right to a certain
level of privacy as long as it doesn't
infringe on a law enforcement
investigation or something similar you
know but it's enshrined in our rights so
what do you say about this so the big
big topic conversation in privacy this
week is that there was like 140
companies that collectively wrote a
letter to the White House saying we
don't think you should offer backdoors
into messaging services like I message
and and other
you know the problem is with back doors
is that they are used and designed for
law enforcement sure and that's fine you
understand that they need to crack down
on crime they need to you know catch
criminals but if there's a if there's a
hole that can be exploited it can be
exported by anybody sure and the concern
is is that they're essentially weakening
their own systems because if there is a
floor it can be found and right Oliver
and they'll always find it before they
will always find it before the
government so now what do you think is
the right answer I don't think there is
a right hands now I think I I struggle
to find the answer to this one I think
is will take legal scholars academics
security experts countless countless
years to work out exactly what works all
I know is that you can't you can't
compromise someone security for the sake
of of privacy and their rights yeah
isn't that the whole idea by an open
source items so like instead of using an
iMessage instead of using a FaceTime
study using these these protocols that
are proprietary you and abusing an open
source solution because everyone can see
the source and those things get fixed a
lot Master sure it's in general they do
but also the code itself the code that
actually pieces the software together
isn't it can be inspected so it's very
difficult to put a secret backdoor in
there for the NSA to you know access the
data and other thing is with facetime is
a good example actually because that's
encrypted and apple doesn't have the
keys right between to decrypt that which
is what makes the NSA and the federal
government so angry that they can't
access half of the things on my phone
Rhino else's because 30 years it was
just phones it was a song you know
that's it are we have a phone tap we
have a phone touch with ecology years
hitting a button yeah so now they have
to come to people if they want my date
they have to come to me and say what's
your PIN codes so now but now you know I
don't want to put words in anyone's
mouth but don't you think do okay so do
you think there needs to be something in
place for that kind of snooping to occur
do you think that the way it's been
since the since you know the the
modernization of the telephone
infrastructure
how we've been able to tap phones and
stuff like that it would be grossly
naive to think for a second that we
don't need intelligence agencies right
because we do when I need a level of
surveillance to keep us safe for the
problem is that it doesn't work sure you
know you have you know phones and all
these amounts of data and a lot of it
stored in the cloud and can be accessed
the problem is is that you have
government agencies taking the law and
interpreting it secretly sure and using
that secret interpretation do a lot more
oh my god what the statute actually
explicitly says and this is the problem
with the Patriot Act and a lot of people
are getting exhausted with hearing about
it it's set to expire is set to expire
and the government has until what the
the lawmakers humming till June first
but actually because of a recess they
have it's now coming up to what two
o'clock they've now got about eight
hours left before they do anything about
it man that seems like a good gig being
a lawmaker oh so much time off you have
recess and you can night filibuster
whatever you want yeah they have recess
was less than me at recess elementary
school right this is true I'm sorry
Elementary Elementary yeah you know all
right well this that was a great
conversation man I like here and we and
I'm surprised the lawyer had nothing to
well this was one I'm not an expert in
you Kayla yeah second thing step
everything saying is fine yeah well
that's good right now about the shot
well I'm just I forgot you went to law
school I can please allow so yeah I was
pondering I gotta sit here and think I'm
not gonna just completely jump uh yeah
also like it's bit heavy it's it is I
apologize I feel like you handled that I
roll them at the time down yeah there's
no low brow today I'm sorry mitac that's
all it is today all right let's bring
things down just a little bit arm this
is kind of ridiculous but you know I
read this a few times when i read the
variety article and there's something
then this is actually the right move
okay we're talking about the week of
March 25th right that's the
batman/superman launch right and what
else
My Big Fat Greek Wedding part to the
deuce baby is actually a movie first of
all yeah and as it should has been
scheduled by Universal Pictures they are
the guys who've decided or they're the
people who've decided my big fat greek
wedding too will open against Batman V
Superman dawn of justice yeah and if
you're really a sick individual you get
that double pack and you see them back
to back right you're not gonna do that
well my question is what do you thinks
gonna do better at the box office wait
you say March 25th or May 24 it says
Marge I thought this is coming out is
this coming out this week because it's
the 20 no known until next its own next
year the current month is May oh I don't
plan any further than like the end of
day most the time fair enough you know I
know you asked me was gonna do fall on
the weekends it's Memorial Day I've no
idea I didn't realize I thought that I
thought Batman Superman was this was
this summer it's not that we just been
hearing about it to death oh god and
it's just it's zack snyder's benitez
been tweeting like here's a picture of
Aquaman here's a picture of Wonder Woman
is a picture of my socks and like oh my
God look it's with Wonder Woman socks
wilderness yeah but Universal Pictures
people would pay a great deal of money
for that of course the universal
universals got the right idea this is
exactly how you're supposed you're
supposed to match up um your movie with
a polar opposite and that is what this
is if and when this movie does better
than Batman oh it's not gonna do both
know it could so what's happening in the
second big fat greek wedding are they
renewing their vows do they get divorced
a new wedding that's the best question
I've heard I don't know how this works
well see that's the mystery right there
right there not tweeting about it we
have the noise we have no wonder and
there's that much more intriguing versus
when will we get the leaks I lose my big
fat greek wedding too at least with some
head in at least with some headlines you
you know what you're expecting Four
Weddings and a funeral that's pretty
straight up that it even need I've never
seen the film do you know why cuz I know
what's on the box right example what is
in the funeral it's like any cousin
between don't care it's like any Cameron
Diaz movie ever she's only in movies
with titles of exactly what the film is
about okay I've got
story do you want the story except
there's something about mary no we don't
know what that something else nope
there's just something I suppose no
you're right right sex sex tape bad
teacher I mean come on she's only in
films that are exactly what they're
about it's true look out the year over
talking about target engines want a gold
night hunt great so get any spam that it
wasn't oil done I was curious your demo
is only in the Cameron Diaz okay
something like Adam Sandler's deep male
equivalent of sure waterboy the cobbler
braised with a cobbler yeah he's a
shoemaker I didn't he's not actually
know me you're making me I'm not making
that up is the cobbler all right what's
the plot to this film so we could move
my story follows that lovely love
lovably loud porta hallows family whose
return after a family secret is revealed
and a bigger fatter wedding brings the
Big Fat Greek family back together oh
what a cash grab that's what's the big
secret it's not the the big question
mark over I'd imagine so it's a secret
oh so whatever comes I would you not
just name this sequel my bigger fatter
creak wet it might be called that I
don't want you who I can't stand to I
hate sokoine it's lazy that they how
he's all anything about this half-baked
they're just gonna slap it to in it walk
away it's freaking ladies motorman too
yeah it's lazy man too um so you know
what I've gotten into this is we got a
little geeky but secure I don't know if
I want to know this so long so I've oh
but you know I've had a lot of downtime
last couple weeks yeah how is jr. he's
good thank you for asking why he sleeps
a lot so i'll have like like father like
son exactly i seem this is des went over
to cat naps under yesterday I woke up
and Zach had a mirror under my nose like
what are you doing is like just checking
for your life lovin uh so very good
excellent oh uh so uh you know I had a
lot of down time I've had I have spans
of time of three hours plus to do
nothing and I started fool around with
my android phone and now I'm like a hard
core routing custom firmware rom guy so
you got a LG g3 I'm that guy
I now and people think you know their
their list I remember when it was cool i
was i remember when he was you know I
window yeah oh that's out the window
dude that's me now I'm that guy what
exactly are you getting into particular
what what roms are you in uh cyanogenmod
that's pretty good it's good so it so
Android do you know about this secure I
know I know about of course I mean sure
android has which isn't but that was a
security story couple years ago when it
became legal to do so yeah absolutely
yeah so basically you strip all of the
 that comes on your phone with you
know you buy an LG phone it comes with
their stupid android overlay sort of
software and then god forbid you have to
deal with the verizon junk that litters
your phone look it's disgusting I hate
it right so bad taking ball two normal
just fine I know a boy a flame I was
waiting for it all your RAM year it's a
resource hog so what I did was basically
stripped all that out i rooted my phone
meaning i gave i opened up root access
to give yourself full permission of the
phone right your thing you should have
to do whatever you want with it and I
did and then I I uploaded a custom rom
which is a custom firmware custom
software of Android to my phone and now
I'm just living the dream with a phone
that works acts performs and does
exactly what I wanted to do thank you
yeah well good that's as it is my galaxy
s3 yeah while ago messing with roms
those are like really fun you can get
really lost it is a slippery slope
that's the time when you actually care
if your phone has an SD card slot yeah a
load bunches of roms try out different
stuff like my phone is jailbroken now
yeah and I'm like oh this crap on this I
can do that I couldn't do a man so
what's that I mean the Android benefits
are very obvious what are the Apple it's
even but when you get another store if
you want to get other so you just get I
understand you can load non-official
apathy there are apps that are allowed
to touch parts of the software and
hardware then normally are not touchable
like wha what's the best what's the main
reason for jailbreaking your phone well
the main reason let's see one you get to
use more the screen real estate like
that's the
biggest one is like normally every time
I see anybody's regular iphone it looks
like a fish apology want your grid you
want a great i want to be able to have
widgets on the actual screen but like
for me I like if you never use activator
man activator is like that basically you
can assign functions to basically
anything life I double tap the time is
should go to last pass like just like
that what's last pass last passes my
password managers no one makes you have
everything they're usually need to pass
for something so activator is sort of a
launcher for Senna launcher so much it
can assign functions two different
things if I triple press the home button
it'll go Google instead of it being just
nothing it looks like you got a little
widget action to now which is a which is
a very naughty word and elaga the top
there my little a bar there got my
little android guy up instead of thee
and then you can change those icons you
can change because if this is your
carrier says you know verizon or AT&amp;amp;T
I've got you can put your name or
whatever I just put an end roid up there
these little extra things that I enjoy
cuz i miss my android i miss my endured
a lot animistic customization the
customization that camera still on the
iphone is really really good oh it's
very good it's annoyingly good and it's
getting like it's getting to the point
was i know the s6 is supposed to be
great but one of the things about the s6
is they took out some of the cool
like taking out the battery and putting
SD card slots into so they might as well
be stuck with the iphone again if I'm
gonna be stuck I'll be snide yeah I
guess so but the I'm curious like the
good reasons though I feel like it's you
could still do more with Android right
uh you know activator functions that are
not on Android not the same way that's
one of the things so like think what pic
triple presses brother bring me to
google play which doesn't do all the
time yeah I mean doesn't always work and
that's it's got a doc to their my doc is
like I've got eight things in there well
are you impressed by stuff like this
Zack I am I used to jump up my phone
yeah and then I I just didn't i got this
what the iphone 6 sure um when it came
out yeah that's a sick i haven't really
done anything with it since frankly all
right oh yeah you can bring android like
think so if i hold down the Wi-Fi button
control center it'll bring up the Wi-Fi
settings like an android and how is it
with batteries it ruin your battery
that's fine same thing almost exactly
the same okay okay we'll see I am
thinking
about switching carriers so maybe when i
moved to t-mobile you're moving to
t-mobile I just can't do I can't do a
verizon anymore i paid so much money so
here's the thing i'm on t-mobile i find
an i travel internationally to the UK a
lot the benefit is that i spend maybe
eighty dollars I think sorry free
internet free to miss international data
it's not perfect but it's for general
age buying a card when you get the
absolute is far cheaper you can I can
call home there's in the city it's
fantastic it's great coverage out in the
sticks not so much alright that's where
it gets problematic if you ever travel
you know but the thing is you do have
access to Wi-Fi calling right so if
you've got access to a Wi-Fi network you
can just pick up the matteson that's
great I love that's how tmobile
essentially fixed the gap in its giant
network you know Meads it's got a huge
network but it's nowhere near as big as
AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon so basically by giving
everyone the opportunity to have their
own Wi-Fi router in the house then they
can they can make Wi-Fi calls where
there isn't any traditional signal yeah
it's pretty fantastic one more break
when we come back we'll hit the reddit

whatever you want in the corresponding
show week thread and we'll read some of
this junk on the air okay ah this was a
up most upvoted comment of the day of
the week wrong holiday weekend but do
you still do the annual trip to
mcdonalds you guys should tell us what
you would get should tell us what you
would get off their menu and then how
eating the food would make you feel
afterward so this was the thing what we
used to do way back when we go to
McDonald's for breakfast why would you
do that to yourself could you do once a
year we would do it we haven't done it
in two years but July those it was
delicious when you're a kid yeah July oh
no we would do this on for 10 I know
that that's why you still do it I
remember it being good sure that
stemetil seed that was planted the last
time i went to mcdonalds maybe was about
two and a half years ago I went in in
London in Covent Garden just use the
bathroom that's how auntie McDonald's I
am why then again I'm vegetarian I don't
eat meat or fish there's nothing you
don't need fishy fish what about what do
you eat cuz you're eating some fade
vegetables yeah vegetable rec fost you
can have the pan like tofu ok you got
pancakes in the hash browns that's all
vegetarianism bacon of course yeah bacon
it's the grows on trees raised on piggy
trees it's really crazy uh so we haven't
done this in a while I i haven't had
mcdonalds breakfast and probably yeah
year and a half uh but i would love to
do it this year if you're down I'm
definitely definitely usually do with
the all you know I have a wedding this
July 4th will have to look at the dates
and see what gets Maryland you like
fourth some people celebrating their
independence by getting dependent bye
bye
pletely giving it up yeah and creating
dependence right exactly so it's all
kinds of suffixes and prefixes so yeah
well we'll try it out thank you flying
donkey below what would you get oh man I
love that the bacon egg and cheese
biscuit with the hash brown sign me up
and might just get regular egg mcmuffin
now you can ask Brown the bacons where
it said there's something about the buff
the biscuit it's on this gets gross no I
know but that the biscuit doesn't even
feel like food it's agreed that is
obviously that's where you like that
unlike that's a little growth it's like
hey you allowed to have this sugar or
maybe it's just crazy maybe you pick for
me and i'll pick for you all right i'll
be like god damn it i would be okay with
that uh the chatham says jeff has
mentioned a couple times that he has an
ass at home it'd be great to hear his
experience and if he has any general
recommendations that's an S particularly
regarding media streamer that never
attached storage well I have a tiny
little box yeah the company i use and
recommend a synology they make really
good stuff they have proprietary
software never heard of it being called
an ass before yeah yeah this is like
cloud in your home but the thing is is
like storage is so freakin cheap now
that you kind of don't really need an
ass anymore I guess unless you want to
serve yourself stuff mo like outside of
your house which is kind of cool I wish
I had an ass with solid state so you
just don't have to though background
pose don't even have to worry about the
reliability issue either where you know
hard disk drives can and will eventually
break down you can get server great hard
hard disks for that yes but the reason
why I had an ass at the house even
though everything was in the cloud
already was when either the internet was
weird and my boy wanted watch Netflix
and didn't work or if whatever else
wasn't working on the network like okay
so this this isn't working this actual
machine or the least the NASA is
attached to a the network in the actual
computer that way he could watch
something even when something went wrong
right which you can't it's hard to
explain like a two-year-old oh look at
the Internet's down right right so what
does that mean like well you can't watch
what you want to watch right now what do
you mean by that
don't understand yeah no I get it so
there you have it synology is the
company i use media streaming i don't
really do that much of it to be totally
honest streaming remotely from my house
I just don't do it I use pogoplug for
that it's this way easier at this point
yeah it's an old man way to do it I mean
we're just not safe like it might not be
safe it's like if you've got internet
somewhere I don't know I you know what I
do also like you own the shelf in the
jaw always keep that internet just in
case you need it just when it's 10 just
harvested yeah you know just store it up
um so yeah that's uh that's really like
the the long shore but I with USB 3.0
I've actually started bringing files
with me cuz it the transfer rate is so
fast that was right because you have to
wait yeah you put it you put it like a
thumb drive look I got 15 min I got 15
minutes to move you to go but now you as
you can transfer like 40 gigs in like
five minutes it's insane how fast USB 3
point is so that's kind of where I'm at
with that arm and then this was
interesting and I wanted to put this out
to you guys if you had any insight on
this Hydra master says I was in a best
buy the other day and saw a phone case
that supposedly extends the range of a
phone's antenna we've seen snake oil
products like this in the past none of
them have worked I wonder if you guys
have tested it or used anything like
that I've never heard of that no I think
years ago you used to get cases or
little add-ons like small metallic
source trips that use on the back of
your NT used to boost you and talent
nowadays you don't really need yes it's
not it's more a case of the the Wi-Fi no
Wi-Fi the data the data network is is
strong enough and it's it's everywhere
especially major metropolitan cities
like New York you can get a repeater
which is expensive and you gotta plug in
and it will boost the cell signal in
your area yeah you can get them in your
house as well right that's femtocell
technology right you plug into your
Wi-Fi network and it turns into your own
cell surface right I would not buy a
case that promises to to boost your
signal I think we test them here though
now
interesting to try out no you're right
that does kind of fall into the snake
oil category ah well that's it folks
