from cnet here at CES 2012 in Las Vegas
and I'm looking at the viewsonic view
phone 3 now the first thing I am going
to tell you is that this is the unit
that was moments ago tethered to the
display so it does have this big ugly
honkin on adhesive on the back and that
will not be on the phone should you
choose to buy one it is an android 2.3
gingerbread device and it has a 3.5 inch
screen with a 480 x 2 32 exel resolution
now one interesting thing about this
phone it's kind of hard to tell here in
the picture that viewsonic has added a
couple extra touches with a customized
skin some animations on all of these
screens in a carousel each one has a
different screen are a different
animation rather each screen has a
different animation and you're able to
actually change those as well and there
we go so you can drag and drop to change
the panels up here so that's pretty
interesting now the phone has a 5
megapixel camera on the back it comes
with swype and an FM radio that's a
swype virtual keyboard and let's see it
also has support for to do two gigabytes
of storage and as for the way that the
device looks itself I'm not a huge fan
at this point the screens all right but
there's a sort of black matte material
on the back let's see if we can get a
better look sort of rubberized on the
back and around the sides and although
it does feel pretty nice it doesn't look
very slick and this is a phone that is
intended for international business
users that brings me to one of the most
differentiating features with the phone
is that it actually has a dual SIM card
so there are other phones like this as
well but it's got two sims in the back
you can put them in and have sort of two
different identities like personal
identity and a work identity you can
actually send text for example from sim
one or some too and you'll be able to
read them that way to and filter them
out that
so there is pricing for it it is two
hundred seventy nine dollars and
ninety-nine cents unlocked and it will
be available on the viewsonic website
but it will not be available in a retail
store I'm Jessica dual-core it this is
the viewsonic view phone 3 and you have
been watching coverage from CES</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
