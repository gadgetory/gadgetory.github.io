I'm Bridget Carey and this is your cnet
update twitter is no longer playing nice
with meerkat a fast-growing app that has
become an overnight sensation for
streaming live video to your followers
on Twitter meerkat launched about two
weeks ago but it already has a hundred
and twenty thousand users it lets you
broadcast live video from your
smartphone and followers on Twitter get
alerts of your broadcast to watch you
need to tune in life because there are
no repeats once it's over there's no
watching it again the meerkat app
depended heavily on Twitter's network
instead of having to collect a new list
of friends and followers for meerkat it
just automatically pulled in all of your
connections from Twitter giving users an
instant audience that's why it became so
popular so fast but Twitter cut off
meerkat from being able to do that
anymore and it just so happens the same
day Twitter cut off meerkat was the day
Twitter announced it acquired a rival
company that also works on streaming
video called periscope so now meerkat
will be competing with whatever
Twitter's cooking up the meerkats
founders say the company will push
forward and create its own network to
not rely on Twitter's user base either
way the few weeks at piggybacked on
Twitter's network sure help jumpstart
the app twitter is not the only one busy
buying up companies facebook just
acquired the shopping search engine the
find and with the purchase it's shutting
it down Facebook naturally is interested
in new ways to make money from shopping
ads and searches the find app let you
compare prices at online and local
retail stores Yahoo is putting a new
twist on passwords you no longer have to
remember your password with Yahoo's new
on-demand passwords when you want to
login a short number code is sent to
your phone as a text message and that's
your one-time code to access yahoo
you'll get a different code each time
you log in in other news blackberry is
once again trying to woo the business
world with a tablet but it's not
returning to its old playbook instead it
worked with IBM and Samsung to create a
high security version of the samsung
galaxy tab s 10.5
five its modified with a security card
for voice and data encryption and
software separates work apps from
personal ones it runs Android not the
blackberry operating system and not to
be left out Microsoft is also making a
fresh push into the workplace with snipe
for business it's similar to the normal
consumer version of skype except it has
better security as well as control tools
for your company's IT department and it
also ties into microsoft office right
now it's just a preview version so it
could be a little buggy that your tech
