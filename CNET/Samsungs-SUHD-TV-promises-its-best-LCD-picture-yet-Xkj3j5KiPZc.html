Samsung's highest end LCD TV yet this
promise is the best picture quality
Samsung has ever produced in an LCD
based television the secret is
nanocrystals wrapped around the LEDs are
on the edge of this TV they allow the TV
to be a lot more efficient Samsung's
claiming a thousand nits of brightness
for some of the models as well as a lot
better color so it can actually achieve
very close to the DCI co space which is
a lot wider than your standard HD color
space of course it utilized that como
space you're going to need new material
but you know people own TVs for a long
time we do expect those color standards
to evolve to accommodate this television
the set is curved on the model behind me
this is an 88 inch model behind me but
the series is available in three
different series is one of which is flat
so you do have a large variety of screen
sizes and curvatures to choose from on
this model another picture quality
vonage the su HD TVs is local dimming
these TVs all have hardware based local
dimming to get that improved black
levels TVs also have a new screen filter
that is supposed to increase the ambient
light rejection to make the picture look
even better in bright light beyond the
picture quality su HD has Samsung's
highest end features including the quad
core and eight core processors depending
on which model there is they also have a
new Smart TV interface powered by the
ties and operating system Tizen is an
open-source operating system Samsung
saying the Tizen operating system is a
lot faster and actually allows the TV's
to have a lot simpler interface than
before of course these TVs have 4k or
you HD resolution the ability to stream
from 4k sources blue Netflix and Amazon
as well as a few exclusive Samsung
partners include direct TV comcast and
now M go which allows you to download
and play back you HD content from the
TV's themselves so then the content
selection is not very wide for 4k but
among these Samsung TVs that's about it
while you can get these days that's a
quick look at Samsung's su HD line of
televisions I'm David Katz mark from
