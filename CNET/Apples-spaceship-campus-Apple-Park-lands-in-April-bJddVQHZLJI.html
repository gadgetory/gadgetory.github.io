land in April 2017 the company's new
headquarters in Cupertino California
will officially be called Apple Park the
175 acre campus has been in the works
since 2006 when former CEO Steve Jobs
announced plans for the second Apple
campus construction began in 2014 and
there were plenty of drone pilots
rushing to capture flyover footage it's
been referred to as the spaceship campus
for some time because of the ring-shaped
main building the 2.8 million square
foot structure is covered entirely in
curved glass to honor Steve Jobs the
theater in Apple Park will be named
after him it's a 20 foot tall glass
cylinder with metallic carbon-fiber roof
that will seat 1,000 people an apple
park is said to be environmentally
conscious we have a 17 megawatt rooftop
solar installation the main building has
also been designed so no heating or air
conditioning is needed for nine months
of the year on top of being Apple's HQ
the campus will also have a visitor
center cafe and who would have guessed
it an apple store opened to the public
Apple Park will house 12,000 employees
that's a lot of people to shuffle over
from the current headquarters at one
infinite loop so the move will happen
over six months</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
