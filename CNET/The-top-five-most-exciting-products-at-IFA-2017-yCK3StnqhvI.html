Aoife tech showcase in Berlin and there
are five things have really stood out to
me
first up the LG V 30 this is a big
screen phone but it's got a tiny bezel
but it's really the camera where LG has
done its best work this camera has now
got f 1.6 aperture so it can take really
great low-light shots and there's a
whole load of video filters and colors
to play around with which could be a lot
of fun next up is Samsung's quick drive
washer now a washing machine might not
seem like the sexiest piece of
technology but when it promises to do
your load in half the time and with much
less energy wasted than any other
washing machine well that sounds pretty
exciting to me one of my personal
favorite innovations is actually the
Bluetooth that's built into the Motorola
MOTO X 4 it's the first time that we've
had Bluetooth on a phone where you can
throw your music to four separate
Bluetooth speakers all at once so you
can give yourself a whole room surround
sound system or share your audio with
you and your three fans on the train the
Moto X for itself doesn't particularly
excite me but I do really love the idea
of being able to listen to a podcast
with a friend on the train and still be
able to have our own set of headphones
rather than awkwardly sharing an earbud
each Sony's ex said one is another foe
who doesn't particularly excite me but
does have a cool feature this time it's
in the form of 3d face scanning with
this you can simply move your phone's
camera around your friends face and
build up a full complete 3d image which
you can then move around on screen or
even set as your wallpaper or if you
fancy throw it to a 3d printer and have
a little figurine of them print it out
for your desk not weird at all
and finally it's for neato BOTS of AK d7
now we have had plenty of robot vacuums
before but none quite as smart as this
with this one you can actually program
where the robot shouldn't go which is
great news if you have areas of your
living room full of cables for your
games consoles and TVs that you just
know a robot vacuum is going to rip off
your wall you can also order it to start
the hoovering using Google home Aleksei
or even facebook Messenger
which is pretty cool but it will come at
a cost at 799 dollars
so those are my top 5 picks from Aoife
this year but make sure to keep it
