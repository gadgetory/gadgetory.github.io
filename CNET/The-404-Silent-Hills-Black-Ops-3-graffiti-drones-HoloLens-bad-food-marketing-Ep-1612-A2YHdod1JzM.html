hey what's going on everyone welcome to
the 404 show on this friday may first
2015 to my left mr. ayahs akhtar how are
you sir welcome back thank you very much
to help welcome me back we've brought
Russ thrush dick longtime friend of the
show to the program on this friday
afternoon how are you sir I'm lovely
thank you new dad yes so I guess we got
to get that out of the way huh yeah
right it's I think it's sort of the
elephant in the room the baby open in
the room then we don't know the name
because I didn't report it you don't
know the nit well the audience doesn't
know the name I'm not sure ok the
audience know the name I guess facebook
and I didn't know if it was public or
not so I didn't say it on the show while
you were out fair enough my babies my
new son his name is Dylan mm-hmm he is a
strong child he's from families like
emotionally strong you mean yeah he's
emotionally strong yeah physically
strong because already walking around
that's awesome ice skating Wow and he's
actually learned to play the guitar as
well ok that's some dexterity for a baby
is that a full-size guitar like a
ukulele you don't know we're only doing
like a smaller you know ukulele sort of
situation less impressive as ukulele
you're right I know I must rings yeah I
mean the amount of regret I already have
as a parent is it's just completely off
the charts anyway uh I want to thank
real quick everyone so many people wrote
me emails and like sent me little love
notes and advice you know and and
everyone in the subreddit who really
took time to like give me you know
little hints and and like I said advice
and in words of encouragement I got a
lot of emails about you know people say
it was talking about naming the kid I
got from some really smart people around
the the country in the world so I want
to thank every single person who reached
out even if I didn't you know right back
to you I read everything and I
appreciate it and I thank you Stacy
Stacy and I thank you from the bottom of
our collective hearts because I guess
Dylan doesn't rhyme with anything gross
villain is cool Dylan there that's cool
Ilyn but it's not like everyone's with
fart no no no that would be the concern
yeah we weren't we weren't trying to do
fart
right rhyming names the smart book so
what I really actually wanted to talk
about real quick is the names that got
rejected so for the longest time so
Dylan was always on the list her Dylan
was on a very short list of about three
names the other names were Ethan okay
and Ethan Ethan's very hot right now
yeah that would be my concern is picking
the name and then you read that list
they release it and it's like oh these
are top 10 most popular baby names oh my
kid is like number two yeah that would
be Mike and that's really fun when
you're in a park and trying to call your
kid by name it's like seven kids turn
around yeah it's a real problem so Ethan
is like number six okay the last four
years that's how so I was like all right
you know like when we were growing up it
was like Matt right and my goal and
Michael her and and now I have 19 idiot
friends with that names yeah we're like
all right maybe let's go a little off
the beaten path so so um what else was
on that we were hobbled her Pablo was in
tahvil that's like Pavel Datsyuk of
course ah no we were thinking about
Tyler okay Tyler was on the list but I
feel like Tyler is making his way up
sure yeah i think in popularity gracing
maybe sure there's a lot of him i feel
like these are all pretty grounded names
was there like window was that one of
the options no spectacle spectacle
spectacle back alarm was uh was it was
up their soundcheck name with a
spectacle back alarm yeah that's a lot
of um willow so my my kind of like out
of the box suggestion that I still to
this day I'm open to and will change his
freakin birther w I really wanted to
Nate and people are gonna call me crazy
I wanted to name my son Jamie Jamie
Jamie that's what I want to do why is
that out of the box right oh so it's
it's historically a female name not
ignoring to a song of fire and ice
exactly Jaime Lannister right gene not
exactly the person you want to emulate
all right hello ji Kennedy sibling first
where to get weird sure uh Davey Kennedy
you got actually me Kennedy right Amy
Fox there's a hockey player jamie
langenbrunner Jamie's kind of Jamie's
quit isn't that short for James I was so
short for James um
I don't know where do you get to the
point where name because the first three
letters are the same right but it's like
some people named James are called Jimmy
mm-hmm you know so sure I think but his
name would have been James Jamie we've
been like Jay am I e right whatever okay
or whatever you didn't actually finalize
this matter well we didn't so yeah we we
didn't even finalized on Dylan until he
was about two and a half days old really
that's weird because we just called him
baby baby Bakalar weird Phoebe Phoebe
okay so yeah he for a while he was kind
of nameless huh hey you as you walked
into it oh this guy this is the guy
right here I know you but think about it
you know we were between it was like the
whole Tyler and they were like you know
there were things happening and and I
then then I see I save this to the end
and I made up I made a late game push
okay post-birth yeah I wanted him Corbin
cor wot ya after korben Dallas yes right
multipass yeah yeah didn't fly yeah
there was a happenin Oh Corbin did she
appreciate the reference uh I don't even
think she appreciated the reference no
see the second Corbin that I think of
was from major league burns Corbin
Bernsen which one that's right is that
it he plays Roger Dorn oh that actor
that plays Roger Dorn oh the shortstop
you was like he's like the dad on psych
right now okay no no I say okay major
week really come on door none of this
only shit that means April too early for
a Roger Dorn night that would have been
definitely a connection all right um
yeah well I wouldn't I wouldn't have you
know related to that but fine story if
it's past i'm sure this little kids
would have made a lot of corbin bernsen
corbin bernsen that's his name we go
real fan had they spell it cor bi n so
korben Dallas doesn't yeah hey oh he
does AKO and really obnoxious what I
would have done concerning a license
plate with that when you go to Disney
World right Corbin oh yeah additional
Corbin is this that's what
use the common co are bi n anyway shot
down that was really it that was like
the shortlist arm I feel like I had I
feel like I should be answering a lot of
you what names did you shoot down
because I'm sure Stacy had her own idea
no we're not naming this kid so we had
like a doc of names that were just it
was getting stooped right like there
were like 38 names and we had we had
narrowed it down to like five there were
she was hot on Teddy Teddy like Theodore
Theodore Theodore Bakalar but um I don't
know if you should necessarily name your
kid just for the nickname I know what I
mean yeah I got a friend of dude that
I'm not I'm not I'm not above it I'm
just saying what's good about Theodore
and teddy is that he has a lot of
options he does like he's going to hit a
seal yeah CEO is cool right uh there are
a lot of variations of Theodore uh what
else was she hot on we owe Blake Blake
Mackel are like what is he like a
villain and 80s high school band
alliteration rides a motorcycle like
bakalar and his gang of tough guys see
my whole thing is I kind of didn't hate
Blake but then I incidentally now think
of that uh that country dude Blake
Shelton and I'm just so turned off by
that D and now preppy evil kid is what
springs to mind from right and we
weren't gonna do any of those like Kyle
or sky later yeah we're in a Tyler but
not Scott Tyler will cuz Tyler you know
more gravity like cousins pretty badass
so durden would be an interesting name
yeah they're in bakalar you know durden
um it just sounds fun so yeah you you
somehow pulled it off with aldrin yeah I
named him Aldrin under the astronaut
yeah you guys I have a weird name and
his mom got a weird name her name is
Merlin Merlin ARL YN like the magician
no like I'm like Mickey Mantle's wife
and grandmothers name is Merlin yeah
there's a hot name like in the 40s or
something that's it sir grandmother's
name is Merlin and I guess Merle Merle
yeah Murtaugh tomorrow any are no girls
so we're like you know our name got
hacked to death in school she was called
Marilyn I was was called anything else
but I as I was called a as a lot which I
get with the Ian name because his I in
the front of course it's not like you
know what's up what's a cool name that
not like that everyone's gonna have and
it's actually gonna test the teachers
that the teacher doesn't know who buzz
aldrin it right the second man on the
moon that guys do basically designed all
the tests for every astronaut and every
like spacewalk there yeah they don't
know how to pronounce it maybe the kid
doesn't go to this school yeah right so
we went with aldrin it's like it's a
things at this second name first name I
came up with yeah I was good to the
alphabet my dog's name is Audrey after
the 3com Audrey the computer that nobody
knows about anymore that's a weird thing
to name a dog yeah she's not named at
Audrey I was thinking Audrey to from
Little Shop of Horrors I've you know
I've never seen never nobody FC nine
once then I can shut that up better
before anybody said sending me emails
about Little Shop of Horrors which is on
HBO now yeah Oh Jeff chat down on ethics
uh yeah I will see it again the names a
tough thing and and I really wasn't I
mean I did always liked Dylan from the
very beginning even when I was a young
kid I remember being all our genomics
with Dylan is one of character I don't
know why I always liked Dylan had
nothing to do with 90210 yeah it's just
bad st you wanted him named after a
perry then there's that weird fifth
element connection again with Luke oh
yeah Aziz light as he's like so yeah
that's the kid's name his middle name is
after his uh his mother's maiden name so
it's dylan davis back alarm very nice
there you have it that seems very common
these days well the middle name thing
very common you can't get oh you can do
whatever you want grace davis worked
because that can fly right I've heard
other attempts at doing that we're like
you just can't Oh middle name can't be
Friedman right you know I have heard the
opposite I've heard I know all kids with
middle names and the middle name is like
enormous and the last time it's like
enormous it's a nice little sandwich
yeah so yeah Herbert the birth was very
smooth okay quick let's get really
detailed you heard the whole story I
told Rosie did you actually left on that
Friday really oh I think we're having a
kid or something and he just left yeah
it was that actually the day of the
birth or so that was friday the 10th arm
it was she gave birth that night at 3am
so it's it was saturday the 11th is his
birthday we went to the hospital right
when i got home and the doctor because
she had called the doctrine
you gotta come in and we get there and
the doctor was like uh you know you're
just not there yet so we're like shit
what would we do uh and I was like be
honest with me like what she's like go
home and then just see what happens but
then around 11pm that night her her
water broke yeah and she was in only I
guess in true active labor for about
four hours which is luckier than yeah
lucky her is right but I was amazing
from like from that point where she was
in excruciating pain to like a little
baby crying out in the real world was
really that's sorta like roller coaster
like you know generally I guess I know a
lot of people it goes on for longer but
that is like sort of a rapid definitely
you could tell to like when all the
doctors and all the nurses are coming in
and they're just like you could just
tell like everyone's like oh this is
accelerator oh we're gonna wrap this up
like they're looking at the clock on the
wall and they're all like we're gonna go
for a record yeah like I remember the
nurse this nurse had kept saying to me
she's like by three don't worry by three
o'clock and sure enough nine after that
Joe Pesci is a nurse where you buy three
don't worry about it three o'clock this
kid's gonna be here you don't worry Oh
market so yeah that was it and
everything's been pretty good he's he's
a good man and uh I'm just uh yeah
everyone's talking about not having
sleep in uh and I've been sleeping okay
cuz he goes in these like for our spurt
and ice and what does the deal in terms
of breaking up that responsibility of
waking up and like dealing with him well
so Stacy's been amazingly generous with
that for the days that I've come in just
let me not get okay which is amazing
sure but I like a night like tonight
he'll wake up I change him there give
him the boob and then you're and then my
I'm pretty much done until the next time
of Christ right yeah so what Stacy also
has to get out well she's gotta feed up
right with her with her with her boo no
I understand so we kind of figured that
yeah so what do you weigh esta cuestión
yeah what am i what is directly
economical standpoint what are you like
she's getting up anyway yeah why do I
get up I mean to be supportive sure but
like an actual benefits shared misery
yeah you got a tag team in a little bit
i mean I'll be honest you know I almost
feel like I get better night to sleep
when I am getting up just now I'm just
being woken up by a crying baby right
I'm like sitting there and everything's
happening in the room and I might as
well just get up better sure I
understand you know so maybe between the
three of us yeah next week when I come
back for three days of the week maybe
I'll sleep in a different room or
something oh that's a good idea you're
gonna fall asleep on the couch yes Oh
have you considered so in in Peter Pan
they use the dog as a nanny I believe
it's even called nanny or nano perhaps
the sheepdog right have you considered
that as an option yes and Marty he's
he's up to the task okay it's amazing
what this dog is doing sure but the
amount of like instinctual sort of need
your things that have kicked in with him
yeah where he's just he's he's org I
know I'm like shifting your joke to like
reality right but he he he's like
genuinely interested and is very
inquisitive about that you do that hat
thing that I don't do it we did that um
and you know he's he knows he's like a
very delicate living share organism and
he's he likes to you know he's got a
couple licks of his head in which I
guess there's nothing we can do but he's
been looking I just got really small so
how did this go get to the level of the
babies yeah he's real small so how did
these only like 30 pen you're holding
the dog in one arm and no so here comes
up on the count your hold on her arm
heals just like and just give it a
little even fur to me insisted all right
I think it's dog lick oh no you thought
he's got spitting in his mouth I mean
he's licking his head what's right the
problem telling me for a baby yeah yeah
cuz when he has the like dog tongue
imprint on always ever ever it's not
like that like dad why do I have this
weird like dent in here so you you've
been through this you're how old your
boy is now he's almost 50 so he's like
an old manor yeah but uh amazingly
enough Dylan is like lifting his head
he's moving it around side to side that
toy every day of my life I know and you
do it real well no one ever applauds me
God knows how you do
top your shoulders there that doesn't
advance though because you have to do
like that tummy time tummy time he's
killing it already he's literally you
put him on his belly and he lifts his
head from side to side for a
three-week-old that's that's pretty good
right sure I don't remember you know
it's all a haze like all of this stuff
of like you're barely sleeping and then
there's like lots of books and there's
lots of apps they're like oh this is
what they're supposed to be doing it's
like I never like whatever happens he's
going to be outfit there's gonna be like
a VR solution for parenting pretty soon
where you just strap the helmet on the
kid and lick leave it for six hours and
it's like does education does mothering
and you're set well here's what I'm
surprised that they'll freak out when
you take it off right what is this horse
yeah oh my god well that's really what
happened because essentially the things
in the in the uterus for nine months in
this like super tight comfortable
apartment and then all of a sudden it's
like it's like when red gets out of
prison and he doesn't know what to do is
lie phonetic hanging it she doesn't know
knows no other life exactly and it's
such a traumatic transient read who's
read was who was the old guy that hangs
himself in Shawshank Redemption um I
know I knew what you meant was here I
knew what you was here it's just this
traumatic Japanese women and and
literally I look hi everything right so
you know you look at it and that the
most popular belief right now is that
like the the three months after its bone
for the Travis is the fourth trimester
where the kid came out just because it
biologically had to you know as a means
of like guru it still be in the pack
totally yeah uh or any other animal I
guess that can have a bigger uterus past
larger head and so that's the thing so
it's so weird so like he barely you know
his eyes move around but it doesn't make
eye contact he doesn't have real control
over vase in us yeah yeah he's a dodgy
little bastard you know with something
you slap them around and yellow cake but
yeah so this whole sort of like
gestation period outside of the womb I'm
surprised they haven't decided to like
pop on a VR on a baby just to recruit
just to continue that you know fetal
sort of experience you left
you smile it's like someone's gonna do
horrible ideas I like light well I'm not
I don't want to do it I get night lights
it's a solution that's like I don't know
what it looks in there but its pitch
black in there you wouldn't see it yeah
yeah I think we're like supposed to put
the kids like head near your heart so
can your heartbeat that's right but it
was picture like inner space but I don't
think it's like which is such a great
and like the infrared yeah right like
body Wars the right the disneyland move
it exactly that's that's that's
recommended you would really know a lot
of lighting if you went in there like
you need a lot of luck that's why you
get hue lights there you go no right you
know go red it's probably dark inside
your body but a hundred percent but i'm
sure there's parts where you can some
like yeah some transverses sure that's
true right an hour i don't know about
translucence in the uterus though how
many oh there's a lot of lady you got
like you've got amniotic fluid in the
way and so it's probably fluids clear
but that's it's goopy and it's gonna be
anyway I didn't want to get into the
party but like the matrix like hanging
in that thing how about this I'm not
gonna get Gurion you everyone wants to
know about the actual moment of birth
really everyone what's a nova that's
what everyone asked me I did you watch
oh yeah everyone's ass it's more a
question about you that is the actual
money they don't want the details this
is gonna know if I did you survive that
it is not as gross as you oh oh you were
you imagining like alien well no I had
seen that as much as you think i had
seen it like videos of it the way we all
do in middle school this was in higher
res this was an HD this is over H this
is over a super 8 k oled yeah this isn't
it's not as intense what I was and maybe
this is this is the most graphic I'll
get okay the umbilical cord ish is such
a magical sort of thing in terms of like
what it looks like like it looks like
somebody jilted and it's like a product
yeah it looks like fuck it looks like it
was made yeah just an wissen a product
awesome man Ralph Nader right god bless
that Ralph Nader well it doesn't it
looks like something out of alien like
my like cut like if you ripped it off
like they're the alien ship right like
the whatever a prop from a good day yeah
yeah like a Geiger oh so so yeah that's
where we'll
I guess we can now it's on your mantel
yeah now yeah we just let that harden up
the bronze it man it was crazy you know
it's just it's weird you know that he's
born he comes out and they put him on
this like you know warming table yeah
like where you put french fries sure
McDonald's post their fries yeah and I
just like put my finger and he just
grabbed it right and in love was like
the first thing he tells the first human
he touched well second night they all
had dogs oh yeah I was thinking about
Stacy there no she doesn't count cuz
that doesn't count for a while that's
why I still one am i touching my heart
right now are you touching it you know
you're touching your kidneys right now
come on well what no you mean like cuz
it was inside to you yeah I guess you
are but she I was the first thing he
grabbed well here's a question when you
guys have sex is she touching you is
effectively that's all we're talking

right let's let's let's uh turn the
tables towards Russ fresh dick oh boy
and this is something we got asked in
our subreddit as well I'm just going to
let you answer this okay uh so you you
you know you've been on the show since
you left polygon you've been doing a lot
of things what are you doing okay what
is fresh day doing so question week I
have been doing a lot of things over the
last six months um many different things
and I all I can really say and this sort
of sucks but I'd love to be able to talk
about it but in the very near future i
will be doing one specific thing which
is very very cool that I can't quite
talk about yet uh you dodgy son I know I
know but it's cool and and literally
within the next I would say two weeks
certainly also the timing of this
appearance on the show is perfect well
it would be perfect if I could actually
talk about it but I can't quite yet it's
a pre announcement but so suffice to say
you will be hearing if you care you will
be hearing about what I'm doing and I'm
very excited to be doing it it is not a
one hundred percent removed from what I
had previously been doing but it is
different as well so okay that's vague
yeah thats all right i'm gonna do a
thing that you might have done before
honestly this is just an excuse for Jeff
to have me back so I can actually talk
about it Charlie all right so you've
answered 0 yeah of the questions on my
sheet right but I guess I have no choice
but to accept that you can nod and smile
and appreciate my k genus alright and
the ability to move your head see that's
what's so intriguing about you you're
just this bundle of mystery right and I
guess that's what I'm that's what draws
me to babies are also vinyl mr. so me
and your baby we got along calm very
similar all right well guess we'll just
take that answer Russ fresh to gives up
to we don't know what but Helen
on sit very soon yeah that's exciting
yeah it's cool all right well you can
still talk a little bit about video
games I can't I can't i've been playing
a lot of video games so what have you
been playing so I've just been playing
destiny and that's it yeah no no no good
night everybody I don't know ah lets you
know what destinies I'm aware if you
don't play games at all I don't you
literally no better to me than Justin
was you don't know what capacities means
Justin knew nothing there are a good
game well like I know that destiny like
it basically is like a halo clone Angie
and I don't I know the story behind it
and like basically was kind of what's
the word lukewarm reception to the whole
thing and it's kind of on say pointless
but it's not amazing right is everybody
it's super exciting and everybody came
out was little this rocket scientist
still plays it over my head which I just
blows me that's what I know um so you're
still playing destiny my destiny amazing
kind of crazy that's because crazy and
crazy is accurate because I would
imagine only a person with severe issues
would continue to play this game as much
as yeah I don't think I don't play it
every day but I do play it I would say
certainly once a week cuz i have a group
that we play and it's fun for an evening
not an obligation that you play it's a
social thing I get that and it's not
like randoms like its actual people I
know and it's like a fun for that for
like the group activity it's a lot of
fun i could totally get if you're
playing solo I don't know what would
keep you playing for that long but yeah
I mean I've already spoken at length
about destiny of course totally get why
people aren't into it but it's cool so
what else gotten better what else you
finished blood-borne what you finished
it I Platinum's blood-borne what what
does I'm amania we know my trophy
achievement TX 0 for people who don't
know bloodworm was this amazingly
difficult difficult RPG relentless made
by the people that made Dark Souls and
demon souls and you you a hundred
percent yeah platinum did yeah how did
you do that I'm I'm good at video games
Jack Thomas it took me a really long
time just to finish just a beat the
cleric beast yeah well I will say he is
actually one of the hardest bosses in
the game I don't think they balanced it
right okay it like Peaks it took me
about twenty three times yeah he's
obscene n and the camera is all terrible
it's one of my least favorite boss
fights okay so for someone who maybe is
variant
by a game like blood yeah about your
amazing achievements as game what advice
do you have for those people um I would
say if you've never played a Dark Souls
game before feel free don't feel bad
about reading guides for the game
totally cuz you will get very frustrated
very quickly especially on boss fights
and the game is still really really
difficult even if you're reading guides
it's not like you're cheat and get
everything and you had to do that to
finish the game uh for parts there were
parts when I was like I have no idea
what I'm supposed to be doing and and
there were like helpful tips yeah I mean
it's a gorgeous game it's one of the
bring these games I've played it's
really the art style is like Victorian
crazy werewolves and I was just really
really impressed by it and I put the
crap at it for like three weeks how many
hours do you know cuz there's no timer
there's no time around it their crate I
hate no I don't know if there was um
although I've looked at my destiny timer
and it's just depressing what is it how
asked I look is it over a thousand hours
no no no i think around 400 400 hours
quick what does that equate to in days
and days i said 10 work weeks oh god
that's horrifying they should destiny
should be paying you they that is not my
new job uh so yeah i don't know i would
say probably like 40 hours that's not
too bright boy it wasn't crazy I you
know I'm ps4 they actually track rarity
on trophies so you can actually see
which trophies like a lot of people have
and and right almost no one has the
platinum trophy on blood-borne is not
crazy it's two percent that's actually
pretty high that is high for ya huh but
you know so you did it you and and and
you think anyone can finish this game if
they're self disciplined enough I think
there are a lot of people that will quit
just out of frustration but yeah
absolutely I it's actually I think it's
probably one of the easier of of the
three games definitely these I think
it's easy yeah all right very good III
is around the corner would you be going
to I am going to e3 you are yep no way I
booked like last week because of this
new thing okay up yeah
I got an Airbnb very close to the
convention center god bless Airbnb
because otherwise I'd be staying in una
del Rey we write nightmare and yeah so
that's very exciting that is very
exciting I'm III is a weird show this
will be my I think 14th oh my god which
is crazy um and I always like get a
dreaded part partially dreddit but
there's always a big chunk of me that's
like excited why did we not have like an
e3 bar mitzvah thing for you last year
that's a good question that's a very
common thing that people do is have you
free bar mitzvahs so really we should
have I mean come on if I come up with in
this chair right now yes oh man we're
doing it right now yeah love to do it at
the hotel figueroa alright so anything
already got your attention he's a weird
this year in particular is like very
weird because I I mean this like halo 5
you know games coming out it either
there's no games or there are games and
we just don't know about them but
honestly I think it's more the it's more
of a push away from like giant triple-a
and more indie and like smaller titles
and that's sort of why we don't hear
about because generally like those
titles don't get a lot of e3 play yeah
there will still be like the assassins
creed of course a and the I am kind of
curious to see if they can like save
that franchise we're just like really
like had a tough time I think we'll know
before e3 yes I think you're probably
right I the one game that I'm dying to
see and I honestly have no idea because
I've been expecting it for the last
three years is fallout no idea if the
new fall it's going to be shown at e3
but hopefully alright so I bring you
three up for two reasons one because I
think no game should ever have a release
date ever like what does that mean I
mean stop giving a game a release date
like until when I'm just say it so so
one day no nothing and the next day halo
5 news bear with me here okay I'm just
it's so crazy sure all of these games
yeah they get announced and they have
these lofty ambitious release date some
of them are like next year every single
games that's been released so far this
year yeah the big ones have all been
delayed okay sure so when you have like
one hundred percent
cross the board okay do you want a
snobby business reason for what they
know why I know that's I hate that
snobby business read I'd like to know
this not be okay snobby business reason
III is partially for the media and
partially to get PR attention yes but
the big real reason that it exists is
for buyers for me to buy up for a store
buyers so like gamestop sense the retail
guy to see all these games and the
retail guys like we need 5000 copies of
Assassin's Creed but don't you think
that model is like dying it is
definitely I mean it's it's a little bit
moot these days cuz like effectively you
could sit at home and get most of the e3
experience right so right you do not
only can you get the whole III
experience let's not forget that you
know those brick and mortar stores are
quickly coming around well but still
amazon I'm sure has a buyer and right
amazon as a buyer but i mean i don't
know who are you that I guess there's
still a reason to own a physical copy to
sell it back but here's what i will say
in defense of e3 why I'm glad it still
exists is because this one party get
drunken that's a good reason games need
a week it's the only wake of the year
where from i from obviously this packs
and obviously those games come but in
terms of like broad media attention it
is the only week of the year that broad
media attention points its direction at
games right put the spotlight puts a
spotlight on so the in the years when
they made like a small thing in santa
monica or whatever it was like a much
larger area it was a drag because it was
like there was not that level of
enthusiasm across the whole world about
this cool new thing um so I like III for
that purpose but I agree a lot of the
reason that exists has gotten a little
bit stodgy and may be unnecessary boom
you know it's cooled at the spot all
right well there were some news earlier
in the week that the game silent Hills
yes um was not going to be exact which
is really weird because I don't think
you had remember that I remember the
whole PT that was that was that that was
a meaty yeah and they took that trailer
download and they took the game off the
store wasn't a trailer it was a playable
playable teaser piece of tedia teaser
true but that's the game that it was
teasing is not coming Jack cancel right
this week so why not just keep the
teaser around a great that's a good
question so the backstory is essentially
Konami which
published the game had this deal with
hideo kojima who was like they're
they're all star boys metal gear metal
gear he made all sorts of their biggest
games basically had like a very unhappy
split what happened I don't know I don't
know intricacies of it but let's I mean
this is not the first time that like a
Japanese developer the guy who created
Megaman had a big split with capcom
barry recently essentially a lot of
these Japanese developers that are known
for these huge titles are sort of moving
away from the traditional Japanese
culture as you get into a company and
you stay there for the rest of your life
right and it's like your parent and is
it right that's all that matters and
these days like there's a level of
globalization happening in Japan where a
lot of these like Rockstar developers
are like you know what I don't need to
do this I have a lot of cachet I'm gonna
leave and do my own thing and make
whatever game I want right and and my
guess is that's a lot of what's going on
here um but yeah it you're right it's
like it's like the band detaching
themselves from the record label right
essentially or a lead singer saying like
screw you guys i'm i'm the star right
the wedding Justin from NSYNC that's
Justin Timberlake and sink I mean in
sync and say I was thinking do you think
about Zack attack which is a lot of
thing when Zack got a big head and left
it blows my mind though is I don't
believe there was ever a more successful
whether or not it was deliberate more
successful viral sort of campaign for a
game in recent memory I mean Petey
knocked it out of the freak I love
Holly's for that halo thing right like
oh yeah i was amazed it knocked the game
was amazing the whole experience was
amazing the buzz that was organic design
how did three game for me last year it
was a demo for a game that doesn't exist
it's crazy and it's really upsetting
because like I'm sure there's a lot of
people that in the next year will buy a
ps4 and there's no way for them to
download the game right interesting
point though if you have already
download the game and for whatever
reason you want you need to delete it
for space or something like that you can
still redownload it if it's already in
your library great news such I've done
so there you got it you can still but
there were people people on ebay there
are people on ebay selling ps4s with PT
install that crazy that's awesome funny
because I don't know that you can play
it unless you're signed
to the account of the person that's all
right you would have to have like a
dummy account and just sort of rabbit
for that ebay but it's a bizarre
situation it's a shame because like I
don't care about silent hill I've like
honestly really I was never a fan of one
man choice I mean come on I mean they're
too scary for me is the real all the
cracks about they are there to scare
when you go back it's like Jesus Christ
I'm sure but like when I played it Simon
Hill too especially like I played it in
college this guy had like giant stacked
speakers in this tiny little dorm room
and the room would shake whenever like
triangle man whatever pyramid pyramid
head exactly came through the door with
a giant sword night frequent it Mia yeah
it's your scary so it was too scary for
me to play through amisha I spent ten
minutes and I quit right and but PT was
the same way but I totally appreciated
how brilliantly designed it was the
first person the like playing with your
mind the like did I see that didn't I
see that stuff it was just like really
well done so good and and there was like
a cool meta game with it with like
people trying to figure out how to get
to the end and so it is disappointing
like we didn't know what Simon Hills was
going to be we didn't even know if it
was going to be first person like that
but there was an indication they were
trying something new right that wasn't
about like oh I found the crosspiece
that unlocks the random it wasn't like I
like really obtuse puzzles um so it did
feel like they're trying something new
it's a drag that's not happening but
that's what blows my mind so like here
you have Konami who is clearly aware of
the runaway success that this buzz yeah
was responsible for and they had
guillermo del toro catch they had Norman
Reedus from The Walking Dead attack so
where do they get off just dropping this
I mean again it has to do we have no
idea what happened in those boardrooms
been who owns the rights to sound hell
it's gonzo nom nommy owns the rights the
franchise yes so why not just outsource
it if you're upset with Kojima I just
don't get starting from scratch you
could be 23 years from releasing this
what do you think that game is coming at
any time soon I mean I don't know it I
don't know how much work was done on it
it's crazy just I I'm more personally
just I think their concern would have
been if they didn't say anything
certainly he would have left and they
would had to comment on it and it could
have been like shadow
what is it the dragons gone last
guardian where it's like what the hell
what is happening just tell us what's
going on um and like whatever I'd rather
know that it's cancelled and like have
it just floating of course I want to
know it's cancelled but I'm beyond upset
yeah it's a drag it's it's a bunker and
then real quick black ops 3 oh yeah so
you're a big college udah guy you ever
play the quality games and once or twice
and then I got sucked and I'm like I
have to stop playing oh because you're
worried so you're the guy who tries out
crack cocaine and never ever does
anything okay that's why I was like okay
this is awesome i have to stop right
fair enough so black ops 3 is which is
the treyarch side of a bone Treyarch
side of the development of the duality
that is called duty between well it's
not a duality it's actually a
triumvirate so it's a tribunal a
tribunal so is that infinity water
damage hammer and now Traore arc
treyarch yeah let's call March as you do
it everyone singh and they are now
taking black ops 3 right and it seems
like it's a future game it is why we
don't need that so that was my reaction
too is that I was a little bit bummed
because black ops 1 was one of my
favorite games of the franchise without
a doubt and one of the reason was it did
this really cool thing where it blended
fiction with reality she's great where
you like switching IFK and they were
tying in historical Morse Gump version
yeah and then black ops 2 although i
love the multi-point in black ops 2 the
campaign was kind of a disappointment
because it's like future and like silly
like drone magic stuff and like it just
felt very removed from the core of the
franchise and now we're getting and and
then advanced warfare came out last year
is actually a really good game to game
you liked it a lot but it does feel like
I mean we're titanfall destiny uh you
know advanced warfare like every shooter
these days has been near future or you
know a hundred years the future it's
just it feels a little bit um you know
like I'm done with right I don't
understand why every sits like every
single game has this thematic sort right
and I mean look I haven't even played at
an event where people like check that
out firsthand I was not
the event so I don't necessarily want to
judge and i will say that treyarch on
the whole makes my favorite call of duty
games of of the three companies that
make them so I've a lot of faith I think
it's going to be a good game my chief
concern is like is this going to be able
to separate itself from advanced warfare
enough to be its own thing right and
they are doing some some things that are
a huge departure for call of duty in
general specifically regarding this hero
idea when the play is a specific
character that has like super abilities
that almost feels like destiny it
inspired or whatever or even like a MOBA
inspired with their these characters
that have like unique abilities they
clearly needed to breathe new life into
the specific gameplay but I think
keeping that futuristic thematic sort of
thing in the background is really making
it tough yeah I don't know I mean it
just I just want a little more variety
and I get them wanting to sort of wrap
up their trilogy that they've been
working on for the last seven years
right um and they again look like
they're doing some interesting things I
just yeah kind of want more variety from
my time periods like there's so much
rich stuff they could have done in the
70s and 80s and they just kind of moved
away from it yeah I want a Vietnam one
or even like 90s like yeah like just
whatever let's go retro a little bit
there was a Vietnam one by the way is
called world at war oh that's right it
wasn't what you want a gulf storm one is
anything I mean there's just a lot of
cool stuff you'd like touch where
there's like an assassination mission to
take out Saddam in the middle there's
cool stuff you can do there and they
kind of scanned a while they just moved
on and they they touch down a little bit
black ops 2 but I don't know the other
thing I would say is advanced warfare I
played a ton of call of duty it kind of
surpassed my ability as a multiplayer
call ya yes the first game I was like I
can hang it was just it was so fast and
there's people zoom and everywhere and
there was I just couldn't keep up with
it and I think people miss that and it
was nice to have that balance where you
would have that with the cult with the
advanced warfare / ghosts one and then
things were may be grounded a little bit
more in playable reality with writing
sure you are yes so uh you know I don't
know I I'll definitely play it and I
definitely am looking forward to it it's
just sort of hope they bring that
variety
right okay I as you can talk again thank
you let's let's switch gears a little
bit and we're gonna keep it at that
email so i just wanted was everything ok
well yeah it's just work stuff so I'm
just talk about it now ok what he say
sure I do this thing called net picks
and we release information about what's
coming out of amazon itunes us other
stuff and i got an email from the guy
guy at tribeca film festival because i
had the wrong date for I am big bird no
no it's terrible because I'm really
psyched about seeing I'm big bird know
both the trailers yeah big bird I am big
bird in the metarie it's going to be
released on the same day as theaters as
it's released in theaters on itunes on
May 5th not the 8th like I had in there
no it's like I've corrected it right now
like why you guys were talking
everything to make sure that that
information is accurate also I really
want to see the movie so it's all
documentary about the person inside big
bird there's been the original Big Bird
and Oscar the Grouch from the very
beginning is 85 years old yes you and
he's both of them yeah it's crazy like
if you want to talk but don't they talk
to each other yeah there's scenes with
both of them right but he's the guy I
know but yeah well I get it but is he
talking to both he's tall I haven't seen
the documentary and exactly I usually
when they don't know that he'll write
and they reveal Muppet stuff I usually
look away I don't want to see it oh I
like little when I saw I understand when
I saw this guy talking as big bird with
his hand moving in the air and you hear
the voice and he's like 85 or it was
just like oh no like he's really old
yeah this is in apparently the story
covers when Jim Henson dies and it's
gonna be kind of sad I said he them
wrong I don't think that he does
day-to-day big bird I think he might
come in for special events and do a dr
Freddie's 85 is that no way he's got an
understudy at that point is like he's
watching his every move is like his uh
but the voice is always in it's always
him is when he must just do a dr if they
don't i don't know who's in it day by
day it's not like they're gonna do it
like Yankee Stadium were they like keep
recordings of the Nexus they might say
every word ever times like sneakers and
they just like versus lines but let's be
honest how much shit as Big Bird said
over the years always the same game for
here's a like it's crazy there was it I
read an interesting thing about the
character were initially he was just
like a hobo he was like a hick character
that was his thing big bird yeah and
what Crouch was the hobo know it that
that was the original vision for big
Berbers just like he was a country
bumpkin and it sort of morphed into just
him being like a very large child right
also a bird right he does kind of walk
around like he's got some little aimless
injury the imaginary-friend
snuffleupagus was an imaginary friend
for a while wait is he not on the show
anymore no he says he is but they
eventually made him a real thing as only
big bird could see stuff although he was
a hallucination Richard it like there he
is the ayahuasca thing right how do you
not see a giant hairy elephant yeah but
ya know snuffaluffagus I will say my
enthusiasm for documentary even though I
am interested is a tempered a little bit
or tainted a little bit by the ELMO
documentary right yeah what ended up
happening there cuz i saw the oma
documents goes good documentary was good
the documentary was good but it it does
but they so memory of it a little bit
stop you contain if you I hate you but I
think the problem with the ELMO
documentary is that it was not a good
documentary because they seem to not
uncover a major section of it that's
supposed to be like investigative
journalism I like have a sit-down joke
tell me elmo tell me about your horrible
past oh god it's so it's upsetting it is
and it looked like you can't watch The
Cosby Show now can't watch anything
anymore well that's another that's
another ganteng issue yes I didn't want
I wanted to watch that show my
girlfriend I'd never seen the show had
never seen Cosby yeah man still watch it
it's not you can pretend that it's okay
no you can't know everything is way way
dirtier now when he's mean I still watch
ghost dad okay yeah that's a messed up
movie is that inspiring you as a diet
dad you know that how you're racing the
congos as it goes baby sector yeah for
sure that's good that's the idea yeah
I'm glad that you can you can figure
that out and be a ghost dad was I saw in
the theater you blew that I think I did
too i think i went to stop or my mom
will shoot instead oh nice who with the
golden girl I stallone and the old girl
I still get it get it yes
and um all right so I'm glad you got
that taken care of it's done uh I it's
called what is it I am big bird I'm big
bird all right sort of i am legend but
with big bird right when I apocalypse
only 18 foot bird survive okay what's
this oh you threw in a few stories here
that I want to get to what's this about
the good food and needing better
marketing yeah there's some kind of like
research where you know you want your
kids to eat healthy stuff and so this
these guys actually put menus together
and they kind of use the same marketing
techniques that you would with you know
junk foods so in the menu they expertly
little happy emoticons next to healthy
healthier items and turns out kids
actually this kind of respond to that
they constantly started ordering because
it's somehow animated it's got a little
happy face next to and something called
a Power Plate if you order a Power Plate
you get a little prize with that so if
you incentivize a kid by simple things
like that you can actually eat them to
eat healthy like I don't have trouble in
my kid to eat healthy is like french
fries and he loves treasures in Treasure
vegetables they're fine yeah they're
perfectly fine there's a fry's never any
they're dynamite this they are dynamite
said unsurprising was also that you can
incentivize a kid to do pretty much
anything a lot of con they're all
speaking of like the wrong thing to do
with healthy food I feel like McDonald's
is spiraling out of control well they're
they're like the total opposite they
realize that they're on the opposite end
of like this big push to go healthy and
go organic and so like all their
commercials these days are just like
here's this raw chicken right that we
made in an artisanal raw chicken house
then there's just lying i engineered
whole wheat bread right and that's it
that's the whole sandwich and so they're
trying they're trying but you talk about
a brand that is has such an identity
crisis don't they own are they like part
of the Chipotle thing I don't know if
they're connected and he may say own
Boston Market about enough they entrepot
because that's the that's what the trick
I mean coca-cola's certainly mastered
that because they owned i believe
vitamin water um air pep yeah i think
it's down by the water and that's the
trick right is you have this brand and
who knows how long the brand the last so
you have the low end whatever fast food
brand and then you have like oh I want
something quote I mean for a while like
chipotle with
considered like a little bit healthier
it probably is more healthy than I mean
if you get a burrito you get a
deconstructed burrito probably they're
healthier in what way I mean McDonald's
and like I can be not as proximity
unless process but you haven't like what
2,000 cash days we can wrap out you're
not having only having 1800 sorry I
don't know about that a lot of calories
a lot like a deconstructed burrito bowl
without sour cream and cheese like 800
is maybe not 1600 can get it does mike
mcdonald is so made for kid like that's
his vice create design friends be happy
meal right because I sent your salt yeah
sugar and like hot I always got honey
with my nuggets you got Oh like honey
mustard no just like honey honey you can
get that in like a little cup and I was
oh my god see I've a lot of that was
finish on I think I have a lot of
pent-up regret about my childhood and
mcdonald oh just because you know I I
definitely think my parents knew like
okay this clearly isn't the best food
should be giving our children but like I
McDonald's once a week okay for a while
as a kid as a kid okay and I'm not so
what's your regret that I did that that
you as a child chose the McDonald wasn't
chosen your I was so chemically addicted
to it the fact that I knew like
wednesday night I was going to get
McKnight was like too much for my little
brain kids I mean they're driven by
candy and sweets and stuff they like
like in summer camp suites are like
currency like candy is like her ya know
for cigarettes of kids right totally
I've been in prison these days they
trade those honey buns there's articles
about how they trade honey buns as
currency it's like Oh a pack of
cigarettes just three honey buns like
this are yes something like that's
insane but you have when you you like
keep if you can just keep track mentally
of like all the weird McDonalds
commercials you see weird they are just
completely off into petaluma california
one no I don't think I like in this
small town things are a little slower it
seems like it looks already like a
parody it's like an old man making an
egg sandwich yeah and it's about this
little town pedal down with California
which I lived in for a couple of years
now really people don't know this town
it's 40 miles north of San Francisco why
on earth are they talking about pedal
than we
California that got my attention I'm
like where's that where is the
McDonald's in petaluma california
showing nice part of town and that towns
got the schizophrenic thing going it's
got like really nice parts and like
sketchy parts yeah and they're like
right next door to each other constantly
so it's it's really odd and like oh it's
in the little shopping center with that
giant parking a lot by the luckys which
is a grocery store out there so the part
of town they show in the commercial has
is nowhere near the mcdonalds at all
because that's on the other side of town
which is all new construction which
there are 16 people nodding their heads
right he's exactly yeah Calif Petaluma
California does not look like that
commercial at least not the mcdonalds
party they they are due Eyres they doing
these really weird like pop culture
cartoon commercials too and you're just
like man they're trying forget it guys
we know you use you know you're just
lean into being unhealthy and gross
right as everyone else is doing
something different because like oh
you've been eating k all day great kick
back and have a big mac like been
burgers they know they need to just go
back and be like mcdonough slogans you
just be like mcdonalds fuck it right
that's that's that's an idea made this
stuff tastes they didn't say like just
follow your taste buds kind of things
I'm picturing like working for the
weekend playing yeah and then it's like
it's like a little motion death row and
nuggets and fries in his face McDonald's
fucking right I should make a million
it's a mess right now it's true dude
like just just you know embrace it
embrace it that you're filth yeah
because you got companies like sonic it
clearly don't given oh yeah it's not
like it's totally doing Sonic's just
like hey we marry her one way and you
know all these companies that are just
like whatever embrace it and even Taco
Bell like Taco Bell remarkably talk
about remarkably is is winning the
breakfast Wars yeah of breakfast
sandwich man for that freakin crunchwrap
yeah you know what this thing doesn't
the other ones don't have they don't
have a hash brown in it right and
exactly I've had one of these yeah I'm
gonna do you have I would try to watch
what are they like they're horrible is a
bad or grease and grease obviously super
process I mean even an egg mcmuffin
doesn't taste as bad as this like
McDonald's burgers on
I'm saying like actually like McDonald's
tastes healthy compared to the taco bell
crunchwrap thing well I like I just
there's something that rubs me the wrong
way about their whole breakfast defector
campaign the pseudo Russian where I'm
just like guys we're talking about a
three dollar breakfast sandwich but
that's a big part of their like if
people aren't showing up before noon
yeah a lot of audience true missing it's
true make sense man all right the
breakfast sandwich wars continue let's
uh let's talk about the hololens real
quick so there was a Microsoft build
event earlier this week that I kind of
got a little bit of I was still on
paternity leave but what happened yes
what happened we had two guys f from
seeing that there and for the demos they
actually had Nick statt and Nate Ralph
build apps to see how easy it is to make
apps for the hollow lens and then they
actually got to try it out and have that
go apparently it was super easy and Nick
was saying like he wants one like his
article of leads off I want one it's
what I want one because the hardware is
actually like the demos it kept showing
like a little demo unit the first one
they tried out when the original showed
the hololens they compared to something
that you'd see the optometrist office
okay but this one's actually the slick
version her manager it's ready to go it
looks like and they said something like
they got to try to feel like 90 minutes
and then they start charging it because
for me I've been thinking about the
hololens yeah it's really cool looking
but how long is it gonna survive if
they're completely enclosed it's like
it's not meant to leave the house though
that that's right because they're
claiming like it's it's the people move
not devices that was the thing with bill
but looking at this thing I mean I
wanted to work I want to be able to put
this stupid thing on my head and look at
there's a TV over there wherever
whatever apps are going on but then you
turn your head away from it versus like
a google glass which is always there
yeah but it's still there yeah i mean
you turn your head you're still wearing
a hell no i'm not talking about I'm
probably screen being a frog oh I olivet
is it like pop on my head attached to a
drone that the end but that's what I'm
talking about with that yeah I just
haven't good there's nothing that I
could see in a hollow lens that would
like give me a great reason like I don't
know what the argument is the whole
apartment I've a small apartment I if
they had an interactive video game where
I didn't have to get
sure and I could like play a game on my
lap if you did that make sense where I'm
like looking down at my lap when I
rather like augment like an oculus style
like I mean that's effectively um it's a
dif different you know that's it's
different isn't much is different all
this is augmented we're feeling really
right it feels like augmented might be a
little more limiting in that sense
though if you have to deal with like
physically what's in the space yeah the
hololens is a deliberate hallucinogen
you know sort of thing we're like you're
seeing things in the world right where
it seems cute vr is just you're entering
another one holland seems like a cute
thing it doesn't really feel like a
product that people like i would buy
whereas a tonight i wasn't i don't get
not sold on it yet d you should read
what these guys wrote it is convincing
but again and where and how far out is
this oh I don't know there's no release
date for this thing every time they show
it off the the the prototype changes
like yeah severe when they've shown the
same style the super slick version on
stage and the thing that they actually
get the guy's a demo was different yeah
now it's actually the same okay it I
mean if what i like about microsoft and
this is the phrases that people don't
say very often they got some really
crazy crazy ideas i mean this this
shouldn't work and then the connection
of water didn't for a while connect us
can you fit the idea of it they like to
say like we're not gonna do motion
control without a controller right look
PS but Sony did what the move after the
wii was already right failure let's put
a little ball on top of a controller
like total fail its idea of like don't
use a controller I think it's gutsy I
just I can't believe that they're the
ones trying it yeah I mean yeah I think
you know they did they were doing like
surface stuff for a while metal surface
not the tablet this sir the table yet
attainable types though probably you
know they don't get it you know twisted
these guys have a crapload of money yeah
that they probably just devote 2 r.d on
a lot of weird still right the quite the
question is once you the hardware gets
out once it's released is it
traditionally Microsoft products tend to
be bogged down by bureaucracy and like a
feature jam like every department needs
a little feature in the pride right are
we
seeing a new Microsoft which is like
more clean straightforward you know and
obviously Windows 10 will be a big part
of that but like traditional like they
just in recent years have just gotten
more and more bloated and like tied to
well this is our overarching message
from Microsoft and everything needs to
fit inside this box and its really held
them back people are annoyed by their
branding like yeah they're a box
ecosystem is annoying to people I don't
know why they're still using the live
tiles on Windows 10 I think people hate
it yeah um I could be dead wrong but I
don't know it just seems like a step
like they're just leaning into something
that everyone didn't like and just
screams windows 8 to me no no no what to
see yeah but yeah that's that jeronne
graffiti it's a thing jeronne graffiti
this is this very cool this is kind of
awesome what's this guy's name his name
is katsu right he's a guy that if a show
oh he catches a big he's a big graffiti
art back in April I'm familiar with it
then you'll be familiar with what he
does later so he actually tasked a spray
paint can to a drone a while ago Naples
showing that off he was doing demos on
canvases like hey look what I can do so
what he actually did fairly recently I
was Wednesday night apparently he
brought a drone with the spray paint can
to houston and broadway and defaced a
Calvin Klein's jeans add these spray
painted red lines on the face of kendall
jenner area she's the model just across
the lines there and he says he's going
to kind of release this information out
to other people so if they want to do
this they can have their own drones do
graffiti so let me ask is it is he
directly controlling it while he's doing
the graffiti or is it like he runs a
program and it like follows like a
pattern yeah I would imagine I just
judging from the end the end result of
what it looked like yeah uh no I would
say it's just him is dead he's a seventy
percent of the cut of the concentration
is in maintaining this equilibrium with
the two-dimensional surface you're okay
anything so he's doing a lot of the word
to take this thing so like he's doing ms
pit like your painting with like a mouse
it looks like new employment yeah but
both like a 3-axis sort of thing in one
hand and then like sure it's crazy so
the thing that's weird too is I'm and
I'm sure he had a like
the can a little bit too all right with
your own i guess because you can't just
spray probably wobble it right that's a
saying you can't just sprawl though when
you should spray picking you really got
a mighty master did to spread like pre
shaken and send it up because you can
see the way his stream came out like it
sort of fizzles out and then he he did
something rich this is really cool and
the thing that's cool but you know in
the world of graffiti like you know all
these guys care about is getting as high
up as they possibly can it's sort of
like breaks the it kind of breaks some
of that enthusiasm right cuz right oh
you go to top of our shooting it's a
gating essentially but catches is pretty
well respected graffiti artist um it's
nate his stickers are all over Manhattan
you'll see him you know you know this
reminds me of is in demotion man when
Edgar friendly has that yes same thing
that comes out of the ground exactly
right this may have like the anti thing
that takes off the guy there to over
there you go was it the wall tickets
right back zapped it yeah this is really
cool though youtube video out there too
if you want to see it actually work I
mean this is ballsy though it's ballsy
and yeah I mean it's a well it's open
it's pretty massive and think about it
like you know it's real easy to get
caught doing graffiti now I'm like you
people know who it is like the his real
name and like katsu ya know I believe
he's anonymous okay cuz you could
theoretically like if he makes a big
deal i get arrested right of course man
even after the fact of course you not to
do this right what most graffiti is not
sanctioned no i understand i'm just it's
just interesting this is the videos
crazy just to see this little flying
near the base it's really awesome it
this is my favorite thing the week um I
wonder how it's like other people gonna
be doing it right but like for me if I'm
one of these guys I'm like man this is
just the beginning this is gonna get
really good and then I don't even need
to like be the guy who's gonna get
pulled down off the off the building
it's just my drone right you know who
have they gonna trace me right this is
you could be on a building free block is
quite amazing I'll be in an apartment
across the street no one would ever know
you have less credibility though you're
like well you did one this drone
graffiti guys don't do regular yeah I
mean there was that drone the crash on
the White House lawn like I don't right
they find the guy who did that I don't
know I don't even know I don't know but
will this strip cred from graffiti
artist you'll have to talk to the banks
I have no idea yeah i'll be sure to call
him I'm gonna tweet at him and see what
he says yeah you know he's the he's the
guy he is the guy he's their biggest guy
it's great document it is okay that does
it for stories we have a few minutes
left for some stuff from the subreddit
it's mostly you know trivial sort of
stuff but nevertheless is a few tidbits
I mean they don't knock this up amazing
so people actually bothered right combo
they're like oh thanks for writing so
here's the thing so we're gonna talk
briefly about Avengers 2 you saw right
no I'm not we didn't I haven't seen oh
you didn't see me okay so then we got
out yet no but there's been screenings
yeah this week some people are slobs I
thought you were going that's a whole
long story alright well first one comes
from misfired neurons this is a very
relevant question for any NHL playoffs
yeah do they take you away from the baby
or the other way around this is directed
me to Paris Lee uh this no this has been
the greatest thing ever had the Devils
in the bio doesn't which is great
because it doesn't I'd be a man by n
right but now that i have no horse in
this race i can watch it and just be
enjoying it here and lets you note of it
the sport of it and the first couple of
nights he was born two days before they
started right so as soon as they started
on Wednesday the fifteenth and when they
end he'll be 15 years old because I
think so goddamn is a lot but like you
know he'd be up all night and games go
on to like 2am clear the west coast
right so this was like our house dust a
manner yeah yeah starting every night at
seven there's seven hours of games right
so it's great yeah so I'm not ignoring
my baby he's in one arm I mean I'll tell
you what he's already seen about 25
which is amazing i got the the record
for that but yeah it's uh it's been good
for Julie blue mine like yeah you really
want icing is everything uh are you guys
excited for Avengers 2 we didn't talk
any anything about it this this uh this
week I'm seeing it on saturday i think
at 1030am because I'm an old man I have
it all planned out yeah what's come out
today hey come essentially today today
um i'm not i don't know i'm torn cuz i
like the first one I didn't love it um I
just feel like as these movies go on and
the stakes get higher and higher and
we're dealing with like giant purple
guys with super-powered rings and bah
blah blah that's where it loosely miss
Dennis Nelson I understand but that's
where it loses me I'm more interested
like I the the spirit of that last scene
in the shwarma house Avengers one is
what keeps me interested in those movies
is like the very grounded human funny
moments of those movies I enjoy and then
once it gets into like the action stuff
it's just like such cg insanity that I
just I'm not as engaged with it and it
feels like as these movies will progress
they'll just get more and more and more
cg insanity which is why the Bama news
are so good yes because they're not
heavily reliant on thur woman's poopy
their long but who's still good it was
good it wasn't was an amazing but like
you know even the the batman vs trailer
which looks like dog shit yeah like that
movie is clearly gonna suck balls yeah
and it's because it's not it I still
think the reason all of those great
Batman movies and I say Oh Batman
because Batman's the only one were they
like kind of grounded in reality and
sunk about the characters the characters
very much grounded so for me that's what
it was that's why for me the first Ninja
Turtles movie is so goddamn good because
it's like it's still real yeah and I
know people are gonna say like oh you're
just an old man and cg turns you off
full no and it's not only that like
you're not the only one cuz obviously JJ
Abrams feel the same way because they've
been the new Star Wars it's like very
traditional sure don't his Star Trek
movies are great like that it's
interesting that all the CG talk because
Nolan hate cg anything you do
practically he does and so I mean in
session had a good amount of it oh yeah
I'm it's Alvin to you it's happened a
little bit whatever you do practice but
he does it he tries to hide it though
which is good in the sense where this is
like images or Avengers is just like the
Avengers movies are like the summer
things that happen in Marvel Comics
anyways if you want the grounded stories
you watch the individual one so like
Captain America the last one like it was
a famous a political talk a few slices
like an open grounded until a giant what
is this guy
ship came into the granite the last
captain america on aim in the sky were
shooting lasers I have to do that okay
that despair those me I like the first
and is also like that it just could sort
of like this you guys the Fox universe
and the Fox universe of it's like all
ground with fantastic 4 and X I'm more
interested in x-men to be on like the
last name with a we accelerate look I
didn't want to be Silver Surfer after
log is like a flying dude with this yeah
with a surfboard that's him but yeah I'm
excited that's the thing Marvel's cosmic
side is all over the Avengers because
the only thing that could take on the
Avengers it's got to be ridiculous
that's why on earth would you need these
five or six people you got the Hulk and
you've got Catherine's you're saying a
nemesis would have to be so
oversensitive yeah why is it like it
should be like why does it take all of
you just want of you like you right one
of you to take care of this just be like
irony what could the Joker due to the
Avengers that do like see I really
matter they chopped his head off like
instantly by Thor's there's like I'm a
god so and that's the issue is like you
just the scale gets so outlandish that's
right and that's why Superman movies
have a hard time succeed and that's why
the only good time I don't worry
whenever well there are a few consumer
imitate the messenger but the best one
was the one where he lost those powers
and was a human being in like it was
this pretty good so on the end of which
one was that three it's too it's too
okay it gives up his power what do you
mean the whole movie is great with Zod
sure sure sure you never saying what
that end mr. work is they get shot into
space as a crystal the super can the
mirror he knocks out Lois's men i don't
think that ruins the whole when it would
be yes I'm about getting she was pretty
good i will agree feelin yeah I just uh
but that's the thing he needs to have a
challenge right we've talked so much
about how much Superman sucks but I
think more with the Avengers is like I
because of all that I am so disenchanted
with anything Avengers like I would only
see Avengers because every now and then
I like Robert Downey jr. being a wasn't
right and robert downey jr's a grounded
character and if they did from what I
understand about hawk i right that's a
character hot guys in America his comic
iteration is like a very grounded like
schlubby character that would like be
interesting as well so like that's what
I want to see out of these movies and
like I was hoping that ant-man would be
a little more like that but a man
trailer looked like crazy and watch it
what is that is what's the take on that
it looked I don't seen the trailer
either goofy I it was originally going
to be directed by what's-his-name from
uh yes scott pilgrim met director that's
good but he moved on it supposed to be
like a true comedy with Paul Rudd and
now it just feels like it's they're just
bringing more into this like giant
mammoth Avengers universe and I don't
know just need bright bring the stakes
back right that's something to like that
I i think they constantly are just so
over the top even with this crossover
stuff it's just like you realize when
you blow your load like that there's
nothing you can do that being said each
and every single one leapfrog's the last
one in terms of money it's banging so
like right and so it's why why stop
right well I'm the snob that like wants
a more grounded movie but good for you
NASA's love what they're doing sure look
gets me more ground like Daredevils
really ground in that TV show sure like
TV show that's the same way that the
books are there more grounded books and
then there's my Avengers right now yeah
so yeah I think we're gonna the fact
that Disney keeps making just money hand
over fist they're gonna keep trying to
expand that as much as they can they
bought up has met many rights as
possible I think they they're gonna do
straight Doctor Strange and by Panthers
about dr. shit smell but and it just
said the same thing about guardians of
galaxy now had any idea what is right
but but but we are familiar with I mean
did you knew garden that you knew
guardians a guy didn't know I didn't
know what that but that was but if I
knew if I was behind the scenes and I
mean that source material is great I
mean they're great well that's a good
angle like a strange stuff to was there
could be really fun like it's like 40 50
years with the stuff combined it is like
a weird guy that doesn't really fit into
the baby I'm just truly Romero I'm not
familiar enough with his defense work um
all right what about that tomorrow land
oh that looks good does right it doesn't
look good completely blank a second it's
the George Clooney directed by brad bird
yeah oh yeah the most guy yeah the Sun
good here is my concern about that movie
George Clooney big star kind of like an
older gray-haired gentleman in that sort
of movie that's clearly gonna pre a
franchise what do you thinks gonna
happen to George Cody before the movie
ends yeah I think there's a hundred
percent like
that he does not live through that movie
but it's called tomorrow lady ages yeah
maybe Benjamin but lately not they're
gonna make sequels and he definitely
won't be in the sequel so like that's
wow so this is like a precision I've
seen to Purdue Napoles thing they shot
like five at one time George Clooney is
not Johnny Depp he's not going to come
back for four sequels he's gonna do one
and be like I'm gonna go off and save
Africa now right so honey but the movie
looks terrific and brad bird on the
whole I think makes very good movies so
he does smart dude yeah all right well I
think I think that's all we can handle
for today that was far-ranging yeah we
covered a little bit of every kamon nice
little potpourri of discussion topics
yeah mr. fresh dick always always a damn
pleasure thank you where can everyone
follow you outside of whatever it is you
do for a living uh just a trust fresh
take on Twitter and what's your mere can
I don't know what's your periscope a
trois rustic that's the problem ear cat
like what am I gonna make a separate
account I know Amir kara scope and
meerkat just came to Android today and
I'm like as poor meerkat I feel a little
too late meerkat it's it's just a che I
it's such a shame for them it's like
they had this amazing one day in a solid
we have is an amazing it was less than
that it was like a day and then
periscopes like hey I think they're all
ridiculous the fact they don't let
anyone stream horizontally the hell's
right is that that is bizarre I never
thought about that but i guess the
benefit of that is that you can keep the
aspect ratio but still it's like why
snapchat or why instagram is the way it
is is because it keeps the aspect ratio
kills me yeah um alright so we'll do all
that will follow you on all those things
and I guess that's you know that's where
it's gonna end that's it stay in touch
with the show uh shoot us an email the
44 at cnet com and you can reach out on

say what's the deal with the f is
notoriously bad at social media we're
trying to get them better at it
and my was so bad effort I'm so bad
people you can be light red you can't
see this on the audio he's bright red

me how bad it's just so people I don't
even know it's like a performance piece
unless you're the Andy Kaufman of social
media it's so so bad and now it's bright
it's gonna bite me in the ass I or it
might totally pay off for people just
follow you out of the novelty of it
they're just like you see this is the
new Iron Sheik yes you fall in turn chic
