in the beautiful state of California
it's the Apple byte extra crunchy here
with you your host Brian Tong riding
solo this week
my producer extraordinaire Stephen
Beecham he is still on break he will
return next week this is episode 72
again this is a complimentary piece to
the actual Apple byte video podcast that
comes out weekly here we can update you
with the latest news get a lot more in
depth with what's going on and that's
what it's all about it's also about you
the listeners we have our phone lines we
are getting back on track after the
break up now that we are listening to
them you can always call us at
1-866-376-8255 a memory Convention
Center this year a lot closer to Apple's
campus and I think that's that might be
advantageous because Apple developers
may not necessarily want to take a whole
day out to get to San Francisco San Jose
is a whole lot closer obviously we're
going to expect to see the announcement
of all the updates to their operating
systems iOS 11 Mac OS 10 points 13 as
well as TiVo's TV OS and a watch off so
we expect to see those I think also no
one's really talking about it but if we
do not see and a hardware update for
iPads in that March April timeline I
think there's going to push it out to
WWDC the other thing is in the past we
used to seeing or we have seen MacBook
refreshes
at WWDC we may not because the timeline
of when the last ones were announced in
the late fall we may not see that you
so maybe this is a good opportunity to
see new iPads at WWDC we will wait to
find out again this is normally held in
San Cisco but logistics wise it's going
to be pretty much the same registration
will start on March 27th also Phil
Schiller confirms the loop that the
venue size is basically about the same
for 5000 developers around 1,000
engineers but also the lottery system
that is used that has been used for
people to attend in the past years that
will still be in place so just because
you jump on on March 27th doesn't mean
you're guaranteed a spot at WWDC you
will have to go through the entire
lottery system the last time WWDC was
held outside of San Francisco was
actually back in 2002 it predated the
iPhone and so obviously San Jose is
probably pretty happy that they're
getting the show back but this again
will be a big deal at least for the
Apple community it always is I tend to
find a lot of the cool stuff we see at
WWDC because it's like stuff we can
download and use right away or at least
up that no matter what the hardware is
which is becoming less and less
innovative and we'll talk about that
down in later the show the software is
hopefully what gives us some of these
cool new bells and whistles so we will
see but there you go WWDC will be this
year held in San Jose on June the fifth
the 9th we also expect the keynote most
likely to fall on June the fifth which
is the first day of the show so that
will all kind of fall in place now when
we talk about new tech and new stuff
coming out from Apple this is kind of a
sad story to me but this report from
Bloomberg is talking about one of the
weaker products in their product line
without a doubt I mean I've talked about
it before the Apple TV which even just a
few weeks ago Apple put the blame on
declining sales of the Apple TV for the
fact that their category called
other in their earnings report which
includes the Apple watch and includes
iPods and includes the Apple TV it had
it declined in this last quarter so this
report from Bloomberg says Apple is
vowed to rev
Ellucian eyes television but why it
hasn't the company is now testing a new
Apple TV capable of streaming ultra
high-definition Forte but it may not be
enough to really take on Amazon Roku and
this is my very first complaint when the
very first Apple TV or the Newport
generation came out I'm like yeah I get
it they needed to put I think right now
off the top my head it has an a8
processor it didn't have an a nine which
at the time for the phones could at
least support 4k video my whole thing is
why can't we just be able to toss that
4k video or 4k in quotations that we
take with our phones directly to our
Apple TV to watch on the fly and at that
time people like oh no one really has 4k
TVs but now 4k TVs are becoming the
standard it's more and more prevalent a
lot of people jumped on board because of
gaming all the TVs that we've seen now
coming off this year are going to be
affordable I mean we're talking about 4k
TVs at a 50-inch size although you may
not necessarily get the greatest benefit
because really 4k you need a 65 inch or
larger to really see those true benefits
but let's just okay rewind 4k and HD are
TVs they're starting to become more
prevalent we're going to see a $500
50-inch one from a company like TCL this
year so the pricing is going to be a lot
more affordable now Apple TV getting 40
now I mean that's if that's really the
only hardware boost that it gets that
doesn't excite me we already know that
they hired Amazons fire TV basically the
head of the product the product manager
the chief of Amazon's fire TV project to
run the Apple TV operations his name is
Timothy toor dhal we talked about that a
couple episodes ago so now this fit
generation Apple TV bloomberg reports it
will be internally codenamed
J 105 and the u-box will be a 4k box
according to people familiar with the
plans but is that enough to upgrade I
mean I bought again I've always wanted a
4k shingen Apple TV but the Apple TV is
one of the most expensive streaming
boxes on the market today you have the
fire TV you have Roku sticks and
chromecast I mean if I I can't remember
up top ahead but I believe apples
TV right now is like 149 i mean it's
extremely high-priced compare that with
really only benefits if it you're in the
ecosystem it doesn't have a streaming TV
service at least embedded in it you can
run playstation view which is in my
opinion the best one on the market you
can run a Direct TV or the AT&amp;amp;T DirecTV
now streaming service which is still in
its infancy but Apple doesn't have any
additional hooks other than all the
other apps that everyone is doing and
the Roku platform supports so many video
services beyond what the Apple TV does
the way the chromecast interacts is a
little different we can still tossed up
to your TV you have access to pretty
much all the services as well the Apple
TV just isn't compelling enough unless
you're an Apple diehard right now and
I've said plenty of times they need it
to change that now in another kind of
depressing update of the Apple TV
project I shouldn't say depressing but
just kind of to tell you how this
product is Amaya pinion lost its way
it's fallen behind it needs to do
something to at least be a viable option
to say this is the number one set-top
box that I want to get whether or not I
own Apple products or not but that's
just not happening now we know about
apples
T Apple TVs TV app I have to like slow
down so we don't all get confused they
that was their latest refresh the TV app
that pretty much syncs to some of the
channel services as well as iTunes
movies and TV shows that you purchase
where you can watch them from one device
pick up where you left off and watch
them from another device the interface
is a little more visual but that's all
they got with the Apple TV according to
this report that initial interface was
built with the idea that they would be
able to lock down their own streaming
service of their own write their own
kind of ala carte package that they were
trying to negotiate to get a core set of
stations and maybe you could customize a
few others on the side for around 30 to
40 dollars but we know that those
negotiations failed because Apple's like
no we want to do it our way
TVC was like no we control the content
and that's it didn't happen
well that watch TV interface was
intended and met
to be for their streaming service as
well as streaming live sports but it
didn't happen because Apple couldn't get
the deal done and it just sounds so
silly because Apple was stuck on this so
badly about the way that they want to do
their plans they just didn't think look
a $30 30 to $40 plan is fine but that's
what the PlayStation View is doing
already
that's what sling TV is doing all the
PlayStation view has DVR capability
completely build in the interface easy
to use you can get a package for like I
think 35 $45 starting that has pretty
much of course stations but Apple isn't
doing that so this whole TV app
interface was intended to be used for
the idea of Apple gated streaming
service that fell through and that
didn't happen okay so now you have this
kind of mishmash of a TV app that is
okay but it's not great we have an Apple
TV who's trying to be more like an
iPhone now because of the way it looks
the whole idea of the apps is instead of
being an actual a better straightforward
content delivery system and so I think
it has an identity problem and it also
just isn't efficient enough at what it
does and it there's no compelling reason
for someone outside of the Apple
ecosystem to buy an Apple TV for $149
right that's it's like now I'm on fire
TV is under 100
I think chromecast takes around 30 bucks
the Roku at least at our higher end
product is around 100 but it's not at
150 bucks so and you guys could correct
me if I'm wrong so I think it's just
really frustrating what's happening with
the Apple TV and the Bloomberg sheds
light on why some of those things are
the way they are but really if they just
say 5th generation Apple TV 4k that's it
I'm just going to be like ok thanks and
then we'll see how many of their
services will all of Apple's iTunes
movies and TV shows support 4k no so you
know some might some will
but not the entire thing right now right
you have Amazon some of the shows are 4k
Netflix some of the shows are 4k the
Vudu video service has their own kind of
4k stream but those movies on the iTunes
store are not 4k and not all of them
will be because that's up to the studios
we already see how and also just a
bandwidth size that's required for that
so I will I will wait and see what they
do with the Apple TV that may launch
later this year according to the
Bloomberg report in addition to that we
need content and Apple is jumped on this
whole content train we talked about it
as far back as the fall of last year
Apple is teasing two new shows well
Apple has finally showed off the
trailers for planet of the apps and
carpool karaoke these are the two shows
that are going to launch with they're
going to be exclusive to the Apple music
service which I already have issues with
that right so you have to be an apple
music subscriber to watch these shows
but the first show let's talk about it
plan of the apps based on the trailer
it's kind of like a mishmash between
shark tank Meets The Voice meets app
developers and so you have things like
you have these app developers they're
going to pitch their idea of an app to a
panel that includes Jessica Alba will I
am Gwyneth Paltrow and get Gary
Vaynerchuk entrepreneur with the
vaynermedia so you have these four
people that's like the panel they see
these pitches they will take the
developers under their wing that they
like kind of like a mentor kind of like
the voice and then the final the end
game is to help them with their app help
them distill it help them mark get it
tight so they can do a final pitch in
front of VCS to get that big VC money
that's the whole goal of the show I
actually think it looks pretty
intriguing I think there can actually be
some real drama for it but that is not
enough for me to subscribe to Apple
music I'm going to do I'm going to see
if I can do another trial run just to
check it out I mean obviously there's
going to be other ways to get it but
that's show number one now carpool
karaoke looks more of like obviously
it's like a fun romp James Corden was in
the trailer but I'm guessing he's just
going to be maybe like the very for
launched episode that they make free to
try and trick people to thinking he's
always going to be in it that's not
going to be the case but it'll be a
combination of celebrities singing in
the car together there was like Shaq and
John Cena there was John Legend
Metallica Alicia Keys so they get
they're getting big names but again it's
going to be kind of two celebrities
rolling out having fun and then they had
them go to like these different venues
like I mean Metallica is like in a
supermarket they there's just like a lot
I think John Legend there's like a choir
in the laundry mat they're doing other
things outside of just being in the car
so it'll be a fun show but again I mean
the question I have to you guys and gals
is would you actually pay for Apple
music to see these shows it's a start so
I know that they're not going to be
coming out full-fledged but I'm just
curious like how much how much do they
really have to give to us to really
convince us now I put up a poll on
Twitter for you guys and gals to kind of
chime in so I could get a sense of where
you at because I'm not always right so I
threw up a poll I asked you all would
you actually subscribe Apple music just
to see plan of the apps and carpool
karaoke spin-off show 8% said count me
in so this is out of 566 respondents so
that's a good chunk I mean that's a good
representative amount you're going to
really get an idea of what you all are
thinking 75% of you said no way
75% of you said no way will you ever
subscribe Apple using chess for these
two shows and again it's the start 17%
of you already have Apple music so you
say why not
but 8% only 8% of you said count me in
so that's less than out of 566 people
that's less than 50 people that are
basically saying I am I'm going to sign
up for Apple music but this all has kind
of more long tail implications because I
don't like the fact that they're
bundling with Apple music right now
maybe they have to rebrand that in the
future because it isn't just music but
it can be it could be compelling if they
come out with a couple really good gotta
see shows and again I think that's hard
because they're going to be in a bidding
war with Netflix and Amazon we know that
flicks had just invested I think it's
either last
they did five billion dollars in
investment of content I think this year
they're bumping that up to six billion
we've seen the type of shows that they
have what are people talking about now
the timeout shows on Netflix
the timeout shows on HBO maybe there's
one or there's a there's just a handful
of Network shows that are getting loved
but a lot of the buzz is always like did
you see that show on Netflix and then
people just binge right through it
because they created the whole binging
thing Apple doesn't have anything like
that so we will wait and see I'm not
going to rule them out but we will see
also Eddy Cue at the code conference the
code conferences where he announced the
trailers for plan of the absent carpool
karaoke again exclusive to Apple music
he also said Apple is working on new
features for the for podcast and so he
kind of dropped this it you know late
last year or in the spring of last year
Apple was asking select podcasters how
they can improve the podcast iOS iTunes
ecosystem so Q said there is going to be
absolutely some more things they were
going to do they did not say what but
Apple would be contributing into the
space we'll see how that plays out I'm
guessing maybe we'll see something like
that at WWDC they'll address what
they'll be doing with podcasts I don't
think it'll be something like
earth-shaking but I think it's always a
good thing and maybe there's some cool
things that you all can do with a with
the show like the Apple bites so there
you have it let's guess what we indeed
we have a sponsor this week for the show
oh man we appreciate the love because
that's all from you all listening in we
have sponsors pretty much booked out for
the next two three months so we are
soaked about that so let's get into it
our friends at Mara technology has
changed the way we run and thanks to
smart phone now even casual renders can
map their routes create pop-up playlists
and track their progress this is all
done without looking at your phone right
we hate if you're exercising the last
thing you want to do is look at your
phone kind of like why the will one of
the reasons why smart smart wrist
wearable upon wearables are out there
well there's Mara and it's a hands-free
running assist
that uses voice recognition and the
microphone in your earbuds to help you
optimize your runs this is stuff that
you can do while you're running you can
ask questions about your speed your pace
or location have maura play albums and
playlists from your music library so you
don't have to at least look at your
phone there's a lot of people that still
run with their phones
Mars can tell you how you're doing in
comparison to your past runs tell you
about weather changes if it's about to
rain so we can track your progress by
talking by noting all of your hot spots
and some of the hard hard parts of your
run you can also connect Mars to the
Amazon alexis you can asked her about
your lifetime statistics so check it out
visit Maura a AI to download your free
virtual running assistant today that's
amara.org and I think that let's bring
this on if we can run this bad boy on
exclusively on an Apple watch that'd be
pretty cool too Ellie's you know if
you're into the iOS ecosystem so there
you have it
Maura ai all right let's jump into more
and use a iPhone is always getting tons
of rumors more momentum around what is
this iPhone 8 thing this iPhone premium
thing what are all the models we've
talked about in a bunch but here's the
latest from KGI who's pretty much
dropped about three stories this week
about the future iPhone app the iPhone 8
the corner KGI
and maangchi quo will feature a new
function area in place of touch ID so
that touch ID home button that we've
talked about we talked about in the past
how Apple is looking to remove that
completely and put it under the glass
according to the support from KGI we
won't have a home button anymore but
that also means we won't have touch ID
and this bottom area of the phone let's
be honest it's similar to what's on it
Android phones there will be virtual
buttons kind of in a row on the bottom
of the 5.8 inch premium iPhone this is
again according to being chic whoa the
plans that they would make up for the
lack of touch ID with new biometric
technologies but again it would be a row
virtual buttons the 5.8 inch
phone would really for a usable display
real estate would be around 5.15 inches
so you're just going to have this bar on
the bottom
I don't what there is no specifics of
how if the bezel of the actual screen
will go down all the way there or not
but it looks like that at least the
display will be five point one five
inches with a black bar on the bottom
according to this report we'll see we'll
see how that goes but that's what KGI is
reporting in a follow-up report
according to JPMorgan analyst rod Hall
we talked about this edge to edge OLED
display he says that Apple will feature
a front-facing 3d laser scanner for
facial recognition we've heard of rumors
about this and that would also kind of
jive a little bit with what KGI is
talking about because there will be no
touch ID scanner on the soap on the
iPhone eight or this next premium iPhone
the remover the home button would need
to have something else to unlock our
phone be used for payments and a facial
recognition 3d laser scanner would be
that thing according to supply chain
reports three laser scanners have
actually increased in volume for that
sales of that module within apple supply
chain and it could add around 10 to 15
dollars per module to the actual iPhone
8 Bill of Materials so we've also talked
about it at the $1000 iPhone you throw
in that 3d scanning monitor you throw in
an OLED screen you throw in the fact
that they're removing the touch ID
button larger screen OLED screen 3d
laser scanner in addition to everything
else that they'll be doing uh we already
talked about it iPhone 7 plus with a 256
gigs be nine hundred $69 Alys here in
the US so that whole thousand dollar
thing is definitely definitely going to
want to happen it's just crazy that it
would it would be the base price per
potentially for this new model also this
week uh we know about wireless charging
we've been we've joked about it we've
really just teased Apple about it for
years because it has been out for a year
Apple has officially joined the wireless
power consortium lending wait to the
rumor of wireless charging actually
coming to this new iPhone 8 so we know
about wireless charging that basically
there are standard the only standard
wireless charging standard from the
wireless power consortium is Chi spell
Qi it's so weird because so many people
were calling it Qi initially I'm like
it's not Qi it's Qi like look it up so
they are now part of one of 213 members
of the wireless power consortium this
was not revealed until this week and we
know Apple has been kind of holding out
for this long range charging we've
talked about stories in the past where
they were ideally hoping to use
something even like even in their
patents if you look them up the base of
the iMac that's kind of a transmitter
offered for long range charging so that
you wouldn't have to put your phone or
devices on any actual surface it would
charge that way through through
inductive charging well now it looks
like they're jumping on board they may
not have the time or patience to wait
for that to actually happen to become
effective the whole long-range RF
charging so they're going to it it all
lines up the fact that at least the
premium iPhone 8 will have wireless
charging the rumors also say it's going
to have a glass backing not an aluminium
metal backing which will allow them to
make it a phone that can Wireless charge
as well so they're part of this wireless
power consortium it's not this we've
also said look the Apple watch has
wireless charging but what Apple did is
they kind of tweaked the protocol the
keys charging protocol is tweets for the
Apple watch that's why you actually
can't use any other Qi charging
platforms the Apple watch you can only
use apples and the Assumption obviously
come on it's Apple they're going to do
the same exact thing with this iPhone
whenever they do so all signs point to
the fact it's not official-official
obviously that's when the actual phone
comes out but that's the next iPhone
will have wireless charging Apple is
finally part of the wireless power
consortium so there you go the WPC you
with WPC and finally just kind of an
update also in addition to that the
Samsung display orders from Apple have
started to kind of become a little
ridiculous of a few months ago Apple
ordered 100 million flexible OLED
displays from Samsung Korea the Korea
Herald now reports that Apple just
ordered an additional 60 million OLED
panels from samsung Display making that
total of panels 160 million OLED panels
so when I hear that we don't again all
rumors point to the fact that we're
still going to have a 4.7 inch iPhone a
5.5 inch iPhone with generally the same
form factor and then this premium iPhone
but 160 million seems like they're going
all-in for this premium iPhone 8 and
based on the numbers of how things sell
we know that people are getting like the
best iPhone at least for from one of
those fans the iPhone 7 plus made had
the largest mix of A+ phone ever and
that trend is only continuing right to
have a better camera with the bouquet
effect the larger screen obviously so
this if I'm going to get an iPhone in
2017 which obviously I am I'm going to
get the new thing I'm not even though I
hate the fact that I don't
I want a 4.7 inch premium iPhone I just
have to accept it that maybe that's not
happening who knows we'll find out
but Samsung's OLED displays in Apple
panels instead of going balls to the
wall with this Samsung would be
basically supplying about 80% of the
total demand for iPhone display panels
given that each iPhone series has sold
more than 200 million units so it's
historically they've sold 200 million
units of each iPhone series this eight
to meet 200 million units 160 already
ordered a 160 OLED panels already
ordered that's going directly to the 8
that is directly going to the 8 so we
know about this OLED panel 5.8 inch
screen
a wireframe kind of like a little
throwback to the iPhone 4s one of my
favorite phone designs of all time or
iPhone 4 iPhone 4s but now in a larger
slimmer sleeker model that that's what
we're talking about all right let's take
a little transitional time that's what
we're talking about all right let's go
check out our voicemails yes we have
voicemails this week we were able to get
a few and we want to get you all back on
track with that again you guys and gals
can call us at 1-866-606-8444 God is
Spotify a lot I've been using that opera
music for about three months so I just
wanted to know what you guys choose
album you said Nina Spotify instead of
ability to the interface better than
Apple music is the content which one I
know a little bit more information
because I made my choice
staying with Apple music or maybe trying
out Spotify Thank You Jax of the show
please hey Juan thank you so much I
think that at least I don't want to
speak for Beecham but one of the reasons
why I'm all about Spotify is because it
is free
you obviously they're still ads that
play within it and also I was turned off
by my whole experience with iTunes Match
years ago where replaced a lot of my
artwork and replace some of the songs
with clean versions Apple music had that
same issue initially with replacing
people's music collection with lower
quality files I I liked the idea I think
if you're someone who's just like who's
started a music collection or someone
who's new younger they had didn't rip
all their CDs from scratch years ago and
works on getting all that original album
artwork I think if you're a young person
who didn't do that Apple music is good
for you streaming music is where it's
going but I don't feel comfortable with
them tweaking and messing with my music
collection like that so you can get
Apple music and then you can turn off
the matching feature but then you lose a
lot of the functionality
music I think Apple music is great if
you're in the ecosystem it's perfectly
fine there's actually nothing wrong with
it but the way that I deal with my music
in the fact that I still to this day and
it sounds silly I still like buying my
music
that's kind and I'm old-school like that
that's kind of weird
so Spotify I do I it's not as integrated
but I'd have to open an app I do like
the curation of their playlist I think
it I just tend to feel like it's a
little better but that's just my
personal that's just my personal feel
with Spotify so that's why I'm on and
again the biggest the biggest
differentiator is that it is free all
right let's check out beau talking about
how much you would actually pay for an
iPhone hi guys oh well it kills me to
say it if the new iPhone is even up to
$1200 and I like it I'm probably still
going to buy it just because I've been
Apple washing 2007 and become an
important part of my life and my
everyday work so hate to say it but
probably true Thanks great show
well that's hilarious because I had a
lot of people say you know about a sir
when I asked how many of you all would
pay a thousand dollars for an iPhone I
would say about assertive people are
like totally comfortable with it because
ultimately they never have to pay $1000
or more upfront it's broken down to
monthly payments to them it's like elves
pay like ten bucks more maybe have one
less coffee and have one more dinner
that's just ramen instead of a real did
a real grown grown person's dinner
so up to 1200 Bo I mean that that's
that's some Apple loyalty right there
but I think that if this new iPhone is
everything that everyone dreams is
dreaming about and if it does deliver
I would I would argue and say yeah I
probably would because it's spread out
over payments I would probably buy a
$1,000 iPhone if it delivers but you
know if they do a 4.7 inch version
that's cheaper which no one has said
they way
I would probably do that one but I think
a lot of people but first I said like
$1,000 hell no but I think a lot of I
phone lists are going to easily easily
do that
and when I say i phone Royalists about a
third of you are the hardcore you're
going to get it no matter what so yeah I
think it'll be interesting to see how
people react to it again nothing is
official but there's so much stuff out
there that almost seems like fact we'll
just have to wait and see
all right everybody thanks so much for
listening and hanging out with us again
with the Apple byte extra crunchy
