lets you design your own 3d wearable a
really awesome oven that's gonna cook
your food for you
and Elon Musk may be doing crazy stuff
again yes it's tomorrow daily
creating citizens of the internet
welcome to tomorrow daily the best ski
talk show in the known universe I'm
Ashley Skeletor he's always the man the
myth the legend the pizza connoisseur my
Pizza consigliere pizza date debutantes
oh my god I like a piece of you times a
pizza aunjanue my favorite thing I've
heard this man rap the intro tell me all
about Alam awesome
alright so what I understand we should
coin this the The Adventures of Elon
Musk because there's always some crazy
thing and it's oh it always seems so
incredible well today he's decided well
do you know I think was two days ago
he's decided that he wants he wants to
be the one to bring internet to the
whole world and this is based around his
space X program now previously we've
heard of people like Facebook trying to
bring internet around the world well
beyond what musk wants to beat that and
wants to have it done I think within
five years he wants this project to be
launched so basically what he wants to
do is create 4,000 low-cost satellites
that would be in Earth's orbit via the
Falcon 9 rocket and connected ground
stations here in the West Coast on in
the US oh man look at this great 4k
video of all these Rockets launching I
know it's such a great video it's kind
of porn porn yeah so they're hoping to
start testing next year and could make
the service available in five years
that's pretty good what's crazy salad
with only with four thousand low-cost
family Wow so interesting thing about
this is he actually intends to use this
to fund a different project so all of
supervillain lair in a volcano yes world
take over laser right but he's basically
gonna use all of the money that he makes
from this to hypothetically creates his
city on Mars well there we go there we
have it yep so I
yeah so the long-term revenue he hopes
to create it's a margin when she's been
a plan that he's been trying to do all
what many does many crazy plans but I
think I'm I'm a must
I'm a Musker muscat musketeer a
musketeer I'm a musketeer I think
musketeer and I love Elon Musk and all
of his his his he's got to he hasn't
pitched an idea where I wasn't like whoa
that's stupid mr. musk it's it's always
been like okay all right I could see the
fact he's making giant steps and whether
and whether or not they miss they at
least get people thinking yeah what is
very positive towards that super cliche
your book quote that everybody puts
their like aim for the movie next summer
aim for the moon even if you miss you'll
end up amongst the stars I think he'll
I've never heard that super literally
that was I think in my senior yearbook
in high school about 50% of the girls
have that as their quote their senior
quote which okay amazing but yeah I
think Elon Musk maybe took that really
to heart and was like I am literally
going to aim for Mars and then if I miss
like I may so we lost in space yeah but
this is pretty cool he wants to bring
internet around the world and with the
Facebook thing people were a little wary
because they thought it was gonna be
like really taking their information
yeah BC issue and they probably were but
they've scrapped their hypothetical
Facebook's scrapped it they the plane
yeah like we could like I think it was
like I think that was the thing that was
two days ago
Wow they didn't announce it officially
but they cut it and a lot of people are
thinking cuz the Elon Musk thing but I
think it was just like Facebook was like
we can't do anything right
I know we've heard Elon must talk about
this before like he like hypothetically
wanted to do it but everybody was like
well we don't really know and I think
this was like he did he file like
official documentation with the FCC
saying yes this is the plan that's yeah
that's that's what this news story is
that the FCC he officially see what yeah
yeah sorry sorry to have skipped that
part but he is officially dealing with
the FCC Phyllis so so yeah there you go
I love it um but that brings us toward
space Tagum dare face must have to go
today which is okay this is this is a
weird one so we're calling this the
continuing Adventures
of Elon Musk no TD musk TD musk so TD
musk is your plot from a fictional comic
book series called the continuous the
continuing is space adventures of Elon
Musk it's really hard to like kale very
kindly coined this this morning the
continuing space adventures of Elon Musk
and it made me laugh so hard at my desk
while getting the show ready them like
this has to be the hashtag of it but
continuing space adventures of Elon Musk
so what kind of story Adventure would
you come up with anything
Elon Musk would do maybe he finds a
lightsaber and goes in I can't maybe he
goes he rides a space dinosaur let us
know what maybe maybe an actually good
idea that you think that Elon Musk
should go ahead and tackle for the
rescue so let us know so that's TD musk
TD musk our awesome job
Elon thanks for watching the show man
great work big man yeah thanks you for
being a fan of us we're also a fan of
you um let me tell you about the June
oven because this might revolutionize a
lot of our cooking everybody out there
yeah you were flipping out about that
who likes to cook in a toaster oven
which I do often because there's only
two of us I don't need a giant oven to
cook in a lot of the time I mean so the
June oven the the June intelligent oven
is pretty fancy so you're gonna see a
video of it like it's got these touch
screen buttons got one dial on it it has
coils made of carbon fiber so even when
you turn this toaster oven up to 500
degrees inside it literally is cool to
the touch so there's no burn burn danger
now here is the crazy part about the
June intelligent oven it was created by
people who have worked on projects like
the iPhone Fitbit GoPro lift like these
are huge huge projects huge products
amazing products great products people
use every day this june intelligent oven
figures out what you're trying to cook
and it does it for you so here's how
that works let's say you have a steak
okay and you put your steak inside and
inside there is actually a scale inside
there that weighs your food exactly so
have you ever done like defrost on your
microwave and it's like how
does it weigh and you're like I don't
know how much does this weigh a pound
like you just kind of guess yeah guess
whatever just microwave no this actually
knows exactly how much a way so it knows
exactly how much heat to give it they
said you could literally no preheating
you could put in a tray of raw cookie
dough and it'll know oh hey you're
making chocolate chip cookies I know
exactly how much time it's gonna take
for me to cook these from zero to 350
degrees like Oh it'll take X amount of
time so you just put in like rock cookie
dough cold into the June intelligent
oven you tell it takes a picture it has
a camera inside and it takes a picture
and using the tegra the NVIDIA Tegra k1
chip it can access deep miss machine
learning algorithms and tell exactly
what's inside whoa so it can say like oh
hey I noticed you're making a steak I
know how to make a steak so I'm gonna
make that steak for you this is like
Jetsons technology this is straight up
like crazy Jetsons technology I love it
so much and so you can also walk away
from your oven and if you want to say
check on those chocolate chip cookies
you just access the app and it shows you
what the camera sees you have like a
live video of your food you do
yeah black video says your you can cook
a 12 pound turkey in there a 12 inch
pizza I'm sorry is this a little boy or
a woman I think it's a woman
very lovely haircut she reminds me of
the lady on Game of Thrones from Dorne
Oh brings oberyn's wife so okay so so
this is an actual thing I can buy or
what pre-order it so the pre-order is
open it's not on Kickstarter this is
like they are just like nope we're gonna
go see you can set likes what type of
steak you want medium rare medium
whatever and it'll do exactly what you
need like if there's the website Juneau
vidcom you can put a deposit down for 95
bucks and then you pay the full balance
when it's ready to ship which is uh it's
$1,500 total so you'll pay fourteen
hundred and five dollars when it's ready
to ship a normal toaster oven is a few
hundred plus I say it like a good
toaster ovens like between 150 and she's
like 200 bucks yeah it's like maybe like
200 bucks but it just burns your house
up meteorites I mean it's it's it just
you know toast and some of them if you
buy like a convection oven what we just
sort of the microwave kind of
convection oven thing that costs more
they're like you know a few hundred
dollars you're right so pretty cool I
like it not a terrible cost I mean it's
a cost of like like a nice DSLR camera I
could see you getting this I are you
gonna get it I'm thinking about it like
it's a little expensive it's a little
little far out of my price range
yes your husband to get it to you for
like Christmas maybe if I get like a
maybe if I get like a nice windfall like
a bank error in my favor or an extra
side job or something I've been waiting
for that bank error for a real
eight-years-old first time I played
Monopoly I'm like what am I gonna get a
bank error in my favor
I don't think 1,500 is too much I don't
think it's a terrible price I mean it's
a little pricey I would have liked $9.99
I would have paid a thousand for it oh
yeah easy no problem producer Logan
would you buy this okay so they were
saying it could replace like urban like
urban dwellers who live in smaller
apartments who maybe don't want an oven
or don't use an oven like this would be
the thing they would cook almost all
their food in she's pretty cool okay so
now that we've talked about that very
cool all right let's talk about this
projection design stuff this actually
was shown off at South by Southwest
apparently I haven't heard about it but
it's super cool and the video is amazing
this is from MATLAB and this is a
program called tacton so here's what it
is it's a it's projection technology
that allows you to actually manipulate
the projection in real time on your skin
which is super cool so this person is
going to design a piece of jewelry it's
it they're going to design a bracelet
using this technology so they have this
amazing prototype their very first
prototype use the tracking and mapping
hardware through connect and then they
did one with leap so yeah here it is
right here the prototype that is the
actual bracelet which looks exactly like
the light projection and they actually
went a little bit further with this and
on the website you can see pictures of
moto 360 so they're saying you know
there's a lot of items that you need
really precision based design instead of
your finger which can be very inaccurate
so they said you can set limitations on
the projection so for example they did a
moto 360 watchband and they said they
told the software
it has to be able to hold this watch
face and here's the size of it and
here's the exact parameters and then you
design around that so what they did was
they created this really rad watch face
that's super cool it's on the website so
I don't we have the link to it maybe
I'll throw up an image and post but it's
it's really neat and you read they were
able to drop in this moto 360 watch face
into this like insane looking like
Geiger alien-esque like watch band which
is super cool was it 3d printed is that
what that was
yeah so what they do is it's sort of a
continuous loop they have the projection
with the tracking technology and then
that goes into the software and so based
on what's happening in the software the
3d modeling changes the 3d model of it
and then reflects that change back on
through the projection printer I know
which oh there's the watch there's the
watch you imagine like before leaving
your house like creating a watch yeah
just like no big deal I made a watch
band today and like whatever but it's
really amazing it's real it's super cool
it's a like super basic thing like not
gonna you know change the world in terms
of you know making life better for
disabled people or you know things like
that but so so cool and also I can think
of a million ways that this could evolve
into other stuff so and I'm sure you
guys can too but yeah that's a that is
tectum that's what it's called TAC tu
Emmett very cool check it out like that
but that's it for our headlines we're
gonna be right back with a a very insane
firey musical instrument inspired by Mad
Max for Mod Squad and then we also have
your user feedback and our phone tog
refer today so don't click away tomorrow
daily but before we go check out this
tiny hamster monster
welcome back to the show we've returned
it's Wednesday which means it's time to
talk about somebody making something
cool out of something else so it's time
for Mod Squad so if you haven't seen Mad
Max or if you have you've probably seen
the the bungee cord suspended guitar
player with the fire coming out of the
top of his guitar oh yeah he's the best
that yeah we would argue maybe that he
is actually the protagonist of Mad Max I
don't I don't think they should name the
movies Mad Max anymore
yeah he's gonna be in Star Wars as well
I gotta me so it's pretty amazing like
so cool and funny and this one guy named
Caleb craft decided after seeing that
character that he also needed a string
instrument that shoots fire so he
freakin made one and we had a lot of you
guys submit this a bunch of you tweets
emails so we had to show it on the show
this week we know it's all over the
internet but he made a flame-throwing
ukulele which is great I love this so
much so he used supplies like a butane
canister a ukulele obviously an igniter
a caulking gun zip ties shaped lock a
hose I like a little metal hose and
electrical tape to put everything
together hot glue gun kettles like he
had a fire extinguisher on hand just in
case things got things got a little too
hot he even put it in the back of his
truck for a fact I love it so he has all
his plans and actually you can literally
go see his full instructions on his
YouTube video he'll tell you exactly how
to make one for yourself don't do it
it's it is not the safest project in the
world but it looks so amazing um and
yeah I would say maybe just keep a fire
extinguisher on hand like he does
because if you decide to do this for
yourself it's actually kind of dangerous
and he says the idea could totally be
scaled up to guitars and bigger string
ants but he's like you could literally
do this for a lot of different streamers
he just chose ukulele because he thought
that would be a good way to start this
guy's the man yeah guy totally rocks
so Caleb craft where does he live that's
a great question I'm not sure
be interested to see if we can we gotta
go see him if he lives in Southern
California we will have him on the show
100% so um yeah great work Caleb craft
and it make showed this video this is
like been all over the internet this
week yeah thanks to everybody that
submitted this a lot of you guys
submitted this to us and we listened and
here it is thank you so much you know
how much we love fire we love you and
fire okay so speaking of you guys we got
to talk about your user feedback
yesterday we asked you guys to use the
hashtag TV flushed to talk about the
pros and cons of putting a toilet a
working flushable plumbed toilet in an
elevator you guys have a lot to say
about this and very entertaining so rick
tweeted us and said i can only see one
con what if the toilet paper runs out
who you gonna call a great question
these are these are genuinely good
questions a good question it really is
good we should translate these into
japanese and send them to the japanese
government because they're really
important questions you guys are asking
the hard-hitting questions here Walter
wrote in and said pro emergency use if
trapped or ill con people will abuse
them horribly brats in Japan it would be
okay I do wonder about I mean we can't
have we could never have that here
people would just people have no shame
in America Americans have no shame we
have no shame which is why we do this
show every day no shame whatsoever
syusai efika wrote in and said con no
privacy like if a lot of people are in
the elevator and I've heared Pro there's
a storage right so stuff the food in
there I don't think I would want to put
food anywhere near that yeah this is
still a questionable idea at best
questionable I mean at best I can only
think of one place where bathroom makes
sense so yeah currently in the bathroom
a toilet would make sense in an actual
bathroom um Gail wrote in and said Pro
ready ready used during a disaster
hashtag hygienic con people staring and
uploading you to periscope which that
always makes me laugh like the idea of
like somebody is just like I really have
to go there great let me get out
phones but this on periscope it's a
terrible idea you guys are using
periscope right yeah it's the only way
to use periscope
oh but yeah that was your user feedback
I was very entertained YouTube had some
really good ones too I was reading
through the YouTube comments some of you
have some really funny pros and cons um
some of which I could not actually
repeat on this show because the family
show but it was they entertained me very
deeply anyway uh it is time for a very
last piece of user feedback which is
always our photogra fir of the day I
know I know
our chromatographer today is Thomas he
took this picture with the Moto G 2014
moto G which is super impressive
considering its it doesn't have the same
level of flagship lens that a lot of the
higher end ones with the Moto X would
happen ok um so he took this picture and
he says I took this picture on my Moto G
2014 at Baylock lake at sunset in the
nut wheel down mountains in Tipperary
Ireland Oh
Ireland Ireland Tipperary it's a long
way to tipperary temporary yeah PS love
the show and we love you Thomas that's a
great picture so green I mean I love
that one Hill in the back though looks a
little bit like California because it's
kind of brownish oh I'm sorry
so so green it's just amazing nice one
you got a photo from Ireland so this is
nice this is nice I think I did one
always at Scotland maybe Scotland we got
one from Scotland this is a great not
the same place Ashley they're different
people I know guys I know but they're
all in that general area and so I just
you know all together alright fair
enough
yeah we're all on earth we're all in our
thrall yeah except for Elon Musk who is
yeah way up in space right now by but
that's uh that's it for that if you want
to send in your phone tog Rafi you can
send it to tomorrow at cnet.com tell us
a little story tell us what device you
took it with and if you want to send in
your hashtag today via email you can if
not send it over social media where
tomorrow daily on most major social
media networks but really the most the
one we use the most is Twitter yeah
