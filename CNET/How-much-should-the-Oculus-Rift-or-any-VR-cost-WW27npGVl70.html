this is sean hollister and virtual
reality we've seen a lot of it this show
is full of it but the biggest stuff
PlayStation VR oculus rift HTC vive is
coming out in just a few months so
what's this show about six hundred
dollar oculus rift that was announced is
VR for us who is it for at six hundred
dollars it's for me because I'm a tech
journalist and I have to buy it I don't
know if I'd be able to buy that and a
gaming PC if I wasn't my job not for me
yeah that's the thing is I love oculus
rift I love HD five using them but I
think that price you add it up and maybe
it was never meant for those of us who
were not hardcore PC gamers I've come to
him a mental state where I say that's
early adoption stuff and then that's why
mobile perhaps existed ok so the low end
it was supposed to be for us oculus was
supposed to be for us 300 350 dollars it
was supposed to be something where all
of us could afford that for our existing
gaming PC's okay maybe that's not all of
us but a lot of us it was Emma Braddock
it was meant to be democratic no it's
just sweat there's the high end rift
oculus and who knows how I expensive I
don't know which they're gonna kill
thousand dollars gonna be out there it's
gonna be up there and even though that
stuff's high-end it's still tethered
you're tethered with a cord to the
ground yeah you're not going to bring
someone home to look at your oculus rift
pc system but you might pull some out of
a bag and show them my phone you can
take the gear vr with you it's ninety
nine dollars you put your phone in it
and what we've learned here at cas not
only is the gear VR much better than the
other cell phone viewers we've seen
where you stick your phone in there what
we're seeing peripherals little brass
knuckle objects a rink controller for
samsung miss developing where we're
going to start to see that immersion in
the phones to you'll be able to put your
hands and demography are as well soon
and then with the pace of cell phone
technology how quickly that stuff
develop Oh like that and overtake it
possibly especially with 3d depth
sensing cameras and the ability to go
everywhere we're going to find out more
this is just a taste and we'll be
reporting soon on these VR systems stay
tuned from Las Vegas here we are at CES</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
