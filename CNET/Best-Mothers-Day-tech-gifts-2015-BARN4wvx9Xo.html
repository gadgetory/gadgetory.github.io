you with tech she sanctioned your first
video game connected you to the internet
and if you were lucky even hooked you up
with your first cell phone this Mother's
Day it's mom's turn to be cool if you've
caught your mom using her phone as a
boombox more than once it's time to
upgrade her with a wireless Bluetooth
speaker check out the Bose Soundlink
color with eight hours of battery life
and five colors to choose from mom can
bring the party everywhere she goes in
style now might also be a good time to
transition mom into ebooks ditching
paperbacks could take a little
convincing but once she's on board
she'll appreciate being able to carry a
huge library of books in a single
lightweight device the kindle paperwhite
is our favorite choice thanks to its
built-in light fast processor and
best-in-class ecosystem now might also
be a good time to wean mom off of her
five-year old smartphone maybe in her
world that's perfectly acceptable but
you know better enter the Galaxy Note a
5.7 inch screen gives her plenty of room
to multitask and a built-in stylist will
finally let her send you those heartfelt
handwritten notes we've been asking her
for how about all those times mom
chauffeured you around from school to
games and to your first concert maybe
it's time to make mom the coolest driver
in town with the mercedes-benz GLA 250
it's compact but spacious with the
refined interior and plenty of cargo
space plus she'll love being able to
kick back while adaptive cruise control
and automated parking take some of the
stress out of her day finally if your
mom is the fitness type why not check
her out with the newest wearable out
there the Apple watch it'll track her
steps measure her heart rate and with
its built-in media player she can even
use it to listen to her favorite tunes
or podcasts and with the Apple watch
launching just weeks before Mother's Day
you can almost guarantee she'll be the
first on the block sporting Apple's
first wearable so whether you're
shopping for your own mom or your baby
mama head on
