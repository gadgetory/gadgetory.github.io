I'm ready laser fit is an upgraded
version of laser tag
it's basically a new sports wear laser
tag meets Fitness you're gonna come for
a class we're gonna warm you up and then
you're gonna go for two rounds you're
gonna run making cardio you're gonna
squat you're gonna jump you're gonna
sweat we don't feel the work because you
actually having fun we really refer the
whole process the rules of the game the
equipment the speed is really the huge
difference between laser tag and this
because of the mat on the floor and the
fact that there's a lot of space you can
actually run and that gives you enough
speed to actually use the the ledge on
the model and actually pop on it so you
have targets on the handle
you have targets on the altar movement
sensors in the handle in the all-star as
well counting the calories to recover
your equipment they have to move all the
time because when they get hit the only
way to actually start playing again by
moving the equipment glows in blue when
you become the leader so we basically
create a ball in laser tag amazing fit
is an awesome way to do sports when you
don't like sports when you don't like to
run when you feel like fitness it's
boring the way it's set up is basically
take an intro class and then if you like
it and you want to come back we have
packages and we have membership it's the
same way of sitting any other Fitness's
and we have people that start coming
back just because it's very addictive
it's an awesome new sports its laser tag
I mean every kid in the world will tell
you it is fun when they said you're
gonna sweat look at this you can't fake
this this is the real deal so laser fit
