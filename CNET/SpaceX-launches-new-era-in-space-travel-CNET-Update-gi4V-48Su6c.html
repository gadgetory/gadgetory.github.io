facebook stock ended its first publicly
traded a right where it began at
thirty-eight dollars a share CEO Mark
Zuckerberg rang in the Nasdaq opening
bell virtually from the Silicon Valley
campus and later shares began treating
at around 42 dollars it was actually a
half hour late to trade because of a
glitch at the NASDAQ exchange it didn't
take long for the stock dropped back
down to 38 dollars by the time the
market closed it's the largest initial
public offering by an Internet company
and Facebook raised sixteen billion
dollars from it that's almost 10 times
with Google raised when it went public
in 2004 you probably won't see an IPO
like this again and right after shares
went public Facebook was hit with a
class-action lawsuit that claims
Facebook invaded privacy for tracking
users after they logged out the lawsuit
combines 21 cases across the US and it's
asking for 15 billion dollars in damages
or about ten thousand dollars per
facebook user a Facebook spokesman told
Bloomberg quote the lawsuit is without
merit and we will fight it vigorously

comcast is ditching its data cap max of
250 gigs a month and now it's adding a
new pricing structure once users go past
300 gigs of data it will charge
customers ten dollars for every extra 50
gigs use that month on Saturday the
world enters a new era in space

the first commercial company to send
spacecraft to the International Space
Station withheld from NASA at Cape
Canaveral it will launch the Falcon 9
rocket which will be carrying supplies

mission and will last 21 days a live
stream of the launch events begins at
four a.m. eastern and there's no better
way to ring in the moment than by
dressing like an astronaut nike has
launched nike craft a sportswear line of
items made from bizarre materials to
help you survive a mission to space such
as the Mars yard shoe it's a sneaker
