milestone in rocket science on Monday by
safely landing the Falcon 9 rocket at
Cape Canaveral in Florida after a brief
10 minutes flight into space when it
deployed 11 low-orbit satellites the
crew of SpaceX cheered with excitement
as a rocket touchdown without incident
past space X attempts at landing a
reusable rocket have ended in disaster
and one rocket headed for the
International Space Station on a supply
mission ended in a giant fireball when
it blew up shortly after takeoff earlier
this year but this isn't the first
rocket to land itself safely after a
trip to space rival space tourism rocket
company Blue Origin owned by Amazon's
Jeff Bezos safely landed their new
Shepherd rocket just a few weeks ago
after a brief flight to the edge of
space following the space X successful
landing Jeff Bezos couldn't contain
himself and tweet it to space X Congrats
SpaceX on landing Falcons sub-orbital
booster stage and added with a little
jab to SpaceX welcome to the club it's
worth noting in space X's defense that
the Falcon 9 is a much larger rocket
capable of carrying payloads to the
International Space Station and beyond
while Jeff bezos's new Shepherd rocket
is much smaller and designed to take
tourists on trips to the edge of space
and back safely
kudos to both space companies for
successfully designing and testing
recycled rockets in 2015 which will save
millions of dollars on space exploration
and open up space to an entirely new
economy in the near future the end of
the year is almost here so make sure to
check out craves round up at the best
science stories of 2015 and pictures
