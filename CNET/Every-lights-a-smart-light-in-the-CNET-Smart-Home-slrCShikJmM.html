taking a step by step approach to
building a connected home experience
here in Louisville Kentucky but now
we're about to take a giant leap towards
making this house into a smart home
Alexa turn on the living room Alexa turn
on the family room Alexa turn on the
kid's room
Alexa turn off the whole house
here's how we did it
now automating an entire homes worth of
lights isn't actually as complicated as
you might think
but you will need to make some decisions
about the hardware that you're gonna use
smart bulbs will let you dim the lights
up and down and they're also pretty easy
to install you just swap them in for the
old ones and then add into your system
they also don't cost that much these non
color-changing versions of Philips used
lights only costs $15 each on the other
hand smart switches are nice because
they'll still work with your automations
even when things are switched off they
do cost a little more though and the
installation is a little more tricky
once we figured out what we wanted and
what we needed here in the scene that
smart home we made a shopping list and
bought everything we needed and then got
to work installing it it actually wasn't
that tough took us about a day to get
everything hooked up and synced with our
system and we had a whole house full of
smart lights but then the question is
control and our answer was sitting right
in our kitchen the Amazon echo smart
speaker the echo has native support for
philips hue bulbs and for Belkin Wemo
switches so we stuck to those and then
added them all into the Alexa app from
there it's just a question of naming
everything you name them in the Philips
hue and Belkin Wemo apps and then you
can name additional groups of lights in
the Alexa app if you're thorough and you
add a lot of different names for the
same switches in the same groups of
lights you can create a system that will
respond to you no matter what you're
asking for now yes the cost of all this
gear definitely adds up but it's
important to remember that you don't
need to automate everything all at once
you can start small the most important
lights in your home and build out from
there and if your house is smaller than
this one and you know doesn't need
multiple Amazon echoes to control it you
can keep the cost of a whole home
lighting solution well below the price
of a new TV a new laptop that's not bad
for a whole home smart lighting setup
with voice controls at the center</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
