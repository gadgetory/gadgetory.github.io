that the salesman will try to push the
corresponding sound bar on you but there
are many benefits to buying off-brand
when it comes to sound for example you
can't buy a Yamaha or Pioneer TV anymore
but they make the best sound bars out
there
you also can't buy a JBL TV but sadly
their sound bars are up there with the
best the JBL SB 350 is an attractive
looking sound bar with a mesh grille
adjustable thumbwheel feet and a subtle
metallic trim this is a stereo sound bar
and while it has virtual and add
squashing modes it's not true surround
it comes with a separate wireless
subwoofer which features a 6.5 inch down
firing driver unusually the sound bar
features an HDMI input not a switch and
it's designed to be used in conjunction
with your TV's HDMI AARC feature by
streaming audio from an on-board tuner
or smart TV if you want to watch cable
through this unit you'll need to use the
optical digital pod additionally the SB
350 also has bluetooth for streaming
wirelessly from your phone and use as
with most of these types of products the
JBL is better with movies than move
music and that's thanks to the efforts
of the subwoofer while you won't get
surround or even DTS decoding you can
get the gist of most action movies with
plenty of slam and clear dialogue music
isn't as successful as it can sound a
little too harsh and there can be a lack
of integration with the sub on rock and
roll tracks at $399 the JBL SB 350 is a
decent sound bar with attractive looks
but it isn't the first choice for our
money this is ty Pendlebury for cnet.com</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
