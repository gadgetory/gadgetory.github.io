disbelief when Portia came out with
their first SUV the Cayenne no ones
disbelieving anymore it's now their
best-selling car by 2x you could argue
it is the company so what took them so
long for the follow up this is the
Porsche Macan this is their compact
crossover very loosely based on the Audi
q5 platform but it doesn't share a lot
of parts just basic underpinning layout
it also targets the very successful
Acura MDX so get those two in your head
as to where this car is going now first
of all you're gonna notice it's very low
slung differently than a q5 and it's
more swept back than a q5 which is kind
of more up and down so there's a compare
and contrast it's gonna launch with two
v6 engines one is an S model car the
other one's gonna be a turbo there's no
base vehicle to start that may come
later with a turbo for the first one
Porsche has done in eons now inside
you're gonna recognize a lot of familiar
Porsche cues the wheel the placement of
buttons here on the head unit this whole
very complicated button filled spine
that arrived originally with the
Panamera so nothing in here is too
unusual which is to be expected in terms
of cabin room I'll need to give it more
time on the row but it definitely feels
intimate in here I don't know that it's
tight it's not that small a vehicle the
base or eschar is a 340 horsepower motor
the turbo is 400 pretty stout difference
there and both are equipped with a
7-speed PDK Porsches dual clutch
automated manual now comparing to the
Cayenne is interesting the makaan is
about six inches or so shorter quite a
bit lower 450 to 550 pounds lighter so
there's a real difference here in case
it's not printing in size here on our
video believe me it's a much more
compact package now I'm not a big
compact crossover fan personally but
this to my eye is the best-looking one
on the market it's got a restrained look
of performance and the low slung lines
really transform it compared to a lot of
competition ok some pricing the s the
entry-level car comes out about fifty
thousand dollars the turbo 70 mm before
you'll R them up with
infamously many and expensive Porsche
options
