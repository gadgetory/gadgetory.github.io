com at Oracle Arena for the Golden State
Warriors and we know technology is
everywhere in our lives and beacons are
a hot new thing well this is the first
NBA arena to actually implement beacon
technology i'm here with Kevin cote
senior director of digital here with
Golden State Warriors thanks for hanging
out fest keV yeah thanks for being here
so that's a lot of fun you know I wanted
to kind of talk to you about beacons
implementing them here as part of the
fan experience kind of talk to us about
how that works and it really works with
the Golden State Warriors app right sure
yeah so so what it is it's about
enabling our fans to use their mobile
device as a companion to their
experience here at the game and we
believe the beacon technology is going
to be something that continues to take
off so we wanted to kind of be early
adopters in it to really get our fans
used to the technology we already do a
lot here in the arena with phones
whether it's Facebook chicken or this
Instagram wall a variety of things to
enhance their experience and the beacons
are just another way to do that and then
really what school at the app is not
only is it done over a low frequency
bluetooth but also in an inaudible sound
a tone right its center throughout the
arena right right yeah it so it can be
sent out via these beacons or even
through our PA system in the in the bolt
if we wish now does that mean you
probably won't have like a dog day here
at the area just in case that's safe to
say now tell us some of the stuff that
will be delivered to your phone through
the answer so right now when a fan comes
to Oracle Arena they're greeted
instantly as soon as they walk through
the doors with welcome two warriors
ground that's kind of what we call this
place warriors ground and immediately
they're served an opportunity to win a
free doublet the first 50 fans do so and
actually come right here to the Facebook
table in addition to that Knights
facebook giveaway to get that free item
we've done a couple other things and
enter two wins for VIP experiences so
that's something you're getting right
off the bat when you come in what we're
going to do in the future is merchandise
discounts at our team store we also have
beacons upstairs in the upper level so
through our app you can actually upgrade
your seats moberly through your phone
so we remind you that as soon as you get
the elevator I like that so if I'm kind
of in the nosebleed yes I've got a
little extra change I can use the app
right and move on down yep all right I
like we remind you that through the
beacon now we're here in the heart of
the silicon valley you know we have this
instagram wall behind us really the
Warriors you know arena oracle arena is
one of those places that could really
leverage this technology are you guys
really trying to be kind of one of those
leaders in that space yeah we're trying
to but we also have to be because we're
in this space we're in this our fans
expect to be able to use their phones
they expect to have Wi-Fi they expect
for us to enable them to enhance their
experience through the phone
alright guys you know what this is
google glass and the Warriors are
jumping on this and you guys are
developing your own google glass
application correct correct yeah glass
Marin and really it's an extension of
our mobile app again being in the Bay
Area we probably have more adopters of
google glass than most markets so we
want to be make sure we're ahead of the
curve again and bring that experience to
to this platform and the thing about
this is this is not going to be just
isolated at any section you want any fan
that it comes to a game then is wearing
a pair of these bad boys $1,500 right
now to be able to jump into your app
what type of information and things will
they be able to see so it's actually
built on the same Android platform as
our Android mobile app so anything from
play-by-play shot charts to game flow
information about the players and then
someday also live camera angles
different different camera angles
altering throughout the arena anything
that really enhances that experience so
that you don't even have to look down
you can be watching the game and but
then they're actually looking up up into
the right and seeing stats and anything
that's going to make the game even more
enjoyable we know in the a.d.d
information all day every day age that's
going to be important alright guys so
there you have it just another way that
the gold State Warriors are really
getting in front of the technology
movement in really implementing things
like the beacons and Google glass right
