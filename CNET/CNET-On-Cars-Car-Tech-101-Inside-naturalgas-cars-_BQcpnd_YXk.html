you're gonna like all the main benefits
number one cheap here it's about two and
a half a little bit more than that per
gallon equivalent now this is in
California at a time we're paying 420 on
up top 474 premium this is a big
discount number two it's real clean
almost no carbon monoxide output in the
exhaust and two-thirds less NOx the
stuff that really creates the nasty
small number three all the Benny's tax
credits maybe some rebates maybe a free
HOV Lane pass in your state even a place
where hybrids no longer get one it rolls
up into a little VIP Club sorts these
incentives are very important to ceding
the market to getting these markets for
clean vehicles to a tipping point where
they will take off on their own number
four less reliance on foreign energy and
we're not a political show so I'm not
gonna dive into that but bottom line is
America has a lot of natural gas without
going anywhere to go shopping for it now
the challenges around CNG cars are also
a foursome storage energy density
fueling and combustion first storage
maybe it's better termed infrastructure
and distribution your house has a
constant connection to a relatively low
pressure natural gas source your car
needs almost the opposite a very
occasional connection to a high-pressure
source and that's gonna require some
infrastructure whether it's a pumping
your house or getting to a pump that is
relatively scarce today
unlike gasoline or diesel natural gas
needs to be compressed maintained that
way at filling locations like this and
maintained that way in your car a
challenge you never encounter with
gasoline or diesel CNG cars carry
natural gas compressed to just one
percent of its natural volume it is
really crushed down up to 3600 psi which
leads to a possibly bulky and expensive
tank and that leads us
which is energy density now compressed
natural gas has somewhat less energy per
a certain volume compared to gasoline or
even more so compared to diesel however
the biggest challenge around the range
has to do not with the density of the
fuel but how much you can carry in
current car design partly because the
cylinder design for a compressed natural
gas car has to be a certain size and
shape to be that strong number 3600 psi
they can make gas tanks any shape to fit
them anywhere and hold even more fuel
for example on this Honda Civic GX which
is basically the flagship of family cars
that run on natural gas from the factory
you get about 250 miles out of a full
but smaller tank of compressed natural
gas versus 380 on a tank full of
gasoline in the more common version
third challenge right now is refueling
you probably haven't seen a lot of
natural gas pumps at your local gas
station that's a process that's underway
in the mean time you might be carrying a
guide like this that tells you where
they are or using the navigation system
in a car like this that will tell you
where they are when you need one
typically these things are going to be
operated by utilities fleet companies
your local bus fleet for example or
maybe one of the new generation of
purpose-built consumer refilling
stations finally the fourth challenge is
all around this area of combustion if
you want to run compressed natural gas
in your current car you can't
it's not like gasoline though they share
three letters you've got to do a fairly
extensive change of the fuel metering
and distribution parts within your
vehicle as well as install that
high-tech and smaller tank we talked
about earlier all in it could be a five
to ten thousand dollar conversion jobs
quite a lot of folks you now have never
done it and once you do a CNG conversion
the cartoons to be a little less of a
performance car the Civic GX for example
is about 1.8 seconds slower to 60 then
it's gas engine sibling although most
folks who buy these cars don't buy them
for dragster performance and finally all
this combustion technology and tank
technology leads to a more expensive car
like most other alternative fuel
vehicles there's a five six seven
thousand dollar Delta that you've got to
work off in cost savings on the fuel
as well as whatever rebates or credits
are available to you so here's my tech
shopping list I'm watching to see where
CNG cars are really gonna go first of
all keep an eye on tank design we talked
about the hurdles in the current tank
future designs may involve a couple of
new things first of all multi
compartment tanks that can be made of
small strong compartments linked
together shape to fit where the car
really wants them that increases
capacity as does a technology that would
put sort of a honeycomb a carbon
honeycomb inside the tank that has much
more surface area on which to attach the
compressed gas this is all part of a
federal government bounty to create a
much better lighter higher capacity tank
for far less money that can get around
these expensive cylinders we're dealing
with now next I'm watching home CNG
compressor design other it's a filling
station for your home you can get these
today they cost three four thousand
dollars another three thousand to
install most folks aren't able to swing
that the government's got another bounty
program out there saying look who can be
the first to bring a five hundred dollar
home compressor fueling station on the
market that'll get the job done easily
overnight from your low-pressure home
source then there's fuel cost again not
my expertise but the idea that there's a
big Delta between natural gas and
gasoline is key to the appeal of these
vehicles finally fuel sustainability
right now we get most of our natural gas
out of sources that are prehistoric and
our finite going forward there's lot of
research being done into getting
biomethane methane that is coming from
sorts of waste we create all the time
and other avenues of life</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
