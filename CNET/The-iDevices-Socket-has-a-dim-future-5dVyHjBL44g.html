smart house why because everybody needs
lights and you can get a smart switch or
bulb and it will change the way that
your home functions but a new product
the iDevices socket is neither a bulb
nor a switch this thing lets you screw
in any standard bulb and voila you could
schedule it dim it and control it using
Siri or alexa plus it includes this
nifty LED ring nightlight now on a
technical level the iDevices socket
performs really admirably the problem is
it's 80 bucks and I can't think of a
single use case where a smart LED plug
or switch wouldn't do the same thing
more affordably say you want to use the
socket in a lamp first off it won't fit
under many lampshades because it's so
bulky secondly you can get features like
dimming scheduling and voice control
from Cheaper smart plugs and bulbs which
both work with lamps ok so say you want
to use it in a light fixture instead
that means you can't use a smart plug
the problem is the socket still doesn't
add any features that a smart bulb or
in-wall switch can't replicate for less
money
finally let's say you want to install
particular lights that aren't smart like
Edison bulbs
well the socket is still going to be
attached to them which kind of ruins the
aesthetic appeal and in most cases an
in-wall switch will do most of the same
things again for less money so at the
end of the day unless you're looking for
a one light fixture that works with one
bulb that isn't smart that needs smart
features and you need it to be homekit
compatible this really isn't gonna be
the best option for you and even then
it's gonna be kind of pricey so if you
do have a situation like that at least
you can take comfort in the fact that
you are a unique snowflake and almost
nobody else will have that problem</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
