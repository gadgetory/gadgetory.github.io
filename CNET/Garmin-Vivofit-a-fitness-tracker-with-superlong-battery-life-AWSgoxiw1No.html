of fitness trackers out there that are
all aiming to get you healthier I've
played with a bunch of them some have
worked better than others one of the
best and one that we hadn't looked at
yet is by a company called Garmin the
Garmin vivofit now Nike FuelBand who
knows where that'll be you can't get the
Fitbit force but if you want something
that's a watch plus a fitness band on
your wrist the Garmin vivofit is
probably one of the best things out
there for a couple of reasons first of
all because it's always on and it tells
the time which if you want to watch type
accessory that helps also it's
water-resistant so you can take it in
the shower also this has a year plus a
battery life that's because it uses a
little coin battery inside instead of
having to charge now you will have to
replace that battery yourself a little
screwdriver at some point but you're
saving yourself the effort of always
having to get a little USB or dongle and
do it yourself so if you like the idea
of a simple solution and you're not
really into multiple chargers this is
probably for you also it doesn't just do
the step counting and some motivational
goal-setting we'll get to that in a sec
but it also works as a heartrate monitor
not on its own but it will pair with one
and what we're talking about is a
conductive band heart rate monitor which
is not the type that would fit on your
wrist and use an LED light but more the
old-fashioned type that you'd use if
you're into doing this at the gym you
have to wet this you have to tie it
around your chest you have to attach it
but these are ANT+ enabled heart rate
monitors which is a different wireless
technology than bluetooth if you want to
get in the weeds with that and this will
pair with any of those and there are a
bunch out there and it will read the
heart rate right from this device that's
a nice plus for motivation much like the
Nike FuelBand which gets you to move or
the jawbone up which buzzes your wrist
this will actually start to get a red
bar if you've been sitting around and
being lazy for an hour and every 15
minutes the bar gets a little bit higher
so you better get up and get moving
unfortunately this does not have a
vibration to buzz you and remind you so
if you're really lazy and sitting around
as I've done I will forget and I will
look down who knows how many hours have
passed and I need to get moving again
but it's nice to have and the goals
which you can set yourself
we'll also smartly adjust so that each
day that you achieve it will set a new
step goal to work along with you if
you've been getting better or if you
feel it's a little tough it will
actually lower the goal a bit its
wirelessly connects it works with iOS
and Android but the view of it doesn't
work with all Android phones view ones
that are compatible according to Garmin
include the HTC One Samsung Galaxy
phones you want to be able to have
Bluetooth 4.0 and Android 4.3 or higher
but you may want to check and make sure
on Garmin's website to be sure also it
does work with PC and Mac with an
included USB ant converter but message
boards have said people sometimes people
make success I would suggest you go with
the mobile app first the Garmin vivofit
is 1:29 pretty good price and has a
variety of bands you can pop into one of
the more interesting solutions out there
if you are ready for a fitness band
that's on the basic side I'm Scott Stein
and that's the Garmin vivofit</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
