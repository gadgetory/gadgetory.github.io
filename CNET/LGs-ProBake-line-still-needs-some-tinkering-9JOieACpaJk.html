lot of the same from this manufacturer
now this evan from LG is a gas range
that's thirty inches wide and covered in
Salus steel it looks really good with
nice sturdy handles and blocky features
but when it gets to performance it's a
little up and down let's take for
instance the chicken now LG ovens that
I've tested can roast a mean chicken and
this oven was no different however when
it came time for my double rack biscuit
test the biscuits on the bottom rack
were consistently a lot browner than the
ones on top which was a really big
disappointment especially because this
oven is equipped with the probate
convection feature that LG likes to brag
about and the broil times for this oven
are also pretty slow it took an average
of 20 minutes to cook six hamburger
patties which is pretty slow when it
comes to gas ranges now the hamburger
patties were pretty good and juicy it
had a nice sear on them but I don't want
to wait around all day to eat a burger
now even though the oven did have other
redeeming qualities like fast boil toms
and easy to use features it's not enough
to make this range which cost fifteen
$99.99 worth the price unfortunately the
spotty performance from this LG if we
want to look at some other gas ranges</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
