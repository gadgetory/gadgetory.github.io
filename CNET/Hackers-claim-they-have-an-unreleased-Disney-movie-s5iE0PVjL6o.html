Hollywood hackers The Hollywood Reporter
posted an article saying Walt Disney CEO
Bob Iger revealed that was exactly the
case to a bunch of Walt Disney employees
in a town hall meeting it appears a
group of hackers have demanded an
undisclosed ransom from the company
claiming they had stolen an upcoming
film on Disney's release slate there's
no word on which movie the hackers might
have lifted this year Disney will be
releasing five additional major
blockbusters pirates of the caribbean
dead men tell no tales Cars three
spider-man homecoming Dia de los Muertos
animated film Coco and Star Wars Episode
eight the last Jedi of course there's
also a chance these hackers only have
the first 20 minutes of a movie or they
could be completely bluffing and have
nothing at all the group asked for the
ransom to be paid via Bitcoin and if
their demands weren't met the movie
would be chopped up and released to the
public in increments which sounds kind
of like a cliche kidnapping movie Eiger
reportedly told those Walt Disney
employees the company will be working
with federal law enforcement to find the
people responsible for the threat and
will not be paying up which totally
makes sense because everybody knows you
never pay kidnappers or negotiate with
terrorists in movies maybe they could
hire John wick to hunt down these guys
oh my god this could be its own movie
you're super welcome for your next
blockbuster Hollywood for more
