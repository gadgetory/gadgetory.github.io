the news and there's new tech for
tracking Santa I'm Bridget Carey and
this is your cnet update facebook is
hoping to raise the quality of posts on
your newsfeed by showing you more links
to news articles and fewer mean images
and clickbait junk articles facebook
wants you to engage more with posts from
high quality websites so it may suggest
more news stories to read on a similar
subject and if you feel like you keep
seeing the same stuff over and over
again that's because facebook is
resurfacing stories that keep getting
new comments if smart glasses are on
your holiday wish list but you can't get
google glass the company music's is
selling its version of a computerized
headset for one thousand dollars it's
the m100 smart glasses and they're
available for pre-order with a ship date
of two to four weeks it has a small
screen that sits near your eye and it
also has a 5 megapixel camera it's
powered by Android and features Wi-Fi
Bluetooth GPS a speaker for your ear and
a microphone it can link to a phone with
pre-installed apps if it sounds a little
too geeky for you well the company says
it's targeting this to the professional
market like say people who need to do
inventory quickly in a stock room and
they could just take photos and scan
barcodes with the headpiece camera Apple
just paid 200 million dollars to buy a
company called top C which sorts through
data on Twitter top C is the go-to
company for tracking Twitter
conversation trends during big events
like for example the Super Bowl so what
can Apple do with the power of Topsy
perhaps it can help Apple sell more
songs on iTunes when it detects an
artist is trending on Twitter or maybe
Apple just wants to use the engineering
team to quickly detect trends in its App
Store tracking Santa this year just got
a little more touch screen friendly
thanks to microsoft for the second year
in a row the Santa tracking team at
NORAD partner with Microsoft and the
company gave the website NORAD Santa org
a redesign so it works best on internet
explorer 11 and it lets you spin a 3d
glow
with your finger if you're using a
Windows 8 touchscreen tablet or laptop
the website has plenty of games and
activities to keep you busy up until
Christmas bing maps will track Santa's
journey and this year you can contact
the NORAD Santa tracking command center
with skype but you can still dial the
number from a telephone if you want and
there's a Santa tracking app for Windows
that has a live tile to see Santa's
progress on Christmas Eve from your
Start screen that's your tech news
