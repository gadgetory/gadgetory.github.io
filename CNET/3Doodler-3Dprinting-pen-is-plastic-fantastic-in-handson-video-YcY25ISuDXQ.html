massive printing box you can do it with
a simple pen this is the 3doodler a
Kickstarter funded project that's
getting its first public airing at the
ephah tradeshow in Berlin now the
principle of this gadget is quite simple
it looks like a big chunky pen you stick
a rod of plastic in the back and when
you press one of these buttons on the
front it gets heated up on the inside
and kind of pushed out to the front in a
plastic e-liquid goo that's when things
get creative after that you use that hot
plastic to sculpt tiny sculptures we've
seen some very impressive demonstrations
here like this Eiffel Tower model but
having a go myself
it does feel quite simple to create fun
with all 3d doodles I imagine with a bit
more practice you could create something
very very cool look I made a flower now
what about the plastic itself well each
3doodler comes with two packs of plastic
there are 32 different types of plastic
in total and they're going to cost $10
each to buy to give you an idea of how
much plastic you'll be using I'm told at
that Eiffel Tower sculpture involves
five or six different sticks it's going
to be on sale in the first few months of
next year it's going to cost $99 and
extra sticks of plastic are going to
cost $10 each it looks very cool I think
it's very exciting but make sure you
