facebook is also working on Wi-Fi drones
a room that can take you anywhere in the
world you want to go get what kind of
and smart hair that's pretty much it
it's it's smart hair weird tomorrow
daily
greetings citizens of the internet
welcome to tomorrow daily the best ski
talk show in the known universe i am
your host Ashley scale Jimmy's always on
Monday kill anonymous freshly after this
weekend of extreme media there's so much
stuff to watch gonna say you it's like
extreme coach ello the man good to go
outside that much between game of
thrones of daredevil some photo uh
Silicon Valley last me on earth yeah mad
men it's like it's all coming down but
i'm done now and we can actually talk
about not in the world so let's do that
let's do that's at the headlines okay so
we know facebook is working on internet
drones we talked about that like a
couple weeks ago its crave it yeah which
is really insane that there's gonna be I
feel like this is now going to be a
trend after reading this story because
there is now another company working on
internet drones so I have this dystopian
image of drones flying the sky like
giving us internet it's so weird so this
company quark ssin has completed a test
flight and they actually have video of
this it's not just them saying at a
conference like oh hey like we did this
this is their sky orbiter drone and this
is actually a model so it's a small
model of what the actual drew these are
like big drunk sober we talked about the
wingspan of the Facebook drone it was
like the size of a Boeing 737 the way is
serious yeah so these ones are pretty
similar to that like they have really
big wing spans this is where they did it
they said they don't want to say where
because they tested it in a secret
location ooh because I the country there
there the Portuguese government is like
we don't like this we don't approve of
it so they I don't know where exactly
they did this test but this is the video
of it and they said it went really well
they they said that obviously they had
kind of a makeshift runway and didn't
really have like optimal an optimal
setting to do the test in but they said
it went well enough and they were able
to beam down a Wi-Fi signal which is
very cool all right um and they said
that these drones that they are planning
on they want to keep them in the sky for
weeks months or even years these are
solar-powered drones the same as face
and they they did get information to
optimize the prototype but they didn't
spend a whole lot of time in the sky I
think because they didn't want anybody
know really that was kind of what they
were doing so and they actually their
CEO thinks that mass production of these
could start in four to six months which
is pretty soon and that's like a
Kickstarter four to six months delivery
and then he also thinks and this is kind
of unfortunately I guess for quark ssin
he thinks that he is they're going to
have to move their company either
partially or entirely out of the country
to be able to actually move forward with
these drones because a lot of government
sub kind of frown on this like they're
not real keen on the idea that you know
we don't want kind of these drones
flying around in the sky giving giving
people internet access I don't it's like
I kind of understand because I'm sure
there's a concern of like espionage or
or hacking them and then like crashing
them into stuff but yeah I there's a lot
of countries that are not too too
thrilled about it so they're saying they
might have to leave Portugal how do they
expect to keep them in the air if
Portugal doesn't want them in the air
yeah I mean well they want to go to
another country where the government's
like more willing they want to do it in
a different country realistically not
Portugal well yeah I mean it might have
to end up being that they go to a
different country and then and only do
it there but I mean there are other
countries I'm sure where they wouldn't
move their company but they be able to
take the drones there and say when we'd
like to offer you the opportunity to
have these drones bring Wi-Fi to people
who otherwise can't have internet never
say how good the wife is from these
things so I've been hearing a pretty
varied range on speeds like I think a
lot of them are kind of like LTE speeds
like beso got pretty okay pretty okay
like they're not you're not getting like
you know 2g it's not so you're not gonna
be so sorry like it's but it's not it's
no google fiber so arts a no fios it's
no no fiber internet but it's I mean
it's it's very reasonable pretty okay
and for a lot of these sort of
underserved areas they're not going to
be running around with a whole bunch of
you know Galaxy Note fours and iphone 6
plus is they're going to have feature
phones that are inexpensive kind of
these like entry models that you see
from Microsoft and like Windows Phone
and then Android how
kind of these like emerging market
devices so I think that's kind of what
you would see all right which is totally
usable then so there you go cool well
that's uh yeah so it's Facebook and then
these guys yeah also google right
Google's named Project loon with the
remote control balloons that given
that's the worst name it's it alone hmm
it makes me feel so whimsical it's
kisses of the balloon right that's the
okay still dumb all right so let me tell
you about let me tell you about a singer
plural all right no plural let's take a
plural very clever name was as far as
getting a Singapore and it's about it is
a convention celebrating design so we
have one thing that came out of this
that really like that impressed us and
it was actually a booth done by Airbnb
if you don't know that is an online
being be a bed and breakfast thing where
you can have you can like book
somebody's house in or like an apartment
all over the world everyone just
anywhere pretty oh they decided to show
that off by showing you one room that
could be any number of rooms oh ok so
here it is it's it basically what what
they have here is they designed this one
white room that just has a bed and a
couch and a TV and it's all white but
they use a projector to project that
what it would look like in different
locations oh so they do a lot of exotic
locations it's really cool yeah they do
they do there's different stuffs the
first stop is Bali okay see tropical
images bamboo screen and the ocean
outside your window then they go to
Malaysia then they go to Paris you can
see it's whopping two different
locations then it's pretty cool yeah it
looks like a little Hut on the outside
you go to Paris and you can see the
Eiffel Tower outside then you go to
Tokyo they're sliding screens it's just
a creative add it doesn't look like
they're like trying to make this like a
like a destination I yeah but you can
see there's the room without any of the
projections on it and then when they see
the projection be isn't for you look
there's crazy that's assume that's Bali
hello honey but yeah there you go this
is so it's basically just to show off
Airbnb and these are real locations
right and these are actual places you
can like book on air B&amp;amp;B which is I like
that I think that's pretty awesome
right so there you go it's just a
creative way to do advertising but it's
also kind of like a cool look at how you
can use future tech I like that too
would you put my bedroom I was gonna say
like would you put this into your I
would love to have something like that
in like a bedroom or the living room
remind would be messed up i wouldnt try
to be like fallout horror take a bolo
stole your like I wanted just clown
faces like nine would just be mine would
be like what I relaxin kales nightmare
fuel just like nope you can't sleep in
this room well that actually brings us
to our hashtag a day which is TD stay
and the question is exactly what we're
just talking about if you could put this
in your bedroom what would you have it
brought look what would you have these
projections what's your job what would
you want to promote would be like the
dreamlike room that you could say now a
lot of people would probably expect me
to say pizza but i would feel saddened
by this and wouldn't be able to eat any
of the things around nights can't do it
so no mine would probably be something
terrifying like it would be an alarm
clock for me okay it would be you know
how that we should we talk about the
thing that projects a light or not
really well imagine like i have
sometimes get have trouble getting out
of bed imagine if i woke up and
everything was clown faces horrible
scary my dental look look get out of the
room running into the shower you're
right i'm ready to go so I think I guess
my officer answers clown face that is a
very that's a very interesting alarm
clock that I think says a lot about you
what about you i think i would go with
okay kind of a weird tangent story i'll
try to keep it short went to this
restaurant one time and i think it was
called Atlantis and on the walls they
had they I don't think there are
projections I think they're actual like
screens that were built into the walls
and they had three different areas you
go to you could go to Atlanta so you
could go to the the Serengeti or you
could go to gosh I don't remember the
third one but it was like a living the
one that I was in with a Savannah so it
was like you sat down to eat and the Sun
would rise in the Sun would set and you
would see animals that actually live in
Africa like walking through go to the
water hole like everything you see lions
like chasing after gazelles and stuff
it's a very realistic depiction of that
world and I thought that was so cool at
the
I'm i want to say a guy was like 16 when
i saw this oh my god so much better but
I feel like that would be so cool to be
able to see like i love the Airbnb idea
of being able to pick a city but being
able to watch it may be from the outside
in real time like where you can watch
people like walking or a real time would
be cool like a live feed yeah like a
real-time satellite feed from like
inside a different place in a different
part of the world so it's like today I
would like to be in Australia and then
it's like you hit the Australia but and
there's a live feed of the for the
windows that show you like what's
happening right outside like in Sydney
or something I think that would be
really cool so i would go with like live
webcam public web cams all over the
world where you could like pick
different locations and it would give
you the interior that would give you an
idea of like what the architecture was
like in that city in that place and
maybe you could also pick a time period
so you would say like i would like to
stay in the edo period in japan you
could go way back and you stay in these
like big elaborate sort of houses and
it's like the time you can see samurai
training out in the yard and like all
this stuff like that would be awesome so
time is sort of a time machine you
didn't have a very short answer no I did
it wasn't like clown face and no to wake
me up now I'd also like to interject
that mine could be fire to everything
could be on fire wake up and scared cuz
everything's on fire see I'm telling you
it's limitless TD stay tell us what you
were you'd say I really love that idea
is so funny to me um okay so the very
last one this is smart hair it's all
hair wear and okay I great transition I
responded uh the same as this as you did
where you're like okay like not sure
sounds a little weird but this actually
has the potential to kind of be
something cool like I thought this was
sort of neat so Katie Vega is the
researcher in charges she created a hair
extension with a capacitive wire inside
of it so you can use these little hair
extensions as a touch input for your
smartphone so notice as she's touching
it you see the phone is noticing which
one she's touching so one two three okay
waiting for the applications okay so
she's gonna yeah so okay mortgage ok so
you
can it has okay it's got a remote touch
sensor there's like a barrette that has
an Arduino controller in it and
bluetooth so that you can send the
commands to your phone and basically
they have three different locations on
the hair extension that you can touch
like three different sections and based
on how you touch it so if you just give
it a tap maybe it activates an app on
your phone and then maybe if you caress
that lock then it will do something like
send your location take a selfie record
a conversation like do whatever you
program it to do so like here she is
taking a selfie with her a pair this
piece is like some spy stuff right here
like you get you're in a situation you
just like Oh mr. evil guy what's your
plan exactly mr. record record the whole
thing it's like that's crazy anyway mr.
Bhalla makes you look flirtatious to
have to like do all that stuff that's
crazy ok give me get one anymore so yeah
so it connects there say she's saying
that they already tested this at a
conference in Atlanta people were able
to try it and they were able to take
selfies with it and so it is an actual
functioning thing it is this is a real
thing on no word on commercial-use so
things like I have a feeling like some
government is you don't like by this
lady like not the hair it's just to buy
her never develop it like in house like
I was like put her in some sort of
secret facility somewhere I can't see
many of my lady friends being like oh I
want to touch my hair and like take
pictures or whatever I mean it seems
like it's not really answering a prop
but I do like the lace I well spying
there's there's of course like a spy
like safety safety that's the big one
where it's like if you don't feel safe
in a situation it might not be the best
thing ever to like take your phone out
come on so this video you would program
maybe you're you would program your hair
if you moved it in a certain way to text
a friend say I'm I'm at this location
here's my GPS coordinates I please help
or you would send it you could text
night I think it's some countries you
have the ability to actually text 911 I
think we do too in certain states this
is another one I feel like most of our
audience would have a better would have
better ideas for yeah we would yeah like
mine was immediately lightly like
well you know you're you're you're drunk
at a club and you can't like you're so
drunk you can't drive you just call your
uber or touching your hair well because
you're already like oh hi I'm so good
wasted like or whatever I would say like
if I'm stressed out like maybe you pull
on your hair a little bit or you're just
like frustrated and then all of a sudden
like a massage place comes there like we
noticed you were stressed out we're
gonna give you a massage see we're not
good at these no I'm not good at these
you come up with one's better please
thank you all right so that's a that's
hair where hair where is a real thing is
the passage of hair wait I forgot is she
trying to sell these I no not yet okay
they're just basically prototype she's a
she's a researcher at the pontifical
catholic university of rio de janeiro so
she's this is like her big thing so i
right number one used safety number to
espionage those are your two options
really i think number one use SPS safety
in espionage you need to get out of a
drop point you just use your hair weird
um all right guys we're going to take a
quick break we will be right back and
when we come back with a kind of a back
of a racket it's not a crowd fund it's
actually a voting thing so I found this
though and I thought it was interesting
and we also have your user feedback from
last week TD Brutus and our photog refer
the day so don't click away it's
tomorrow daily
so a really brief update on that poor
poor drone that was swatted out of the
sky by the monkey in our break video the
drone did not survive the terrible
attack but the GoPro did that monkey has
wanted now in 15 states yeah he's on the
run if you see that monkey please call
your local police officer he's armed and
dangerous I feel like this is a little
different but I feel like we could give
them maybe votes because that's what
they're looking for a looking for votes
in this situation so I guess we vote or
don't vote ok mozart don't vote ok
wearables smartwatches really big right
now Apple watch pre-orders happened last
Friday people make a big deal out of it
a lot of wearables trying to kind of
write on the Alpha watches coattails and
pick up people who are like I don't want
to have to watch but I may be interested
in something else that sort of suits my
needs so there are a lot of people who
decided not to get an Apple watch so
that's where didja tox comes in so this
company is called digit ox digit talks
digit rocks oh ok gotcha digit ox yeah
just shocks um kind of weird alternate
to a SmartWatch because in essence it
makes your actual watch that use right
now into a sort of SmartWatch so odd
clever yeah this is pretty clever so
it's a little disc and it attaches to
your any watch that you have any any
regular old watch that you have and you
can so you can make your favorite watch
kind of a intelligent watch and then
they have this you have this ability to
kind of do a deep dive into your apps
and say I only want notifications like
if this happens or so here's that the
app so it'll say like only if I get the
out these are the only notifications I
want to get if i get messages from these
people calls from these people emails
from these people so and you can also
keywords so it's like maybe you get a
regular email from somebody with I don't
know I'd like a daily rundown of
something at your job that you don't
necessarily need to look at right away
but you want emails from them if they if
it's not that email if it's something
else you want to make sure you're
notified you can get those notifications
you like program it very specifically to
like notify you so you're not getting
like that fire hose of notifications
where it's like your wrist is constantly
buzzing okay so that's that's the gist
of it is that you would be able to get a
message and it vibrates your watch yes
the disc has like a little but it's not
like it changes the screen of your phone
no it's just a little vibrating
notification thing yeah okay how much is
it ok so the voting thing is actually
that's it they're not selling it it's
not a crowdfunding yet it's part of a
contest i guess like Virgin Mobile is
doing this contest called pitch to rich
it seems like a little shark tank kind
of thing where people pitch their ideas
and everybody votes on it it's online I
think it's a UK contest and so people
can vote on good ideas there and like I
said they basically say two things their
goals are they want you to be able to
digitally detox on your smart watches
and stuff they're like basically this is
kind of the notification that most
people really need with a SmartWatch
they don't need to get every
notification through their wrist like
you really only want the most important
things and that'll help you not look at
your phone as often serum say yeah yeah
like and then then then the other part
of it is a lot of people have a favorite
watch and they don't didn't want a
SmartWatch they want to be able to use
their watching you a lot of people have
a favorite watch I would say there are a
lot of people who wear a watch that have
a favorite watch and wouldn't
necessarily be interested in upgrading
to an Apple watch but might be
interested in something like this do a
lot of people have a watch uh well it
depends may depends on where you are in
the world one and then two it depends on
I mean like most people I know my age in
this area don't watch a--'s like my
husband wears a watch every day but he
doesn't have any interest in a
SmartWatch so how can this be how can
how is this better than if they had
created an app that only makes my phone
vibrate when i get an important message
so i think how is that how is that
different especially since if this
vibrates and I was like oh I got an
email for my boss that says fired and
that's the key word that I'm looking for
how does how does the watch vibrating
make any sort of difference than my
phone vibrating whereas when it vibrates
then I look at it I think how is that
better I think it's a really good point
and I would say I'm the only thing I
would argue with is that a lot of people
might not have their phones handy like
if they sit at a desk maybe their phone
is like you know across the desk or
maybe they have it in their computer bag
a lot of people especially in the UK a
lot of people take the tube a lot of
people walk everywhere so they're
constantly using messenger bags things
like that maybe your phone would be in
there as opposed to in your pocket so i
would say in that way in your purse in
your messenger bag your computer bag
your bag pack whatever you can keep your
phone in there and then that way you
know if something important comes so if
you don't carry your phone in your
pocket and you also wear a watch it's
very nice yeah and you also wear a watch
but you also need notifications with
specific keywords because you get
message that much right then this is the
device for you exactly sorry it's cool I
wanted to bring this to you cuz I
thought you would have interesting
things to say about it which you do I
think those are really good arguments I
think that's really it's very specific I
feel like they very much or something
out here like it could make sense
there's some potential but you gotta
have a watch already like yeah well
maybe I mean this is like dude this is
like almost like half tech like this is
almost I feel like I'm sure this you
provide you with a cuff you could
probably do it with a thicker bracelet
cuz it doesn't look huge so I mean you
could probably put it on one of those
things like you wouldn't necessarily be
beholden to a watch but I think that's
sort of what their marketing it is so
would you give it a voter now I don't
know any of the other contestants of
this contest but I mean regardless but I
don't because I'm gonna do like on shark
tank I don't really know much about
watches nor do I wear a watch typically
so I'm out i think i'm with you i think
i'm with you i also it's nothing much
cool tech it also won't it feels like
this will be
coolin long to me it feels like this
would be really useful in areas where
people a use a lot of public
transportation and have their phones in
bags and stuff like the fact that you're
having a list of all right that's it
right it's very nice like that this is a
very narrow use case for like I would
say it's a very narrow use case so I'd
say no I can't even think of messages
that again my phone vibrates when
something is up like you know and I can
tell it like hey don't alert me unless
this happens all right and then not only
that when it goes off uh-oh my
girlfriend is you know is leaving me
then I can look at it and be like oh
noes your fire emoji hey Dad emoji but
there are apps that allow you to really
kind of dig deep into whitelisting and
all that stuff so I I say no but I did
think it was interesting enough to bring
on the show Logan your vote no he says
nope three nopes we know it's pretty
harsh but ash wait maybe they came up
with a new use for it i don'ti there
needs to be another use their something
is missing I'm out okay fair enough so I
let us know what you guys are called
again sir you can look it up it is
called digit digit ox digitana but talk
like the clock yeah like tick tock not
TLX yeah it just took Avengers okay guys
it's time to talk about what you think
about different things that we put up on
the show it is time for user feedback
okay so last week we saw the adorable
dog Brutus who had for prosthetic legs
yeah pause thetic legs I know this is
the second time you've tried not a jit
Rottweiler no all right uh so you guys
had some really great ideas on what you
would also like to add to Brutus's
repertoire of abilities to make him sort
of a Superdog all right looks really
good ones um I'm gonna try to pronounce
this and I'm sorry if I mess it up um do
me so says I would get Brutus a pair of
sleep things fangs that inject sleep
serum into bad guys leaving them knocked
out for the cops holy crap I love that
Gregory wrote in said I think brutish
should have telescoping legs so he
doesn't have to jump up on you lick your
face he could walk long distances in
just a few steps and he fetch kites
while there's still
here I love no that's like um Mega Man's
dogs like google gadgets like go go
gadget dog yeah but mega mans dog
already has those extended legs elbows
name is um Tim please somebody's
screaming at us right now exam as much
Michael wrote in and said I would make
Brutus like spyro the dragon and give
him fire breath I don't get what was the
goal here to make him kill people no
he's a super dog he could fight crime
okay sleeps here on me see you looking
so it sounds like the judgment it's like
Batman like you he's making the judgment
call to burn someone or alive and he's a
dog put them to sleep and leave him for
the cop again also scary house is very
no just actually made a really good
point not an upgrade but said Brutus
still needs a poop catcher and sent us
this which I did not realize that is a
real product poo trap it's like a
harness on a dog with a bag on the back
which man if you're putting your dog in
that we need to have a talk you guys I
like the idea that he has to like carry
it around oh my god okay so that was a
pilot I think that made me laugh good
perfect Frank wrote in and said hashtag
bat dog he looks like Batman's dog give
him a bionic batwing so when he gets
tired of walking he could just fly away
I can't the flying I get all the fine i
was flying around but no i'm n-not to
reuse the back I like it I like the bat
one and then very lastly I thought this
was very sweet Neil wrote in and said I
would give Brutus a hug and now we all
feel good about ourselves except for
calyx he has no heart so how it works
dude uh-huh and then brew did you give
Brutus a hug and then Brutus wouldn't
bite you with his sleep fangs and knock
you out and a run away see I want to
make him more deadly he's just a sweet
guy I said I'd make him camel I'm gonna
love him alright alright so are very
macho very lies piece of user feedback
as always as our phone talker for the
day
you're gonna like this with pictures
from Tim Tim wrote in and said good
morning tomorrow daily team I'm living
an old beautiful city in a northern part
of germany called lubeck by the way this
is the city where marzipan was invented
00 Japan mavi pan I always liked the old
charm of it but never really discovered
it completely so when my exchange
partner from France came me and my
friends were on a small tour through the
city when we were on the st. petri
church tower chip I took this picture of
