supposed to get on a horse and ride a
horse out and I'm terrified of horses
just what we're about to shoot I said
well whose motorcycle is that I go well
that's your brother's like well you know
if he could ride bikes I could probably
ride bikes too and so they changed the
horse for the motorcycle last minute
because I was freaking out his horses
cuz they have giant eyeballs and they
can feel your smell your fear it was a
Honda rebel which is not the toughest
motorcycle in the world and I lived in
downtown LA before there was a downtown
all day it was just like trash cans on
fire everywhere and you'd have a bunch

Buell and s1 lightning which is a cool
bike it's very kind of futuristic back

I have this one that's made from an old

with fur on the inside like that movie
that we</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
