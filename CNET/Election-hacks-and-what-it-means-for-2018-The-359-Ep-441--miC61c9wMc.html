welcome to the 359 I'm Ben Fox Ruben I'm
Roger Tsien I'm alfred hang so Alfred
you just got back from Vegas where you
attended the Def Con and blackhat
cybersecurity conferences
first of all what was what was it like
how did you like it I mean there was a
ton of cybersecurity news that had come
out of there I think I wrote like nine
stories in three days all right so I'm
trying to but yeah I mean I think the
big headline there was most likely the
election hacking village this is the
second year in a row that they've done
it this time around they wanted to prove
all the naysayers wrong by basically
saying we're putting mostly machines
that are already in use because there
was a criticism of last year's a voter
hacking village oh we don't even use
that machine anymore so about 70% of the
machines that were brought this time war
are actually being used in this year's
election okay mmm
so and how easy were they to hack I mean
like are we in a lot of trouble I mean
so a lot of them were pretty simple to
hack but another criticism of it of this
year's village is is basically you know
yeah but they have unlimited access so
they can just go in and have as much
time as they want with it during in an
actual election on election day you know
you have all these volunteers watching
you and making sure you don't go and put
like a flash drive in it or anything
like that but I think there's still you
know a lot of valid points being made
from here where basically the idea is
okay but you're still using this machine
and like just because you have people
watching for it doesn't mean that there
can't be you know some issue with like
physical security where like your
volunteer is not looking at it at this
time and then the idea is like if people
lose their confidence in an election in
the voting machines like even if it's
just one machine that's compromised
totally point is you know I don't know
if I can really trust who we elected
anymore or anything like that
yeah let's go to Teddy Ruxpin you just
published this like earlier this morning
about hacking the new Teddy Ruxpin and
it seems kind of kind of weird yeah so
this was more of a fun story so parents
out there who have a Teddy Ruxpin I just
want you to know that this isn't one of
those hacks that you know your kids
information is lost or anything like
that
basically a cyber security researcher
wanted to take a look and see if he
could put anything that he wanted on it
Teddy Ruxpin has a complex file system
that like you can only accepts files in
a certain system but he was able to do
it
and he basically took a video clip from
the movie hackers from like 1995 where
guys yelling hack the planet and then he
puts it on the Teddy Ruxpin and its eyes
are showing like the Def Con logo
instead of it's like cute like blue LED
eyes yeah but yeah this is this guy that
had done it is already in IOT security
researcher and he anytime he gets like a
smart toy for his kid or anything like
that he wants to see all the different
ways that he can hack it so this one was
kind of safe so he gave it to his kid
and now he can put any story that he
wants on it so but also what was it easy
to actually hacked a Ruxpin um I mean
once he figured out what kind of like
files that it needed and like how to
convert like his images and audio into
that filed and yes but you know I think
the whole process of figuring that out
might have taken a bit longer nice also
we wanted to talk about smart cities too
so this is this is something where more
things are getting connected these days
and I guess that means there are more
vulnerabilities in more ways to like
hack into a smart city right yeah this
is much more serious than the the Teddy
Ruxpin hack so these were they these
researchers basically took a look at
secure smart city systems from three
different companies that you know one
does like controlling lighting two one
does like flood warnings and then
another one does like road stuff like
for smart cars and things like that
and they found like really simple
vulnerabilities like some of them had
like their password set on by default
some of them Vic yeah so like one of the
tips that they basically gave to these
companies like maybe you should like
change your passwords if you're gonna
like implement them in your tip for
everybody yeah when it comes to smart
cities though I reached out to the three
companies all them who said they fixed
it one of them behind the cars basically
said you know we don't test this on
public roads that they were being used
by the Federal Highway Administration
but it wasn't being used on any public
roads thankfully so there's not that
much of a danger there either nice well
luckily now I'm terrified about
everything lastly we wanted to give a
shout out to Claire Reilly's story on
coober pedy an opal mining town in
Australia where people live in
underground mining holes definitely
check out the story if you want to read
more about these stories check us out on
SEANET thanks for listening everybody
I'm Ben Fox Ruben rotor Chang I'm Alfred
and thanks everybody for joining us for
the recording of the audio podcast now
as always I'm gonna jump into the chat
and try to pull out any good questions
and comments you guys have about the
quest the topics at hand
Alfred you've had a really busy week I
want to hear I'm honestly I'm mostly
surprised to find out that the Teddy
Ruxpin has a complex file system you
would think that something like a toy
may be a little more easy to access
could you expand on that I would I would
understand why it has a complex file
system like mostly because they so the
only way you can get stories for your
Teddy Ruxpin is through the app itself
that like they they provide and it like
transfers over bluetooth so the way that
he did it those because because he
couldn't infiltrate the app he like
plugged a mini you like he plugged it
into the USB port in the back and
uploaded it that way and even when he
does that he can't create a new story
that you can access from the app you
basically have to replace the files from
another story so like you can open up
like I don't know what stories Teddy
Ruxpin has but let's say it has like the
Three Little Pigs you would like open
that up but and then you would put like
the stuff that you want it to play in
that file
how would you basically on the app play
Three Little Pigs yeah but I don't play
like what you want instead but yeah let
me look through this but like it's it's
very I guess like new it's very specific
so like for the images do it to somebody
else's remotely or you wouldn't be able
to do it to like thousands of the set
for the images on the eyes they have to
be 128 by 128 pixels because the eyes
are only like 1.25 inches and then the
audio itself has to be like a specific
type of wav file and then even beyond
that he have to you have to put it
through a what's it called a formatter
to make it a custom snx rom format I
have no idea what that what it is the
necks really just like a custom format
yeah for Teddy Ruxpin yeah yeah yeah
yeah sounds like more like a hobbyist
project yeah I mean definitely I think
this is one of those things you see it
black at Def Con right
like these random hacks that yeah
they're not practical but they're
interesting this yeah I'd really I
thought it was really interesting to see
you know the Teddy rocks been yelling
out hack the planet so mhm hey let's go
to that videotape shall we yeah let's do
it
where am I supposed to look there you go
sorry we just had to get a little taste
of that right Oh totally hey I kind of
want to do audio stuff yeah excellent
line Ben dude do we think this is gonna
open up a whole new market for like not
build-a-bear but like hack a bear kind
of thing custom custom toys for your
kids yeah so I asked him about that and
like if he's put any like specific
stories that he's done for his own kid
it turns out there's a lot of work that
goes into like the stories that Teddy
Ruxpin has on its own because like if it
tells you a story zyo Sonny out and then
like the arms are supposed to move too
and then like it shows like a sunny sky
so like you would have to have the
videos in the eyes timed to the story as
well so you know he did this project in
a way that was like this is fun for like
Def Con and like look look at this like
really novelty thing whereas like if you
wanted like a whole video thing like
synchronize like that's a lot of work
which like they do at you know wicked
toys the company behind Teddy Ruxpin but
like for a hacker or like I don't really
like you can put in the effort for it
but I don't know if I'd be war you know
I really love your kid if you would do
the custom story yeah would or to like
freak out your younger sister I suppose
that would be one reason you're the
hacker doing it though for like on your
sibling yes oh then I feel like there's
a story behind you in your siblings
oh there's a very long story let's go to
the chat and take some questions from
Fujian do you think that blockchain can
help with the election hacks they go on
wait wait wait they go on to say they go
on to say I think that I read several
governments are testing blockchain with
their elections to try and prevent these
what are your thoughts on that
okay so West Virginia rolled this out
last week they're doing a blockchain
based mobile election like voting thing
they're doing it from their phone here's
the thing about that though even if like
the app itself is working on blotching
your phone can be compromised so it's
like
the service like think about like when
people's Bitcoin wallets get like robbed
right its bitcoin is secured like
they're not gonna just straight-up steal
that but they can hack your computers to
take that and that's why it's a terrible
idea this is well it's a limited pilot
right now right it's specifically meant
for armed services that people people
that are serving overseas so they are
gonna test it out and III obviously
understand the blockchain is very much a
buzzword these days but the idea of
providing more capabilities more
technological capabilities for people to
vote I think is a good idea instead of
just doing paper balloting and showing
up at the voting booth ahlet's I think
it's important to like tested on thing
on votes that are inconsequential and
like don't matter before like putting
out on an election thing like maybe try
blockchain voting for American Idol or
like naming a boat yeah but oh yeah that
worked out really well at first and then
if that works out then maybe let's talk
about doing that for elections but like
because like this is not a place to like
test something out and in that sense you
know like Oh we'll see if it works and
then somehow an elected official is like
considered illegitimate because like it
might have had security issues but yeah
that's no no no - blockchain and
election security do you think from from
your perspective at black hat and DEF
CON do you think that because there's so
much more attention to election hacking
now than in 2016 that like they're more
prepared there's more awareness there's
a little bit more urgency in Tepeyac
actually preparing for the midday it
depends on what state and what county so
like the Department of Homeland Security
does a lot like they helped secure like
funding for a lot of states to get it
but at the same time not every state has
basically said like we need this and
they can't basically say like you can't
use this machine in your County because
it's run by state and local officials
you know and a speech from like you know
vice president Mike Pence about the week
before the UH
DEFCON he mentioned there are 14 states
currently that are still underfunded not
under funded but under prepared for
election day and the problem I'm
surprises I would have it's just 14 yeah
but the problem with this village at
least from my perspective was basically
that like yes they're doing a lot of
great research
yes they're finding a lot of
vulnerabilities but it is not going to
make it to election officials in time
like they're gonna put the report out in
September that's two months from
Election Day and and at that point
that's already - yeah even if there is a
massive vulnerability with like all the
voting machines in your County from this
report what are you gonna do like you're
not gonna like it's order a whole ton of
them within two months I mean go back to
paper ballots I mean the good thing I
guess is that you know they can use that
knowledge for the 2019 election but like
there's basically like not much that
they can do at this point which is
hilariously sad but I guess the hope is
that they are prepared already which DHS
has done a lot of work from 2016 onwards
to make sure that happens like it's not
like they've waited on tone now to tell
everybody like the question is whether
it's filtered down to the state level or
yes
yeah and that that is that is a pretty
big problem also a lot of like local
states have issues with like contract
stuff so it's like oh we want to switch
voting machines because you know when
you sold this to us like we didn't
really consider security vulnerabilities
or anything like that now like that we
are we don't want to use your machines
anyway well you're in a contract with us
till like 2022 yeah yeah yeah give us
more money um and I think that was that
was another factor that like is not
considered that much is like vendors so
like people when they look at election
security they look at they point the
fingers out like elected election
officials the DHS you know state and
local counties but it's also up to the
vendors you know they should be the ones
fixing these vulnerabilities not like
asking people like oh just buy different
stuff or switch to different thing I
agree with you yeah they're generally
not on the hot seat I mean like you
mentioned Diebold in yes Ori I think
there's probably a couple of other
vendors out there there it's like
there's just less awareness yeah for
that and it's much easier to you know
that's also on them yeah it's not I
agree I agree I think to Ben's point
they're like no one's getting angry at a
table door Diebold yeah they're getting
angry at the elected officials the state
yeah because there's just an easier
target
yes my point is that they should be
getting in Korea the vendors yeah and
somebody in the chat tell me how to
pronounce d-ball Diebold Bible is it
dible and whatever I vote as a Christmas
movie all right
starring Bruce Willis alright that's
gonna be like that I feel like that's a
good name for a die-hard sequel folder
off-brand that you got like Walmart nice
let's take another question from k-19
how does one get involved with Def Con I
always wonder if the convention is open
to the public
yeah it's open to the public you can
it's every summer and it's much less
expensive than blackhat but yeah you can
just go check it on their website and
find out when it is if they tell you
that Def Con is cancelled
that's not true that that is a
long-running joke with Def Con where
it's basically anybody that's like new
to it will ask like oh when is Def Con
or anything like that it was like it's
know what sometimes cancelled so most of
the times it's not canceled there's been
a few cases where it's come close to
being canceled from what I've heard yeah
it's also a joke yeah so just check it
on there yeah just check it on their
websites open to the public you can come
as press you can come as just a normal
person you can go as like a contestant
like that all these different contests
and stuff if your security researcher
I'm sure you know that you can go as a
speaker yeah they have they have all
these like different things that you can
go there for and what about black hat
same thing it's open to the public but
it's also much more expensive because
black hat is more for like corporate
like cybersecurity compromise which ones
the more fun I mean I guess it depends
on what you like like they have a show
floor for black hat where like they have
like Oh check out this stuff from like
Symantec I also do all these like weak
like kind of gimmick still I get you to
like stop at their booth oh yeah normal
trade yeah so if you like if you
like swag like if you like free stuff
black hat is for you there's some free
stuff there that's I got blockchain
necklace there um it's just it's
literally like a cinder like it's like a
3d printed cinder block on like a chain
that's kind of cool and you're not
wearing it now why it's at my desk I can
go get it but I don't want to walk off
set so okay thank you to mark
Fitzpatrick and Matthew dat you for
clearing it up it's pronounced Diebold
let's take one from our old friends
friend Roy why isn't or why aren't the
IT giant jumping into evm development
dubious elections are a worldwide
problem any corporate or any corporation
can make huge money by getting national
contracts well you can't get a national
contract for it was that's well
regardless like is this a minefield that
like a company like Google yeah that's
also yeah I don't think they want to be
apart of it regulated there's a lot
scrutiny there if it fails that's yeah
that's fine then their work with the
military has already been like seriously
sighs yeah scrutinized for sure so yeah
they may want to stay in their lane on
this one yeah it would take like it's an
interesting extreme amount of money for
them to jump into this dumpster fire
yeah and yeah - Alfred point it's not a
national contract you'd have to win them
state-by-state which I don't think is
worth it it's a lot of work you've got
to have basically lobbyists or sales
team in all 50 states sometimes
different counties within states and
that's just it's a lot trouble let's
take a couple more questions for a call
today
another one from Fujian how does hacking
into a phone prevent blockchain from
providing appropriate election votes
wouldn't people have to hack millions of
phones and if your vote is on blockchain
is it safe I mean in the same way that
like so if you use signal or you use
whatsapp or you've used iMessage like
that's encrypted like messaging like
that's supposed to be secure - you can't
like pick up like what I'm sending you
through signal through like Wi-Fi or
anything like that you can't like the NS
I can't really intercept that but what
they can do is they can like get if they
have access to my phone they can just
open the signal app and see it that way
that's what I mean like encryption yes
is like extremely secure and as is
blockchain but there are workarounds to
it that like makes it like
inconsequential in some scenarios right
but to to to is point hacking a bunch of
phones individually yes it's not
scalable yeah but like this wouldn't be
hacking phones in the sense of like you
can also hack like accounts like if you
can log into like your Android phone
with like you know using if I just have
access to like your gmail account or
something like that and then I can like
set up my phone to log into your Gmail
account
and then from there I can find out your
login to your blockchain voting app that
you have like that's like that's like a
pretty like good workaround for that
like your blockchain the vote itself
like is most likely secure like if
you're using like a form of encryption
on it but like there are like several
workarounds for that I just hope the
hackers have had my same political
leanings so they're just gonna vote the
same way I would anyway you know that's
that's what I would be it would be I
mean I guess if you had access to the
account information of like whatever
hundreds of thousands yeah accounts that
would work but I guess I mean that would
be kind of tough to scale if you didn't
have that yes yeah scaling is always
like the the biggest challenge on these
things so yeah I understand but I just
but like like the point that I mentioned
on the podcast also like even if it's
just one phone that's hacked and like
one phone that's compromised that's
still like really like shakes the core
of like confidence interactions right
and that's what like this whole hacking
village thing really is about for me at
least we're you know the the idea is and
they said this about the 2016
presidential election to where they
basically said like there's no proof
that any votes were altered by like any
of these Russian hackers and like but
they did they were successfully able to
like shake the core of like trust and
confidence in aural and it isn't even
yeah but that's that's a really good
point they didn't even change the votes
all they had to do was infiltrate
certain systems and show that mostly
voter records yeah yeah so like that's
my point though that like another angle
of this is to basically like have you
not trust your vote and they don't have
to change the vote to do that mm-hmm
yeah the only thing you can do is just
vote for a Mickey Mouse and then call it
a day
all right one more question on a way out
the door from Sir enjoy one more time
did the EVM defendant say that such a
vulnerability exposure would reduce
voter turnout among the young
generations I mean the is asking that
the vendor say that or like the folks in
the hacking village it just seems like
generally anybody in the village anybody
who is a defender of the exposure
how would that sway young generation
turn
now um I think that's a bigger question
than like voter like voter hacking
content I mean I'm sure there's many
other reasons why younger people are
disillusioned with democracy and voting
this could contribute to it I don't
think it's the only reason though or
main reason really yeah yeah yeah okay I
guess we're just gonna leave it leave it
there I'm very green on this entire
topic so I'm learning throughout this
entire conversation today as I do most
days most days
closing thoughts before we wrap it up
let's let's go ahead and put our votes
out for what we think the next best toy
to hack is going to be I'm putting my
money on tamagotchi gotcha
is that back already oh the Simon Says
thing not connected now do on this
that's all fancy internet connected the
color music thing yeah just so what it's
just gonna like do the wrong beat and
destroy your self-esteem yes exactly
exactly so the Sony dog what is it the
ape I bow I bow yeah yeah just turn it
into like an attack dog or something
not sure what an adorable attacked up
yeah that's a slogan worthy of a t-shirt
doesn't even have know that things have
knives so a and uh well what would you
do to hack the the magic leap just again
disorient I make it profitable thanks
everybody for joining us that was fun
tell us in your comments and questions
and tweet at us let us know what you
think a good toy to hack would be
besides Teddy Ruxpin and what challenges
could be at hand to do so until then
we'll see you guys tomorrow thanks again
to USB for sponsoring the show Ben
you're gonna take us out here sure the
359 is available on iTunes tune in
