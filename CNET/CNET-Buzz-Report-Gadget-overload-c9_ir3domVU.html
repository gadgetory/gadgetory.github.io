report the show about the tech news that
everyone is talking about this week
Mobile World Congress in Barcelona
demolished the phone and tablet world as
we know it Apple demolished app
developer revenues and computers are
poised to demolish humans but first it's
the gadget of the week the gadget of the
week is the haha that is so cute how you
think there's only one gadget of the
week this week it's Mobile World
Congress time people it is raining
phones and tablets and you know what
that means it's time for a buzz report
gadget Palooza edition let's jump right
in shall we first up the phones the
worst kept secret in tech these days the
playstation phone it's real now and it's
called the sony xperia play android
gingerbread four-inch screen playstation
controls and you know the getting's good
when that is like the phone of the show
next up this samsung galaxy s2 samsung
says it's the world's thinnest
smartphone now featuring dual-core
processors 8 megapixel cameras and there
are Wi-Fi only versions of the galaxy s
devices that will take on the ipod touch
bold show samsung we finally got
hands-on with the LG optimus 3d which
does look awfully 3d promising and then
HTC came out swinging they announced the
cha-cha and the salsa which are Android
smartphones that have dedicated facebook
buttons which I don't care what you say
I would use that f is for facebook also
HTC announced updated versions of the
Wildfire the desire and the incredibly
popular incredible by upping all their
specs and then putting an S after each
name s is first smartphone okay but that
is just the phones what about the
tablets there was the HTC Flyer a 7-inch
gingerbread tablet the 9 inch LG optimus
pad which is a dual-core honeycomb
beasts that takes 3d video we also got a
look at the HP touchpad which is the one
I think is super promising looking it
brings that webOS interface to a 10 inch
dual core touchscreen
nice and then Samsung dropped the tab
10.1 which is a 10 inch version of the
galaxy tab it includes 4g honeycomb an 8
megapixel camera on the back and then
one on the front to people when it rains
tablet it hails tablets and to think
some people go to Barcelona for the
jamon delicious and while all that was
happening iphone 5 rumours were raining
down all over the place to reports this
week suggested Apple might have three
future iphone prototypes ranging from a
much smaller cheaper iPhone like an
iPhone nano to a phone with a nice big
4-inch screen to one that actually has a
slideout keyboard which come on if Apple
does a phone with a keyboard I'll eat an
iphone 4 but I would like to see them do
an iphone shuffle it would just randomly
call people in your address book it's
social speaking of Apple the company
also announced a new subscription
service this week that lets you sign up
for movies magazines video and
newspapers through apps on your phone
but the app developers have to give
Apple a thirty percent cut of all new
subscriber money and they can't include
links in their apps to let people go by
content like say a kindle book outside
of the app yes the most dominant app
marketplace on the web is demanding a
30-percent rake off the top of every
transaction that happens in its
territory and also making sure that
hardly any transactions don't happen in
its territory I got a hand it's Apple
that is some straight-up ballsy mafia
right there and finally everyone the
singularity is here if that's what they
call it when computers officially become
smarter than humans I think it's safe to
say we have arrived the supercomputer
Watson equipped with just two thousand
eight hundred and eighty CPUs operating
at eighty teraflops and 15 terabytes of
RAM put the hurt on Champions Ken
Jennings and Brad rudder at jeopardy
this week chambers for 1200 and
846 this King founded trinity college
the largest of Cambridge's colleges
watson who is Henry the eighth or right
again let's finish and recruit it used
artificial intelligence and natural
language interpretation to decipher quiz
answers and then deliver the correct
responses in the form of a question mark
my words people the age of the machines
is here civilization is both doomed and
saved but I think the real question here
is what does the computer do with the
money it wins go to Disneyland no we
still got one on your terminators and
that's the buzz report for this week
everyone I'm mollywood and thank you for
watching now we come to Watson we're
looking for Bram Stoker and we find
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
