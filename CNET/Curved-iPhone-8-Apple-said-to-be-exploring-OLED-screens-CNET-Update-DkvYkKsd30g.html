screen iPhone a report from The Wall
Street Journal says it could happen with
Apple testing more than 10 different
prototypes for the iphone 8 or whatever
Apple ends up calling the next batch of
phones the report says Apple is asking
parts suppliers to increase production
of thinner OLED screens and Apple is
also asking for prototype screens with
better resolution than the one samsung
uses there is pressure for Apple to
deliver something snazzy next year to
mark the 10th anniversary of the iphone
so don't expect the usual sources told
the journal there could be more than two
iphone models revealed next year and if
one has an oled screen which the iphone
doesn't yet have then you can count on
it to also costs more than other models
because oh lids more expensive to make
but don't hold your breath on seeing
some curves just because Apple is
tinkering with a curved screen doesn't
mean it'll actually happen and curved
wouldn't be novel to the smartphone
world anyhow LG's G flex phones have
curved displays Samsung's Galaxy S edge
has a screen that curves over the side
and Samsung has been taking the concept
a step further and testing bendable
screens so you could fold your phone in
half like a wallet harkening back to
those old flip phone days I'm Brigitte
