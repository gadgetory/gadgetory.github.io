you were hoping for a big update you may
have to wait until next year
Apple is set to show off the new iPhone
7 on Wednesday and this would typically
be a year that the iPhone gets a
noticeable new design but when you round
up all the rumors and the leaked images
it seems the removal of the headphone
jack is the biggest change and that's a
change that could make people a little
freaked out since it requires getting
adapters for your current headphones or
using wireless Bluetooth headphones
we've even seen reports of Apple making
wireless ear pods called air pods that
just sit in your ear that is until you
walk out of the Apple store and take ten
steps before they fall out of your ear
into a storm drain or maybe that'll just
be my luck we're also expecting Apple to
include more storage in the iPhone 7
starting at 32 gigs instead of the usual
paltry 16 gig option
some reports talk about the phone having
better water resistance and a better
camera possibly with two camera lenses
on the back and of course it would not
be a new iPhone without it coming in a
new color maybe this time shiny black
will be an option it's getting harder to
add features that will make it enticing
to upgrade so why do some experts think
that next year will be any different
well it is likely that Apple's saving a
bigger enhancement for the iPhone 7s in
2017 because that would mark the 10-year
anniversary of the first iPhone
meanwhile with the removal of the
headphone jack you know Apple is going
to spend some time hyping up new ways to
listen to music and a few new changes to
Apple music are already on the way
Apple's rolling out personalized
playlists to Apple music subscribers the
first to see this new feature are those
who are beta testing the
soon-to-be-released operating system
updates of iOS 10 and the Mac OS Sierra
the playlist suggests music you may
enjoy just like Spotify has discover
weekly playlists Apple has also begun
selling gift cards for a year's
subscription to Apple music it'll cost
$99 which will save you about 20 bucks
if you want to commit to a full year
that's it for this tech news update I'm
