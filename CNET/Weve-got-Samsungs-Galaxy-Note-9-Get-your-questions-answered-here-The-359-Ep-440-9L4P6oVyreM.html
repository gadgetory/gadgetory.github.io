holy crap it's been a long day welcome
to the 359 episode 440 I'm BVG and we
got Roger Shara and Jess here to answer
all of your questions about this damn
phone damn phone so yes this podcast a
little bit different today it's running
a little bit late obviously but it's
gonna be dedicated to the galaxy no 9
I'll probably stay quiet for most of
this thing and let the experts actually
talk about it but as usual if you have
any questions about this phone anything
samsung related or mold related just and
sharra know everything about phones but
give any questions even the comments
section but I will pick out the best and
we'll get them in three minutes or 59
seconds we'll see about the best hang
out everybody will see you back in the
chat in 3 minutes and 59 seconds from 3
welcome to the 359 I'm Roger Chang and
with me our special guest shark Tipton
and Jessica dole cart they are here to
talk about the Galaxy Note 9 and really
all things Samsung cuz it wasn't just
about the note 9 today right correct so
first of all we should get to the phone
let's break down the flagship product
this is no 9 what are some of the
highlight features ok so I've got the
note 9 right here the highlight in any
note is going to be the stylus and what
Samsung did and this is really the
standout feature of the phone is not
only can you write and draw like you
normally could but there is a Bluetooth
antenna in here so it is Bluetooth
enabled which means that if you like
long press or short press on this button
depending on which app you're in it will
do something so maybe you launch the
camera app switch around the camera take
a picture so this this basically extends
the functionality beyond what we
normally see other than that we see a
lot more storage options and a much
larger battery but essentially some
features are the same as the galaxy s 9
including the camera setup yeah well I
guess the other thing that stood out to
me was the the price right thousand
dollars starting starting and that's 12
128 gigabyte version there's a 512
gigabyte version that is 1250 and yeah
they both like with a 512 SD card you
can get a whole terabyte of storage but
I mean that's those pretty big numbers
right yeah I mean it really is
especially when you consider that flash
storage is so cheap right now like you
could buy micro SD cards like I was just
looking like a 64 gig one you can get
for like five bucks on Amazon and you
know that's one of the nice things about
Samsung phones as you can expand the
memory but you can do it really cheaply
so you know kind of the the memory as
the big selling point for why it's more
expensive is a little shaky to me and I
mean look the iPhone 10 is a thousand
but it was a big design change over the
previous generation this phone you know
I Fontana also includes cutting edge
technology with a 3d front-facing camera
we don't see this in here we have an
iris scanner and that's great but that's
been around in generations and the
phones just get more expensive so I
think what we're looking at is really a
shift and in what you know the
appropriate price for a high-end device
should be and Samsung is trying to make
a claim yeah well that's that sucks for
all of our wallets yeah so but going
through some of the other features you
talked about the battery which is the
other kind of big point they were
focusing on it's 21% bigger capacity
yeah it's 4,000 milliampere what there
you go so I mean you think that's enough
to get people to like is that a big
enough feature that people care about
I mean people complain about that all
the time right I think that the major
driving points for purchase you've got
the camera definitely you've got screen
quality but these days it's just don't
be bad battery life is huge so there are
a lot of people especially now that you
can't remove batteries and swap them as
you could you know I'm 10 15 years ago
and there really is a demand for phones
with long lasting batteries of course
there are a lot of things you can do
this phone has fast charging it's got
wireless charging you can top up your
phone every day it'll go from zero to
completely full and probably around to
two and a half hours so there there are
ways to extend battery life but I think
I think people are just really worried
about running out because the phone is
such an important part of our daily
lives I mean what would you do without
your phone if it went dead you're eight
I'd go back home
charge my phone the day of the train
schedule like you know right actually I
wouldn't be able to make it home yeah
yeah I think a lot of people get very
worried yes absolutely and the other big
feature the improvement of the camera
the intelligent camera right yeah okay
the same camera setup this is a little
bit of AI software this is software that
we've seen on other phones including
some high-end phones from Huawei it's
not new this is something that a lot of
phones are going to be picking up
basically it sees a cookie and
identifies it as food and changes the
settings so this is potentially useful I
wouldn't say it's a make or break in any
way shape or form I also thought when we
were just playing with it you know and I
haven't used it since you have this but
when we were just playing with it
earlier it seemed that it was slow like
it took a little you know it was like
you had to wait a beat before it figured
out what it was instead of just being
able to take the picture I mean and
you'll find out more when you do it more
but yeah and you can't swipe it away
like you can and Huawei phones it's
either on or it's off okay for all of
our Samsung Galaxy Note 9 coverage
checks on CNN I'm Roger Cheng I'm sure I
sit in and Jessica doll court thanks for
listening I mean at least Scott wasn't
on the show to then it'd be like six
hours over anyway thanks everybody for
joining us for the recording of the
audio podcast I'm jumping into the chat
now like I always do and pulling out
your questions and comments to keep the
conversation going
needless to say we have a lot to talk
about the phone but there's actually
more than a few people in the chat who
want to hear more about the watch
changing gears here for a second yeah
there was a Galaxy home speaker and the
galaxy watch shows I cancel we're back
on one chart I can take over oh there
you go I mean it wasn't a huge surprise
but we did rise to see like a ton of
leaks coming ahead of time well well
this is a public day like they did that
they leave their own watch she did
but scratch what I just said I mean the
thing that was intriguing to me they
were they were promising multiple days
on a single charge with an LTE battery
or that part wasn't clear to me but they
said several days on a single charge
which I was like that's that's
impressive if they can pull that off
right no I mean yeah but I mean I mean I
guess if you're doing sleep tracking
with it but but realistically like
you're probably gonna be taking it off
anyway you're not using your watch with
the same you know constant resource
claiming as you would for a phone you
just don't hit a watch as well but the
problem is like the watch is smaller has
a small battery and it's never really
like this Apple watch really can't last
more than a day maybe a day and a half
right about doing things with that
though there is an LTE connection yeah I
am kind of curious if that claim would
extend to using data that's yeah that's
where you go and your run cuz this thing
once you put LTE data only it's you know
last like 90 minutes maybe so no one
stopped of course yeah that's like so I
have to wonder how or if they were able
to figure out balancing LT usage and
longevity on that you know also it'll be
great to see the watch in person I
haven't seen it today I came right back
to the office but it sounds at least
like it's very similar to the gear
watches yeah yeah yeah that the rotating
dial and they made a big deal about it
being circular yeah it's interesting
that they I guess they basically have
scrapped the gear name the gear name is
a failure now and it's just it's galaxy
watch decide yeah but so what's their
home thing isn't a Galaxy home yeah yeah
so maybe you know they're just trying to
like ya know that yeah you're just kind
of weird they're like last year it's
just their perfect marketing thing right
it's a galaxy of devices but why didn't
they do that before when we have like a
galaxy fridge or a galaxy dishwasher
maybe Farah
they do have a galaxy suit no they did
make smart suits
did they really yeah all right yeah they
had him at CES like last year they
before okay like I know when I was in
Korea few years ago and I saw a galaxy
suits they were not smart well those are
just more like Brooks Brothers yeah
they're just like nice really kind of
expensive surprise suits yeah
all right Brian give you questions yeah
can I leave this seat I've been here
since 10 o'clock this morning no no
we're almost done here you're there
forever we've got a couple of good
comments our wallet says the galaxy note
looks so good it might rip me away from
the Apple ecosystem strong I would say
wait till next year yeah like I think
the biggest Samsung changes were gonna
see here next year
you know like in squid now agree as to
the Galaxy S Pen yeah with like the in
under screen mean however you call it a
fingerprint reader that like works on
the front
yeah like 5g you know this foldable
phone you know even when we talked to a
Samsung exec after the keynote like
that's what he was saying you know that
they have tons and tons of innovation
coming up right so you know if you think
the note 9 is great you might want to
just you know Samsung give it welcome or
a longtime partner we've seen the Galaxy
phones coming out first to market with
Qualcomm you know next generation
processor so it's very possible that
Samsung will also nail an exclusive with
the Galaxy S 10 having you know the
first Qualcomm ultrasonic fingerprint
reader and display and that's something
that I would kind of expect I would be
more surprised if that didn't happen I
mean I wouldn't be surprised if they end
up with the first 5g phone right the 5g
mass-market phone yeah I mean I think it
just I think it's just gonna be a race
with that yeah but give it you know it's
like the timing look the latest timing
Qualcomm has given me four phones is
like second quarter which would fit you
know if like the s10 is usually like
March right usually launches towards the
end yeah right you know so that would be
I would say you know there might be like
a one-off 5g specific phone that no one
wants to buy like that Motorola thing
with there's literally zp3 with a moto
mod that won't be available until
sometime in 2019 when you put this big
honker on the back of headphone it's
just you know that that seems like a
play for a Verizon to be able to claim
that it was yours to a 5g thing but it
is not a 5g enabled phone
and keep in mind that those first 4G
phones I don't know the very first one
was the HTC Thunderbolt and that was a
terrible terrible phone it was a
basically built to demonstrate the LTE
connection and other than that it was a
terrible phone Brian what do you got
moving on Cody Williams wants to know
with that 4,000 milliamp hour battery
what is that
what's the benchmark they they tout the
all-day battery but what about for a
heavy user where does that fall off
start to happen with usage yeah I think
that's a great question and it's one
that I can't wait to answer seen it has
a pretty rigorous battery test with
video drain and we'll kind of hit that
thing two or three times until we get
some pretty consistent answers basically
what we've seen for the Galaxy S 9 Plus
which is sort of comparable I guess the
most comparable in terms of screen size
and then the modern processor the
Snapdragon 845 is that you're still
going to want to charge it for a
charging cycle you overnight but really
it just needs two hours at some point
during your day so if I were to wake up
at 6:00 in the morning and have a late
night and stay out until 1:00 in the
morning I would not feel confident that
my phone would last you know you start
seeing those double digits so the single
digits on battery reserves and you start
getting very very nervous and let's face
it I'm not ever gonna use like the power
saving like I am the person who's
turning off all the connections and
dimming the screen and okay I could get
home in 30 minutes I'm not worried so it
I want to see if it's gonna push it to
that next level but at some point within
probably a 24 to 36-hour period you know
you're still gonna want to recharge your
phone apec asks is Android we're getting
a refresh or updates or the watch is
just gonna fade away I don't feel so
Tony's actually this was actually
another Tizen watch oh good so point
that out yeah so this is not actually
Android wear so Android wear is getting
rebranded its wear OS I believe and
we'll probably hear more about it
like whenever Google holds event they
usually hold one in the fall probably
October I probably October yeah so we'll
hear a little bit more about that then
but yeah as you said that this Galaxy
watch is not
is not Android wear or wear yeah yeah
they just yeah Samsung does its own
thing for its watches fridges that stuff
for sure Wes Joanne is that pesky Bigsby
button still there yeah it is here on
the side where it has been and you know
I don't have a problem with a button
being there my problem is that it only
works with 6p I think if it were to map
to anything else of my choosing then
that would be great we've seen
convenience keys on other phones and I
think that they're really nice except
when you accidentally press it to launch
the thing you don't really want to watch
and that's maybe how it's pesky but but
otherwise it's not the buttons fault
right it's the fact that Samsung is
restricting the way that you use your
phone I think it's interesting though I
mean bixby something we didn't talk
about but that you know they've made
some changes to Bixby for the notes and
you know one of the things I thought was
interesting was that you'll be able to
do things about having like something
I've always thought that's kind of
awkward about Apple it's like open this
song in Spotify open this you know you
have to be very explicit about or like
call an uber call a lyft you know you
have to be very explicit about what
service you want to actually do that
task and with Bixby now you'll just be
able to say make a dinner reservation
and you know I don't know actually open
tables a partner but you know
theoretically open table would just like
find it and do it for you and and you
know or like Ticketmaster if you're like
Oh buy a ticket to this concert you
don't have to say using the Ticketmaster
app right um which is weighted has been
yeah and I mean in that but that's kind
of how it's been for everybody I think
is just like you know for these smart
assistants to know what what to do you
actually have to like tell them what to
use right and you know we do they're
Samsung's working with a bunch of
partners on this and they'll have an SDK
so everybody can kind of tap into it so
it'll see if it gets to like overcrowded
where it's like you want a bike ticket
to something and it's like StubHub opens
so does like to you know like who knows
but i think that's something that could
be actually really handy and a little
more natural way of interacting as
opposed to play this song on Spotify
well I'm curious mother do they explain
how they would do it if you've got
multiple apps that do different things
like they did not
uber and lyft and there they are
theoretically partners with Samsung if
you call for a cab or call for a car
like doesn't know which one you write no
and I mean that was exactly but you
could set it the way that when you open
something you're asked do you want mr.
Pro browser I would imagine it something
like that and we've got it in beta on
this review unit so it's not rolled out
yet so that's something I'm definitely
gonna be looking at in the days to come
it's a powerhouse of a phone I mean it's
a beast I just wonder why they have to
keep that big speed but it's the
appendix of cell phone features right
like it once upon a time it did
something valuable but nobody remembers
what it was I mean it was just like the
camera you know like I mean what would
you map it to if you could remap it for
me I would remap it to play Hall &amp;amp; Oates
on spot so you couldn't have a
convenience key through Android with the
power button so if you double tap the
power button that's the camera so you I
don't have that so what is it can you
remap that one or is it just the camera
the volume button so I by default it's
double-click the volume button to open
the camera and that and that's Android
wide I mean it is really like the vision
was to open the camera that way but you
know when you look back at some of the
previous Samsung phones like some of the
active phones not the essayed active but
before then like it's five active six
right well those all had a convenience
key that way to open like the s health
app by default but you could still
reprogram it to open something else so
knows how to do this and it was the
exact same I don't think anyone has an
issue with the convenience key itself I
think people have an issue with the fact
that it's just big spilling I can remap
it but you can
how can you remap the pen but not the
not the phone I mean they want you to
use bixby like you know if they're if
they're like letting you avoid it and
you're never gonna use it and I mean I'm
frankly like they they want VIX be like
AI as important everybody has to have
something there and for them it's mixed
me and they are trying to make it better
and they want to make sure people are
using it because they can't you know
can't learn if it's not being used
that's a good segue to the galaxy home
right I mean it's a big speed powered
speaker they want to get in just they
want to get into homes they want people
to fall in love with Bixby like they
have with their
already in homes is the pay but no one
uses them right no but I mean like
they're like the one of the biggest
refrigerator makers they're the number
one maker I know like they've this like
they've kind of like they should have
had this speaker before anyone else
Franklin like they they they're so like
dominant in in just like our home you
know they are the world's biggest TV
maker right there are like very big in
home appliances like we all you know I
have like iPhone owners like Apple
fanboys have Samsung appliances or
Samsung TVs because they're the best and
or you know among the best I'll let cats
Myer determined I'm Sam my forte
but you know it was kind of it seems
like they're just so late with this yeah
that and Samsung knows how to do audio
yeah and they just bought Harman yeah
like really knows how to do okay Jay
said there there is I wonder if it just
took a while for everything to come
together I wonder if Samsung just
thought nah people will just talk to
their TVs and their fridges yeah I mean
like frankly Bixby is still new you know
when it first came out it was just an
interface to tell your phone to like
turn on a hot spot or like whatever you
know and it wasn't until I don't know
several months later a year later I'm
not even sure how long almost a year
later I think when we finally saw it
moved beyond just the phone
so like you know it's it's taken a while
I think that's why the speaker is so
late right they yeah the assistant
wasn't ready it wasn't that the speaker
the to build everything from the ground
up right that was kind of the highlight
of the keynote for me was I I wish I
could have experienced it to really get
a better judgment but sound demo the
sound demo cuz I mean I'm a sound guy so
go figure
it was good but also like Herman
literally does concerts so right here
you know they're so they're speaker is
you know an AKG speaker which is is a
Harman brand and in kgs good quality
stock it's good quality stuff like
Samsung gives you that like the you're
the headphones that you get bundled with
your phones are now AKG headphones and
the over the you know they have a bundle
with the note that you're getting AKG
headphones so but I mean you know in
setting up like a demo of something like
Harman like outfits concert halls right
like if anybody
like that yeah totally but we didn't get
a lot of information of that we're
supposed to get more at the Samsung
developer conference yes which is not a
public event you know I mean not that
this was a public event but yeah I think
it's I think it's an October October
yeah we'll get more information if
interesting how they rolled this out
just like Apple rolled it out like they
teased this yeah Apple teased the home
pod no they teased the galaxy yeah
later yeah I mean it's funny like we
went to try to see it and we were late
getting to the demo area and they'd like
removed all of that and we weren't even
that late yeah I know 15 minutes yeah we
waited 15 minutes to do some other
interviews by the time we got to the
demo area they like remove them all yeah
and they were not are they hiding they
were not functionable I mean to be fair
like the prototypes cauldrons I mean
that's a perfect kind of segue I want to
make sure that all of you were aware of
what Jeff Bakalar did today yeah yeah
just making sure that that's all in your
eyes I mean if they were able in fact to
amplify the entire Barclays center with
consumer-grade speakers that would truly
have been like 106 them yeah but that
could have been hokey or maybe kind of
bogus I don't know like that that's a
big amphitheatre it I don't want to call
conspiracy but let's go ahead and take
some more questions before we call it a
day here's one from life improvements I
wonder if big speed will ever be on the
watch oh that's a really good point
actually I would put money on that yeah
yeah yeah it's why they need to have
ties it right unless they put a skin
like a Samsung experience skin over
where OS but it doesn't seem like they
really want to move away from their own
platform no Scott my it says built index
has got me excited could be an unnoticed
game-changer I'm with you on that one
sir where do I lost I lost a question I
wanted to see Djibouti
butI Singh are they bringing all of the
colors to the USA no you get to have
this one which is ocean blue with the
bright yellow S Pen or you can have the
lavender purple which is also really
pretty and then globally you get a just
a basic black version or metallic copper
I like the copper all in action I
thought it was funny that they didn't
really go with like a neutral color you
know like zero a black or silver or like
yeah then you're like whipping out this
like you can't really be discreet with
the yellow stylist if you're like if
you're an owner you don't hardly to lose
in the air pods well but there's no find
my pen actually if I threw this off the
table right now I would get a
notification that says well I think air
god that's just too weird like they were
last connected to your phone so it kind
of doesn't really help you it's like oh
yeah I knew where they were cuz that's
when I had them in my ears but know how
like now I need their pod you can't
store them anywhere
conveniently um so what samsung said was
that the blue and the purple tested best
for the US market and we don't know
about other markets I don't know why
they don't just offer all four all of
them right manufacturing by all of them
the channel distribution you would have
like boxes of the least popular color
like Moses lucky you you get the copper
one I feel like we'd like moved from you
know there was like the time were like
the galaxy s2 it was a different name at
every carrier and like everything you
know it was like yeah and you know and
then they've tried really hard to move
to just the one device which was like
something that really helped them and I
going back to pricing that is something
that is kind of interesting about the
note 9 pricing is like you don't really
think about this if you're buying
iPhones because they're basically the
same you know it's the iPhone 10 is
$1000 but the note is or the Galaxy
devices are different prices at every
carrier
right at the beginning like from the
from the get-go right so it's so
confusing and this time with the note 9
it's the same price everywhere no we
would have ranges of like well if you go
with US Cellular it's 680 but on Verizon
it's 750 and you're just like wait
really there's a $70 yes so like I
wonder how long it's gonna last like
within a month in a month or two I see
promotion yeah yeah yeah and how soon
and how much are we going to see the
noh8 discount well they already
discounted the note you know it did
happen it was like down to like 750 this
is why they're the reporters and I just
push the buttons I don't know how much
they would discount it more though cuz
they don't want to make it too cheap
where you you look at the two and you're
like holy this is excuse my
language this is $500 this is so good
and then we bring on your guests anyway
I don't even know what we were talking
about that's like oh yeah yeah I feel
like if they cut the price too much it
would almost force you to buy that cheap
well favorite is is it's not Samsung's
call right a lot for a lot of cases it's
just trying to get rid of yeah because I
mean I don't know how many people would
actually buy their fight the phones
directly from Samsung problem you know
they sell them on their website but it's
not you know it's not the same as like
getting it you know at an Apple store
right we got just enough time for a
couple more quick questions let's talk
about the s-pen everybody's really
excited about the s-pen I know I as is a
huge fan of it here in the office the
big num one two three can the note 9s
pen work with the note 8 Zhang wants to
expand on that and ask if they're going
to sell the s-pen as an independent
accessory so it could work with other
previous notes that's a great question
we don't have clarity on that all the S
pen's will work in terms of pressure
sensitivity in writing
I dunno there is a Bluetooth antenna in
here I imagine but am not sure but my
guess would be that it is specific to
some sort of circuitry in the note 9
because if there's an antenna here you
know there has to be a receiver and also
the charging because it's charged by the
phone yeah you know and I don't think
like the note 8 would probably have the
capability of charging it that's a very
good point yeah you - wait is it the
device is it a wireless charger is there
contact no it's charged when it's like
plugged in but I mean where's the
contact on the pen is it the button
there's nothing here so we need to kind
of like dig into those we I mean we did
not get a lot of time to go really
technical into the specs of like how
does it work exactly and what is the
circuitry like and blah blah blah but I
send it down to Kentucky for cracking
over but I would wait for that every
note going forward is going to have
something really similar yeah and this
s-pen is not a lot bigger than the note
8's penny either so so you're not
getting it might be big enough that it
doesn't actually fit I didn't try but
that is a possibility
it is a little bit bigger but not a lot
so what does happen if you say lose the
s-pen that comes with your note can you
get a replacement unit and a hat you
have to go straight to the manufacturer
to get that sent to you on like a serial
number type thing you bought it you can
buy replacements I mean it happens
things happen okay I was just kind of
curious like if it's that married to the
original phone what happens when you do
have to replace it
it's to that specific phone like you can
probably just get a replacement it's
like you can't buy probably buy more
yeah
yeah okay can built-in decks come to the
note 8:30 on that and also I can't
remember what they said about that there
were some things we asked about that
we're coming into something yes some
some element of it was specific to the
note no
but so I think like yeah I I don't want
to go on record saying that and that's
something that I think we need to
revisit I never liked the doc so I do
think that it is really important to be
able to just plug in directly and use it
I have had problems with lag when I've
used decks in the past it has not been
my favorite way to use it I would
probably just rather you I mean I'm a
I'm a creature who lives everyday on my
laptop we write we're all in our laptops
so for me I don't think like a natural
use case has ever popped up but it's
something where I would want to see a
lot of improvements with the
responsiveness in order to even think
that that is you know a great idea that
everyone should use that right does the
note 9 SD card allow for app installs
and running them or is it just for pics
and vids so can you use can you use the
SD card to install applications on your
phone or is it just for media transfer
should work the same way that any SD
card the whole thing like you can only
do the apps external card right because
I even in like my Amazon fire tablet you
can't put certain apps on an external
good question we'll have to do some
tests do you think you will be able to
use the galaxy watch as a camera remote
just like the Apple watch I will have to
try it out for us they didn't really
give us a there hasn't been too much on
the watch yeah yeah I imagine that as a
feature they'll probably show up since
Samsung's really great making sure it's
got features similar to what Apple
offers I thought it was a good wishlist
item there yeah comments for sure
and then before we let everyone go want
to give a quick shout out to hunt early
thanks to hunter for pointing out that
it's a rare occasion that the 3:59
happened at 3:59 whoa Wow I didn't think
that yeah but yeah we're out of time I'm
completely cooked cuz I haven't seen
here pushing buttons talking about
phones all day and I don't care anymore
right now so yeah wrap it up right yeah
all right 3:59 podcast is available on
itunes tune in stitcher Feedburner
google play music google podcast the
amazon echo and of course cnet.com I'll
see you all Monday
