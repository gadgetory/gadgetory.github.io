goodwin and we are here at the 2013
deneva Auto Show standing the front of
the meat bentley flying spur especially
the second generation of this car big
luxury vehicle it's got the 6-litre w12
engine big facet and that's what family
does the Caspian you know who else does
big fat vehicles well well maybe not fat
but they're trying to rolls-royce it
actually just debuted the rate that this
show and the Wraith basically is based
on the ghost platform they had that nice
fastback designs yeah yeah that's sort
of like coupe-like roofline that
everyone's been kind of using since Audi
debut the a7 but it's actually two doors
they are these sort of coach doors that
open backwards 0-60 and 4.4 seconds and
something that weighs as much as a small
boat that's kind of impressive ok but
you know it's faster what's faster the
new Ferrari they just actually in veiled
a new limit edition only 499 units are
going to make and you know it it's
called what's it called laferrari that's
the horrible name that a maze will have
called it low laFonda well laferrari is
actually a hybrid too ok so it's all
sorts of like affront to God right now
oh yeah it's got I mean as far as the
sports car purist this thing just blows
all his rig away it's got a digital
instrument cluster ok it's got a hybrid
drive system all right so actually they
attach an electric motor to their big
6.3 litre v12 and they say to 62 miles
an hour and somewhere under three
seconds they have no idea ok that's
impressive that's impressive man is kind
of exclusive only a couple hundred made
but I've got a car that even more
exclusive than that it's way over our
shoulder here at Lamborghinis booth it's
the Lamborghini veneno they're actually
only making four of these four they're
only selling three and they're already
sold out well yeah we've got 3 i'm sure
that's funny do you want to be like well
probably not too many do so many people
can afford the 3.9 million dollar price
tag for the 750 horsepower vehicle
that's based on the Aventador so it's
got a little bit more horsepower it's
got a fully carbon fiber body and it's
been completely rescaled it the whole
thing is just a mess of wing than vents
and diffusers and spoilers it's one of
the most aerodynamic car
that Lamborghinis ever made top speed of
220 miles per hour we've been talking
about a lot of very expensive cars none
that I can afford so let's go take a
look at a car that I really like that I
might be able to afford and that they
will be selling in the US all right
let's look so here it is the Alfa Romeo
4c and when I saw the concept of this
car I was really excited and this one is
actually going to be coming to the US oh
is it yeah and so it's this really
lightweight they say like 2,000 pounds
that's extremely light for today's
guards 1.7 liter direct injection
turbocharged engine more than 40
horsepower I mean that sounds like fun
doesn't it all sounding good it looks
like it's also a mid-engined so I mean
this is a pretty inexpensive mid-engine
high-powered rear-wheel drive car with
me what's not awesome about that yeah
well there's a couple things that are
not awesome about it actually look at
these headlights okay they look bad
they're weird they kind of look very
insect-like and a little weird but I
think you're nitpicking like one thing
on what's another wise beautiful car
they need a lens over them or something
I don't know if I could walk out to this
car every day and say like yeah that
looks good well you know you leave it to
the aftermarket or you can oh you can
maybe look at something a little bit
different if you're looking for like a
pretty inexpensive sports car because
the shaky corvette convertible was
actually just announced at the show so
the same 450 horsepower 450 pound-feet
of torque seventh-generation corvette
that we saw in detroit now has a pretty
awesome retractable cloth top what's
interesting is that chevrolet said they
didn't actually have to like add any
sort of like structural rigidity to the
vehicle it was built from the ground up
to be a convertible so it's
heavier that's awesome so it's that
awesome it is that awesome on the other
hand we've got some other convertible
conversions here at the show that maybe
weren't designed to be convertibles from
the ground up talking about the ft-86
open concept oh this is based on the
Scion fr-s subaru brz twitter gt86 if
you want to go yeah like all of those
cars yeah you know i love the handling
of the FRS brz GT 86 I don't really like
the looks of that ft-86 open now yeah it
kind of looks a little incomplete they
actually haven't actually shown us what
the car looks like with the top up
doesn't look really bad but I know
you're not a fan of 2+2 convertibles no
I mean they look like tubs whenever you
get the you know a roadster convertible
is fine but whenever you get you know
like four seats with a convertible top
then you just have a big tub of bathtub
kind of thing I mean you know Toyota is
actually also showing off another car
that's really awesome and totally
different the car that I want to drive
the most let's take a look at that ok
now that down there is the Toyota i-road
concepts it's the intra single time yeah
I don't have up really a cars and it's
only got three wheels what's kind of a
trike so it's got two wheels in the
front they're both powered by two
kilowatt electric motors one wheel in
the back affectionately the wheel that
does the steering interestingly and I
was watching the Toyota people
demonstrated and it actually has a
really cool feature called active lean
so what happens is when you really crank
the wheel and start getting into a turn
the front wheels give you a little bit
of camber so the whole vehicle leans
into the turn it's really awesome it
looks like a lot of fun that's a one
seater and it's a motorcycle two seater
you get the tandem seating there's a
second seat behind the driver for your
junk or your
significant other whoever you want a
snack it's not a car VW does have a car
call the xl1 it's 261 miles per gallon
is what they're saying okay I'm
impressed and go on yeah so small two
cylinder diesel engine made it to like
an electronic motor they actually made
it point nine leaders 400 kilometers
with this car it's a plug-in hybrid it
goes about 30 miles under electric power
by itself and then you can go I guess a
lot more to thin end up the tank is they
haven't talked too much about it but if
they do say twelve point seven seconds
to 60 miles an hour which is not fast so
pretty much what you're telling me we've
gone from super cars that do a single
digit zero six times to this Volkswagen
that is about half a minute rate yeah
bought Ferrari to the law xl1 yeah that
you pretty much cover the entire gamut
well I'm go Wayne Cunningham and I'm
Allah antuan goodwin and that about
wraps it up for the 2013 geneva motor
show cheers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
