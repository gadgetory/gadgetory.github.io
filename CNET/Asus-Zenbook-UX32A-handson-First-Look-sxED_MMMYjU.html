at the assist Zenbook ux302 milly erne
thats because you're probably just read
or saw our review of the ux 32 vidi
another completely identical looking
book from a soos these are part of the
Zen book line which was one of the first
lines and ultra books to come out late
in 2011 a suits from some of the first
guys on that bandwagon and of course
like a lot of other later ultra books
did their stuff looks a lot like a
MacBook Air but so a little bit of
personality of its own the interesting
thing about taking a look at this
current generation of Zen book laptops
is they really run the range from sort
of low-end budget-conscious to very
high-end the expensive one the vidi that
we looked at the other day it's got a
1080p screen that's got a core i7 Ivy
Bridge CPU it's got discreet graphics
this version over here that UX 32a is
about 779 if you shop around maybe you
can find it a little bit cheaper than
that what it has though is a regular
1366 by 768 screen it's got a core i3
CPU but it's from the previous
generation
we call those Sandy Bridge chips so you
don't get the improved integrated
graphics or a better performance and
battery life as you do with the current
generation of Intel chips and it's got a
smaller hard drive and it does not have
the discrete graphics that the more
expensive version has know you know when
you look at it for 779 you say to
yourself there's a lot of other
ultrabooks right in that eight hundred
nine hundred dollar price range made a
little bit less so you have a lot more
choice there however if you really love
to look and feel that more expensive
Zenbook this is exactly the same chassis
it's got the same USB 3.0 ports so if
that's what you're looking for this is a
much less expensive way to get it if you
don't need a faster CPU you do pay a
little bit of a performance premium
there in terms of the CPU and you don't
need this Greek graphics or the higher
res screen I'm Dan Akron and that is the
suzanne book you x32
