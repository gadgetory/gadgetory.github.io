robots welcome to the Caltech rob's
tickle course five teams composed of
Caltech mechanical engineering students
competed in this annual tradition where
robots go head to head in a series of
challenges this year's theme an obstacle
course every year with this course we
come up with a completely different set
of tasks it's a completely different
game the teams learn what the robots
have to be able to do at the beginning
of the year and then spend months
prototyping and refining their final
designs we got like basic ideas for the
designs about 20 weeks ago when this
class started we've actually been
changing the designs quite a bit
throughout this entire 20 weeks that we
had everything finalized about a couple
of weeks ago honestly then we built
everything I've been testing solidly for
about a week maybe a bit less the
finished product isn't just a reflection
of the students knowledge it's also an
important team-building experience when
teams meet team has to begin to form
storm as they constructively confront
each other through what ideas are going
to be the ones that they actually go
forward with then they begin to norm and
that's when the vectors are not
perfectly aligned but becoming a lot
more aligned and ultimately they perform
if they've gone through those four
phases of teamwork this year's course
required teams to build three robots
designed to complete a kind of relay
race the first uses self-driving
technology to autonomously navigate a
field of pylons and pass a baseball over
to the next robot the second robot
speeds up a seesaw and down the other
side and then over a second stationary
ramp or the third robot waits for the
ball hand off after the third robot gets
the baton it uses magnets to release
bolts on a gate drive through it and
then deposit the ball into the goal each
team tackled the course multiple times
repairing and tweaking their robots
between runs the path away there's
pretty bumpy so as we drive over it be
robots just vibrate a lot and so all the
screws come loose before our last two
matches I like secured all the wires as
to make sure that like that would happen
again and then we had to move sailing
from them even though team vista took
the championship the process itself aims
to teach each team member valuable life
skills they can put into action no
matter what they choose to do after
graduation that's what you want to hire
you want to hire people that when the
stress is high when the pressures on
those are the those are the cool heads
in the room I always tell them this is
your last big reliability test
