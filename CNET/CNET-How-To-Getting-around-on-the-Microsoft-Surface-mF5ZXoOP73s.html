of hardware from Microsoft but between
the hybrid tablet design and the windows
8 software it takes a little bit of
practice to find your way around I'm
Donald Bell I'm going to show you some
tips and shortcuts for navigating the
Microsoft Surface first some basics but
the touchscreen is pretty obvious that
you can touch things on the screen to
interact with them but what isn't
obvious is that a lot of the navigation
here is done by swiping in from one of
the four edges of the screen swipe in
from the right and you'll get the charms
bar for adjusting settings like Wi-Fi
connections or screen brightness swipe
in from the top or bottom to view all of
your available apps or swipe in from the
left to jump between open programs the
left edge also has a few other tricks if
you pull over an open program halfway
you can view it side-by-side with
another window and if you swipe in from
the left just a little and circle back
you can see shortcuts for all of your
open apps now if you have the keyboard
cover with your surface you can do a lot
of these same tricks without even
touching the screen here are some useful
key combos that all center around the
windows key windows ce will bring up the
charms bar windows e will take you to
the file explorer windows tab will cycle
you through all the open programs and
perhaps the most important shortcut here
is from the home screen just start
typing to search for anything on your
computer finally some tips on
personalizing the home screen all the
tiles here can be rearranged adjusted or
even hidden you can rearrange by holding
on the icon and then sliding it where
you want it for more options try
dragging the tile to the bottom of the
screen and letting go now you'll see
settings for the tile you can make the
tile bigger or smaller or unpin it from
the home screen so you don't have to
look at it every time you use your
computer so there you go those are my
tips for getting around on the microsoft
surface for more cool stuff to do with
windows 8 visit how to cnet com if you
