headlines the first of which is about
toys the New York Toy Fair is spinning
down and there's some really high-tech
toys this year particularly from Mattel
the toy maker announced two products in
particular that caught our eye first
they unveiled an updated thing maker but
instead of the goop baking box from the
1960s this time around it's a 3d printer
for kids complete with an app to design
custom toys Mattel also brought Barbie's
Dreamhouse into the 21st century
complete with voice commands color
changing lights and other Internet of
Things compatibility both products will
each cost three hundred dollars and will
hit retail stores later this year
interestingly Hasbro went with a much
more analogue approach kind of the
opposite from what Mattel was showing
off our rivals to the bitter end
yeah but I'm well we may have to talk
about that later this week I think maybe
that's a Thursday topic in the week it
might be so let's talk about Vanderbilt
University there is a team of scientists
they are using a $40 cotton candy
machine to create artificial human
capillaries human capillaries are very
very small about one-tenth the diameter
of a human hair so creating artificial
capillaries has proven pretty difficult
for scientists but the Vanderbilt team
is using a store-bought cotton candy
machine to spin up sugar strands then
they pour gelatin over the cotton candy
which coats each individual strand and
once that gelatin cures they dissolve
the cotton candy inside each gelatin
channel creating a system that could be
a first step towards artificial
vasculature to sustain lab-grown
organs amazing stuff the next step for
the team is to find a way to get cells
through those channels without clogging
them up I'm hoping they go with gummy
bears gummy bear cells amazing it is
it's incredible this is like one of
those science things that you you just
it blows your mind to use this product
they got in a target
can't even they got an ultimate mod
ultimate mod squad yeah sure
so if you guys want to talk about the
topic that we pick for Thursday's show
you can use the hashtag hey TV yeah we
love it when you shout at us over social
media and then if we like what you say
we'll incorporate it into our discussion
our deep dive discussion on Thursdays
speaking of which what do you think we
should choose well I know you got really
excited about all the toys I like
talking about toys you know I think even
more interestingly as the Hasbro
approach I feel like we have to talk
about that ok and and why they might be
moving in that direction for this year I
think cotton candy organs is pretty
crazy but yeah I'm with you
let's go toys we we have a wild card so
we might be able to pick two from one
day but well maybe they don't give us
their recommendations as well using that
hashtag hey TV that's right so now that
that's all been said let's check out our
phone tog refer the day today's phone
tog refer of the day is Chuck who took
in this infrared photo on his iPhone 6
using a a fancy-pants
attachment yeah he writes us and says
Jeff and Ashley loved the show attached
as a photo of my two golden retrievers
snoozing the picture was taken with an
iPhone 6 with an IR adapter by Fleur SLI
our the shot shows different degrees of
heat from the dogs white is the warmest
on the dog in the front you can see his
warm breath you have my permission to
use this photo on your show Chuck this
is good for when you're playing metal
gear solid with your dogs in real life
that's right you're looking for them and
you need to make sure they're sleeping
you check them out in the dark bottom
you don't want to turn the light on
because they might realize you're there
and then it's gonna be just licks all
day long you're gonna jump all over you
and give you a little dog slurps your
your heat map how much hot it's all
ruined so then it's all ruined so yes
that's very handy for making sure your
dogs are asleep in the pitch dark of
night
very cool photo though it takes a lot if
you want to be our phone tog refer of
the day send us your photo tell us what
device you took it on give us a little
story about it and make sure you give us
permission to use it on the show as well
yeah our email address is right down
here tomorrow at Cena comm and then of
course you can find us all over social
media we are all over the show on the
Internet guys yeah we love hearing from
you and we will be back
tomorrow with more headlines and then
Thursday we're gonna hit you with some
deep that stuff so yes and we will have
a guess having to do with gravitational
waves
oh man I'm very excited I love science
yeah don't miss Thursday's show that was
it for the show guys until next time be
good humans</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
