robot hands to rehabilitate themselves
and the selfie of the future is here ah
crap great and also a very interesting
capsule for natural disasters it's
awesome tsunami already tomorrow daily
greetings citizens of the Internet
welcome to tomorrow daily the best week
talk show in the known universe I'm host
Ashley scattered Ramiz always kill
anonymous pretty good forget tea you're
pretty good pretty good episode rockin
that to you actually you know what this
episode sucks we say every episode is
amazing well this one is terrible he's
lying it's gonna be let's see if you can
even make it through it yeah it's gonna
be do that it's always a good episode
yeah there's some good stuff today so
let's hit the headlines what they're
gonna hit they're gonna hate this first
one yeah excellent I mean it's just
terrible for everybody involved just a
sad story know it's crazy lifting
stories cool medical tech so usually
when we hear about like robot hands or
you do prosthetics yeah alright so this
is a little bit different this is
actually serve up it's kind of like a
power glove but ok I got times like a
hundred way better use case okay so um
when people have strokes they can be it
can be really devastating for them and a
can a have a really long time to recover
fully or sometimes not at all so this is
an awesome thing that comes from the
researchers at the University of
Hertfordshire in the UK they have made
this robotic glove that it is meant to
help patients in stroke recovery so
they've made to prototype devices so
they have these you can see they're
doing like fingers flexion all this
stuff they're just kind of showing you
the glove they combine this glove with
games like I in software so like there's
games and basically you if you've had a
stroke you have limited maybe mobility
in your hand or your arm you put this
glove on and then it has like three
different types of games you can play
that make you move your arm it's like
it's a crab oh here it is right here
said ok they're showing you like what's
a hand opening and closing and stuff
like that so there's a couple different
games there's a clam hand so they use
you're like a clam and you gotta close
your hand up to like close the clam
that's and then there's a crocodile
jumping in sort of movement game that
makes you move your arm around and then
there's a ball and a maze that like
makes you flex your muscles and like
move the ball around inside the maze
that's fantastic so now it's not just
about someone like being like oh I have
to squeeze my hand 500 time
times you this diamond actually it
actually works with your brain which
always wants to like yeah like these fun
goals and in little tasks and stop my
god yeah so um it's literally putting
rehabilitation in their hands like it's
actually like putting it right in there
and it's really cool because they were
saying at once they play these games the
data gets sent to their physical
therapist and the physical therapist and
say okay well you're doing really great
on this but maybe not so well as this so
we're gonna up your time on it like they
can really see over ahead of time like
how well they're doing in sort of adjust
hat which games they're playing like an
app for how long and it's they've seen
pretty good results so they have 30
patients do this and they said if they
practice about a hundred minutes a week
so little over an hour and a half they
showed clinical improvements so there
were actual quantifiable improvement
shown that you know because they were
you know working on specific hand
movements with this device that's crazy
so the game was actually involved in the
rehabilitation yeah sure of course it's
just like they when they release like
they think it was either the we're that
we fit and they gave him telling
retirement homes and the old people
showed more activity all right Debbie
yeah they're playing the game they were
bowling and exactly and it's also a
specific movement and it's it's engaging
like you're really into it and so it's
you don't feel like oh I'm so bored with
this like I just want to stop doing this
like I'd rather be doing something else
eight people are having fun then it's a
little easier for them to go through
rehab so up next streamlining and
improving the device based on what
they've kind of taken notes on thus far
and then they actually want to get some
funding for commercial prototypes so
maybe we might see this someday as a
thing that you know everybody gets to
use which is any stroke victim would be
able to use something like that sounds
yeah that sounds like an awesome way to
rehabilitate somebody so now I want to
talk about a robot that is just that's
not just about everybody it's just about
you cuz this is a selfie drone this is
created from the University of Zurich
now check this drawn out or right so
what this drum does is it flies away
from you it's fully autonomous it drive
flies away up to you and then what it
does is it does a 360 degree scan of you
oh this is yes see so there is you have
to light you have to lay down on the
ground it's kind of a bummer so I know
that
it's kind of like some space kisses
right out I need to take a selfie as you
can see it's flying around to him isn't
him I think it's a I don't I can't allow
or monitor is Chinese you know were just
jerks um at that kratom and and scanning
him look he's puts his hands off cuz
it's like its autonomous yeah I wants to
show he's not controlling it right so
it's yeah okay there it's making a 3d a
selfie of this person so Wow yeah and it
looks like it's not just like it doesn't
look like it's just you know like kind
of scanning a little like a spot like it
this is actually it's moving around it's
moving around making sure it gets every
single little thing there's like a
composite 3d model like this is serious
business yeah and he's olya they're
moving he's moving around hey don't do
that it's not gonna mess it up is it no
I don't think so i think whoa whoa this
camera is like action apparently you
know it's not like super perfect but I
mean look well that looks pretty good
it's pretty good at skinning see the
camera you can see what it's looking at
everything I wonder what that like okay
so now I'm curious as to what the
finished product of this actually looks
like is it is it the bits probably not
the best ever like you said I'm not
amazing no it's not it's not the best
but it's pretty pretty close I'm pretty
close look at yeah there you go you can
actually see oh it got likes the shirt
and some of the details in his hoodie
yeah see some of the things you couldn't
have gotten if it didn't move around and
get them get you from different angles
but because it was moving around it
could get a more 3d sense of this face
instead of just getting a top-down that
weirds me out a little bit well you know
there's always a group people out there
excited about selfies exact 3d selfies
yeah selfies everybody um all right so
going back to helping people again
instead of being yeah we had our selfish
break we are selfish break let's move on
to helping more people so funny that
this story actually we're doing today
because exactly 34 years ago in 2011
yeah was the tsunami and earthquake in
Japan like I remember that um so if you
if you were living under a rock at that
point this terrible earthquake and and
subsequent tsunami hit Japan has caused
all kinds of devastation you've heard of
the Fukushima meltdown like that's
that's that earthquake that was like the
aftermath of that earthquake and that
tsunami so this guy
who lives in Palo Alto his name is Chris
Rock Robinson he's a designer and he was
super affected by the images that he saw
on TV and him and his friends were
talking about like how like how the
world would you survive that kind of a
disaster like that's crazy and so
instead of just leaving the conversation
at that like most of us would going oh
well you know something we can do about
it he was like I'm gonna do something
about it and here it is this is called
the tsunami ball hahahaha now you'll
notice it's not a sphere and he was
saying in this this is like a 24 minute
long video and it's super fascinating he
was saying that he researched why not we
don't really see spherical objects in
the ocean like boats or craft like
watercraft and there's a very specific
there's a whole bunch of different
reasons that's why it's a bad idea so
he's like so I realized I had to make
something a little bit different than a
ball that he's because he wanted it to
have like this basically like this
little spherical capsule that you could
hide in when a tsunami hit and then you
would survive so he's been building this
thing for a couple years in building it
since 2012 so it's been a few years and
basically the capsule lives in your yard
and he was saying like this thing would
live in your yard and then in the event
of an emergency would get in it and
brace yourself for impact and this thing
is like hypothetically because obviously
it hasn't been tested in a tsunami
hypothetically would be able to
withstand the impact of water and debris
and in that situation it would stay
floating and then it would Ken it would
keep its writer safe for a period of
time like to get rescued which is pretty
awesome he said it was inspired by
escape pods like I guess some oil rigs
have escape pods and he was like okay
I'm gonna kind of do something like that
um and it's made of marine plywood like
dozens of layers of marine plywood arum
aeromarine epoxy and flotation foam if
what's this guy's job he's well he's a
designer like that's so he did was he
funded for this no I think he's just
doing this in his own spare time like
this is like a fun project for him like
he talks about how it's been really
interesting because a lot of it's been
trial and error because he's like I've
never you know made anything like this
before um so it still floats it's 22
feet long
and the plan is to test it in a pool
first yeah it does and then and then if
that works they're gonna toss it in the
ocean and see how it does for like a day
or so and he was saying that cuz it's in
his backyard and there's like a hammock
in there and stuff like he was like
relaxing and I was watching this list
thing is crazy you I highly recommend
that you spend like half an hour and
watches thing it's really it's a
testament to how cool people some people
are like they just do think like that's
pretty cool um he said he might rent it
out on Airbnb because it's in their
backyard if he's like yeah I might
running out on Airbnb ones have done
tarea de and therefore Airbnb he just
like spend the night inside the tsunami
ball and listen bonus if there's ever
natural disaster in Palo Alto if there's
a tsunami there oh yeah you know highly
unlikely but if that ever happens I mean
you're probably in the safest place in
the city oh yeah they're a look at ya
hammock got everything you need
everything you need in the tsunami ball
you're just like what I think it's
awesome I'd say yeah how like wait did
it say how long you worked on it still
working don't work in I he's been
working out for three years said yeah
three years three years so he started in
2012 and now he's still working on not
I'm not throwing me shade it's just no
tea no shade worked worked real hard on
that thing yeah and that's not as full
time jobs really impressive full time
job alright so we're gonna take a quick
break we'll be right back with a round
of back in her hackett literally and we
have your user feedback which is going
to make you and all of you so happy
because i'm going to have to apologize
and then our phones are for the day so
don't click away it's tomorrow daily
welcome back to the show you know we
like to feature a specific crowdfunding
venture every week on the show yes we do
and then we like to tell you if we like
it or don't and I have a feeling guys
are like this one its back your hackett
how many times kale have you made
pancakes for breakfast which also
pancakes greater than waffles superior
breakfast food um oh I will literally
fight you after the show for that so how
many times have you been making pancakes
you're like I wish I was a pancake
artist like every time right cuz that's
how I feel oh yeah I mean yes a hundred
percent so uh here's the thing there is
now a pancake bot and it kind of is like
a 3d printed pancakes 3d print pancakes
okay so this little girl is drawing a
picture of a rocket we're watching the
video right now if you're listening is
you draw a picture of a rocket and it's
inside the software and what happens is
this amazing pancake bot draws in
pancake batter the lineart and then
fills it in so it does the lines first
so that when you flip the pancake over
the lines are darker yeah and the fit
than the inside filling part of the
pancake right uh this is pretty much the
greatest human event this is not a
pinnacle of useless of advanced
civilization guys this is the pinnacle
this is really good the time acing this
is the top this is where it ends with
there's no way okay so now it's going
for a detailed Eiffel Tower so we're
gonna see how well it actually gets like
the cross beams and whatnot yeah so
here's the thing so it it basically like
you can trace over stuff like you can
import an image and then trace over it
with your with a line art like simpler
line art so it's not going to be perfect
but look at that some crazy good details
basically done okay now we got our shock
and awe out of the way let's get reality
in there all right i'm gonna add some
i'm gonna add some fill in some
information just like the pancake vodkas
um you can save your designs to an SD
card so you don't have to keep doing it
over and over again
you can you can save your designs this
one they drew this and they imported it
and then what they did was you can
actually stop the pancake bot and you
can do a different color batter no use
food coloring and add in like color
batter so he's watch your gonna see the
guy and he's gonna hand fill in all the
other stuff with like a blue pancake
batter and then flip it over and it's so
awesome okay so while he's doing that um
it's they have pre-loaded pancake design
is chicago bulls yeah i'm assuming so um
so it's okay so that's what it does very
clearly it's a pancake maker you can
make your own designs listen I'm really
excited about this like bear with me uh
for like I said pre-loaded pancake
designs early bird has already sold out
they've already met their goal like
their they've blown past the fifty
thousand dollars they do how big is this
thing you haven't said how big it is I
wish they want to it's not very big they
they show like the three different
prototypes on the Kickstarter site and
it's like the first one is insane it's
like this giant contraction yeah and
apparently he got guilted into making it
because his daughters thought he said he
was gonna make like a Lego pancake
printer or something like that and he
was like cuz he commented on something
on the make kind of made him feel bad so
he built it and then he realized wow
there's really something here and then
he streamlined it and then there's like
the second version and this version is
super nice it's like Bruce Lee made it
because he told me promises daughters
yeah come on Pizza cupertino machine
that and there in the video there in the
video it's adorable so he made them a
little pan k and then they that's them
the draw that draw the rockets and stuff
of pancake rockets so I'm no that's
adorable it is super adorable so the
early bird was 149 the regular retail
price is gonna be to 99 but on
Kickstarter if you spend 2 99 you get to
so they do two for the price of one if
you do it or you get one for one I think
it's 179 oh yeah you have to look at
your computer though well and it has to
be near yours no no it's an SD card so
you know you are burning brighter okay
you load it on the SD card and you put
the SD card in the pancake bot nice i'm
just saying my birthday is coming uh it
delivers in july if your that's really
soon you persons okay so get non your
and cake I backed it this morning I was
like done I put my money where my mouth
was I was like I'm in sign me up so I
say back it love pancakes pancakes are
my favorite breakfast food really I love
pancakes oh it's the best I back in your
I'm not gonna buy one it's my enthusiasm
I back don't know the awesome adorably
sorry breakthrough in the adorable story
like it's yeah I mean it's not look very
expensive know it all things considered
with the software and what Ron pancakes
yeah definitely definitely packet and I
have no more breakfast food in the world
3d printed breakfast foods um so yeah
that's pancake bot so nice nice work
pancake all right guys every every
single day we like to talk about what
you think about the show so at this time
for user feedback I have an apology for
everybody yeah because pancakes are not
better than waffles shut your mouth bite
your tongue lest you be struck um so I
