we're going to talk about the dyson dc50
animal vacuum cleaner this vacuum
retails for $499 which is a really steep
price sticker for a vacuum especially
when you consider the market but as it
is a Dyson that $499 price sticker may
not shock you as much what may surprise
you however is that it's performance
doesn't really live up to its price
point this is a fine vacuum the dc50
performed well in all of our tests but
our large particle tests on hardwood
revealed that the entire success to this
vacuum seems to be in the brush roll
which dyson recommends that you
deactivate on hard surfaces so relying
on its section alone it did well with
small particles but did a bismil e with
pet hair and Cheerios it is great with
pet hair on carpets so if you are a pet
owner with largely carpeted areas in
your home the dc50 will perform as
expected and collect all of that pet
hair for all of its good performance and
Dyson's reputation for making excellent
vacuum cleaners we found this one to be
a little bit flimsily designed or at
least that's how it seems everything on
this vacuum seems to be made of plastic
that coupled with certain design flaws
that were not really wild about makes us
pause about the durability of this
vacuum for example on the bin right here
this button that you push to open the
bin itself it's a really thin plastic
pin that does the depressing and it just
doesn't feel sturdy I don't feel
confident that it would withstand lots
and lots of usage over the course of
years emptying the bin is simple enough
but if you need to do a deeper cleaning
of the Cyclones or the internal working
parts of the bin it's more complicated
than we feel it should be but still I
feel like Dyson could have designed this
to inspire a little more confidence
since design is one of their hallmarks
moving forward with design perhaps the
most recognizable feature about Dyson
vacuums it separates them from other
vacuum brands is this rollerball
technology but the very thing that makes
this Dyson vacuum so unique is also
something that kind of inspires a lack
of confidence
and as for example the ball is supported
behind by two plastic axles with really
small guiding wheels attached to them
the wheel fell off in one of our final
tests and I don't have a ton of
confidence that this would stand the
battering that most vacuums go through
over the course of that 10 to 15 year
lifespan that a lot of people keep them
for another problem that we had was the
locking mechanism to bring this vacuum
into an upright and locked position you
have to push it forward until it clicks
unfortunately this clicking sound is
really misleading as a lot of times we
would push it forward until it clicked
and then it would fall backwards on us
long story short the dc50 is a fine
vacuum cleaner and if you have it in
your home it's doing a good job I'm sure
but there are better values if you're in
the market for a new vacuum we would
definitely recommend that you look
outside the Dyson brand as a lot of
other manufacturers are making vacuums
that are just as sleek and just as
modern with all of the cyclone
technology and none of the design flaws
foreseen at with the dc50 I'm Katie
