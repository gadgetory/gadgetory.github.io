today we're gonna take a look at the
main gear Potenza Superstock so this is
main gears high-end small form-factor
gaming desktop you can see it's got some
nice clean looks and there's really some
fast performance inside this box and you
have to compromise due to its size a
little bit it's not quite the most
upgradable PC we've seen and because of
that you can't add a second graphics
card and you can get other pcs in this
price range the two cards they'll give
you a bit more performance as long as
you understand the sacrifices oh this is
a pretty great high-end gaming system so
like a lot of minier designs we've seen
recently the ports on the system are
actually at the top of the case you take
off this plastic vent and inside you can
see there's the power buttons helping
USB ports here down on the motherboard
you'll see inputs for USB 3 as well as
various kinds of audio now on the front
of the case you can see there's one slot
here for the DVD drive there's no
blu-ray drive of the system but you can
get that as an option you'll see part of
the magic with this system those tuners
to take these panels off front panel
pops down and so do the back and this
side and this side of the case is fixed
to the chassis but the rest of it gives
you pretty clean access to the inside of
the system so you'll note that this is a
really compact design inside of here and
in fact I didn't even try to get the
graphics card off because I really
wasn't sure if I could get it back in
it's sort of hemmed in on the top and
the bottom here from this side of the
case you can see here's the slim optical
drive if we look over here we can see
here's the hard drive sled the liquid
cooling pipes and down here is the heat
exchanger there's memory in there as
well as a liquid cooled CPU so for its
components the system has an overclocked
core i7 3770k CPU eight gigs of memory
an nvidia geforce gtx 680 graphics card
as well as the solid state and standard
mechanical hard drive setup now in our
lab we found this is one of the fastest
pcs for application testing and for
games it's among the fastest in terms of
single card pcs the only real caveat as
far as this performance we mentioned
earlier you can buy a similar PC in the
same price range that has two higher-end
graphics cards they'll give you better
performance especially if you go to two
displays so I can really only recommend
this system if you need a particularly
compact gaming desktop or if you like it
looks overall its price is fair for what
you get if you include size on that
premium but you just have to understand
that you sacrifice some upgrading as
well as some potential
and graphics capability so much Brown
this is main gears pretends a super
stock</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
