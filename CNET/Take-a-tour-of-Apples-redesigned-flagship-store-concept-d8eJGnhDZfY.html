Store preview here in Union Square their
first and their largest global store
we're talking about 42 feet tall glass
sliding doors that open up 40 feet wide
to kind of get you into the store now
there's five features that they really
incorporated into this store that we'll
be rolling out to all future stores from
this point one of them is called the
Avenue they're going to have these
feature spaces one for photography Apple
music the app store and also an art and
creativity expert people that can even
take you out to somewhere like Union
Square to take photos and test out
cameras so just a way to really get in
touch with the hardware and software
here at Apple the next thing is a
boardroom we know Apple does a lot of
small business so they have a dedicated
space it's not even open up yet to the
public but it looks like this boardroom
nice and cozy that you can access here
at the store the third is called the
genius Grove it's kind of a change from
the name of Genius Bar again the theme a
lot of open space but where you can get
all your service repairs done here the
forest base I'm kind of standing right
here in it you'll see a lot of brown
stools a big large screen this is kind
of their new theater where they're going
to hold a lot of events at the Apple
store as well and the final piece this
plaza there are sliding doors to get you
outside there's a sculpture by Ruth
asawa and really just an open space
following along with this theme of a
Town Square to really make this store
feel like it's part of the area that
it's in</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
