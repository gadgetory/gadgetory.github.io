taking a first look at the Philips
screamy oh now this is the first short
throw projector and what that means is
that the projector doesn't have to be
mounted somewhere across the room it can
be as close as four inches to the wall
you're projecting on and that screen can
go from 50 inches to a hundred inches
depending on how far away it is so it's
very flexible what's also unique about
this guy is that it uses an LED light
engine so instead of using the
traditional bulb that you might have to
change after a while you don't ever have
to replace those LEDs and Philips claims
that will give you a nicer crisper
picture the projector runs a full
version of Android which gives you
access to a suite of apps including
YouTube and other video streaming
services as well as DLNA so sharing
files over the same network and miracast
which works with other Android devices
it's also got bluetooth of course Wi-Fi
and a bunch of inputs including HDMI
auxilary an SD card slot and of course
USB what's surprising is that built in
is a Dolby Digital 2.1 speaker system
now usually if you buy a projector
you'll want to add on your own audio
system but we took this guy for a spin
and I have to say it sounds awesome
finally you can't ignore the design this
projector looks really good and it
includes this handy carrying strap so
you can take it from place to place and
maybe have a little movie viewing party
we don't have an exact release date for
the screen yo but we do know that it
will be $17.99 and it's coming out in
summer of 2014 for cnet.com I'm Sharon
