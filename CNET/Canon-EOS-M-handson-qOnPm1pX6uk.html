expected less than I should have the
design of cannons first and only
interchangeable-lens compact stands out
it's got a nice well built and well
conceived metal body that's compact it
comfortable to grip single-handed while
I wish it were tilt a bowl or
articulated the touchscreens quite
responsive with a streamlined interface
and the hard controls are simple but
effective the camera also delivers
excellent photo quality though not more
excellent than competitors like the NEX
5r you can comfortably shoot JPEGs up
through iso 1600 but at all iso
sensitivities i could get better results
in some way or another by processing the
raw files in part that's because none of
the cameras color presets to live a
really accurate color and I find a lot
of hue that I don't like however I
suspect a lot of people will find the
colours pleasing enough I'm all the
videos fine for typical vacation clips
and the autofocus and video doesn't
pulse annoyingly there's a lot more muah
ray and aliasing than I think there
really should be plus the low-light
video is fairly noisy looking you do
have complete manual controls in video
which is nice but the camera lack
speaking to help with manual focus for
both stills and video and feature sets
otherwise fairly blah it's got a handful
of special effects it doesn't really
render them with any novelty that's got
a hot shoe but there's no option for an
electronic viewfinder and the only flash
is optional and bulky but the real
Achilles heel of the camera is
performance even with the hybrid phase
and contrast detection autofocus system
it's really slow to focus and shoot in a
lot of circumstances it's great for
capturing kids and animals if you want
them half out of the frame and while it
can maintain a pretty fast burst that's
not with autofocus enabled the fact that
there are only two native lenses for the
system an 18 to 55 millimeter standard
kit and the 22 millimeter f2 pancake
makes less attractive
more established systems sure you can
pay about 200 bucks for an adaptor to
support other canon lenses but it shoots
nice photos and it feels good in your
hands but unfortunately it doesn't out
do most of the competition I'm Laurie
grinning and this is the canon eos m</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
