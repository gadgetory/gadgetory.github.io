get touchy feely with the new Nook
eReader how to make the switch from
iphone to android home inventors show
off at maker faire and the droid x2 and
Xperia Play leave us wanting more it's
all coming up right now
hey everyone welcome to the scene that
tech review where we collect our hottest
videos of the week and tell you what's
good and what's bad in the world of tech
and we also offer some unique tech
wisdom in the form of the bottom line
I'm Brian Tom filling in for Mollywood
who's on a very special assignment this
week but as usual let's start things off
with the good first up there were a
couple of big announcements in the
Windows Phone and ereader worlds this
week here's Bonnie sean-david car noise
to tell you all about them hey everyone
I'm Banita senior editor at cnet com and
we are here in New York where Microsoft
just previewed their new windows phone
mango update there are actually over 500
features coming with the update but
they're concentrating on three key areas
and that's communications the browser
and apps some of the highlights of
update include a group contacts now and
as well as linked in boxes so you can
now link your personal inbox loop which
is something we've been looking forward
to with the internet browser you now get
ie9 with support for html5 and as for
apps you get third-party multitasking
and they gave a demo here and it looks
pretty easy so that's a big feature
we've been looking for a couple other
highlights include Twitter and LinkedIn
integration into your peoples hub as
well as dynamic live tiles for your app
so you can see which means right on your
Start story all these features will be
coming with a mango update due out this
fall they're not talking about handsets
yet but we do think it will hear more
about it in late summer or fall so look
forward to some more hardware and mango
update i'm bonnie chen this has been
your preview of the windows phone video
hi I'm David Carr nguoi and I'm here
with the new nook this is being branded
as the Simple Touch reader it has a
touch screen that has neo node infrared
technology that's the technology that's
in the sony reader and also the new Kobo
touch edition this device comes with two
gigabytes of internal memory as well as
an expansion slot and microSD expansion
slot so you can add up to 32 gigs on a
card and that allows you to sort
literally thousands of books the one of
the big deals here is the battery life
Barnes our noblest saying you can go up
to two months on a single charge and
that means that's about twice as long as
the Kindle right now as you can see
there are very few buttons on this
device there's one main nuke button and
there is a power button that's really it
you navigate everything through the
touch screen there's a homescreen of
shopping all the things that you would
expect from the old nook but it is on a
touchscreen device this runs on android
2.1 it weighs 7 point 5 ounces that's
just a shade heavier than the Kobo touch
edition but it is a very light device
marginal has had sort of this soft touch
paint to the back so it's got a little
bit of rubberized feel to it there's
also some buttons on the side of the
screen that allow you to do things like
go fast forward through a book in terms
of font sizes you get seven different
font sizes and there are six different
styles of fonts it reads PDF files but
does not read Word files and there are
no nook apps available for the device
this is really a strictly and emitting
device it has a Pearl Earring screen
that's readable in direct sunlight
that's the same inch screen that's in
the kindle as well as new kobo reader
and sony readers one of the big issues
with ink is that you get sort of a
ghosting effect but Barnes and Noble has
really taken a lot of care into making
sure those flashing has been reduced
this is really a pretty quick device it
has a 800 megahertz
texas instruments omap processor in it
this is a Wi-Fi only device there is no
3g is a hundred thirty nine dollars
that's the same price as the kindle
Wi-Fi over it is twenty-five dollars
more than the kindle with special offers
barnes noble is making a big deal about
these social networking features in
those dice there's something called nuke
friends that allows you to share what
you're reading what's in your library
with friends one of the nice things
about having the touch screen is you can
do the dictionary lookup you can
actually tap and hold on a word and that
word will come up and it'll
automatically look up the word so there
you have it the new nook the Simple
Touch reader will soon find out whether
it is a kindle killer it is a smaller
device than the kindle and the
touchscreen certainly adds a
navigational element that the kindle
does not have right now will be
interesting to see what Amazon's
response to it is i'm david carr nguoi
and that's the new Nook the Simple Touch
reader thanks for watching that new
touch screen is pretty nice but the Nook
isn't the only ereader that has one as
David mentioned he also got a look at
the new Kobo touch and you can see more
of it over at Cena TV com now tourney
from touch screens to touch pads next up
Scott sign brings us a look at the
latest in the thinkpad edge series from
Lenovo though not as slim or as light as
some of its competitors this new edge
does feature a new touch pad design plus
many other features thinkpad fans have
come to expect from a business laptop
hey I'm Scott Stein senior editor at
cnet com and this is the lenovo thinkpad
edge e 2 20's now what good is a laptop
if it's not portable and sometimes it's
nicer for a laptop to be even more
portable did this thinkpad edge 2 20 s
kind of falls into that ultraportable
category what does that mean well it's a
little bigger than a netbook it's a
little smaller than a full-size laptop
it's kind of that strange middle ground
for the 12.5 inch screen and these
dimensions it means that's going to feel
more compact in your bag and it's not
going to feel quite as heavy it's about
3.2 pounds which is a nice way to carry
around and it's under an inch thick and
really what the 12.5 inch screen amounts
to is it kind of compresses the edges
here making for that small
sighs and lying the keyboard to fill the
space and it is a full-size keyboard
which is nice going into that why do you
get a thinkpad while you get it for its
business features and its business
software but also a lot of people like
its ergonomics the thinkpad edge
keyboard is a new raised keyboard we saw
this on the thinkpad edge design last
year it's also on the thinkpad x1 that
we just reviewed it's great it's a
really nice raised keyboard got concave
keys we won't go too much more into it
but if you're a keyboard nut you're
going to like it also there's a trackpad
on here that's a click pad there are no
more buttons on the bottom here this is
a dual click zone area there are buttons
up here but what those are for is for
this red nubbin that is known as the
trackpoint this is on most think pads
and it's some people like it because on
a plane they don't have to move their
finger around as much anyway there's not
as much cramping here because those
buttons have been removed so there's
more finger space there a couple of
upscale features on this edge 2 20's to
that put it a little bit above the
standard thinkpad line infinity glass
glossy display Dolby sound and it's
speakers there's also a neat little
light that comes up that lights up your
keyboard we've sent that under the
thinkpads before but it's a nice feature
to have and it comes complete with your
basic ports through USB 2.0 it's got
hdmi it also has full laptop specs
inside from about 4 gigs of ram in this
one a 320 gigabyte hard drive it's got a
core i5 processor that's second gen
intel core i5 although it is low voltage
which means it runs at a slower speed
it's actually the same processor that we
saw on the samsung series 9 really thin
laptop that we reviewed earlier this
year the starting price on the edge 2
20's is 749 that's a lot cheaper than
the sixteen hundred dollars of the
samsung series 9 now does not as thin a
laptop and the battery life is not as
good but when you can get a laptop like
this at that price that's really nice
and it's a lot more affordable than the
thinkpad x1 the super high-end 13-inch
laptop that we reviewed recently that's
about as thin in a nutshell this is a
thinkpad would carry around with us i
really love the ideapad you to 60 which
came out earlier in the year almost the
same design but was on the ideapad side
of things had a really nice slick look
but
last year's core i5 processor and worse
battery life the battery life
improvements on this are nice gets it
over four hours plus it's got a faster
processor you probably like that total
package and at under eight hundred
dollars for two gigs of RAM in that
configuration it's hard to complain I'm
Scott Stein and this is a look at the
lenovo thinkpad edge e 2 20 s so looks
like lenovo has redeemed itself after
that nasty beating the thinkpad x1
suffered in last week's tech review now
I'm just glad molly was the one who said
it and not me now you might know I host
a show called the apple byte and we're
not going to make this an apple vs
android battle but there are plenty of
reasons why you might want to switch
from apple to android drop calls yeah so
here's Sharon Vaknin with some of the
tips to make the process less painful
hey current iphone users I'm Sharon
Vaknin since you've probably already
decided to switch to Android I'm not
going to tell you all of the benefits of
doing it you already know that you're
getting a highly customizable interface
and that you can choose from a huge
selection of phones I also don't need to
tell you that you're probably getting a
faster processor and a better camera
along with free turn-by-turn navigation
you know these things and more so now
it's time to figure out how to get all
your iphone data to your shiny new
android phone all right get your iphone
android and computer out in front of you
the least you need to do before
following these steps is add your google
account to your new phone by going to
menu settings account and sync Add
Account Google and then following the
steps on the screen if you don't have a
Google account there's also an option to
create one let's start by transferring
your contacts connect your iPhone to
your computer and launch itunes click on
your phone's name then go to the info
tab check sync contacts with google
contacts and now enter the same gmail
account associated with your phone then
apply the changes
your contacts are now being transferred
from your iphone to gmail and from gmail
to your android calendars and notes are
also easy to transfer on your iPhone go
to settings and then mail contacts and
calendars if the gmail account you're
using with your Android isn't here at it
then go back to mail settings tap the
account and turn sinking on for
calendars notes now your calendar will
transfer to your new phone and your
notes will be filed under a label and
gmail called notes you can't sync notes
back to your Android but they're safe
and gmail and searchable if you ever
need to find them now it's time for some
bad news there's really no easy syncing
for Android like there was for your
iphone through iTunes everything is done
with manual dragging and dropping mostly
for photos videos and music let's start
with photos and videos we first need to
get them off your iPhone and onto your
computer Mac users just connect your
iPhone to your computer and launch image
capture put the photos in a new folder
on your desktop and hit download all if
you're on Windows plug in your phone and
open my computer you'll see the phone
show up as an imaging device right click
it and hit explore then drag and drop
all the photos and videos into a new
folder on your desktop now connect your
Android phone to your Windows or Mac
computer mount the phone and you'll see
it show up on your desktop open it and
find the pictures folder sometimes it's
called DCIM but if you don't see one
just create it you can name it photos
then just drag and drop the files from
your hard drive onto the android
pictures folder and let it transfer once
it's done the photos will show up in the
gallery app on your phone and of course
you can also add other photos and videos
from your hard drive using the same drag
and drop method the same method applies
to putting music on your Android you
might be thinking about your text
messages and voicemail right now there's
no simple way to export these items from
your iPhone it's possible but the
process itself really deserves its own
how to if there are specific text
messages you want to keep you can
forward them to your
email account by going to messages
opening the conversation hit edit and
then tap the messages you want to
forward hit forward and send it to your
email address that's really the only
easy option with your contacts calendars
photos music and videos on your new
Android what are you going to do with
your old iPhone well you can keep it and
basically use it as an ipod or you can
sell it somewhere online like gazelle or
you can make mom happy and give her a
nice gift for cnet I'm Sharon Vaknin and
i'll see you on the interwebs see you
guys that's just too complicated you'll
be much happier if you just stay with
your iPhone trust me I promise and thank
you seriously though if you do decide to
make the switch and you've transferred
all your music to your new phone or to
the cloud you'll probably find the
standard Android music app a little bit
lacking luckily we've compiled the top 5
android music player apps that you can
use instead
if you recently bought an android phone
and about half of all smartphone buyers
lately did exactly that you know it's a
Swiss Army knife of a thing but how are
you with the music player that comes
with it mmm I'm Brian Cooley with the
top 5 android music players that will
make you forget how to even spell ipod
courtesy of a list done by cnet's josh
goldman number five is the amazon cloud
player this freebie is hot new stuff by
store and play the music from the cloud
that's the internet or you can download
the files if you like so quick five
gigabytes of space is provided to you
for free from amazon 20 gig if you buy
just one mp3 album from them now it's
not that well developed as a player in
terms of managing your music just yet
but it's a healthy taste of where things
are going number four is called mixing
this guy has something akin to the
genius technology you find it itunes so
it's kind of spooky how it can suggest
music based on just a song or two you
feed it it'll make and tune playlists
that keep getting more and more like you
the more you use it it also has built-in
artist information of direct links out
to youtube videos of their music videos
and also a graphic eq and it's free but
if you pay five dollars the ads go away
number three is tune wiki now in my view
people are either music people or their
lyric people and this apt is for the
ladder it'll show you time to paste
lyrics subtitles while the music's
playing while also getting the album art
up there along with player controls you
can drive it by voices well through the
android voice layer and you can use it
to map the locations of other tunewiki
users nearby so that whole spooky
obsession with lyrics thing that you've
got going on can we got someone other
than just your former friends oh and
it's free number two is called powering
now in spite of the title it doesn't
just play death metal it's totally about
quality sound with a 10-man eq that
sweetens just about every audio format
it plays just about all you can even set
eq
per song which given the variable
quality of most of our mp3's is a
welcome feature bottom line poweramp
just sounds great five bucks but there
is a free 15 day trial before I get you
to number one don't think there are just
five great audio players for Android
check out Josh Goldman's full ten app
slideshow on cnet com oh by the way if
you have questions about using your
Android phone as your in-car audio
player check out the Android Atlas
podcast that's at two o'clock on
Thursdays that's two o'clock pacific at
cnet com / live there you'll find my car
tech colleague antuan goodwin and he
knows how to connect all the dots
between cars and android okay the
number1 music player we love for android
is called player pro the features what
doesn't it have search download and save
lyrics great tag editing 10 band EQ
social network integration I love this
lots of really usable home screen
widgets and different lock screen
widgets with customizable control
options so your phone really works and
feels like a true ipod this is the
do-all player for android it costs an
odd four dollars and fifty-one sense hmm
but there is a free five day trial
you're gonna love it and want to pay for
it great music players for android just
one more reason the smartphone will
eventually eat the entire tech industry
for more videos like this go to top 5
cnet com I'm Brian Cooley thanks for
watching
wow those are some pretty good apps you
know I wish itunes did all of that fine
well guys it looks like it's time to
take a break we'll be right back for
more tech review right after this
welcome back to the scene at tech review
our weekly video digest of all things
good and bad we've seen here at Cena TV
now we've already seen some of the good
stuff so you know what it must be time
for the bad this week we've got a couple
more android phones for your
consideration now our editors had high
hopes for these handsets when they were
announced but it turns out they really
couldn't live up to the hype the
motorola droid x was one of verizon's
most popular phones last year but the
tech world moves fast and it's time for
a new model to step in hey everyone I'm
bonshaw senior editor at cnet com and
I'm here with your first look at the
motorola droid x2 the successor to the
droid x so you really wouldn't know it
just by looking at it the two phones
pretty much have identical designs the
x2 is the same size and weight as the
original model so you're looking at a
good chunk of hardware here but I
wouldn't say it's any worse than the
other 4.3 inch touchscreen models out
there if anything the bump on the back
adds just a little extra bulk while the
phone looks the same Motorola did
upgrade the display on the x2 from a
wvga screen to a higher resolution qhd
display it's a very good-looking screen
but not quite a sharp or smooth as the
iphones retina display or samsung super
amoled plus screens still you're not
going to have any problems reading
what's on screen and the extra space
makes it great for viewing websites and
videos one other quick difference about
the X tues design is that Motorola
remove the dedicated camera button on
the right side so now you have to use
the touchscreen too not too happy about
side from the display the biggest
approve Minh that the x2 offers is the
addition of a dual-core processor the
benefit of this is that the smartphone
offers snap your performance
particularly when it comes to browsing
and gaming I was able to play 3d games
with no problem and it handled most
websites with no problem the unfortunate
thing is that the droid x2 isn't forgy
capable so you'll have to browse on 3G
speeds which isn't horrible but it would
have been a nice addition for this
upgraded phone because of the lack of 4G
obviously the droid x2 is going to turn
some people off and to be honest I was
disappointed too and if you fall into
that camp I'd say
take a look at the HTC Thunderbolt or
Samsung Droid Charge maybe wait for the
Droid Bionic but if you're okay with
just 3d I think there's a lot to like
about the x2 it's got fast performance
good call quality and battery life so
you're getting a very solid performer
here the motorola droid x2 is available
now for 1 99 99 with a two-year contract
I'm Bonnie Tom this has been your first
look at the motorola droid x2 i'm nicole
a senior associate editor for cnet.com
and this is a first look at the sony
ericsson xperia play this is essentially
Sony's answer to the much-touted and
much height playstation phone this phone
does indeed have a slide-out gaming pad
as you can see here the gamepad looks
very similar to Sony's PlayStation dual
shock controller you get the d-pad on
the one side here and the usual
PlayStation face buttons on the other
side you also get the same select and
start buttons on the bottom right here
in the middle instead of two analog
joysticks you get to touch sensitive
circles these circles essentially act as
the analog controls you would use these
analog controls to control things like
movement and camera viewing angles as
you might expect the xperia play comes
with a few games with it comes with
bruce lee Dragon Warrior s46 a racing
game as well as an old playstation
classic crash bandicoot if you wish to
get more games for the xperia play you
can select the little button down here
and that will lead you to a featured
list of xperia play games on the V CAST
App Store as far as the gameplay
experience goes we do think these
physical controls offer a Richard
gameplay experience over the usual
touchscreen controls of most phones
however we thought the analog joystick
controls just were not as responsive as
we would like we ended up just using
these physical controls for the most
part however not all games are
configured to use these gameplay
controls so make sure you find the games
that are meant for the xperia play on
the whole
we found the gameplay experience very
immersive using these physical controls
it's definitely much more of a richer
gameplay experience than just using the
touchscreen controls also on the side of
the phone here are the left and right
shoulder buttons the Xperia Play ships
with the latest version of android
gingerbread 2.3 they did not clutter up
the phone with any fancy interface on
the front of the Xperia Play is a very
bright and colorful 4-inch capacitive
touch display you get up to five
customizable home screens you also get
all the usual gingerbread features above
the display is a front-facing vga camera
and on the back is a 5 megapixel camera
lights and LED flash so it's the sony
ericsson xperia play for you if you're a
serious mobile gamer that wants to take
your gaming to the next level then this
does offer a Richard gameplay experience
but there are a few faults the phone
doesn't have 4g LTE and the analog
joysticks are wanting we do think it's a
better game play experience than most
other touchscreen smartphones but we
don't think it's enough for you to give
up your PSP or nintendo DS just yet
these sony ericsson xperia play is
available for around two hundred dollars
of the two-year service agreement with
verizon wireless i'm nicole unas has
been the first look at new sony ericsson
xperia play
alright so those phones aren't total
failures but come on motorola no 4g
seriously and like Nicole said I'll pass
on the Xperia Play and stick with my PSP
now let's wrap things up with this
week's bottom line each year Maker Faire
events across the country give home
inventors and artists the opportunity to
show off their creations to the public
now last weekend the crew from the crave
podcast took a tour of the Bay Area
edition of Maker Faire and here's what
they found hey I'm Donnell Bell and i'm
eric franklin and we're at the 2011
Maker Faire in San Mateo California this
is a celebration of inventors and their
inventions crack enos all kinds of cool
stuff and there's always some cool tech
to see so let's go inside and check it
out so as originally started as kind of
a goofy halloween costume project is a
shareware program and the models are
available from google sketchup there's a
halo costuming wiki what is this exactly
this is a kinetic sculpture kinetic
artist to do a different sort of a wide
range of kinetic work there's a button
here that you can push and hold and when
you do that cause we bobble up and down
beautiful as they should be
you're here to show off awesome robot
sculpture Ella term we use is kinetic
sculpture my particular approach is to
use only things that I can find key hole
covers ukulele knobs the whole head is a
voltage meter that's been flipped upside
down and cut it out this one's name is
doubtful because that's the center line
reading on this gauge here I know
there's a story behind how you've
actually come to create this i
disassembled typewriters exclusively and
i reassemble them into human figures and
animals I don't solder I don't blue I
don't weld I don't wire things together
I just use the existing parts of
typewriters and reassemble everything
this is the plasma Drive of the Reagan
gothic rocket ship which is a 40-foot
tall retro-styled rocket ships which is
currently installed on the pier of San
Francisco the science fact is this is
the platform for studying a high-voltage
phenomena called the dielectric barrier
discharge as it turns this crackles with
with high-voltage electricity and you're
going to do that for us right now no
unfortunately we can't turn off high
voltage here I think there's probably
it's probably the wait wait wait again
it requires darkness and it's something
of an intimate affair but there's some
great pic videos of it on my webpage
almost scientific locom it's kind of fun
I've never done anything vaguely
artistic in my life this is a send-up of
the typical tract home of an urban
sprawl the chassis is a Jewish water
pipe it runs it about a good jogging
speed something you don't want the
flamingo's to blow off so these are the
boxing all the different routines are
stored in the Android phone is that and
that's sending that information out to
another microcontroller inside the baton
motor is a transference and the
controller through the motors alright
come on give me the hug I'm ready ok
what are you showing here at maker faire
today so we're showing fire gym which is
a rock experience using rock van which
is a video game basically the way it
works is we have we have my friend John
over here playing the guitar we took
that guitar you plug into the computer
it sends data to the Arduino which is a
little microcontroller that uh basically
controls anything you want to it's
completely open source you can program
anything on take start five volts that
you got from there do we know and puts
it on and sends it to the relay which
gets which makes the dot five volts 120
right so 120 volts goes into one of
these solenoids and the solenoids make
it open up when they get when they get
electricity and then the propane flows
right through and out the top
the bottom line this week I want a robot
hug but that's it though you know guys I
won't let this thing get past first base
that would be just weird or not okay
folks that's going to be our show but
we'll be back next week with a brand new
cnet tech review until then there are
tons of great videos available every day
at cnet TV com see you next time and
