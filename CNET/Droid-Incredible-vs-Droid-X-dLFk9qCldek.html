Tong and we have another blockbuster
battle for you it's a prize fight pull
it out between the HTC droid incredible
and the motorola droid x our judges for
this fight our senior editor Bonnie boom
boom cha senior associate editor Nicole
ice-cold Lee and you know who all night
long tongue will take all three judges
blind scores and average them out to the
nearest tenth each round the final prize
fights for will be an average of all
rounds using the same decimal system get
ready for some droid on droid action
first round of sexiness and durability
the droid incredible has a compact and
slender profile that fits in your hand
it's rubberized surface can take a
beating and even if the ladies like the
topographic design I'm still not a fan
of the triple layer booty now the droid
x has a whopping 4.3 inch screen for its
main attraction but this phone is large
it's not comfortable to hold and it's
even taller and less pocket friendly
than another prizefight favorite the evo
4g translation this thing is huge the
incredible takes this round with a 4.3
and the droid x gets a 3.7 next round
his controls and user interface the
incredible features HTC's Sense UI and
its hands down our favorite flavor of
Android with its elegance and
customization and it really makes
Android less intimidating to newbies
even with its learning curve Nicole and
Bonnie didn't like the optical joystick
but it doesn't take away from the device
for me the joy tax to get some love here
for its ro physical navigation buttons
and the superhot swype keyboard option
built in but the motoblur interface
isn't as polished as the sense UI and
why did they decide to swap the home and
menu buttons that are pretty much the
same on all flagship android phones this
one's close but the incredible just gets
the edge with the four and the droid x
gets a 3.7 after averaging two rounds
the incredible leads by half a point but
there's plenty of fight left round three
is features
these phones are almost identical under
the hood with 3g Wi-Fi Bluetooth and GPS
they bring all of androids goodies like
voice search batting cages GPS
turn-by-turn directions and voice to
text what's shakin bacon but the droid x
is the new kid on the block and being
able to use it as a mobile hotspot and
hook it up to a TV with its hdmi out put
it on top the droid x takes its first
round with a 4.7 and the incredible gets
of for next round is web browsing and
multimedia when it comes to web browsing
to multimedia these guys are almost
Carbon Copy close of each other browsing
is pretty smooth on both phones and they
feature multiple windows and bookmark
previews now the incredible features HTC
Sense UI media player which is elegant
and cleaner compared to the droid x is
standard player which really needs some
help but forget about all that the droid
x is 4.3 inch screen enhances every
experience by making web surfing looking
at photos and watching movies that much
better x marks the spot and the droid x
gets off / pick 5 and incredible get 24
so after averaging four rounds the droid
x has gained control leading by two
tenths of a point but this is still
anyone's fight the final round that
decides it all is called quality and
performance we've tested these phones in
different environments from New York
City to the Northern California suburbs
and San Francisco the incredibles call
quality was mixed with Nicole and I
experiencing more clicks and fuzz
compared to the droid x Bonnie had a
signal with no flaws and it was pristine
in the NYC but I've heard better phones
from verizon now we were also able to
squeeze out a solid five and a half
hours of battery juice when talking over
3g and that is impressive now the droid
x was equally as good in New York for
Bonnie with excellent call quality but
Nicole and I still heard a few pops and
breaks over here our labs were able to
pump out seven and a half hours of
talktime on the droid x and that's even
more impressive performance is king and
in the final round the droid x gets a
4.7 and the incredible gets of 4 so
let's average out all five rounds
in a prize fight where the incredible
took the early lead the droidx kept
chipping away and takes this battle 4.4
to 4.1 and is your prize fight winner
both of these phones are great pics for
verizon but in this case size and
features matter i'm brian song thanks
for watching we'll catch you guys next
time on another prize fight</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
