one of the smartest cars in the road but
since then it's only gotten smarter
thanks to a series of software updates
today Tesla's unveiled one of the most
advanced software updates yet
adding the vaunted autopilot
functionality that will let the car
steer itself we're here in New York
we're going to take it for a ride so
we're in New York City traffic which on
one hand is a terrible place to drive
but on the other hand is a pretty good
place to test car with some autonomy
features right now I'm going to take my
hands completely off the wheel and my
feet are off the pedals as well and as
you can see the car is moving along on
its own there's a Volvo in front of us
it's slowing down and the cars recognize
that there's a blue car here on the
dashboard which has been improved to the
new 7.0 software and it basically is
following the moves of that car ahead of
me so as it slows down we will slow down
and as it speeds up we will - it's also
detecting the lines in the road and
being able to basically keep us in those
lines and keep us going forward now I'm
supposed to be keeping my hands on the
wheel and I'm keeping them close to the
wheel just kiss I need to but the car
can go ahead and drive fully
autonomously even with my hands off the
wheel there's also a revised dashboard
that's included as part of the 7'o
release we've got a new lovely looking
clock under there and also the
individual tire pressures are displayed
here in actual psi so it'll give you an
actual explicit reading on what's going
on at every corner of the car pretty
good if your track junkie or an auto
crosser for example you still need to be
paying attention when you're driving
using this system because the system
won't look at things like traffic lights
or even street signs things like that so
you are still very much in control of
the car and even if you are able to take
your hands off the wheel it's important
that you're always paying attention this
isn't the kind of system we can take out
a book or take out your smartphone or or
take a nap even when you're stuck in
traffic like this so we're gonna try a
lane change here there's a car in my
blind spot right now so it won't do it
the car is gone let's see if it'll
change now
there we go as you can see it'll even
change lanes completely hands off pretty
nice no this is not a fully autonomous
Tesla you still gotta wait a couple of
years for that but this is a pretty big
step forward it's probably the most
advanced cell steering system we've seen
on a car yet the ability to change lanes
alone is pretty cool now if you own a
Tesla Model S it was built in October of
2014 through to today or if you're lucky
enough to have a Model X the software
update will be appearing on your car
sometime within the next week if you
have an older model s I'm sorry to say
you're out of luck and if you don't have
a lot less at all what other excuse do
you need</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
