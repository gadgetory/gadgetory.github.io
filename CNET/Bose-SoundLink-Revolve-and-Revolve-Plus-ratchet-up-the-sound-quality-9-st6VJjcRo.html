revolve plus poses new cylindrical
Bluetooth speakers that deliver
360-degree omnidirectional sound the
smaller revolved costs $200.00 while the
bigger revolve Plus which features a
built-in handle for easy transport cost
$300 Bose is touting the speaker's
ability to play very loud for their size
and push out a lot of bass without
distorting and I have to say I was
impressed with both their design and
sound at the respective sizes they may
be the best sounding portable Bluetooth
speakers and they're both water and
shock resistant with a threaded tripod
mount on the bottom of the speaker that
would allow you to attach them to a wall
or a stand as you might expect the
larger revolve plus plays louder and has
better bass response than its little
brother both of these speakers play much
bigger than their size would indicate
and although they do have their sound
limitations they can certainly fill a
small to medium-sized room with sound it
does help to place them near a wall to
get some reflection which will improve
their bass battery life for the revolve
is rated at 12 hours at moderate volume
levels while the revolve Plus is rated
at up to 16 hours
as far as extra features go the speakers
have integrated microphones so you can
use them as speaker phones and you can
pair two of these speakers together
using the Bose Connect app and use them
as a set of stereo speakers or double
them up to augment the sound in party
mode speakers charged via microUSB but
there's also an optional charging cradle
you can buy for them for $30 yes they're
pricey but I did compare them to more
modestly priced Bluetooth speakers such
as the ue wonder boom JBL flip 4 and ue
boom - and they clearly sounded better
the bigger sound and bigger bass the
revolve plus also had no trouble beating
the UE mega boom I have more in-depth
evaluations of their performance in my
text reviews but suffice to say while
you shouldn't expect them to blow away a
good pair of a wired bookshelf speakers
they do sound excellent for their
compact sizes I'm David Carr for
