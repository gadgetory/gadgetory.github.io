how to contributor today we're going to
discuss how to securely wipe all the
data you have stored on your BlackBerry
PlayBook this can come in handy if
you're having problems with an
installation of an OS or you get ready
to sell the device on eBay or to a
friend wiping the data off your device
is important that way people don't have
your pictures and documents and
everything else you have on the device
to do a system restore on your
BlackBerry PlayBook first thing you need
to do is enter the settings menu by
tapping on the gear in the top right
hand corner then scroll down to the
security option here you'll be presented
with another list tap on security wipe
here you're warmed one last time that if
you wipe the device you'll lose all your
applications files pictures videos
anything else that you have stored on
the device if you want to proceed tap in
the text field and you'll type in
blackberry then press wipe data after
you've pressed wipe data you'll see the
screen go black for a couple seconds
next you'll see the BlackBerry PlayBook
logo pop up and that will stay on for a
couple of minutes while the PlayBook
erases all of your information in your
pictures and everything else once it
comes back up it's going to take you
through the setup process like it did
the first day you bought it if you're
going to restore from a backup and
BlackBerry desktop manager go ahead and
go through the setup process if you're
restoring it so you can sell it go ahead
and power it off put it in the box and
get ready to sell it that's all there is
to it
