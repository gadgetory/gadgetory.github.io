when it arrived in 1998 but the shtick
ran its course after 11 years or so and
Volkswagen has come back with something
with fewer cute curves and note but face
let's drive the 2012 VW Beetle turbo and
check the tech well here it is the new
New Beetle 2012 they've really changed
things up and let's be entirely frank
they've ichika find the car it's gotten
chunkier angles more strong sort of
edges here and there some creases it
didn't have before the biggest thing I
think you notice is the roofline notice
how the a-pillar comes up and now takes
a turn and kinks right here to get more
of a flat bar more of kind of a slammed
look which takes away that big goofy
iconic bubble that's a good thing to
reach out to a broader market of buyers
but to me it kind of starts to leave its
whole purpose on earth which is to be a
faithful repro of the original beetle
that'll be your call but to me they're
starting to get a little bit far afield
let's get inside
this is the top head unit as we have a
top trim beetle top trim and it's a
turbo this year that's got navigation
first and foremost nice rendering good
pitch the typefaces are good it could be
a little cleaner but for a car in this
price category not bad
of course touch screen which I find
quite responsive you've also got this
knob here which depending what you're
doing is going to be a rotating selector
soft buttons here on the screen are
echoed on hard buttons below them kind
of a redundant waste of real estate but
whatever you've got this weird interface
of VW does where you kind of spin around
the wheel sometimes there's even more
choices than on the screen in which case
the whole thing rotates and gives me a
headache
now all these new beetles come with
roughly the same array of input choices
for entertainment am/fm but no HD
satellite radio is optional I've got an
optical disc slot up here an auxilary
jack is right here and then what they
call the Volkswagen MDI which is this
guy here you've got a pigtail in this
case I've got a USB but I can change it
out if I unplug it from the wall of the
glovebox and put a different pigtail
there we've also got bluetooth streaming
on here which is a nice touch in
addition to Bluetooth calling and all of
those sources go out through an
eight-speaker standard system or you can
get this premium Volkswagen system
that's the middle tier trim on these
cars or if you get the turbo like this
you can load it up with a Fender audio
system we've got these fender badged
speakers over here and this fender audio
system has nine speakers including a
subwoofer now because we're in a turbo
we have an optional transmission beyond
a manual or a standard automatic a DSG
this is a dual clutch gearbox in
Volkswagen parlance and you're gating is
like an automatic you've got PRN D and
then Sport which is a sport drive or
kick it over here to get your shiftable
on the paddles here you do have an
upshift than a downshift behind the
wheel one on each side for the different
direction of shifting we'll see how that
goes on the road but first let's find
out what puts power into that
okay now these new beetles you've got a
choice of two different engines hell
that's right they move that thing a few
years ago while we're here though this
is that fenders subwoofer the big boy
now engines up here ah here it is now
this car is a turbo so we have a
different engine than most beetles which
will have a two and a half liter inline
5 pretty garden-variety VW stuff this
one is a 2-liter four-cylinder they all
sit sidesaddle turbocharged intercooled
they all drive the front wheels no
matter what beetle you get 200
horsepower on this one 207 foot-pounds
of torque
gets this roughly 3,000 pound new beetle
up to 60 in about 6.8 seconds while
delivering 21:30 MPG if you go without
the turbo the numbers look like this the
non turbo beetle two and a half litre
five-cylinder gets you 170 horsepower
and 177 foot-pounds of torque while
giving the car up to 60 in 8 seconds and
delivering 1 mpg better fuel economy on
both counts and as I mentioned we have
the optional DSG but you can also get a
six-speed automatic Tiptronic gearbox on
a turbo now while we're all waiting for
the new New Beetle that come available
as a new New Beetle convertible which
isn't available yet you got to make do
with this optional sunroof which is a
big ol piece of glass but the problem is
when it's on the move it doesn't have a
big old piece of movement it leaves
basically a toaster slot open at the
front while all this stuff is still
covered by in our case dirty glass I
don't know why there's such a limited
retract on this the first thing I picked
up on driving this car is that they've
got the DSG really well dialed in these
dual clutch gearboxes are still pretty
new on the market
there aren't many that are crap anymore
it's a very satisfying gearbox it's
automatic when you want it to be and
more engaged when you want it to be that
as well like a manual but as soon as I
get into the power on this car if I'm
going up a grade at all or anything like
that or if I'm in a turn I'm getting a
lot of wheelspin I'm getting some rear
up on the car so that I'm losing
traction on the front tires this is not
a car for someone who's going to be
driving seriously it's not a sports car
I can feel the turbos definitely making
the most of a small engine you get this
real peak
kind of a thing in terms of the power
delivery again it's fine for a fun
little everyday driver it's not a car
you'd want to use in a lot of you know
sort of demanding driving where you
really want to modulate the power
perfectly and have a good time on the
road it's not that kind of power train
so all in I got to tell you after a
driving this turbo I'm really intrigued
to drive the two and a half liter five
which I also thinks a good motor that
has a different kind of power delivery
that I think I prefer okay let's price
is 2012 beetle first of all let's go
totally based without a turbo without
any option packages twenty thousand five
hundred I bring that up because a lot of
folks look at this car to be somehow as
thrifty and parsimonious as the original
beetle
it doesn't really occupy that same
category in the market anymore but
that's where it starts now on top of
that the sunroof package is twenty five
hundred which gets you the sunroof
satellite radio touchscreen in the
center of the dash and keyless access as
well as of course that nice big roof
sound and nav adds eighteen hundred for
navigation and fender audio and some
bigger wheels then we had the turbo cars
those are going to add 36 to 39 hundred
on top of any of those previous trim
levels I mentioned and that of course
get you the turbo engine a much more
interesting independent front suspension
different wheels you're also going to
get a different front differential for
getting power to those wheels and a few
other engineering changes with this
turbo model we have you get a choice of
gear boxes either 6-speed manual or a
6-speed direct shift dual clutch like we
had for eleven hundred dollars more</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
