the world's most moneyed soccer mom your
car is here let's drive the 2013
Mercedes g63 AMG check the tech now
because I'm neither a petrol crook nor a
well moneyed soccer mom onion an
accessory mercedes-benz does not offer
luckily it's cheap a bag because being
seen in this thing is downright
embarrassing I mean I spent several days
in it primarily in communities where
Ferraris turbo Panamera's and
convertible Bentley's are coming and
they were driving by me mouthing the
word dick the vehicle has not changed
much since 1979 making it the oldest
platform that Mercedes still sells it's
an old military ride in fact the US
Marines just bought 150 of them now
normally I give you some spotter tips on
how to identify the vehicles that we
shoot this one should be relatively easy
it's really tall it's really square it's
got exposed external hinges and it's
unforgiving in its size and mass they
only make one version for consumers
these days it's what they call this long
wheelbase wagon that actually has four
doors and a second row but it's not
exactly a cargo hauler it doesn't
flatten down to haul sheet rock or
plywood it just lets you put more stuff
in the back like ak-47s if you're on
assignment and that back door swings
charmingly like a barn door not lifting
up like a lift gates now spot the AMG
version by the big five-spoke alloys the
badge work that calls out the engine
we'll get to that in a minute and these
audacious dual side pipes who does that
anymore
now before we get to any of the tech
your first indication that this car is
riddled with practical quirkiness is
down here either the world's smallest
basketball net or someone left their
codpiece here to dry in fact it's a cup
holder and you might laugh until you see
at work it's actually brilliant because
it takes all the vibration of the road
out of your coffee so nothing ever
splashes out of there I love these
people how'd they ever lose that war
okay under the electronics command
display seven-inch non touch it's a
Mercedes they don't want the
fingerprints on the screen nothing in
here is dramatically new in terms of
tech but it's all standard for this
price it better be the nav system looks
really good they keep upgrading the map
quality they do a decent job with 3d
buildings you can also get Google search
and Google Street View on here with the
mercedes benz mb apps suite which is
free for three months then you got to
pay for it that will include web search
google local search with Street View as
I mentioned Yelp ratings Facebook and
also the ability to send destinations to
the car we've reviewed it before it
works pretty well
now in terms of media all the hits of
modern tech are here in a few that
aren't hits your media interface on the
screen there is actually this set of
pigtails in the console you've got an
iOS 30 pin on there right now here's a
female aux I believe you can swap this
out for other connectors you've also got
USB down here right next to it you've
got bluetooth streaming as well 10
gigabytes of the hard driver available
for media and there's a card reader in
here somewhere but I would never use
that so I didn't go looking and of
course AM and FM radio both have HD on
them Satellite Radio's in here as well
one way to go on the audio here it's
going to be stocked with Harman Kardon
Logic 7 5.1 support as well
450 Watts 12 speakers around the cabin
nothing to option or modify there now in
terms of driver assistance tech Mercedes
likes to assume you know how to drive so
most of it is passive we have adaptive
cruise control to set distance and speed
there's blind spot warnings they use
these little lit up triangles in the
mirror there's no correction and there's
no lane departure or correction for that
either camera tech on this car is
relatively pedestrian you've got to
backup
which is very handy except you've got a
spare hanging off the rump and it's very
hard to judge the distance of that thing
that's right up in the foreground of the
camera overhead a steel sunroof no silly
glass moonroof you're not gonna open
this thing up for a breeze you're gonna
open it all the way so some muddled
splash off those big tires and get in
your hair
all you're gonna leave it closed so the
bullets ricochet off the roof
another serious oddity in this guy is
the flat glass you may not notice this
in the car you drive that's always been
this way but you have curved glass for
the most part and a sloping greenhouse
this guy's got flat walls and flat glass
in them see that big reflection that's
our camera light looking right back at
you when you're driving you see odd
reflections of the traffic on that side
of the vehicle so you look over and for
a second you think you've got traffic
floating next to you it's a little
unnerving do you get used to it
all over cities raves about this shifter
being a wonderful piece of AMG
innovation I don't see how it looks more
to me like Prius innovation adapted to a
Mercedes it's one of these little
delicate electronic detent shifters for
reverse neutral and drive but then for
some reason Park is a button why not
make that part of the detents so I have
one set of behaviors to control the
drivetrain in this car that just sounds
like a bad idea to mix it up like that
and I hate this little Comfort Sport
manual button I like what it does I hate
how it does it it's tiny it's hard to
find
it's got no actual finger recognition
without looking for it and it does
something critical put you in a
different drive mode put that up here
into the paddles on the wheel make it
big by the shifter but that is silly now
if you think that the g63 is sublime
here's where it starts to get ridiculous
in the engine bay this guy's got a five
and a half litre twin-turbo AMG
v8 yeah and as you can see lovingly
handcrafted by old buddy Sasha building
her these are all made by hand
beautiful motors I don't know if it's
the most brilliant engine in a vehicle
like this I would love to see a big
brawny diesel they do that but not in
the AMG version so here's what we've got
536 horsepower 560 foot-pounds of torque
it could lift this thing straight up let
alone down the road of course we weigh
5,600 some odd pounds here zero to sixty
and 5.3 seconds is amazing for that
reason alone if not because of the big
square profile of the animal where it
all comes out in the wash rather badly
is the mpg 1214 that probably means 10
real-world
yeah no gas guzzler tax oh not because
it isn't a gas guzzler but because it's
a light truck and they're exempt from
gas guzzler regulations all this power
always goes out through a 7-speed Sport
automatic again a weird thing in a
vehicle that is so off-road centric and
does it drive all four wheels of course
it does through not one not two but
three lockable differentials if this
thing had eight wheels it would drive
them all in fact they actually make a
six five six on this but that's another
video let's go for a ride
well I don't know if I could possibly
flex this vehicle it's so damn off-road
capable think about it
twin-turbo two banks of four cylinders
each and that big v8
we've got body-on-frame construction two
solid axles three locking diffs if you
need heavier gear than this it's
probably gonna get delivered get a c-17
you know it's the most eerie about
taking this thing off road
nothing squeaks nothing rattles this
really is a bank vault on wheels now on
pavement this thing prints tank it's
built like one but you also get a lot of
road feedback like one the vibration and
noise make it frankly tedious to drive
on an everyday basis and that barn
burning engine is very muted in any of
the automatic modes but drop it into
manual and get on those paddles and
everything changes it's a vicious bigboy
as is that exhaust note that you would
much more expect coming out of a 63
Vette than a 2013 Benz
okay let's price this guy pretty simple
135 grand right around there delivered
and there ain't no options to speak of
not seen that style everything's in
there already but there are some
additional costs about 70 grand for a
rose gold Audemars Piguet because you're
a petro crook and that's what you wear
or 15 cents for a bag that's how I roll</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
