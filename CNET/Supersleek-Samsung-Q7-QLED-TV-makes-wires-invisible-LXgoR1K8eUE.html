TVs I've ever tested Samsung's q7 is the
company's cheapest so-called Q LED TV
this year but it's still really
expensive you're paying for sleek looks
not necessarily superior picture one of
its coolest extras is this ultra thin
wire which Samsung calls the invisible
connection it's 16 feet long and winds
up into a little puck you plug one into
the back of the TV and the other end of
the included one connect box then you
hook all your stuff cable box game
console Roku box whatever to the one
connect which can hide discreetly even
inside a cabinet with the rest of your
boxes
the invisible connection is so thin it
can go just about anywhere even straight
up the wall and basically blend in if
you don't wall mount you can stash it
inside the TVs sweet-looking stand along
with the power cable Samsung's design
also extends to the back side of the TV
which looks almost as nice as the front
seen from the couch the q7 is all
picture and the thin frame and metallic
accents completes impeccable fit and
finish even the all-metal remote is
cooler than usual since the TV has a
unique ability recognized gear you plug
in automatically and integrate it right
into the menu system you can use the
included clicker to control just about
everything it doesn't work with all the
gear we tried but for many people it's a
great alternative to a universal remote
control the menus are simple and
straightforward with a decent selection
streaming apps including many with 4k
and HDR capability for the highest
quality streams it also services
individual shows and movies in many apps
you can customize the layout easily as I
mentioned at the top however the q7s
picture quality wasn't as oppressive as
its design the picture is very good in
bright rooms but in demanding home
theater environments it couldn't match
some of the better LED LCD TVs we tested
and fell even shorter compared to our
favorite OLED based TVs as usual with
edge-lit
LCDs like the q7 the culprit was lighter
black levels in stray illumination and
local dimming system overall the Samsung
q7 is a great choice for people who
prize hiding wires over cutting-edge
picture quality I'm David Katz my resina</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
