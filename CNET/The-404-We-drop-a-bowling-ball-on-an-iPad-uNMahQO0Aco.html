44 guys Justin and Jeff we're here at
the g-form booth to test that one of a
little more benign things here at CES a
case now we've seen no dozens of cases
across the years generally they're just
extra soft and you know like if you drop
them this has happened to a lot of
friends they'll crack you know even
though they're in the case g-form says
that that's because they got the science
wrong behind it the way they've built it
they come from a background of actually
athletics so they've built pad for
football players soccer players and the
idea is the molecules actually stiffen
when they're when there's a lot of
kinetic energy that hits them right so
they're generally pretty soft at first
you know like I said they come from
athletic background so you can actually
wear a couple of them they've got this
version right here that goes on the shin
you know they're kind of stylish but you
might have seen their YouTube video it's
running back there right now where
they've dropped an iPad from a hundred
thousand feet almost in space they claim
that the ipad actually survived the drop
and we're going to do a little test here
ourselves Justin yeah that's a strong
man over here he's got a bowling ball
yeah you know what to definitely put
this technology to the test I've
actually
I really hope that they stand behind the
product otherwise muscles gonna be out
one really expensive tablet you don't
worry about it is a fine we'll be fine
if you're doing this all day I think
this is a real iPad we had the cnet page
loaded up and yeah Wilson it's okay
don't worry it'll be fine I'm sure
they'll buy you new one or whatever now
we're gonna put it into the case zip it
up say goodbye Wilson all right somebody
just bowling yeah i'm gonna put this in
there
yep I hope and here's the bowling ball
so we're gonna put it halfway through
are you ready Wilson three two one oh
that didn't sound good so let's double
check to make sure that it's okay you
can't really like this thing anyway
right it's fine oh you're gonna be
bummed it's fine it is still in working
condition there it isn't so G form has a
full line of protective cases for I
devices and tablets they have an iphone
case that you can for forty dollars
gives you that same sort of padding on
your iPhone they make one for 7-inch
tablets as well they call this the edge
that 7-inch is thirty-five dollars and
then they have one for the ipad the
10-inch tablets they call this the edge
design gives you sort of like a
clipboard feel those are $45 and then
this is the Big Daddy over here the
portfolio which has an opening case

dollars comes in all different kinds of
styles to a camo case I personally
