all work together to create this
volumetric capture of everything that's
going on on the field so to sync those
each camera is tied to a a computer of
its own a server in a rack that then
reconstructs all the video into one big
volumetric capture of everything that's
going on and so essentially that's how
it's sync is it's completely
reconstructed into three-dimensional
video with for every square inch that's
on the on the field and so we call that
a voxel which is basically a
three-dimensional pixel we've also
developed a whole new feature to be the
player feature we'll be really close to
see the players on the field even though
the cameras are actually mounted up in
the rafters but through this new
volumetric capture method you can use a
virtual camera and the virtual camera
can get very close to the action on the
field it can be anywhere on the field as
a matter of fact and what you'll see in
the be the player feature is we'll
position the camera as if it's right in
front of the face mask of one of the
football players
this weekend's game you're going to see
three clips from the Intel 360 replay
system two of them are going to be be
the player where you can actually
position the virtual camera where you
can looks like you're seeing through
what the players saw and then there will
be one until 360 replay which is
basically a 360 angle view of a key pipe
