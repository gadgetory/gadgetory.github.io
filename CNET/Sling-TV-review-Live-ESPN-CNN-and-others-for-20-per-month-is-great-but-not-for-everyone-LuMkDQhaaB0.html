that's an overstatement but the service
I'm reviewing here is the first of its
kind and at least provides a glimpse of
where TV might be headed I'm talking
about sling TV it's an alternative to
traditional cable and satellite TV and
the best part is the cost it's just 20
bucks a month for a package that
includes ESPN TNT CNN the Disney Channel
HDTV and others these are live TV
channels just like you get from cable
but delivered over your internet
connection I'll start with the good
parts there's no contract and no
obligations if you don't like it you can
just cancel in your out 20 bucks sling
TV comes in the form of an app and
chances are you already own at least one
device it's compatible for most of my
testing I need a Roku 3 connected to a
big TV but I also tested the Android and
iOS apps on my phone and an iPad slinks
has a bunch more devices including Xbox
one Amazon fire stick and chromecast and
even some smart TVs will be supported
video quality was very good for the most
part in testing I experienced few
instances of buffering and lag if your
internet connection is robust enough to
handle Netflix or Amazon streaming it
should do fine with sling TV the app
also has a bandwidth limiter so you can
avoid using up all your data aside from
the lack of popular basic cable channels
like regional sports networks Comedy
Central Fox News Bravo and AMC slink TV
also has its share of downsides on most
channels your prevented from pausing and
rewinding so of course you can't skip
commercials there's no real DVR
functionality and not much available on
demand the biggest red flag for many
people is sling TVs single stream nature
you can't watch a second stream on the
same account for example a second TV in
the bedroom while one stream is already
playing still if you like a channel
lineup and don't mind the restrictions
sling TVs basic $20 price with no
commitment makes it worth a try who
knows you might even like it enough to
ditch cable I'm David Katz buyer for
