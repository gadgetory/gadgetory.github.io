movies be making a comeback what if I
told you
Warner Brothers wants to reboot The
Matrix sources have told The Hollywood
Reporter that the studio is in the early
stages of developing a relaunch of the
1999 movie one of the most original
films in history the report also says
there is interest in having Michael B
Jordan star in it you may know him from
the movie Creed and Zack pen isn't talks
to write it he wrote for movies like The
Avengers The Incredible Hulk and the
upcoming film ready player one but there
is an anomaly in the programming the
people who created the original
franchise may not be involved and that's
no glitch there's no word on whether the
what chouse keys will be part of this
and the report says the studio is leery
of including the original producer Joel
Silver we also do not know if this is
reloading the whole story again or a new
evolution of the plot or if it will
unplug completely from the one main
story and exists as a side story
ergo the problem is choice unfortunately
no one can be told yet what this new
matrix is you have to wait to see it for
yourself some may say a matrix reboot is
an inevitability but do not stress out
about them ruining this iconic movie
instead only try to realize the truth
there is no script and this whole idea
may never get off the ground if you're
stressed out take a cookie
I promise by the time you're done eating
it you'll feel right as rain</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
