look at the HP Envy row 20 this is
another entry in the rapidly growing
category that I call tabletop pcs and
what that means is this looks like an
all-in-one it's got a big screen right
here it's got a keyboard and a mouse but
unlike other all-in-ones
there's no power plug plugging this
thing in because it actually has a
battery built into the screen itself
which means that like other tabletop PCs
you can fold it back and then pick it up
and carry it around with you like it's a
gigantic 20 inch tablet which is
essentially what this is and then when
you're tired of carrying it around
because it weighs 12 pounds you hit a
little switch in the back and a
kickstand comes out and then you can
lift it up to just about any angle the
kickstand is probably the cleverest
thing about it this is as high up as it
gets but then any angle in between you
move them back a little bit it stays
moving back some more it stays you move
it back up it stays I love that this
kickstand will pretty much stay at any
angle and you can even just move it with
one finger and and it's balanced and
weighted perfectly so that it'll stay
exactly where you want it too unlike
some of the other tabletop pcs we've
looked at even though this is a big 20
inch screen it's only got a 1600 by 900
resolution which is less than the 1920
by 1080 the full 1080p HD screens that
we've seen on a few other tabletop pcs
and frankly most other bigger screens
it's also got a core i3 CPU not the
faster I 5 or i7 that we've seen again
in other versions of the same type of
computer from other PC makers in its
defense the robe is a little bit less
expensive that core i3 configuration
with a full one terabyte hard drive it
is $8.99 maybe a little bit less if it's
on sale you would pay at least $100 more
for something from another manufacturer
that's comparable my big complaint of
course is that it is really thick and
really heavy again it weighs 12 pounds
and I'm mystified by that because Dell
manages to make an 18 inch version this
is a 20 inch screen this is an 18 inch
screen but this thing is about five
pounds and it's so much thinner and so
much lighter this one has a core i5 in
it and a full 1080p screen again
starts at $100 more and goes up from
there but the weight difference is is
pretty fantastic if you mean to keep
your PC sitting still most of the time
and just pick it up and carry it on
occasionally or you want to fold it down
and maybe play some chess another
tabletop game then you can certainly
save a few bucks and get this version
right here I'm Dan Ackerman and that is
the HP Envy Rove 20</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
