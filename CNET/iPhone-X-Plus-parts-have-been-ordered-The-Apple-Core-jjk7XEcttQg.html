with the buttons on the Apple watch
series for we're getting to the core of
Apple news and rumors right now now that
WWDC is behind us we can officially say
that the next batch of iPhones is just a
few months away
rumor has it Apple is gearing up to
launch three new iPhones at the next
launch event in September and iPhone 10
sequel an iPhone 10 plus with a 6.5 inch
OLED screen and potentially a three
camera array and a cheaper version of
the iPhone 10 which we're not sure what
that would be called yet so take a guess
with a 6.1 inch LCD display now
according to these on leaked images
published on my smart price comm this is
what that cheaper iPhone 10 would look
like you can see it has a single rear
facing camera and aluminum frame
replacing the more expensive stainless
steel now according to Apple analyst
Michi quo the price tag on this cheaper
phone would be somewhere between 600 and
700 dollars so not really cheap just
less expensive the other two would be
more in range with the current iPhone 10
but they better not make it more
expensive and this time they may
actually arrive on time according to
Japanese site Nikkei this year Apple has
ordered the old components for the two
premium models earlier to avoid delays
but they may not have as many to go
around the report also says Apple has
ordered roughly 20% fewer components for
the new iPhone lineup compared to last
year now their 10th anniversary iPhone
has been their top-selling phone at
least according to Apple but it did fall
slightly below expectations so this may
be in response to that and it's not just
Apple that's seeing interest wane this
is the first year in history that sales
have been down for smartphones across
the board we're also expecting a new
Apple watch at the next launch event and
it looks like the Apple watch series 4
could potentially be getting a new set
of buttons
sort of a source with direct knowledge
of apples plans told Fast Company that
the next watch will have solid state
buttons meaning they don't physically
click when you press down instead they
respond to touch with haptic feedback
kind of like what Apple did to the home
button on the iPhone 7 now this would
apply both for the side button and the
digital crown now physically this
shouldn't make much of a difference at
least according to the report because
the position of the buttons is not going
to change meaning it looks like I'm not
gonna get my round watch face but that's
okay because internally they will leave
a smaller footprint which means more
room for a larger battery and better
waterproofing so I've been having a
little too much fun with the developers
beta of iOS 12 here's the new Siri
shortcuts group two notifications the
new bedtime mode the measure app that
will basically make your measuring tape
and level obsolete and way too much
information about how I'm using my phone
and the setup for the group FaceTime is
there so you can kind of get a feel of
how it's gonna work but I haven't gotten
it up and running quite yet but my
favorite feature so far is a pretty tiny
change that wasn't even mentioned on the
keynote now instead of pressing down on
each open app to close you just swipe up
like before it's the little things now
there's still a lot of things that will
change on this developers beta so take
it with a grain of salt I will report
back on the final version once iOS 12
rolls out to everyone in September oh
yeah and about these meme oh geez I
gotta say they were more fun than I
expected definitely less creepy than
this chick but I honestly don't know how
much I'm gonna use them once the novelty
has worn off so don't worry you probably
won't be seeing this place again so
that's it for this week's update but
we'll be back with more Apple news and
rumors on the apple core hey guys thanks
