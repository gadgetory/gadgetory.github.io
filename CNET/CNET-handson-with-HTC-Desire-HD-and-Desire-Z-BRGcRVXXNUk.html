reporter with CNET news with a quick
look at the new HTC Desire HD Android
phone that HTC announced today in London
this is a new Android phone the most
notable feature of it is the large 4.3
inch diagonal screen it's got a
resolution of 800 by 480 and it's
notable of course for a lot of real
estate when you're browsing the internet
reading books or if you like to watch
movies this can stream movies to your TV
or you can also watch them right here on
the phone if you like it's a pretty nice
screen it's a super LCD which HTC has
lower power consumption and better
colors and contrast you also have a look
here at the HTC Desire Z the most
notable feature of this is its flip-out
keyboard here it goes very quickly into
a hardware keyboard mode you look at it
from the side you can see that it
actually pivots up and the screen is
fairly close to flush with a keyboard
which HTC says improves typing and also
the ability to move your hands back and
forth between hitting the screen buttons
editing the hardware keyboard the
hardware keyboard feels reasonable to me
one of the nice features is it's got two
custom buttons so you can customize that
for example I just pushing it the first
time the sine of function will say
launch something the clock it sounds
good if you like to use your clock often
so now when I push that button it takes
me straight to the clock HTC's Sense
user interface also includes an
application called friend's dream this
is basically a consolidated social
networking tool you can see the Facebook
and Twitter status updates here you can
switch between different views here the
photos do you want to see what links
people are sending around it shows that
you can create customized lists of
specific people you want to follow your
a list your VIP list and there's a
section for notifications as well one
thing you might want to do with a large
screen is
we read books and there's a built-in
reader application it's got a number of
public domain books here more to take a
look at them they are supplied through a
partnership with Kobo which provides
access to a lot of books and there's
also a built-in bookstore it's a
standard reader application one thing
that's the same from the earlier version
of Sense UI to this one is if you hold
down the home key while you're on the
home key you get the view lots of
thumbnails of your home screens so for
example you can then touch one this is
the very picture oriented version of the
contacts list if you need to call
somebody or since an email</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
