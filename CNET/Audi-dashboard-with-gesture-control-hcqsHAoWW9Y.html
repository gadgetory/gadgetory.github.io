Las Vegas we saw a lot of really new
innovations in voice and gesture control
for all kinds of home electronics but
here outtie is showing us how they're
moving gesture control into a marriage
with multiple head-up displays on the
windshield this is really interesting
check it out now it's interesting matrix
of three screens times four or five
information types the screens are laid
out this way the drivers screen
obviously is only seen by the driver the
one in the middle is seen by driver and
passenger and the one over here in front
of the passenger is only seen by that
person so that way you can very gate
things by their distraction level and
usefulness to the driver or not here are
some of the modes that one there is
navigation very cool looking sort of
animated world navigation if I move my
hand up I can go to an information card
database there's some howdy news for
example I can go this way again I can
also get to a calling interface when the
driver sees a call coming in it's a
thumbnail and the contact info only
swipe that call over to the passenger
and it comes up as a video call if all
the smartphone technology is in place
find a piece of information here and
decide I want to navigate to it from the
nav interface I can swing that over to
the driver's side and now that's turned
into navigation via augmented reality
laid on the road so like when I throw
the MGM Grand a sort of overlay icon
from nav to the passenger they get a
video about the MGM Grand and if they
like it they can throw that back over
that can go all the way to the driver
who now has an info card and that can be
swung over to augmented reality
navigation so the same information type
or task if you will changes it's
delivered mode as it goes from screen to
screen occupant to occupy oh there are
they basically Kinect cameras that are
built in the dash that watch the
gestures from driver or passenger now
this is more than a car tech
demonstration this is gonna be one of
the central issues 2012 and 2013 in this
big brokered argument between regulators
car makers and tech companies
distraction is the big thing in car tech
from this point going forward for the
foreseeable future this kind of
technology could be a big piece of how
we get to a middle ground where those
that are on one side or the other side
of tech
cars can find a middle ground they can
live with</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
