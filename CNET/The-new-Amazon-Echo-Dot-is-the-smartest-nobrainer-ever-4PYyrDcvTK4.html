the second-gen mini-sized
amazon echo dot smart speaker is
terrific and well worth the $50 that
amazon has asked me to spend on it it's
an easy recommendation because it's
functionally the same product as the
first gen Amazon echo dot which one
editor's choice from us back in March
the dots available in white now which I
think looks pretty good and you'll also
use these two buttons up on top to
change the volume as opposed to turning
a ring like you will in the first gen
dot but aside from that nothing major
has changed and for the most part that's
a great thing
Alexa can still stream music play
podcast answer your questions set
kitchen timers control your smart home
gadgets tell bad jokes and read the
headlines even I might add the headlines
from here at CNET today's scene at tech
today update this is seen it and here
are the stories that matter right now
the sound quality in the new model is
about the same as the old one too
perhaps a bit fuller and a little bit
less trouble time of the season by the
zombies from prime music
you can also connect the echo dot with
an external speaker like this one using
Bluetooth or a line in cable now one
minor quibble amazon didn't include a
line in cable with the echo dot they
only cost a couple of dollars typically
and you might even have one lying around
at a junk drawer but still would have
been nice if Amazon had included them I
also wanted a second gen Amazon echo dot
to be a better listener than generation
one and in a lot of cases it is just
check out this test from our studio
Alexa play Alexa play that was a
fantastic result even with a speaker
blaring music right behind it the second
gen echo dot heard me almost every time
first gen echo dot almost never heard me
so yes the second gen Amazon echo dot is
a terrific product and a steal at it's
$50.00 asking price Amazon echo dot
might be too tempting to pass up</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
