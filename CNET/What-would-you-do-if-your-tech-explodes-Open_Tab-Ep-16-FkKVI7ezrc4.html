this is open tab thank you for joining
us my name is Jeff Bakalar and I'm
hanging out with Bridget and Alfred
throwing back a couple drinks and
decompressing after a very busy week I
know we've all had more than enough
about we've heard more than enough about
that samsung galaxy note 7 debacle but
we're hopefully going to close the book
on that right here today with any luck
never bring it up again because good
lowers am I sick of this stupid story
and later on we'll give you some talk
regarding my experience with the
PlayStation VR but this roundtable it
also includes you our networks have been
blowing up huh you got it I got see what
you did there you got it like the phone
three have a we have a rim shot no okay
I've been blowing up with feedback
surrounding the Samsung headlines all
week and we figured what better platform
to delve into this than this one find
your way to the chat and comment section
and we'll bring you into the show
because we really enjoy hearing from you
all right so this week samsung formally
killed the production of this galaxy
note 7 ended it chopped its freaking
head off after doubling down on their
alleged hot item ticket now that there
are roughly 3 billion dollars in the
hole what happens next Alfred you've had
an ear to the ground as this all
unfolded on social media what were some
of the reactions you heard that you saw
that you collected that you gathered
that you smirked at that you shook your
head at had it all play out well it's a
hot one yeah drink every time there's a
bad pun yeah you have a new at home if
you're older than 21 you have to drink
when you hear a crappy Galaxy Note pun
what so you're wasted already keep going
down I share some hot takes that I'd see
that doesn't count can't you can't do
can't double up on it
a lot of people are actually saying that
they're going to keep it oh so moral yes
they're saying you know they paid a lot
of money for this even though they can
return it and get a new one anyway right
they're saying there's no device as good
as this one because you know this one
explodes and you can that's because a
sick feature seriously they're like I
did get that feedback to from some
people who don't they want that stylus
in the large phone and they're like well
I'll go to the note for someone wrote to
me so so when you so are the five even
yeah so when you hear that kind of
feedback do you take well how do you
react because if I it would take a lot
of willpower for me not to just start
yelling at them so how do you handle
that when someone says you're I'm not
giving this back and I'm like don't get
on a plane with me yeah don't don't
leave your house don't do anything it's
it's it's pretty set I think people are
just hoping for someone to tell them
it's okay but they really can't Wow and
also it's a headache to return have you
seen this fireproof box that you have to
get from Samsung to ship it back I don't
like but like that should also be that
should be there silent one yeah should
probably have to bring this back I gotta
have like a hazmat team because of my
phone maybe I need to return but in a
static shield bag it goes in a regular
cardboard box that goes in another
regular cardboard box and then that goes
in a special cardboard box that has some
special a ceramic fiber around it and
they give you blue gloves to handle it
because you might be allergic to the
material oh my god listen to this we
were checking comments and tim says I
would keep mine but not getting updates
for the next two years and no warranty
support changed my mind hey Tim what
about catching on fire does that change
your mind God he's like I don't want a
guy I'm not gonna get updates on my
phone what about you're going to die
perhaps now some people that I heard
they they had some pretty really like
funny reasons for one deciding to return
it we're essentially i was going to keep
it but then you know I realized I
wouldn't be able to get in some public
places with it so that's why I'm going
to return I'd you know it's a valiant
reason he's thinking about other people
now but my whole thing is like okay so
if you could go to all these
you still would have kept your phone
like it wasn't about you know this could
blow up and her people it's I can't go
to the library what's going on here
samsung doesn't know what's wrong though
I mean what what makes you think you
know more than Samson oh I'm sure I'm
fine good nothing happened yet well they
don't even know what's going on it
really like I get it right but it's not
like you're your jet it's an
inconvenience for sure but the thing you
have is dangerous potentially and it can
hurt you or your family or the people
you love or your house or strangers or
everyone you know all of the above sure
all these people keeping their notes
Evans are just riding along in their
hover boards yeah today I want award
right out of my face because that's what
they're doing right that's who that's
who these people are this is that what
we're saying many people are at a loss
as to what to do next in the fall of the
recalls the refunds and the hue I mean
it really must be a gigantic pain in the
ass to go to a store pick out a new
phone for free that must be terrible to
get it get paid a hundred dollars the
whole thing oh you poor people cry me a
river let alone look I mean I understand
you're out a note 7 it was a good phone
when it used to not blow up right it
used to be okay so what would you do
about replacing it what phone would you
get instead what would you guys pick up
in replacement of the note 7 there's all
these people that are saying you know
the note 7 so great it's the best phone
ever and it's just you know if you want
a phone that's very close to it and
doesn't explode very cool feature by the
way you gotta checked out that um the
galaxy s7 and s7 edge i granted they're
not the same phone but they're like
they're like they're like 75 percent of
the same phone down there yeah and they
also don't blow up so that's like an
extra 20 that's extra extra credit
that's 25 points right nice it's enough
but then you put they have a really big
phone guys I don't want everything baby
big one I'd like I can't like I even
like how do you put that in your pocket
like you down I would mean I have a
Bigfoot my phone's probably the size of
the note yeah 7 it doesn't have a
stylist I feel like that's what people
are really all
about as a stylist yeah personal
preference I'd get the pixel phone if
I'm like sticking to Android we're sure
a lot of people I think that's a solid
reputation I mean no Google's like
seeing all this happening they're like
yeah yes continue to be my favorite
emails have been the ones where it's
like I think that Apple and Google
conspired to make the notes Evans
explode because I'm a good conspiracy I
don't like oh yeah we do not endorse it
e the conspiracy theories of mr. healthy
thing I thought like your yet we do not
endorse this we think yeah it's not I
got emails about it and I'm just like oh
yeah that's that's what happened they
like purposely like they cool and Tim
Cook and you know yeah google just snuck
into the lot into the factors i all
right okay that's it we we need a couple
of these explode see what you can do
moving along levan on facebook says well
they want to expose in order to get me
to get the new device i already spent
over two hundred dollars on getting the
phone with paying off I'll device early
then the rest of the taxes and fees so i
guess i'll be rocking the note seven
till it blows up guess why LaVon that's
a real terrible planning out there just
return it you i feel like they're going
to make this right you get your you get
your money back online all the things
you paid for with including taxes and
you get like at least a $25 credit even
if you say I don't want samsung anymore
right you could even you know go to
iphone you can pivot to an iphone don't
give you twenty-five dollars to get it
on $25 I mean but you're getting $25
like yeah like a case with that sure I
think you can also get returns on your
accessories of the note 72 right and you
know the easiest way the return it is if
you went to a carrier it is a pain if
you have to go through samsung in that
special box but at least it rice is kind
of making it a pain to their saying go
online and we'll send you one of the
special box i don't want one of those
boxes now like do I have to prove that i
own a note 7 together you need to order
bride cuz i justjust want to collect
those boxes huh no no you
I like just collecting the note 7 from
so you know it's a collectible item now
they're not making it is very rare it is
a rare item literally just buy one and
turn it off so it can explode I wonder
if it'll make its way into some sort of
like Technology Museum oh yeah it's
gonna end up in like one of our bag one
set dressing she's a relic like the Ford
Pinto it is it like I don't think
there's ever let's be honest I don't
think there's ever been a device that
has just been completely smashed to hell
like this thing I mean like there you
know this is have you ever been to a
nintendo world yeah oh you're talking
about that game away from but that was
like an IED dead or something like this
is an actual defective product that just
man unbelievable anyway uh here's
actually a good point user typical day
reminds us that anything with flammable
elements can explode look at ferrari
lamborghini porsche tesla etc even some
iphones have caught fire the only thing
that matters is how a company responds
to the situation and honestly I think
Samsung's response was really quick and
good especially offering all that money
to people have any other companies
showcased such good customer support
following an unfortunate event like this
have either of us personally gone
through something like this with the
device or service in the past so ah the
first point about Samsung's reaction
yeah it seems like they did a decent job
it's unprecedented don't forget though
they kind of didn't go through the
correct channel out of the gate first it
was like a company inspired recall and
then they went to the official yes like
so there they do catch some criticism
for that I guess well deserving you
about a lot of incidents before they
started saying that you should you know
do something about so maybe I'm like a
customer-facing level they did a good
job but when it comes down to like
proper procedure they kind of drop them
I mean even on the customer level they
didn't like do a good job they
completely botched a recall they got a
second chance right you know where send
them back we'll send you good one sure
then those exploded can we not break
that bond no they didn't do the Java
know we're call the device and gave you
back a broken one the problem is that
they were essentially best guessing the
problem going oh it's from that
manufacturer of batteries will just get
the batteries from this place instead
and it still happens so it's not it's
more we need to know the answer what
happened for sure and to your point do
you think this now leads to a new sort
of a regulatory sort of thing when it
comes to batteries and products and
stuff like that like someone said before
like everything has a battery in it like
this phone could blow up tomorrow and
you know anything that has a lithium
battery and it is potentially
combustible so expect more paranoia on
flights yeah I guess right I think it's
to isolate of an incident I mean if
every phone it was happening I mean this
is the only like Samsung phone it's
happening with right so far but if it
was like you know a whole bunch of
Samsung phones I roans always happening
with then like well at least like the
Quality Assurance the tests look no yeah
they definitely need there's something
going on down there right okay we're
just a little burnt out Oh Jeff I
literally amount of alcohol now we're
going to say goodbye to alpha thanks so
much for being here buddy time for a
quick break when we come back we're
going to take a look at the gnarly new
addition to the Anki overdrive family on
this week's episode of Joe and tell keep
this tab open we'll be right back are
you ready for the next thing in smart
race cars I'm Dan a queer here taking a
look at on key overdrive now if you're
pretty funky before that's because they
brought out an earlier version of this
system at one of apple's WWDC competence
back in 2013 and they showed you an
iPhone controlling a race car going
around the track very cool stuff but it
was one static track sort of a
first-generation toy this new version
works with iOS and with Android still
has the same sort of remote control cars
that you steer with your iPhone or your
Android phone the big difference now is
the track is completely modular you can
buy the starter kit here for about one
hundred fifty dollars that include
two cars a charger for the cars and a
bunch of different tracks you can buy
extract pieces and you just put them
together like this they snap together
magnetically and then you can take them
apart and put it back together anyway
you want there's all sorts of shapes you
can make now hidden under the pattern
here is some code that the car see you
can't see it but the car seat and that
lets the electric I in the cars see
where the track is stay on the track and
not go flying off anywhere so you don't
do too much of the steering the cars do
that automatically when you're using the
iphone app what you do is you shift the
cars from one side to the other you can
control whether it on this side or this
side like this and also acceleration but
it's going faster or slower go around a
turn too fast you could zoom right off
and of course the cars you can get up to
four them going at once they can race
against each other they have weapons
built in that you basically use by
tapping a button on the app and that
causes the other cars nearby to sort of
short out or spin out of control or get
damaged so you can zip past them you
don't actually see them shooting edge of
the real life maybe that's the next
version of augie setup is super easy
especially when it comes to putting the
tracks together getting the app going
and sold on all the phones that you're
going to use and getting everybody into
a game together that's a little bit more
complicated a little bit of a learning
curve there you know I feel like most of
the time you're going to want to skip
most of the game modes and just do
straight free racing with your friends
that seems like what this is built for
now if you want to get more involved
with this and get everybody playing and
build a very elaborate track a little
bit of an investment is involved this
base kit here is one hundred and fifty
dollars you can buy extra track kits and
they break down to about ten dollars per
section of track and you get two cars
here if you want to buy more cars there
are a couple more available there forty
nine dollars each but once you put it
all together you get everybody around
race around the pool table like we did
that is the Anki overdrive
Oh
pi PI
for those not familiar with Aki
overdrive it's a smart racetrack and you
control the vehicle speed weapons and
lane changes from supported iOS and
Android device you can race against the
cars in AI mode or against a friend with
corresponding sound effects playing from
the device so here we have ground shock
which is my favorite one and we have
skull today I'm here to introduce our
newest additions to the Anki overdrive
family it's the X 52 super truck
designed by Hollywood car designer
Harold Bell ker the X 52 has a pulse Ram
where views at the right time can blast
opponents off the track this is all done
by dedicated flashing lights and not
some space aids laser show possibly in a
later generation the trucks are a little
more pricey than the car is at $59 with
these new trucks come a new game mode
take over once you put the truck on the
track you have that game after you scan
the track you have to chase the truck
one of the opponents have to weaken the
truck whoever weakens it the most just
took control in take over players start
each match in their chosen supercars
anyone that can break through the super
trucks defenses will take control of the
vehicle to wreak havoc on their
opponents until the other player
disables them and takes command of the
super truck so pretend I'm ground shop
and my father is X 52 so I'm blasting
him boom boom pinky there's my dad dr.
wall
Oh
hey thanks Joe and Little Joe Joe in
that video all right we're back still
hanging with Bridget and welcome and a
big welcome to mr. Scott's died I who's
here in the flesh nursing a hot tea
nursing a hot tea because he's a bit
under the weather but not under the
weather enough to be here which may
appreciates a good balance it's a good
balance he's a good man Scott and I got
to check out playstation vr last week
and the week before that so let's talk
about playstation v r yes this is a
thing that needs discuss it and i have
lots of questions so how that is ok
let's first do like a little sort of
intro thing sure um i think for the most
part we kind of like it um considering
all you need to run it is a PlayStation
4 yep there's 45 million PlayStation 4's
in the wild that's a lot which means all
those people who own them only need to
spend about well you need to kind of
spend five hundred dollars after that to
get it all up and running but that's
about it and when you compared to the
other VR options out there the higher
end stuff it's cheaper significantly
cheaper so I think if you're looking at
it like that sure this is the VR to get
if you want vr it won't feel you want to
do that play with that is a VR like
review that experience at the helmet on
your head right and enough things to do
with it that are different than what you
get with your phones the phone stuff it
you just turn your head around and
that's interesting but PlayStation VR
looks better and also you can grab
things with the controllers right a
little more yeah it's a little more
holodeck II it's not full that's one of
the complaints is not really full
holodeck you explain that in a sec yeah
so I think if I'm looking at it from a
specifically technical point of view you
can't argue that HTC vive is certainly
the best we can do right now on a
consumer level the vibe is the best
right but
that's hit a goal that I think is going
to get eclipse sooner than later okay
what do you mean well yes it in terms of
tracking the maximum numbers amount of
space right now sure like 15 by 15 feet
right that is great and the fact they
can track motion very well that's great
what oculus is going to do with its
touch controllers in December is kind of
like that hmm but it's not going to have
as much open space and you're going to
need three of those little camera stands
you're setting up a little bit of a
production so how does this like
translate to like it got the coffee
table at home and you're in a tiny New
York apartment that is this you got to
clear the decks yeah otherwise you're
going to hit this and you know vive does
have you draw space but it doesn't have
it doesn't have object detection to help
you so it's not like if a dog comes
running into the room the vibe is not
going to smartly alert you with a with a
dog skeleton glow that you know object
is in space watch great hey Brad see
this ya see this Scott see this
everybody that's how many times I've
stepped on my dog in PlayStation VR know
that and kid injuries in general worry
me every PlayStation VR on those types
of system supposed to be 12 and older
right uh so you shouldn't be doing this
for your young kid and there's a lot of
cables so it's also the tripping yes
plus the not knowing where things are
every day's already have a rule in the
house we're like no VR until the kids
sleeping yes because they're just
another obstacle just waiting to get all
tangled up in the VR mish-mosh it's it's
a personal thing and it's best to do on
your own terms where you're the only
person who could get injured well how
many games are having you walk around
can you just sell a couch and do it you
first so most so it's a good point you
wrote up so like places we are most of
the games you can sit down I think
there's a few that really work the best
if you're standing yes um but you know
for those ones that are standing there
really fun and you want us you want to
move around a little bit and there is a
bit of a wiggle room sort of window that
p sv r gives you the vibe is much more
room scale focused where it's giving you
this sense of freedom in a certain you
know allotment of square footage budge
uh but yeah it's it's tough and and let
into your point before I my living room
area the the amount of real estate i can
devote to PlayStation VR is about 28
square feet and it kind of is just
enough to make it happen I set it up
yeah I set up in a little corner with a
lot of clutter around me not much other
stuff and and luckily I found most of
these games that is actually what I like
is there mostly meant to be seated and a
lot of them are perfectly fine with the
DualShock controller so I found that
like almost all the launch game seemed
to be fine with that they the moves seem
very much like a specialty item which
you'd want to have sure but like I think
you could play most of the best games
right now with the DualShock and so I
like it seeing it seated you know it's
also PlayStation VR is very
loosey-goosey with the idea of what you
need space wise right so when it sets up
it kinda just looks at you and you get
an awful selfie of yourself in your
underwear or whatever you're wearing
with your VR helmet or you know you
could be under word could mean I'm just
saying it could be anything out yeah
it's already done it definitively
without a doubt bottoms up play VR my
underwear but you know you will get a
terrible selfie that from that camera
angle going sure are you are you okay in
that space everything good and you kind
of put your head in the center and
that's it so your awareness of well what
does that mean others will tell you
clear this much space and they're just
like up just go right and when you're
out of the space it just black say yeah
it's weird you kinda just like fall off
the face of the earth you other guy
tells you a please go in the middle what
were you I'm not sold on VR as much as
you shouldn't be okay but you and mainly
because yeah me me and Tim Cook Tim
Cook's not sold on anything so he makes
it right it's the classic you're not
doing it the boat will doing it we're
not doing it yet but here it is my my
big thing is I get nauseous nauseated
nauseous nauseous works yeah um after
more than I don't know if it depends on
the kind of game it and and what what
it's doing and how well it's rendered
but I can't play for a long time so all
this investment for something that like
these are games are they what are they
expecting you're not yet know a lot for
not hold on can I give you my wallet and
give you eight hundred dollars to make
me feel ill like can I do that ya like
like
with drama me like it should so it's a
lot of money for nausea it is a lot of
money for that I have yet to get
nauseous until friday night last Friday
night I played 100 foot robot golf and
brickbats what I follow games where it's
like put on the helmet now for this one
level and then you take it off so easy
you got to put the thing on it doesn't
look right until you adjust it for a
good 15 to 20 seconds I mean is there's
a lot of janky pneus going on there it
is not perfect Jessup Jake eNOS yeah
janking it that's my quote put it on the
box like janky as f I mean it's just
weird like it is not perfected we are
judging by the three main stream full
high-end vr things out there we are not
there yet okay you have a long way to go
and this is the way it currently looks
is going to transform massively not just
the size or the price but the way the
tech works people are going to go
wireless with this stuff they're going
to start trying to make things that are
in as bulky headset wise they may start
having eye tracking this is totally one
step so that means yes you cutting-edge
VR person are you going to buy this and
be set no you're going to have things
next year in the year after you're gonna
want to get to so yeah yeah you got to
be careful pick your point it's
basically like a way to get there I
think if your if your VR curious but
you're like that on a profile put that
out there on I'm looking so for curry
you're curious looking for if you're
that person just get a phone-based one
yeah you know get uh so check out the
daydream yes come here vr is great has
tons of apps yeah with with with good
non exploding samsung phones right and
then you can get a daydream which we
don't know how many apps there will be
but it certainly looks promising yeah
and they're like 80 bucks when you
already have the phone yeah so yeah I
feel like this one is Playstations has
enough games and I feel like if you
bought it and you knew it you're in for
you'll be worth getting but you got to
know that it's eventually possibly going
to sit on your shelf right it's
something you may not use all the time
might happen
may happen yeah like he comfortable with
that in the review I the last sentence
is basically like am I might still be in
the honeymoon phase with this and I
can't and it's kind of true like yeah
it's all we example I got home and I'm
like looking at the damn thing and I'm
like I don't even know if I want to put
this thing on right now I without a
doubt and I can definitively and
confidently say this I would much rather
be playing a regular video game than
doing a VR you can't play it for more
than a half hour 45 minutes anyway it's
just it's just too much and that's what
I mean and that's not me like being like
I'm not trying to be old man Jeff when
they are it is too much for any human vr
is you gotta suit up for it yeah I gotta
strap in and in about a year and a half
now of using VR in various forms I never
can say that I use it every day I it's
it's it's it's there yeah and then I
think about visiting it and I feel like
that never changes oculus gear VR yeah
you go oh it's there in case I I want to
look at it and that is the criticism of
it that's also kind of what it is and I
agree it's it you are buying a kind of a
novelty but at least getting on board if
you're if you're socially if you have
all the gear like you may have a
PlayStation game or even if you're a
super PlayStation person then it's
almost like it's a reasonable sort of
you know splurge I think but it is way
early days it's early too it's fun to be
early there sometimes it is fun you know
what if you got a lot of roommates if
you have like five roommates yeah yeah
chip is go get one you know but for
someone who's like I need the latest and
greatest maybe you pump the brakes a
little bit and see what happens in like
a year too yeah it's okay to wait I
think I think this one is probably the
best state I'm really curious though
what happens with the pc stuff because i
feel like it's going to start being
available in a lot more system sure so
if you have a pc at all know that our
oculus already talked about this by this
time next year i bet you're going to
hook it up to a huge number of pieces
yes and and possibly and we're looking
at the xbox also as something that's
going to be
Scorpio is going to be V are connected I
don't forget about that so yeah so
that's nothing if you're a councilperson
maybe wait and look at that because
microsoft super hooked into possibly
oculus and yeah so you're gonna have a
more option so don't be like you get
this now and be like oh wait you didn't
tell me about all these things and I
think that there's me a lot more and a
lot more weird stuff like things that
are kind of a hybrid things that might
feel like a phone thing but I'll sure
this not just games right now the
porting that she's gonna make it take
off oh they're neither is there PR is
the worst report i would say really hard
to leave it at that yeah well the worst
up order all right we gotta wrap it up
