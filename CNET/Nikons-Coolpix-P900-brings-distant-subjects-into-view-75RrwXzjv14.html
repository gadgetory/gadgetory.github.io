zoom fiends the answer to that question
is never and that's how we end up with
this the Nikon Coolpix p900 the camera
has a class-leading 83 times optical
zoom that goes from a wide 24
millimeters to two thousand millimeters
the rest of the camera is good but the
lens is definitely the star attraction
it's also geared more for
point-and-shoot users because while you
do get manual and semi manual controls
that can be a chore to use and it lacks
more advanced features like raw capture
a hot shoe or a mic jack you do get a
serviceable electronic viewfinder and a
rotating display and there's Wi-Fi with
NFC so you can use a mobile device as a
remote viewfinder or transfer that
impossible birdshot you got straight to
your phone to share immediately now more
zoom does not equal better quality
photos so while being able to capture
subjects that are quite literally out of
sight is pretty awesome they tend to
look soft and lack fine details and
although it can be fast to focus the
camera would occasionally say like
subject was in focus when it actually
wasn't it noticeably slows down in
low-light too and shooting moving
subjects in general can be frustrating
at such extreme focal lengths also and
this probably goes without saying while
the cameras image stabilization is good
you'll want it on a tripod or monopod
for the sharpest possible shots you can
read the full review on cnet.com but
even though it has some issues
there's no denying the shots this camera
can get are remarkable for its $600
price and size i'm josh cole Mussina
