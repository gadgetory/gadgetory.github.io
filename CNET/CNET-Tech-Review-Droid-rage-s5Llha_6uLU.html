brought to you by the letter s as Sony's
new s tablet wedges itself into a
cluttered market and Samsung's Galaxy s2
is coming to a pocket near you plus
catch all of your favorite podcasts with
your Android phone and use snagged a $99
touch pad now what it's all coming up
right now
hi everyone I'm Hollywood and welcome to
the scene a tech review where we collect
our hottest videos of the week and tell
you what's good and what's bad in the
world of tech plus offer our own unique
tech wisdom in the form of the bottom
line let's start with the good samsung
truly had a hit on its hands when the
Galaxy S line of Android phones arrived
in the US last year and the names hit
the hyperbole ceiling to epic captivate
fascinate even mesmerized all different
galaxy s models with different features
for different carriers well this week
Bonnie cha was on hand for the unveiling
of the first three members of the galaxy
s2 series including the epic 4g touch
for sprint hey everyone I'm Bonnie putt
senior editor at cnet com and I am here
to bring you a first look at the samsung
galaxy s2 which was just announced here
in New York I'm holding here the sprint
version which will be called the samsung
epic 4g touch and they are actually
coming first to market will be able
september's to keep for 1 99 99 with a
two-year contract so very fair price
what you're getting is a souped-up
version of the galaxy s you've got a 4.5
inch super amoled plus touchscreens
they've also updated the TouchWiz
interface we get a little more of
control over customization like
resizable widgets and more animations
which is very nice front you've got a 2
megapixel camera for video calling on
back you've got an 8 megapixel camera
with flash and there is a dual core
processor under here so you can shoot
video at 1080p software-wise it's
running Android 2.3 2.4 and again like I
said it's running the latest version of
touch with we've also got more security
options here they offer on device
encryption as well as full microsoft
access the exchange support sprint is
added some of their services on here
such as Sprint ID sprint zone sprint
mobile wallet and things like that but
overall looks like a very nice upgrade
to the samsung epic 4g fortunately no
keyboard for those who love their
physical button but again very nice very
thin here sprint have added a textured
back unlike some of the other so offers
a nice or more of a premium feel I'm
Bonnie Thomas keep in your first look at
the
and some fx4 d types for sprint I like
to see Samsung getting rid of all those
over the top names and just sticking
with one really really long over-the-top
name anyway those new galaxy s 2 s are
hot but if you can't wait a few weeks
and you need a new android phone now
ryan tongue has a couple of solid
choices in this week's prize fight of
course it helps if you're a sprint
customer or don't mind becoming one
what's up price five fans i'm brian Tong
we're bringing you a fight to the finish
between 2 4g phones on sprint it's a
prize five punch-out with HTC's ego 3d
and motorola photon 4g our judges for
this fight our senior editor Bonnie boom
shakalaka cha senior editor Nicole
ice-cold Lee and myself ring a ling a
ding dong we'll take all three judges
blind scores and abs them out to the
nearest tenth each round the final price
five score will be an average of all
rounds using the same decimal system is
five rounds to the finish round one is
designed HTC's evo 3d and the photon 4g
are solid devices but the evo 3d stands
out with its cleaner design textured
backing and curved corners now the
photon 4g has a brighter display and
we're always fans of a kickstand but
this is one of the only phones that
decided to cut off corners as a good
design element and it doesn't work ACC
takes round one with the 4.3 and the
photon 4g gets a 3 next round is
controls and user interface the evo 3ds
lock screen app launcher and visual
transitions plus its overall ease of use
make our editors smile and its physical
camera button and an easy switcher
between taking 2d and 3d photos when it
points with us now the photon 4 g's
motorola blur interface has cleaned
itself up from the past we like the
ability to resize any of your widgets it
has a more simplified rigid look but it
can also feel and get a little cluttered
at the same time the evo 3d gets a
perfect five and the photon 4g gets a
four so after averaging two rounds ACC
leads by over one full point but there's
plenty of fight left next round is
features HTC's biggest feature is in its
name and it's glassless 3d now you might
think this would be a huge advantage but
when you can only use the 3d feature
with specific game content certain movie
files and pictures and movies you take
with the camera really wasn't that big
of a feature advantage and what hurts it
even more is the lack of hdmi and fewer
features compared to the photon 4g
Motorola isn't messing around here at
all and the photon 4g is packed with an
HDMI for our beloved kickstand that the
evil removed from its design it's a
dual-mode world roaming phone and it has
a web top docking station option that
gives it PC like functionality I know
it's a 129 add-on but it's a feature
that ACC can't match Motorola gets a
perfect five and HTC gets up for next
round is web browsing and multimedia
both of these dual core processing
gingerbread phones feature 4.3 inch
screens and swipe and handle web
browsing about the same with support for
playback and flash content so we're
going to call it a push here now the evo
3d gets the advantage with its 5
megapixel camera that takes better
quality pictures overall compared to the
photon 4 g's 8 megapixel camera and when
you add in the 3d option taking pictures
and movies can be even more fun even if
you have to be in the perfect sweet spot
to see it correctly now the evo 3d gets
a perfect five and the photon 4g gets up
4.3 so after averaging four rounds the
evo 3d only leads by half a point the
final round that decides it all is
called quality and performance the evo
3d has solved call quality but we did
notice there was more background noise
and occasionally noise artifacts like
crackling now the photon 4g delivered
with slightly crisper audio quality and
are richer and fuller sound overall both
phones rock dual processors but the
photon 4g also felt just a hair faster
moving through the menus without all of
HTC's visual eye candy so in the final
round motorola gets a perfect 5 and HTC
gets a poor let's average out all five
rounds and enterprise right we're both
phones scored two perfect rounds the
photon 4g came on strong towards the end
but it just wasn't enough and HTC EVO 3d
takes this battle 4.5 to 4.3 and is your
prize fight winner i'm brian Tong thanks
for watching Oh catch you guys next time
on another prize fight
Congrats HTC but I still don't know why
they got rid of the kickstand on the EVO
sometimes the best part of having a
smartphone is being able to put it down
when HP announced it was killing off the
touch pad tablet it was obviously
because no one was buying it then HP and
retailers dropped the price to just
ninety nine dollars and suddenly people
couldn't snatch him up fast enough but
what good is a touchpad given that webOS
will no longer be supported here's Brian
Cooley with a few ideas
you might be one of the lucky hundreds
of thousands who scored an HP TouchPad
for a 99 bucks or maybe you're one of
the techs knobs sneering at those who
did either way there's no denying the
touchpad fire sale made it one of the
hottest tech products on earth for a
while but are those who bought one savvy
or stupid I'm Brian Cooley with the top
five things to do with an HP touchpad
also known as why any tablet is fine for
most of what you'll do with it file this
one under reality check number five use
it as an ereader the touchpad comes with
the kindle app pre-installed and the
kindle store is not going away even if
you use the touchpad for no other
purpose you just got a reader for
fifteen dollars less than the cheapest
Kindle now there is some risk the Kindle
platforms going to evolve and the webOS
based touchpad might get left behind but
let me restate $99 number four use it as
a photo viewer the touchpad does a
particularly good job of harvesting all
your online photos in one place from
Facebook to photobucket snapfish and
others it beats the hell out of making
people squint at your smartphone screen
or the back of your digital camera
number three use it as an in-car media
player now you can spend the two grand
or so to get rear seat entertainment
built into the head rest of your car or
let our little sub $100 friend or really
any tablet take over instead the
touchpad will always support standard
mpeg-4 and h.264 video formats along
with all the major audio formats now
only an iPad will get you access to the
iTunes Store but there are enough other
ways to get download and streaming video
on any non iOS tablet and anything's
better than those few scratched up dvds
in the back seat pouch that your kids
are sick of watching anyway number two
email emails agnostic it works on any
device that has an email client and the
touchpad has one baked in just like
every tablet and it's not going to stop
working because you're missing an OS
updater needs some app no one's
developing for your platform in fact
seventy-four percent of respondents in a
recent Google survey cited email as a
use of their tablet before I take you to
the number one reason to buy and use one
of those fire sale touch pads let's give
the ipad it's due if you want to buy a
tablet and not have to explain yourself
then it's going to be an iPad a recent
survey showed ninety-five percent of
people looking into a tablet are
considering an iPad the next nearest
competitor was like ten percent
considering the touch pad the one that's
not made anymore and the blackberry
playbook forget it like fewer than four
percent of people care if the iPad
retains these kinds of numbers the touch
pad will not be the last of its
competitors liquidating at fire-sale
prices see what I mean okay the number
one thing you can do with your fire sale
$99 touch pad and not care what anybody
else thinks is go on the web in fact if
the touchpad had nothing but a good web
browser it could still do everything
else on this list and it does have a
good one one that actually shows you
flash based websites without broken
stuff on the screen like you know who so
whether you found one of each piece $99
unicorns or are considering some no-name
tablet that's good and cheap take heart
that you will get a lot out of it even
without a bunch of apps and OS updates
orphans are beautiful too to stay up on
top of the latest tablet reviews the
best street prices and even news of who
might be having a blowout fire sale next
go to cnet com click on tablets right
there on the left I'm Brian Cooley for
more top 5s like these go to top 5 cnet
com thanks for watching
if you missed your chance to snag a
bargain price touch pad the first time
around HP is announced they will be
offering a limited supply of the tablet
in the next few weeks and they'll be
available starting at $99 from hp's
website but we don't know whether other
retailers will match the price this time
around so start stocking HP com today
although if you'd prefer a tablet
running an OS that actually has a future
Sony's new S tablet is just the latest
of several tablet models built on the
Android platform but it offers a few
features that help it stand out from the
crowd hey I'm Donald Bell and this is
the Sony S tablet it's an android 3.1
honeycomb tablet with a nine point four
inch screen and unique wedge-shaped
design is due out mid-september priced
at four hundred ninety nine dollars for
16 gigabytes or 599 432 now we've
already seen a ton of honeycomb tablets
this year and Sony must know that they
had their work cut out for them they
want to stand out from the crowd in my
eyes they've succeeded in terms of
design tab will has a completely unique
wedge shape that gives it a better
balance in your hand and minimizes glare
when you have it on the table it doesn't
achieve the same fitness as an iPad 2
but it's just as light at one point
three pounds and feels more solid than a
samsung galaxy tab 10.1 around the sides
here you have buttons for power and
volume speakers headphone jack and the
door here that offers a micro USB sync
connection and a full-size SD card
reader a built-in app handles moving
files back and forth from your card
another thing worth noting here is that
Sony went with a nine point four inch
screen instead of the 10.1 inch panel
found on nearly every other honeycomb
tablet out there they're also using
Sony's true black technology to make the
screen contrast really pop sony also
rolled in an ir remote control that
comes with one of the best interfaces
we've seen for managing multiple devices
and finally just to prove that Sony is
all in they've made this a PlayStation
Certified device which means that Sony
will be offering games from their vault
of ps1 and PSP titles out of the box you
can play Crash Bandicoot
and pinball heroes overall this is one
of the best executed Android tablets
we've seen the hardware is beautiful and
lightweight the screen pops and the
software optimizations are all
thoughtful and restrained it's not cheap
but if you're wondering what a high-end
Android tablet has to offer this is one
of the best examples we've seen so far
for cnet.com on Donald Bell and that was
a first look at the Sony S tablet 499
sounds high after 99 bucks but at least
it's comparable to other tablets
actually wish that philosophy would
carry over to Sony's TV business also I
can't wait until someone figures out how
to use that thing to control my ps3 get
on it people in fact let's take a break
so you can get started working on that
right now but don't go too far there's a
lot more tech review coming up right
after this
welcome back to the cnet tech review our
weekly video digest of all things good
and bad we've seen here at cnet TV
continuing on in the good if our
resident security expert Seth Rosenblatt
has taught us anything over the years
it's that the internet is a dark and
scary place and you should never click
any links ever but if you see a URL that
just begs to be clicked and you feel
like you have to see what's on the other
side seth has a few tips to help you
decide whether it's worth the risk have
you ever been fished whether you use a
Mac Windows or Linux iOS or Android
there's a real strong chance that
somebody has sent you an email or text
message in an attempt to get you to turn
over your personal information I am Seth
Rosenblatt for cnet today I'm going to
show you some excellent ways to make
sure that you don't get victimized
online data equals money and you're a
big old dollar sign to the bad guys so
first off browse smart always double
check the URL of your banking site
before you log in and look to the left
of the location bar to verify it's legit
this is Tripoli true when going to your
bank from an emailed link in fact let's
just agree now to never ever ever do
that again if your bank emails you a
link ignore it and type in your bank URL
by hand but what about that link to some
ostensibly hilarious video your best
friend just posted on your facebook wall
there are several services you can use
to verify a link there's google
safebrowsing type google.com / Safe
Browsing / diagnostic ? site equals and
then the site name or the IP address to
find out if it has hosted malware in the
past 90 days another similar service is
HP hosts at hosts filenet enter a site
into the search box and its database
will tell you if the site has been used
to distribute malware or phishing
attacks HP hosts gives you more detailed
information than google safebrowsing if
you're into that kind of thing two other
excellent services are Norton safe web
from
symantec at safe web Norton calm and
unmasked parasites calm pop in the URL
and you're good to go or if the site
comes back as unsafe don't go many
security suites come with browser
add-ons to check links you can click on
the fly and those work fairly well at
scanning your search results and adding
icons to indicate if a link is safe or
not if you don't have a suite AVG's
linkscanner is a free add-on that works
with both windows and mac and avg free
mobile ation android app will block
malicious links there iphone and ipad
users you're at a lock there are no link
checking apps I could find for iOS
probably because iOS is safe apple says
if you know of one let me know so those
are a few tips on how you can stay off
the hook of the creepazoids after your
box Cena you hear that creepazoids I've
got my eye on you former iPhone users
who have switched to android often
lament the loss of itunes for me Bo
management especially when dealing with
podcasts there's no built-in pod catcher
and it's time consuming and frustrating
to have to track them down manually well
antuan goodwin feels your pain and he's
found a couple of apps that will help
ensure that you never miss another
episode of your favorite shows welcome
to tap that app I'm antuan goodwin this
is the show where we talk about the
hottest apps in the mobile space these
days I spend more time listening to
podcast than I do listening to music
there's so many good shows about
technology and cars and Android now
iphone users have got it easy podcast
management's built right into itunes but
google's left its podcast loving android
users out in the cold without a native
podcast subscription service fortunately
there are a few good pod catching apps
available in the android market dog
catcher puts your favorite audio and
video podcast at your fingertips with a
set of options that allow users to be as
basic or as complex and granular as
they'd like to be if you want dog
catcher to just download the newest
episode of every subscribed show it can
handle that if you want to set the auto
downloader options on a per show basis
dogcatcher can do that too if you only
want to download podcasts when your
phone's plugged in and on Wi-Fi you're
good to go this app also allows resume
playback so you can pick up your shows
where you left off now the on pod offers
just about all of the functionality of
dog catcher but adds the ability to
separate your podcast into categories so
you can keep your comedy podcasts
separate from your tech news podcast now
categories come into play with a cool
feature called Smart Play that lets the
user micromanage what feeds get add it
to the playlist and in what order so if
you like to start your day with the
latest news show then listen to three
comedy shows and then finish up with the
oldest episode of your favorite internet
radio
drama beyondpod will accommodate
beyondpod also offers a tablet optimized
version for honeycomb users both dog
catcher and beyond pod are going to cost
you about seven dollars each however
beyondpod is free for the first seven
days for those of you who like to try
before you buy I think that either of
these apps is worth every penny if you
subscribe to a bunch of audio and video
podcasts the app that will be best for
you will depend on which interface you
like the vest whichever podcast manager
you choose be sure to fill it up with C
net podcast which you can find over at
cnet com / podcasts and if you've got an
app that you would like to see us tap
send it to tap that app at cnet com I
manasquan good one and if you'll excuse
me I've got to tune in to the latest
episode of tap that app weird Antoine is
sure a busy guy in fact I'm not sure how
he has time to listen to all those
podcasts considering how much time he
spends making them every week all right
I've put it off as long as I could but
the time has come to check out the bad
we talk a lot here about all the great
things smartphones can do and sometimes
we leave out an important thing they
should do and that's make phone calls
apparently Samsung left that out as well
when they unleashed the admire upon the
unsuspecting public
I'm in German section editor for cnet
com today we'll take a first look at the
samsung admire the admirer is a new
phone for metropcs as a pretty simple
design so it's basically user-friendly
functional but just isn't going to have
a lot of really high-end features one
thing to note that however is the phone
didn't have the best audio quality audio
tended to cut out a little bit of time
so really a trouble hearing me so
doesn't have the best audio quality but
let's get down to the design as I said
it is pretty simple does have this
ribbed texture here on the side so gives
it a bit of a comfortable feeling in the
hand also there's a bit of a texture on
the back I wouldn't want to drop this
phone a lot of times on a hard surface
phone is a little heavier than it looks
a little over four ounces mentions are
pretty average so slips easily in a
pocket or bag or anything like that it
does have five home screens though of
course you can customize usual Android
fashion phone is running Gingerbread so
that's a nice bonus especially on a
basic phone like this just came out but
it is good to have all the features of a
gingerbread down below we have four
physical controls these are easy to use
their tactile I could feel you can find
them by feel on the back there's just a
3.2 megapixel camera lens and a small
speaker speaker doesn't have the best
output made the speakerphone kind of
unusable actually especially when the
phone is resting like this and the music
quality on that external speaker is
pretty poor so you definitely want to
use headsets when you're talking about
listening to music now the phone is all
the basic features you'd expect from an
Android phone as I said although it does
have a couple of extras this is the
first device that we've seen from
metropcs that comes with access to the
carrier's new Rhapsody unlimited music
service so you get unlimited access to
almost all of rhapsodies catalog it is
free but it does require metropcs is
sixty dollar per month unlimited data
and calling plan so keep that in mind
another unique feature this phone has is
metropcs is virtual card service once
you sign up there's no minimums and it
should be pretty easy to manage so on
all I think the phone has a lot two
offers for us future Scout of the design
is user friendly but I just wish that
call quality was just a little bit
better i'm kent german and this is the
samsung admire from metropcs
so there you have it the admirer is a
nice phone that doesn't really work as a
phone let's hope they don't have the
same problem with those galaxy s 2 s we
talked about earlier and now it's time
for this week's bottom line until now if
you wanted to take advantage of onstar
suite of driver assistance services you
had to be driving a General Motors
vehicle which let's just say isn't for
everyone but with the release of onstar
FMV or for my vehicle these security and
convenience of onstar is now available
to almost anyone typically the OnStar
service is only available in GM vehicles
but I'm in a Ford Explorer and there's
an OnStar mirror now before you go
getting confused we're taking a look at
the OnStar FMV it stands for for my
vehicle it's a universal standalone
OnStar mirror that you can install in
pretty much any vehicle it's also got an
internal speaker that's built into the
back of the unit and an external
microphone that you can mount pretty
much anywhere in your own vehicle ours
is up here in the roof now on the front
of the unit there are three major
buttons the first button of the phone
button or if I like to call it the
self-service button because you don't
actually have to interact with anyone
here you'll be able to access hands-free
calling either through the OnStar system
to built-in cellular connection or
through a Bluetooth connection with your
parent phone the second button is the
blue on button now here pushing this
button will get you in contact with on
thar's concierge service who will be
able to help you find destinations who
can send you roadside assistance the
real person the third button is for
emergency services now you don't really
want to push that button unless you need
help from police fire or medical
personnel now in the event of an
accident the system can also initiate a
call from an OnStar person and if nobody
answers they can automatically send you
out help that's the automated crash
response system now the way that OnStar
knows where you are is because the FMV
has a built-in GPS receiver and can even
give you turn-by-turn directions to a
destination that's been pushed to your
car either by an OnStar concierge or
through the online Google
apps interface the onstar is going to
retail for about two hundred ninety nine
dollars but you're going to have to have
a professionally installed the go ahead
and factor about a hundred more bucks in
for labor after that you're also going
to need a subscription to the OnStar
service which is about nineteen dollars
a month or two hundred bucks a year I've
been in chalong good one we've taken a
look at the OnStar FMV universal on star
receiver the bottom line this week for
my vehicle is right granted some might
balk a little at the cost of
installation the monthly fees the lack
of remote door unlocking but I gotta
tell you every time I see on star on a
commercial when the operator calls for
help after someone's been in a crash I
want that I think I might do it alright
that's it for this week everyone but
come back next week for an all-new Cena
tech review until then there are tons of
great videos available everyday at Cena
TV com I'll see you next time and thank
you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
