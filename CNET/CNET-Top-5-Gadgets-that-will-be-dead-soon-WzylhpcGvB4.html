we count down another hot sea netlist
Amaya's act are nowadays a lot of us are
carrying a computer in our pockets
capable of doing a whole lot as a phone
became a camera phone than a smartphone
it just seemed redundant to carry around
other devices like a personal digital
assistant so today we're counting down
the top five gadgets living on borrowed
time at number five dedicated GPS units
the time is ticking on this one
I remember when phones first got GPS
capabilities and there were all kinds of
questions when it came to reception and
handling calls while navigating the
phone GPS experience has become so
streamlined to the point a dedicated GPS
doesn't make a ton of sense for many
people number four game consoles as we
know them right now game consoles handle
a lot of heavy lifting locally so they
usually need respectable Hardware
internally however we're entering an age
where people can stream their games
online without needing a powerful
console nearby Sony's PlayStation now
service running on a Samsung TV is a
perfect example as internet speeds
increase there's a good chance of the
powerful console age will be traded in
for apps on a smart TV at number three
dumb lightbulbs okay bear with me on
this one at my time here and seen that
I've seen massive interest in light
bulbs seriously these lowly devices are
only super important on a day to day
basis so here's what I think the days of
the dumb light bulb that is one that is
not connected to your home network or
phone are winding down placing a
wireless technology into a device that
is a constant electrical connection it's
kind of a no-brainer eventually I think
that all light bulbs will have
conductivity options pretty much like
every TV has 3d there are some bulbs out
there right now with speakers built-in
others can act to strengthen your Wi-Fi
network at number two the
point-and-shoot camera this product
category is already on life-support
what's that saying
the best camera is the one that's with
you for most people that's their
smartphone the first camera phones are
kind of hilarious when you think about
it one we call them camera phones and
two they shot is super low resolution
take a look at the Nokia 72
6:50 it shot at point three megapixels
so plenty shoot still made sense then
but that was a long time ago these days
the best phones are offering larger
sensors an optical image stabilization
to produce pictures that are good enough
for most people people who want to get
serious about photography likely will
head to DSLRs or the mirrorless
alternative before getting a
point-and-shoot and number one the
dedicated fitness device let's face it
the future of fitness gadgets lies in
smartwatches I'm not saying that Fitbit
or Jawbone's gonna go out of business
what I'm saying is that the days of
buying a dedicated fitness tracker will
likely disappear as smartwatches get
cheaper or when fitness trackers add
more SmartWatch functionality take a
look at the Fitbit surge that's probably
what the future of fitness trackers will
be merging into watches then there's all
those sensors and phones apps and
smartwatches are the future of the
fitness device that's it for this
edition of top five I want to thank Paul
Spain Patrick and Jay for their input on
this list via Twitter remember if you
want to chime in on this list or future
ones let me know on twitter i'm matt
ayahs thanks for watching and i'll see
you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
