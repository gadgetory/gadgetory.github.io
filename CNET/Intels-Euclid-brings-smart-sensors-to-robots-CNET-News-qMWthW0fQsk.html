going to introduce you to today and that
Intel's Euclid now Euclid is truly a
developer's dream for real sense it's an
all-in-one device that integrates
compute communications and the realsense
cameras into one form factor basically
the size of a candy bar complete system
all you need and to show us an example
of this
I've brought David on stage the show
it's just what you can do with Euclid
and a small robot he's developed hey
Dave hey hey Brian so this is your clear
and it has everything you need to bring
census to any robot inside there's a
real sense er 300 camera and Atom
processor a variety of sensors onboard
communications and this one has a
battery so it's essentially a
self-contained PC and it's running
Ubuntu Linux and robot operating system
now I actually used this a lot and I
want to load on applications and
developers can ease your load on
applications that's provided or to
create their own of course and use this
you web-based utility that used to turn
on the screen to have it on this device
and how much for an example what I did I
have a robot here that I built kind of
cute right and I want to give it the
ability to follow me and it's very
simple all I have to do is go through
the application here and with a few
clicks I can go ahead and show you it
working let's see it push that button
right there and it's try oh there you
are Brian it's tracking me to you by
that yellow yellow bounding box you know
it's working so now this is a highly
integrated all-in-one platform and it's
plug-and-play so I could just simply
take it into this robot and plug it in
just like so there you go it's live get
through this I put down on the ground
here like a test application to meet Lee
so what come on come on come on there
you go it's that quick and that easy
it's Euclid great job thank you very
much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
