tuning in to the 404 show on Sina TV I'm
Jeff Bakalar and I am Justin you what is
the show where we're broadcasting in a
Retina display yeah you wrote retina d
retina d just sounds better it does ret
d what does retina display mean I think
if you polled 200 people maybe one or
two would actually give you a proper
definition of how retina displays it
doesn't really mean anything it's it's
an invented phrase right Apple yeah we
were talking about this the other day
over at Russ fresh success sure how like
new processors and uh all the marketing
jargon that goes along with sick right
they're just selling a whirling like a
word they made up right um obviously
we're alluding to the announcement made
yesterday at apple's WWDC conference
isn't worldwide developers conference
yeah out in California talking about the
new macbook pros right which all the
one-percenters are jumping on no I'm
joking it's a lot of freakin money let's
get let's cut right down to it
twenty-two hundred dollars for the
entry-level macbook pro it's got a
Retina display which means it's got a
badass uh resolution yeah the screen
that no one really needed but no one
really needed now I feel like retina
display makes sense for the ipad right
do you think it makes sense for a laptop
i think if you look at like what this
macbook is supposed to be for the
demographic you notice me for like
hardcore video editors I'd uh you know
talk about the minimum price but the max
is 3750 that's the best model you can
get with like that 2.7 quad-core i yes
as it which i don't think that most
people need that much power in a laptop
right like you have any people don't
need solid state drives unless you're
constantly turning on and off your
computer yeah I don't also think you
need a quad-core processor unless you're
doing a lot of video editing which I
think you're hoping you had right now
yeah I'm I just here on a new laptop I
have a new ish laptop
about a year old and I'm already done
with it oh yeah but what I don't
understand is why there's no in-between
e you name of weather and like only two
Mike why can they have made a macbook
without the retina maybe dial back maybe
give it like a dual core i7 right and
sort of you know keep it may be at a
price range where it's like my god this
is this price is too good to be true
they still and I guess people are
learning is the hard way they still are
a luxury company raced you know they
still are like this you know can you
afford US company I don't like that I I
was I was bummed out I wanted to see
like you know a twelve hundred dollar
ultrabook sort of thing right that's not
what we got well they did release some
of the new MacBook Airs though right is
that not what you were looking for I
don't know anymore yeah this too many
it's like duh yeah too many choices i
think i don't know if it's too many
choices but you know it's such a great
machine you really have to hand it to
them and it's only like four and a half
pounds right this new macbook pro
macbook pro with the dis retinues but it
really is an impressive machine yeah i
mean say what you will about the price
and how no one can afford and it's
overpriced and all this nonsense it
really truly is an impressive machine I
think if nothing else though if you
don't need this much power you can save
a lot of money by taking advantage for
the price cuts on the older model no
pros yeah um you know like not only are
those getting deals now in the apple
website you can also get a refurbished
macbook pro for i think under twelve
hundred dollars now and what's weird
they really like you said they did come
out with new heirs also didn't even talk
about that they came out with new mac
pro's also right talk about it right you
know which I thought is interesting uh
but yeah there's new MacBook Airs you
know they're still there are a lot of
money to and then when you look at the
specs with the air and the new pro now
it's tough there's there's big divide
there right so how do you see anything
was there anything else announced
yesterday that you were really excited
about yes definitely all I wanted to
talk about all the new iOS 6 features
okay um namely the maps did you see that
part of the address yeah so I os6 will
include a news
3d mapping function that's kind of been
a long time coming since they departed
from google maps right um a lot of
people are kind of complaining though
that uh the new flyover feature which
does look cool that like kind of lets
you give like a helicopter view to the
city you never knew we were on the
Transamerica building what not uh people
complaining that it's not really good
for city dwellers cuz it lacks some of
the like the public transportation
directions right and even the walking
directions that google maps provided
right we had to imagine once they've
been in google maps are gonna lose a
little bit of that functionality right
also it's a new program this is their
first iteration right Google Maps has
been around for like what seven years I
know isn't it sort of a huge pain in the
ass yeah you know I just think like look
I mean say what you will for the reasons
they they parted ways but you gotta give
credit to google maps I mean that that
stuff gets better every day right you
know it just improves every freakin day
and uh you know with this new
implementation of the of the new 3d map
integration it's just the kind of start
from scratch yeah it does look really
cool looks great and that's fine but
like you said not exactly for the the
city person do they mention anything
about street view either I was trying to
do some research on sir this morning all
that and I didn't see anything in there
about like flyover seems cool but they
um Tim Cook when he was demonstrating it
you didn't really zoom in enough to
where you had a street-level view it was
like you know in the air yeah so I don't
know how that's going to work maybe
there's a satellite function but it does
sound like they will be offering
turn-by-turn directions yes which is
something that every iphone user has
been drooling at right in in in envy of
android users because google maps has a
fantastic gps turn-by-turn navigation
right built into every every phone and
you know a lot of people with iphones
have sort of been like well i can I have
that you know that's the thing man a lot
of this stuff that they introduced are
things that Android users have been
enjoying for you not just Android users
but jailbroken iphone users yeah for
years like the whole sendin send a text
back instead of like when someone calls
like a simple stuff like that yeah the
little things in life but the point is
that Apple's never the first to do
they're right most of the time the best
at it and that's fine like that's a
corporate strategy that they don't have
to be for corporates you call it
corporate strategy I ball something else
I'll just being a call it I call it
never calling you after the first day
but I call that's what i call it um yes
it I know I really like to turn by turn
directions they should a screenshot of
it gives you exactly how much time you
have left to get your destiny up in
their bodies like the locator welcome to
android right now but does android dude
crowd-sourced updates for like traffic
information and things like that yep are
you sure positive maybe Apple will do
like a ticket warning system now
everybody know when you went when I
program it in there's a little icon in
the bottom left corner right and it
shows a green a yellow or red and that
means hey you're either gonna have a
smooth ride right um traffic or get used
to sitting in traffic does it give you
alternate drive directions and do it try
a bird you know I know you I have to
make it and and i'll let you know that
time i think i can't i'm not sure that
does this but i think it will give you
directions based on the current traffic
really because I I know I know that I've
been in a situation and I've asked for
for navigational directions and it's
given me two different routes depending
on like you know trap it definitely is
done that that does sound cool but does
android have Siri that emits a lard a
lot louder a lard allow a loud in police
siren what yeah I said something about
an app that you can download where you
can project a police siren out of Siri
why would you want to do that your car
speakers so it sounds like you have a
cop car alarm are you anything will get
out your traffic way yeah yeah I've read
that but it's not going to be integrated
into Syria no oh it's not yeah you
they're not gonna give everyone not on
the ability to like mess with traffic
yeah it sounds kind of cool yeah try
that sounds safe I think um yes or no no
3d Street View mode either which is what
I've been waiting for google maps to
come out what have you yeah wouldn't
that be cool if you could tourist city
any city you want with Google Maps three
you that you wouldn't have to like keep
clicking those arrows to move through
the city which gonna give you like a
driving okay of wherever you want sure
control like a video get on board with
that that's what I wanted all right uh
what else did uh I OS introduced
yesterday um the game center stuff I
thought was interesting they really
didn't get too deep into it but Game
Center which is what iOS is currently
using basically way for you to organize
your game progress there's achievements
you can challenge social sort of
gatherings matchmaking and what have you
that's going to be cross-platform so if
you have a game that you're playing on
your Mac and a game that's playable on
iOS though they can now talk to each
other for cross-platform playing right
which i think is pretty cool um you know
I don't know how well it's going to work
I don't know how many games are
available for mac and iOS and so that'll
be interesting to see how that works out
but that's not going to be out till
mountain lion okay when's that gonna
that's July that's uh I like how Apple's
doing a lot of the cross cross platform
well they need you they need to because
they uh you know if you if you look back
like three four years ago they're sort
of road map in terms of operating
systems it deviated it Forks right so
then get iOS on one side then you had OS
10 on the other right and everyone felt
like oh they'll eventually meet in the
end but it doesn't really feel like that
it feels like now they're just going to
be going down this like parallel highway
well and uh but be able to like you know
but I think a bridge between those two
operating systems is definitely wish I
cloud fish like yesterday I member they
announced I cod tabs which is something
I didn't even realize you could do and
you're surfing on your phone in Safari
you can pick up on another device right
where you left off you tabs are able to
realize firefox and chrome does that
Firefox can do that right you know but
across platforms though can you do it on
the phone versus a desktop yes browser
hundred percent I think I know you can
do it on the cleaner they have bookmark
sync that's right i think you can do it
on the chrome right or there's an app
that will let you do it k um but at the
end of the day that's an awkward
transition like how many Ted's do you
have open on your mobile browser right
you
no I think what really is very telling
what they're going to do and I forget
who said this I think it was someone we
know from back in the day about the
whole mobile ticket thing okay yeah so
we're talking about things like passbook
right so passbook is basically like a
mobile wallet and it's going to and
basically represent Apple's first
commitment to digital ticket coupon an
account consolidation right what I mean
if I'm ticketmaster I'm like hey the
first shots been fired you know there's
nothing really that that proves that
things are going to get crazy but I
think this is a first sign of what's to
come for you thinking this could
probably put an end to all the high
prices with taking I don't know about
that I think it'll just sort of
democritus eyes the whole situation
right and uh we'll see what happens i
don't know it's it's gonna be much
easier maybe for people to resell stuff
maybe that'll drive the price down a
little bit i think if nothing else
passbook would be a convenient solution
to what a problem we've talked about for
is keeping track of your passwords yeah
I mean it's not built for that function
because you're supposed to buy tickets
sure shut it could be used for that yeah
um and then the whole eyes-free thing
the serie inclusion in in cars and stuff
alright alright so they're basically
calling it eyes free and it's going to
be put into cars they're going to have
integration certain car certain vehicle
manufacturers with right on board I
think yeah and um yeah it's it's sort of
going to make it easier for for a more
integrated Siri mm-hmm instead of you
know I don't I just I hate these
commercials that make it look so
seamless and it's not so maybe this is
for your stuff will be a step towards
that reality I think it's cool that your
tip that Apple's trying to take a
navigation in like in console systems
out of the car itself which might drive
prices down for that I remember when I
was shopping for a car in high school I
got a Honda but the if for gps it was
like six hundred dollars more and now
you can just kind of take that with you
that's that seems like a interesting
feature it will be it will be
interesting to see how it works I think
if you're a car manufacturer you
definitely want to
have a footnote in your features that
says Siri compatible we you want that
you mean yeah everyone seems to be
talking about how this is going to
eliminate visual distractions and
provide a safe route right now
experience but there's like something to
be said about cognitive distraction
right like what when I don't care if
you're looking or not the fact that
you're trying to control music by
talking to a device the same time when
you're supposed to be dry and then the
inevitable frustration you will
encounter when it doesn't work properly
and then right look at it you're like
what the hell I didn't say that right
you know you're playing Marky Mark when
I clearly said C&amp;amp;C Music Factory
probably this is a problem and you look
at the thing you start hitting you with
your hand right you you know you get to
a fender bender I mean I that's the way
it work and a broken phone and a broken
phone yeah what else are we interested
about so that really wraps it up for
WWDC I don't think people like sony
microsoft and nintendo need to take a
page out of the Apple Keynote playbook
right because when all said and done
yeah it's overpriced but these things
are impressive lot of features and this
is how you get people excited about your
bunch of business sure and obviously the
last week at e3 I along with a lot of
other people did not think those three
guys made a made a splash like Apple
just did in there and a press conference
right I also read an article this
morning about from a Mentalist I'm not
even sure what that title what is that
is that like a media I think it's like a
psychologist that didn't go to school
Amendola a mental isn't there a show
called The Mentalist yeah but i think
i'm a guy that were natural abilities I
think Apple we could just read people
anyway yeah um so this guy's not a minor
eater but he did write a pretty
interesting article i wish i had it here
but I note about how our apple sort of
inflates or just straight up lies about
the stats in their keynote addresses hmm
to sort of just make themselves look
better as a PRN other companies do this
but apple doesn't more flagrantly and
i'll give you an example please do
because i could not agree more with this
um so in one of the slides Tim Cook was
talking about the adoption rate of OS 10
vs windows seven right and if you do a
little bit more market research you can
see that like Microsoft definitely
outsells Apple in terms of
in terms of their like operating system
sure sure sure but the problem is that
uh apple doesn't talk about corporate
corporations using right it's just like
the home use yeah and so they had a
graph up that was showing uh the
development in the course of the first
year of sales yep right and uh they're
saying apples make the point that the
new op iOS was adopted quicker at a
quicker rate in the first year that
Microsoft was and it gets updated more
more users upgrade right incrementally
the problem with that is that there's a
like an economic strategy here is that
most corporations that use operating
systems use windows of course and they
do it over a very slow course of time
because they needed to be tested prior
to you know rolling stock company yeah
so the Knox can adopt the new one the
first day that you doubt it comes out
right like iOS users will download it
immediately because they want to know
those new features yeah but when you're
in a corporate atmosphere it's a
different story so you know there's like
a psychological element there that
they're sort of hiding it's not only
that it and I maybe he brings us up
there's a lot of crap of like when they
use ambiguous words like favorite rice
is their favorite don't give me that
crap I complained about it last time
when they were when they were saying
like what people's favorite devices is I
guess that's an immeasurable concept
right you know it doesn't work like that
I forget what the with the map was but
they were they did it again yesterday
and they said like people's favorite
thing to use for whatever was I can't I
wish I could bring it up but it was a
customer satisfaction yeah and they grow
old and they propel is ridiculous pull
this stuff right really is infuriating
about when they do that yet this was any
other website you would ask for citation
yeah right ask for references like what
studied you poll there's always an
answer is that that that leads to
something at the Bonhams is like pulled
from Nielsen or comms or something like
this there's nothing yes just like a
fairy tale you know ample grinning not
only that like uh I mean if you're not
gonna provide your sources at least talk
about the sample size right like they
just had this really nebulous graph that
said that Apple had like these customers
are uh satisfaction yeah I don't know if
they're comparing their own users to
another web sites or what but at least
provide the sample size we should've
asked to people and build this graph
yeah so we're not going to be all
positive about
DC before we hit the break I want to
talk about Scott Stein has his
disappointments from WWDC let's go
through these real quick yeah first
bummer was that there's no consolidation
of the macbook line right so all they
did was basically they didn't make it
one thing like you know I mean you sort
of got that feeling when the ipad 3
turned out to just be the new ipad you
thought like all right well maybe
they're going to follow suit across the
board no they introduced a new laptop
and the pros in the airs still exists
now you have three different laptops on
it seemed like they were going towards
maybe a one or two a platform there's no
4g on the new macbook and that's a
bummer a lot of people wanted that
clamoring for it there's no new imacs or
Mac minis right I can live with that uh
no Apple TV okay so I understand that
there's a lot of disappointments that
people were expecting yesterday but is
it apples father didn't come out with
that more is it is almost all
speculating so much Brian I know these
this isn't really a knock on Apple race
is just what people were upset like no
one know like it would be different if
Apple sort of tease the television that
we don't know if it's gonna come out it
right right some people are upset that
there was no one more thing it's like
really I really upset that the the
conference didn't have a finale yeah
it's get away in fact that Siri came to
the ipad is one of the big things at
people for sure and that had delivered
that no new iphone we knew that was
probably going to be the case no Apple
TV in addition to the HDTV there's no
new TV with the little black box right
um no ipad mini i guess people were
clamoring for a 7 to 8 inch ipad and
finally no update or overhaul of itunes
which is quickly becoming the most
resource demanding insane application
ever they got a deuce they got to do
like an itunes light or something like
that because it's getting a little crazy
we got to take a break when we come back
more chat we have a video voicemail want
to share yeah and some questions from
you guys that will get two more 404
right after this stick around
here is the doll back with the face
pajamas live in the best and I don't

name yep yeah but you're right you is
like the Jones or the Smith or brown
whatever white last anyone today I
learned that you yeah like common orally
I don't know this read the email um hey
404 Chico from Jason here got a quick
question for Jeff what comic reader app
do you use on your Nexus I'm a huge
Garfield van but the only dedicated app
for it sucks really this is you need an
app to read Garfield oh I mean like well
look I can't help you on that front
because i don't use one on on my galaxy
nexus but what I did really want to
share with everybody is an app that I've
been using on my iPad it's my favorite
comic book reader app ever and it's
called comic zeal yeah so here it is
check it out here's what it looks like
and it's super simple now that reads a
CBR and I got like a copy of the New
Yorker here which is interesting right
you bought a copy than yeah you can
download them in and pop them in so
here's how it works no way you're going
to read that New Yorker know so it's
really interesting because it gives you
the ability to like file all your comic
books uh-huh and so let's say like you
you pop in and you can put all your
walking dead ones in one thing and then
you read it and you're you know you're
living the dream how does that take you
from panel to panel yeah okay yeah I
mean it's just a really good app super
easy and it lets you like organize stuff
you can take your your comics and like
drag them into a folder and then sort of
organize them in any which way you want
I've never really used one that's as
sort of intuitive is this it's really
cool what what are you smell just
laughing
garfield oh it's interesting i didn't
know there's a lot of like Garfield yeah
I'm super psyched on Garfield but hey
that's cool whatever you're into we
don't judge let it ride our next email
oh why don't know if I should read this
one oh no it's okay I didn't bring my
box of tissues oh she's a fine skipper
this way uh who wrote this one manual
right Janey says first I have three
things to say first I'm sorry with the
drivel losers really cooked like I love
the minority report last week you should
consider doing this more is really in
training week nice job Justin Richard
and REO and that other guy Joey third I
listen and watch cnet's coverage of WWDC
all of the updates did seem cool felt
cheated because of the mac not an iphone
fan but an Android user and loved it too
I was hoping for the beautiful and easy
to use experience that came with working
on a new mac right out of the box said
there's a lot of overpriced laptops that
if I were to purchase one I wouldn't be
able to even news out of the box because
you have to get an optical drive right
like the new one doesn't have that as
well as install your microsoft office
suites that's nothing new that never
came with apple laptops not sure sure
but anyway he said he would also have to
buy dongle to connect his ethernet
through the Thunderbolt there's a lot of
hidden costs yeah so that and then you
also have to buy a the new power adapter
right like new man you don't have to
give you hot you want to operate with
like an older screen okay that's like
ten dollars right there there are a lot
of hidden costs he's if he's been a big
avid Mac user for more than a decade but
he made the transition from zip and jazz
discs to flash drives and now he has to
do it again isn't like the new mac stand
which is change would be left behind
yeah they they that's their m.o man I
mean if you if you're trying to stick
around with four year old technology
you're gonna get left out of the party
that's sort of how it's always been with
them yeah and we're talking about this
before it's getting harder and harder to
get an ipad and use an android handset
like what you're doing right now with
all the cross platform integration I
seem to be doing it just fine really you
have no desire to get into the
get an iphone now on whenever I've never
not wanted an iPhone more than my time
really yeah i mean i don't i don't need
yeah i don't think it's a big deal
because they'll net i say this but who
knows I don't think they'll ever lock
you out right you know I mean I don't
think there'll ever be a time where you
can't use google contacts or gmail with
your iphone right i don't know may be
happening soon this rivalry is getting
intense I don't know I can't see that
ever happening you know that's
completely alienating a huge chunk of
people right so I don't know let's get
you a video voicemail because we haven't
done this in a while yeah let's do it
and I want to hear from Marlon uh for
nothing else besides the fact that he's
very complimentary oh cool three of us
last week oh so it does involve as many
compliments as possible oh not in you
i'm talking about the Minority Report oh
sure yeah cuz i'm not a minority I just
want to make a short video I pretended
to do it last week but I was so busy and
I couldn't I just wanted to congratulate
Justin on last week's episode the
