good what about you your seats want to
sense and the VW scandal the king of
them all and powered by tech it's time
to check the tech EC cars differently we
love them on the road and under the hood
but also check the tech and are known
for telling it like it is ugly is
included at no extra cost the good the
bad the bottom line this is CNET on car
welcome to CNET on cars to show all
about high-tech cars and modern driving
i'm brian coulis we spend quite a bit of
time lately roaring around in mustang
shelby GT 350s and Corvette zo6 --is but
I never like to stray too far from the
real world where cars like the Honda
Accord live just as happy to see one of
these come into the scenic garage
especially since they've rather heavily
revised the 16s sheetmetal and
electronics let's get in the 16 accord
sedan and check the tech Don Accords one
of those cars that you know doesn't make
the hair on the back of your neck stand
up but I'll tell you what I can drive
one of these things all day long as so
many million
do
the 2016 Accord is not a completely new
car it's on the same platform as the one
we've had since 2013
so the basic volumes and dimensions are
all still the same but they've really
revised the front and rear in particular
on the outside look at the face it's
much more sculpted and scowling people
like angry scowling car faces for some
reason out back there's a lot more
accurate DNA to my eye and again more
finely sculpted and muscular you've got
LED tail lights on all the 16 accords
and up front you've got LED headlights
available now on the top line that's
called the Touring when I got in this 16
accord in a couple ways I wasn't sure
was in a Honda first of all they've done
some really smart stuff with cabin tech
which to be honest they don't normally
do in this case it's Android auto and
car place side by side no excuses no
extra cost I've got my phone cable down
here to a convenient USB data and charge
port and that's that and check this out
you've actually got a live web browser
now not while you're driving obviously
but this is normally really high-end car
stuff you can pull over and watch CNET
on cars but wouldn't I still have my
gripes about the interface though first
of all there's no volume knob yeah you
got to use that rocker on the wheel or
this touch thing to the left of the
screen
no thank you and you can get too many
weirdnesses on these dual screens like
having audio on one and the same thing
on the other one that's a waste the
overall interface though has been
revised to be more elegant yet still
featuring some of the cleanest largest
touch buttons in the biz
I like that
the succour DXL stays pretty close to
the playbook under the hood a 2.4 liter
direct-injected inline for doing 185
horse and almost the exact same number
on the foot pound CVT is the only
gearbox on this trim lowered Accords can
get a six-speed manual upper Accords get
a traditional automatic overall you can
get pretty close to 40 on the highway
and of course all the cords are still
front-wheel drive okay first thing I
want you to do if you go test drive this
means 16 Accords coming to a stop like
this cutting onto the wheel and feel the
pedals I find that it idle there's kind
of a vibration coming through that I
don't expect in a modern car that isn't
exactly cheap so you got to check that
out for yourself maybe I'm nuts I don't
know now once you get going all that
harshness kind of blows away and I'm
left with a surprisingly perky
4-cylinder but I coffee mud head the 6
when I first drove this I was impressed
CVT gearbox you can hear it going
through it smashing ations there that's
the only choice on this EXL trim it's a
good one I got to give you that you know
I'm not a huge CVT buff now it's not too
hard to plumb this engine and find its
breathless spots so it's not a real
super powerful engine but in everyday
driving you're not going to notice them
the big tech ticket on the road is Honda
sensing their driver assist package
including collision mitigation braking
which can go to a full stop forward
collision warning lane departure that is
active to keep you in your lane road
departure mitigation which is different
from lane departure it keeps you from
going off the road and adaptive cruise
control first time in an accord our
amplitude reactive dampers that means
two valves in the shocks to read the
road surface based on frequency of
vibration and move between the two valve
sets to be either firm or compliant okay
if the onion ever does a special on
firstworldproblems there's a technology
in this car that needs to be the cover
store it's called
Road assist or something I mean just the
name is onion ask what it does is it
uses the electric power steering and the
vehicle's various sensors to help you
steer straight when you're going down
one of those peak ground roads I never
knew that was fatiguing maybe I was
missing something and I continue to love
this Lane watch camera it's one of the
best cameras in the auto biz's that one
that looks down the right side right on
a 16 accord four-cylinder EXL which is
very high trim a little over 29,000 I'm
gonna load up some sensors on that
wireless charging tech but definitely
move my trim up one more notch to get
the navigation but more importantly the
Honda sensing adaptive Drive tech that
bundle for 2 grand you're stealing that
all day long
we're in about 32 to CNET stop find our
full review notes on that 16 Accord
Sedan over at car cnet.com nice everyday
driver well you probably know that cars
sold in Europe and America even the same
make and model do differ in some ways
but a recent and rather obscure trade
tariffs negotiation has surfaced a
substantial and little-known difference
between cars sold on either side of the
pond that is of great interest to
smarter drivers in both
I'll fill you in let's see that on cars
returns
it's called the transatlantic trade and
investment partnership is being
negotiated now between the US and
European Union and seeks to increase the
ease of trade between the two regions by
addressing tariffs yes but more
interestingly by normalizing product
standards between the two markets no
product is subject to more standards
than automobiles one of the big
assumptions was if we test US and
European cars and find that they're
basically equivalent if not equal in
terms of safety standards we can call it
a wash and let them cross markets and
that would avoid expensive
re-engineering and recertification of
every car before it can be sold in the
other market now stubborn differences
between the two markets have existed for
a long time mean automotive Li just look
at the first Jaguar e-type the series
one at these lovely glass covered
headlights by late 67 those were gone
thanks to US regulations and the car
never looked quite the same again same
goes for those five mile-per-hour
hideous US bumpers that luckily never
got adopted in the EU but this is not
some battle for the aesthetic high
ground in fact it's a battle for the
dollar high ground the Atlantic Council
estimates that US car makers could go
from shipping about 13 billion dollars
in cars into the EU market to nearly 85
billion dollars by 2027
and by the way automotive would be the
biggest single industry to benefit from
this normalizing process so for now
automakers are saying this study needs
more study while the European Transport
Safety Council says maybe we should
leave cars out of the negotiation one
thing's for sure regulators can now
agree that it pays to double check if
cars that seem equivalent in very
similar markets really are
welcome back to see net on cars coming
to you from our home at the Mount Tam
Motor Club just north of the Golden Gate
Bridge well as fitness bands and
smartwatches Duke it out to see who's
going to be the platform of choice on
our wrists car makers have gotten this
inkling that their seats should be the
biometric platform under our butts makes
for an interesting car Tech 101 what if
your next fitness wearable weighs about
Oh 30 500 pounds it's not entirely
unlikely as more and more technology
companies are deciding the inside of a
car can be a wellness monitoring tool
for SIA here is a good example they call
this their active wellness seat
technology I am right now sitting on a
sensor it looks like a seat but in the
bottom cushion is a sensor you can call
it a butt sensor because it's using my
rump to figure out my heart rate and my
respiration and then the tricky part is
doing a very complicated signal-to-noise
process to take out all the vehicles
vibration and thumping it all gets
reported up somewhere in the dash like
on this mock-up there's my heart rate
there's my respiration rate right there
below that they're able to use another
algorithm to figure out if I'm stressed
right now or if I'm sleeping in the
middle is fine but either those extremes
it can then do some kind of seat therapy
on me a combination of massage heat and
cooling could be used to wake me up if
it's a really vigorous massage with
cooling or calm me down maybe if it's a
more calm massage some other factors
that you can deal with once you have
this data captured you can send that off
to a medical professional
you can also MUX that data together with
what's coming off your Fitbit for
example to get more accurate data
overall interesting wrinkle on crash
detection what if when a collision is
detected they don't just send the
severity of the crash on the location
but they can also send my heart rate and
respiration to emergency responders they
know a little bit more but what they're
going to get into when they arrive here
then if they don't have that data and
then from this of course automakers can
decide to extend that more they can tap
into a sensing seat like this to do
their own sort of response systems for
different moods also make it part of a
holistic almost intuitive Spore
mode or comfort mode for the overall
drivetrain depending on what mood you
bring to the car
that would be on the OEMs plate to do
that by the way the medical grade
sensors behind this technology are
already in use in hospital beds to
measure certain patient parameters
Jaguar si is using them as part of a
platform called mind sense in addition
to reading brainwaves it also envisions
a biometric seat to read heart rate and
respiration rate particularly to better
know how to alert the driver of a future
autonomous Jaguar when they need to take
control again the advanced Institute of
industrial technology in Tokyo was
several years ago working on a seat Tec
that reads the contours of your rump to
identify you basically a butt print to
get access to the car and a few years
ago Ferrari applied for a patent on seat
technology that would go beyond
measuring heart and respiration by
adding brainwaves measured by a headrest
sensors in the aim of better tailoring
the cars drive mode to the drivers
mental hook clearly the day is coming
when car seats will do a lot more than
just keep you off the floor in a moment
your email all about the VW emissions
scandal and why it's like no other
when CNET on cars continues
you
it's time for the 991 to get a midlife
refresh except rather than a nip and a
tuck and a bit more power this time it's
got a whole new heart and it's
turbocharged the turbos mean you get
more power more torque more mpg mold
everything really but it also means push
can keep up with its increasingly
turbocharged rivals buy more from the ex
car team of CNET UK at cnet.com slash
welcome back to see net on cars i'm
brian coulis this is the part of the
show I really enjoy answering some of
your emails and they all kind of go one
direction the last couple weeks
it's a torrent of questions about this
emerging VW emissions gate story some of
our questions come in from Chrissy in
Chicago who says you know in the u.s. we
kind of just seem to hate Diesel's
for some reason you think the media is
just zooming in on the problem
especially hard
Kelvin C says I know you like these
cylinders he's referring to me and I do
I'd love to hear your perspective on why
VW would do this and what a repair would
look like for VW diesel owners and Peter
T says how about a discussion of old
versus new diesel technology that helped
enable this scandal to happen in the
first place this is an unprecedented
issue in the auto industry sure we've
had some big debacles before I mean look
back at what's happened with Toyota
gates that was the unintended
acceleration Hyundai and Ford had some
issues with stated versus observed mpg
that were pretty stark General Motors
still working through an enormous recall
on badly designed ignition switches Jeep
had some unprotected rear fuel tanks
that were a big problem and of course
takata's massive recall of airbags that
explode but all of those are in a
different category than what volkswagen
has done the revelation of some 11
million volkswagen and audi turbo diesel
powered cars have technology to
willfully and repeatedly skirt emission
standards is truly unprecedented
specifically VW engineered the software
in their engine
ECU on these cars that's the engine
electronic control unit to sense when
it's hooked up to an emissions testing
program and then to modify its own
software parameters to meet low emission
standards got it
then when the car sensed it was
disconnected from an emissions test it
went to a different profile entirely
that allowed it to get better
performance but at vastly higher
emissions 10 to 40 times the legal
allowed rate and to do it actively when
not connected to an emissions test is
what is so evil about this not that many
years ago the engine control units
weren't that sophisticated it would have
been almost impossible for VW to
engineer this kind of deceitful behavior
I bet a lot of folks there wish it were
those days right now they wouldn't have
been able to step in it like they did
instead they've taken a huge hit on many
fronts it's cost them who knows how much
in market value it's measured in
billions of euros they've lost their CEO
they've yet to even see likely billions
in penalties from US regulators and
they've got to figure out what to do
with all those cars on the road
somewhere from an expensive
re-engineering and recall to possibly
the largest buyback in automotive
history and they've given diesel cars of
black eye on the US market a market that
was already kind of sketchy on them in
the first place
thanks for watching really hope you
enjoyed this episode we appreciate you
viewing seen it on cars follow me on
Twitter it's Bryan Cooley and you'll see
regular snapshots from the field and
know what we're shooting next for our on
the road segments I'll see you next time
we check the test
