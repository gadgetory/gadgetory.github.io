CNF book club for this one Dan Ackerman
and I sat down with Jaron Lanier a VR
pioneer an author of last year's book
dawn of the new everything which talks
about his time in VR in the 80s and 90s
and also a new book ten arguments for
deleting your social media accounts
right now which is about social media so
we talked to him a little bit about both
we're here at seeing a book club episode
who knows what and today we're talking
about a lot of things but with on a
couple of different books Jaron Laney
lennier Jaron yeah Geralyn Geralyn done
do everything and your new book ten
arguments for deleting your social media
accounts right now which is a follow up
so we want to talk about both we'll
start with the most recent one and there
are a lot of really really timely things
that are popping up in this book that
we've been dealing with for years and
are coming to a head right now involving
the worlds that we live in and feel like
we can't escape and it could not be more
timely in fact you were just telling us
about how you made a last-minute change
to the book which came out like in March
about something it just happened yeah
well you know this book was kind of an
unplanned pregnancy it's the way I'd put
it what happened was I had a big book
Donathan ooh everything last year and
whenever I would go and talk to the
esteemed media they would say well okay
all this VR stuff is good and fine but
you're you you were one of the earliest
critics of this whole manipulation
advertising model for Internet companies
and now it seems like it's gone dark
with the election and everything what do
you have to say for yourself now and I I
realized that I hadn't really written
about that for some years and I started
coming up with things to say and I
realized wow this could be a little book
you know like my little collection of
things I said to this so this was kind
of driven by journalistic interest so I
just put this thing together fast I gave
it to the publisher said hey when you
publish this as a mini book and then
Cambridge analytical came out it was
already at the printer and I'm like oh
my god okay
pull it pull it pull it I just need to
add some more stuff and they're like you
can't do that it's getting printed and
I'm like what do you need all you do is
you start the printer you stop the
presses like they even said that in the
40s right stop yes yeah and they said
okay but you can only use existing white
space on the pages you can't change any
pagination because otherwise you have to
redo everything yeah so I just I just
read it a few things so at least uh a
little bit of the more current stuff
from 2018 is at least acknowledged in
there but the truth is this is a
long-term problem it's been with us I've
been writing almost the same stuff since
the early nineties which is so insane
and but what's really insane is that
we're still somehow living with a stupid
problem that's not in anybody's ultimate
interest the problem being that right
that we've adopted this business plan
for consumer Internet companies where if
you and I connect or you and I connect
the way that's financed is some
mysterious third party person behind the
camera over there is paying to
manipulate us and otherwise we can't do
it and we've drop on that conversation
where what the do based on it well what
they do is they they eavesdrop on us and
then they use algorithms to figure out
what little stimulus to give us that
will manipulate our behavior a way that
they can then measure and it only
changes slightly they can only affect
this a little bit statistically and only
some of us but a small statistical
change to society if it's methodical and
consistent it's just like compound
interest it can build into a big change
in society so it's made the whole world
sort of darker and more paranoid it's
reversed the course of increases in
democracy around the world it's made
social movements go dark it's it just
sucks on every level and so that's the
thing we have to change and that's what
the book is about to manipulate people
you know a tiny level when you spread
out over a billion and a half Facebook
users that's where that scale comes in
and you're able to move mountains yeah
so you know what the algorithms can do
is they they can automatically just
test and watch for what little tricks
happen to work for people without really
having any solid model of how the brain
works or anything they're what we call
AI is still really crude if we're honest
but one thing that's really upsetting is
the main application of AI is the
manipulation of real people right now so
there's something deeply twisted about
the whole field for the moment but let's
say just making something up there's an
algorithm that discovers that around the
time your rent comes to you every month
if they show you ads and Reb you respond
a little bit better because maybe you're
nervous and red means that you there's
no theory behind it there's no professor
in a cubicle somewhere who said Oh red
will mean the same it's just a
mathematical correlation and then they
manipulate you and your behavior changes
a half a percent but overall in the
population of millions of people who
have who are correlated with you through
your behaviors or what you've bought or
who you know or whatever there's just
like this little 1% change but then
that's consistent over time and then as
they get better and better at
manipulating you when you're nervous all
of a sudden when a collection when an
election comes up or a collection they
make you just a little more paranoid
they can make you a little somebody can
come along and and kind of basically
distract you or make you cranky and and
and so it's it's small changes
distributed methodically and
algorithmically that are screwing us up
you know and and and it's a it's just
making for a lot of kind of people with
these kind of cranky addicted
personalities like our president at the
moment who's an addict and it's a it's
creating this absurd situation where
it's hard to talk about anything real
yeah well you mentioned it like going
back to how the internet was was
conceived that that this is a problem
from the get-go and that you know your
belief in that if there have been more
not just the way that links are
constructed the way people's identity
remains somewhat shadowy but the not
having any ability of micropayments you
mentioned a lot about it's a focus on
some sort of financial way that we can
either ones paying therefore were the
customers first
is the other way around yeah this was a
kind of an interesting political
development so the first people on the
scene to think about how you'd make a
digital network including notably Ted
Nelson around 1960 looked at this and
they said well here's what a network
should be anytime two people do things
there should be links in both directions
there'd be no reason to copy things
anymore cuz that'd be a big waste of
energy and everything because you could
hose link back to the original people
could get world he's not only on putting
something up but on how they reused you
could have like mashups of mashups of
mashups and the whole chain could be
understood and people could share
revenues from it if it was monetized so
there has to be like a two-way links a
payment system and everybody should get
memory to store their stuff and they
should have an identity that's theirs
that's secure that was the first idea
and what happened was around so for
those who think Al Gore inventing the
Internet is a joke it's actually kind of
true like I was there and he didn't he's
not an engineer it's not like he
invented packet-switching or any of the
things that make the internet work but
there all these people who were gonna do
separate Nets that we're really gonna
talk to each other because people were
strictly Dennis there now and he said
well hey we'll throw some government
money at you to bribe you and they kind
of started to interoperate so that was
actually a real accomplishment that was
no small thing we'll see if it lasts at
this point it's it's sort of being
undone in my view but let's leave that
aside so but during that time there was
such an intense wave of how would I put
this there was like this there was a
super faith in making everything free
and open the way well this was before
the Wikipedia of course but but there
was a the free software movement was
really going with Richard Stallman and
all that and there was a analogous ideas
music should be free culture should be
free and this very strong feeling led to
this idea that the internet shouldn't
dictate anything except the most basic
raw possible capability it should be the
most minimalist design possible and then
we'll leave it to private enterprise to
fill in all those other pieces like
identity and
Commerce and all that stuff and if
hundred that is that because of network
effects it's a network after all what we
did is we created this pave the way for
these giant monopolies right so of
course there was going to be one giant
thing like a Facebook and of course
there was going to be a giant thing like
a Google and we kinda knew that was
happening but somehow I thought oh well
whatever they will survive somehow and
then we also had this idea that since
nobody should have to pay for things the
only viable business plan for all that
stuff would be advertising but then
advertising which really was kind of
nice at first like the earliest Google
was kind of kid in terms of the ads but
because of Moore's law and people just
getting better at algorithms and
customers getting savvy or and other
actors who are maybe not so nice
figuring out more and more about how to
game the system what started off as
advertising morphed into this massive
behavior modification system and that's
how we ended up with where we are so one
way out of it is to in my it is to
change the business plan you could try
to re-enter the re-engineer the internet
so that more the basic functions are
just part of it and they're taken away
from these companies I know there's a
lot of different ways you could fix it
but we have to fix it well would anybody
get on board doing that that's the
problem getting people off what they're
on now the apps are interesting because
it's advertising traditionally it's
gotten I both come from a print in
broadcasting background it's literally
broadcasting you put your ad out and
hopefully a few million people will see
it at the same time you know same ad and
maybe they'll buy a shoe and maybe they
won't whereas online advertising has
become the most ultimate type of
narrowcasting almost to the individual
and and that's why it's so different
it's kind of like fly-fishing at this
point yeah but ya know it's worse than
fit cause like it's it's more like it's
not even fishing it's just like sticking
you enough in a skinner box it's like
this continuous will observe you and
will keep on changing the stimulus until
we learn how to modify your body amazing
yeah yeah I I don't mind dad
I think advertising has been a part of
modernizing I I don't think we'd have
the benefits of technological progress
without advertising not that I love all
ads sometimes they're certainly annoying
but um none on SEMA I'm sure they're all
very pleasant ads and and beneficial to
the user but but but advertising is not
the problem it's behavior modification
this is continuous observation of people
to keep on finding the way to manipulate
them that used to be really rare that
was like something that only happened if
you were in a in a cult or you know a
psych experiment or something to do that
universally is new territory and the
results so far not encouraging well do
you think what I kept thinking about two
rings reading the book well your euro
mention like in one example lease with
with cable television like you know
where you would think that advertising
wouldn't continue but then people were
paying and there was still advertising
like my worry is that if people did if
you introduce a new economic system
would that behavioral modification might
still remain as a layer in terms of like
it and intertwine in something well yeah
I mean this hope is that there are a few
different philosophies of competing
right now about how to fix this okay so
one of them is regulation so the idea is
that you'd say you if somebody says
don't use my data to mean if you like me
you can't use their data so the EU is
experimenting without there's this gdpr
thing the very first day of the GDP our
people lodged complaints against Google
and Facebook saying you know under GDP
our if I tell you I want to access your
site but you can't use my data to affect
what the site shows me you can't just
refuse me you have to do that and so
that's going to litigate now and we'll
see where it goes another another idea
is to just nationalize the thing totally
so it becomes like the public library
system and the government runs it in the
US there's such a strong strain of
libertarian thinking that that might
sound a porn to people
maybe it should on the other hand I have
to say the Public Library System has
been one of the most beautiful and
beneficial inventions of the whole
history of mankind in my view so I don't
think it necessarily has to be a
terrible thing the only country
experimenting with that right now that I
know of is Papua New Guinea where
they're talking about shutting off and
starting about starting their own
version I don't know how that would go I
honestly know very little about Papua
New Guinea I know a bit about their
music that's about it
and then the another alternative which
is the one that I've been most
associated with that I've been exploring
is to romana ties the idea of networking
and so so you'd pay to use it and then
you'd get paid if you contribute a lot
and it would create this whole expanded
economy where the data would be just
paid for instead of free and what I know
a lot of people have questions and have
doubts about it and I since we haven't
tried it much it's hard for me to say a
lot about it there are a couple of
experiments that have been good though
it used to be that people thought in the
future there won't be Studios like this
instead everything will be created like
the Wikipedia by volunteers who are
unpaid we actually got an experiment we
have an empirical contest between people
trying to do that of whom there were a
lot and then people like Netflix and HBO
trying to use the internet to create
direct billing relationship with
individual customers the direct billing
thing created this thing we call peak TV
it just worked better people are
enthused about it whether you like
what's on Netflix or HBO or whatever is
I can't say that's up to you but most
people seem to like this stuff and it
seems to be this really a big deal
that's been a success so that like if we
could do that to social media so we get
peak social media you'd pay for it
somehow either monthly fee or as you go
through micro payments or however it
works but I think you also should be
paid and I can get into that in a second
I think that's really important but you
just make it part of the economy instead
of this weird non-economic manipulation
Lazaro economy like make it just normal
you buy and sell stuff you want well
that was the other interesting thing it
was fascinating the way you talked about
AI
throughout right your book and
throughout your books skepticism about
it is a you know sort of a religion or
and also that the thing which I had
never really thought about till I think
I read your take on it how much these
different algorithms are based on human
knowledge and expertise that at the
mission the translating that this is
based on people who are doing
translating work the the works of art
that are building these algorithms that
see men like computer art but to degree
to which ramana ties in what seems to be
the work of the system that's really
coming from someone else yeah so you
know there's this kind of weird thing
going on so there's a lot of people from
the tech community not pardon me I saw
clear maestro
there's a lot of people who are warning
that we're gonna have this massive wave
of unemployment because of AI and these
are not anti tech Luddite weirdos these
are people from Silicon Valley and what
they'll say about it is well we'll have
this economy of people being very human
being loving the loving-kindness economy
it's called sometimes they'll be nurses
and stuff and everybody will live off
this basic income or they'll get welfare
basically because they're not needed
anymore and to me this is just moronic I
just kept because here's the thing
AI runs on data we get data in that's
the training set the machine learning
algorithm works with the training set
and then it then it does something
that's a kind of a derivative of it
that's the paradigm occasionally you can
have a I work with small training so but
there's always a training so it works
with data the data comes from people
because there's not any aliens or angels
around here to give it data so what
you're telling what you're telling us is
that the data which comes from people
will be used to make the people obsolete
except that the data came from the
people so they aren't obsolete because
they're still needed and and so like the
usual retort to this idea that AI will
people put people out of work as well
it's never happened before they always
said that people you put out of work by
cars they'd be put out of work by this
and by that and of course that's true
every time somebody said we're gonna
have a wave of unemployment because of
new technology they've been proven wrong
because it turned out people were need
new ways and the new jobs were better
than the old jobs and everybody was
happy
the only difference this time is we're
pretending that the new way that people
will be needed is actually not like
we're just we're pretending we're saying
we'll steal for them instead of paying
from you know the only difference this
time is we don't want to pay the people
for the new way they'll be needed and I
mean it's like criminal it's stupid
so every time somebody says oh basic
income or loving-kindness economy you
know saying they'll just pay the people
for their data it's like a better more
dignified solution then you'll motivate
people to make better data and they can
take pride in the quality of their data
everything about it is more humane and
more sensible everything will work
better because the data will be better
and by the way all the people who say oh
we're gonna have basic income or this
loving kind of thing they're never
saying oh and raise my taxes to prepare
for it I want to start paying more taxes
to start paying everybody because I'm
gonna put them out of work nobody ever
says that the underlying thing is I have
a right to steal from everybody you
don't you don't have that right pay them
for their damn data the methodology is
you get someone to train the replacement
version of themselves who doesn't need a
lunch break and of course the first
people are going to replace are the
nurses that that sort of high investment
you know low margin job well they're
already replacing their truck drivers my
favorite story about this kind of stuff
is they talk about coal jobs coming back
and the first thing that happens is they
start replacing the coal truck drivers
with with robots with self-driving coal
trucks
yeah well the it's every type of AR has
a slightly different profile so for
self-driving vehicles there might
actually be less in terms of data
payments to people because it's more
about just gathering Road data but for
something like nurses I think there's
going to be a lot of data taken from
people on an ongoing basis and this gets
we can really get into the weeds with
this because a lot of people who really
just don't like it they just really want
to be able to steal everybody else's
data though there's a zillion objections
and it can get very complicated but
fundamentally it is theft I mean if we
want AI to be anything other than theft
we have to give up the theft part do you
think you think is her voice assistant
go that there I mean is that is that
part of the fantasy of AI or do you
think that's basically gonna hit a wall
or you know because that's basically all
anyone's talking about now in terms of
you know like the thing the big
companies do voice yeah I mean if like
they're pushing that more and more right
right um we're gonna have artificial
assistance bilking each other with fake
blockchain cryptocurrency schemes that's
the future Google assists in call that
the dentist to make you place an entire
them to each other ever name their child
again yeah
it's now forbidden name it was
increasing yeah even in these sort of
like conversational element of these
well I really want to emphasize I have
no objection to a voice interface any
more than I have objection to any other
kind of interface I think let's make our
machines beautiful and usable the
problem is not the voice interface the
problem is not using personal data to
make a voice interface
the problem is stealing the data in
order to manipulate the people using the
voice interface so I was really you know
what I thought of when when Amazon had
its four successful year getting people
to buy it smart speakers as gifts it
reminded me of 2001 a Space Odyssey
because this was one of the cautionary
tales about how computers could go wrong
and it has this round thing that just
sits there and watches even talks to you
so it ends up being a murder and they
have to shut it down I'm thinking like
after that after this fundamental
warning from decades earlier people
still bought howls right when they had a
chance and it makes you worry about like
whether whether cautionary tales about
technology or even work but I we
certainly have to keep trying I think
most people who grew up with all the
cool you know cyberpunk books now that
we're also cautionary tales are using
those as inspiration for having built
the the new wave of VR worlds and so
it's sort of the same thing even like a
you know a modern ready player one
there's caution in that or it's
definitely caution in Neuromancer or
snow crash but people always talk about
those as works that inspire them to
create something that's like the
metaphor about the fourth time you
recreate the dinosaur DNA you think it
right by now that it's
not a good idea I'm sure in these places
it's when you bring up Neuromancer
because I used to know Bill Gibson and I
just I just saw him again in Vancouver
actually and in the old days I used to
is complaining I'm like Oh bill you're
making VR seem so negative and if you
just talk about the positive thing I'll
be like this magic spell that'll make
people use it well instead of becoming
creepy in humans he would you know let
me know that that was a stupid way to
talk about writing which is correct he
was keep scary but it's funny like I was
worried that he was being too dark and
the truth is maybe he wasn't mean or
another we I worked on this thing called
Minority Report yeah and you know we
tried to we it was I think a reasonably
articulate warning about how things
could go wrong and I'm trying to predict
and run society would would go amok and
useless useless so I personally prefer
good yeah right they say let's make
something like mitre yeah for it that
would be great
you know it's what but the Minority
Report
I actually made working versions of
those gadgets like the the very first
face finder was this algorithm of my
friends and I sold it to Google but that
was the thing where somebody somebody's
trying to escape the police but they're
put into these ads along the way so the
police can see him that was I made that
that was like a that was the scene idea
and actually implemented it and way way
back then it was the very first time it
could be done but the I guess this book
is an experiment like okay we tried
warning you which I'm talking about in
advance a lot of people did when I say
we I mean a lot of the computer science
community going back to the beginning
this is not like a new revelation that
these things gonna be problems we've
been a lot of us have been talking about
it for a really long time so now it's
happening and so there's an old line
from in in the in the world of sales
that you tell somebody what they're
gonna see before they see it you tell
them and there's what they're seeing
while they're seeing it then you tell
them what they just saw and then maybe
they'll get a little bit of it all right
so I think it might have maybe it
applies to these political and tech
warnings too we told you what you were
gonna see
book is I'm telling it to you while
you're seeing it and then next year
somebody can write one that that's what
just last year yeah still that time yes
somebody gets it you know I I still
really optimistic and if I was and I
wouldn't even been doing all this stuff
but it's you know people people are very
vulnerable to being duped and hypnotized
and manipulated and that's that's what's
going on and it's very hard to come to
them rationally and say okay you're
being duped and tricked and manipulated
snap out of it it doesn't you know it's
like hard to find an angle in well hmm
addictions are hard I mean I related to
a lot of those feelings reading the book
but it's like anything you're doing
that's bad that you say well if you
could recognize that it's an addiction
but being getting getting off of it as a
whole other thing and then you still
find there's a tremendous challenge
there or ideally everybody says oh I
wasn't you know I didn't buy those shoes
even though so the answer this time I
dodged it and so clearly doesn't work on
me right well all right a positive spin
that's possible as he could say in those
olden days when there was less
technology and most children didn't make
it to adulthood and people live to 30
and died and that was normal and a lot
of people were hungry a lot at the time
and plague swept through all the time
and all that stuff which was that long
ago at all there was just last century
even earlier this entry with it or I
mean early 20th and and certainly 19th
and you can say that in those days the
immediate problems people faced weren't
mind games between them as often as they
are today and the reason mind games
between us have come to the fore as our
biggest problems is because we can
afford for them to that we're
comfortable and the basics are covered
enough but unfortunately that's only
true like in the short term I guess the
scenario that worries me the most is
that we're making ourselves so crazy
through this new society we've created a
mutual manipulation that we can't face
the real objective problems like climate
change like we're we've blinded
ourselves to the survival
substantial issues we have to face up to
and that's ultimately if we didn't face
any real problems like I guess I
wouldn't really care that much like okay
go you know whatever you know do
whatever you want as long as you don't
bother people too much but unfortunately
that's not the world we're in we're in a
world where we actually do have to get
it together and we can't give up on the
idea of truth we can't divide ourselves
into mutual hate groups we can't do any
of that stuff I know there's you and I
wanted to talk about VR as well there's
so many things to talk about but um in
in the VR landscape there is a bridge I
think here where you know I think about
the current generation of VR hardware
and I was wondering what you think you
mentioned I mean the tube the two
biggest behavior modification company
empires now being Facebook and Google
clearly being neither of them were
involved right right so I mean how do
you you kind of talk about that in
dominate of everything to some degree
but I mean how does that feel right now
well there's a little bit of a comedy in
it because Google and Facebook are the
only two of the five tech giants that
really are dependent on this mass
behavior modification business plan and
they're addicted to their own business
plan so that they can't diversify their
own profit centers but they can
diversify their call center so they just
do that compulsively so Google will say
well we'll make a company for balloons
and we'll make a company to solve death
and we'll make a company from I don't
know just all these endless things right
and yes it's it's all a desperate way to
try to find some way to diversify their
profit centers and in the way the VR
investments of these two companies are
serving perhaps as a symbolic way of
them letting their investors know we
really are trying to diversify if they
really want to diversify they have to
give up their addiction to this stupid
business model and then they'll serve
their investors better so that's one
thing to say another thing to say is
well then we get into the details
there's
there's the guy who founded oculus
himself got addicted to the very stuff
we've been talking about and turned
himself into a megachurch
oh yeah yeah I hope he can grow out of
it I there are a lot of wonderful really
great brilliant people at both oculus
and the various Google Places I was tell
a story out of school maybe I will I say
you know I I do my research with
Microsoft but I'm friends with everybody
and I'm not promoting Microsoft anything
but I was I I was having a meal with a
certain very high up Google figure and
they said to me you know you keep on
introducing our VR people to each other
but we're we're trying to keep them
separate so they'll compete with each
other and but they find out about each
other through you could you stop that
like like this ridiculous anyway so I
don't know right Google is funny it's
like this giant archipelago of these
competing groups and this this my main
problem with Google these days is their
idea about controllers because so
they've been kind of behind this idea
that you have this little three degree
of freedom one button thing and to me
the greatest joy in VR isn't so much
being in a world but transforming
yourself becoming a weird avatar and
having your own interaction your own
sensory motor loop be the canvas in
which you learn about things so you
don't look at triangles you become a
triangle if you're gonna do a geometry
lesson you don't look at oh I don't know
you don't look at a lightning storm you
could become a lightning storm I've
never tried that but there's but I mean
that's really where VR comes into its
own and that's where it's distinct from
other things and so you should want more
and more of your body being measured
instead of less and less and that's see
yeah I really wish that they hadn't done
that I it's gonna take us like a decade
or two going argument where we both used
all the you know current jet headsets
weighed going way back to when oculus
was a pair of ski goggles though with a
cell phone screen shoved inside and
Scott feels like things like oculus go
and
the Google stuff you tell me you're
gonna get out exactly what Scott is more
supportive of the new disconnected phone
systems they don't tell what your tape
which I think once you try a six to get
a real full thing there's no going back
even though you feel like you're hooked
up to a sort of monster hmm well I like
where it's going with mobile but I I
it's not fully there yet untethered I
think it's such a step backwards in so
many ways yeah okay so yeah if I may
point out a gentleman
yeah the first proof of concept that you
could do an untethered system that was
totally self-sufficient where the
complete tracker was Holland's right
right so I love that and yeah but but
the other thing the hololens was the
first device intended to be a
see-through mixed reality
general-purpose device let's say and and
obviously if you're gonna add stuff to
the world you need to be able to move
around in the world where the stuff is
so having a cord is ridiculous so it
actually must be untethered there's not
a choice otherwise it just makes no
sense I think if you're gonna be in I
guess what these days I to distinguish
these things as we come more more
awkward I say classical occlusive
virtual reality sounds like too many
syllables but anyway if it's one of
these old-fashioned things or it's like
alright so I having the cable might not
be as bad although there are still
safety issues and people should at least
model where the cable is and their
software it's not that hard to keep
track of where there's somebody's draft
themselves around it or something I mean
it seems that ya know that's something
every software developer should like
really think about but I mean of course
it's also nice to have them cordless but
in a way having them cordless might make
them more of a safety hazard like you
have to really you have to think about
the whole system and they use scenarios
and make sure you're thinking about the
safety and the comfort of the person but
one thing I want to say is at the moment
where you've gotten to the point of a
6-degree geekiest this show the our guy
you know a lot of my viewers of the show
right now but I'm worried like somebody
tuned in and they're just in their book
in books they're like these are like was
like taking nonsense and I these are
like those horrible people from across
campus who made all the money stop
murders right I want to assure you that
Don of the new everything contains
sensitive literary passages that are at
least reasonably well-written with real
character development and dialogue
really ok very not bad for the guy all
right so you get to the point where
there's a headset that has a six degree
of freedom tracker that's inside out it
at that point you're sensing the
environment well enough that you're just
a hop skip and a jump from being able to
sense a lot of the body and certainly in
your hands and so for God's sakes if
you're gonna do a cordless headset don't
do one of these stupid little three
degree of freedom things dude at least
get the people's hands I mean it's
really worth that extra bit of effort
and I'm a little mystified that anyone
go to the trouble of an inside out track
or without also grabbing the hands so
just like I don't know what they're
thinking well my favorite experiences
which made me think of what you're
saying in the book and what we're not
addressing now and kind of bring it down
to the human level too I guess
well you talk a lot about haptics and
that's like the missing part of what you
do with your hands now but then also it
was interesting so much of why you cut a
virtual reality was about people that
without a consensual world between
people that it's then it's just an
experience and there are so few of those
I mean one I tried it and they most
people can't try this I get a Tribeca
they had this one with a theater piece
of live artists where I wore you know it
was like a hand scanning leap motion it
was called Jack part one and there were
live actors and we were yeah so his face
yeah it was one of the most exciting
things because you don't get that that
often we'll see I just think it was kind
of thumbing its nose at traditional
entertainment economics an interesting
way because the big problem with VR
venues has always been the proportion of
workers you have to pay versus person
paying ticket so as I described in the
book in the way back in the 80s they
tried to build
our venue with Steven Spielberg normal
for Minority Report you know and it was
very very hard to do because you have
not only expensive the equipment of the
day these days the equipment is cheap
but you have to pay people like the
question is like in a movie theater you
have maybe four or five people working
and you can have like a hundreds of
people in there so the ratio is
favorable so in this case there were
like five or six people working just for
one person to have an experience it's
just like great and so every people who
didn't see it there's like somebody
around with the fan to blow the window
and yeah and somebody stopping down the
floor to give you some haptics but
there's like this whole performance it's
a whole like personal person is amazing
so the person gets a personalized
improvised experience but it's
economically yeah the least viable thing
ever
specially I'm like yeah it's like it's
it's a conceptual art piece about anti
economics and which is great I'm glad
they did it that it's like not gonna
happen a lot you know there are some
people doing I think interesting
multi-person virtual world design right
now I mentioned a couple on the sort of
more articulate small numbers of people
at a time Chris milks work is getting
really interested it's great and there's
so many people this is okay can I can I
rant about something else yeah yeah so
let's say right let's say you find
yourself helping a friend who's
non-technical get their VR set up at
home to work right some of us have found
ourselves to this position we always say
you need a VR caddy yeah okay so you
install this thing and then they're like
don't hit that button because that'll
send you to the steam store oh no don't
hit that button cuz that'll send you to
the Windows house oh don't hit that
button because that'll send you to the
well here's the thing once you get into
the multi person the the the large
numbers of multi people worlds there's
like seven or eight of them competing
now and by the time you're in there
there's like eight object buttons to get
to different clubs levels and so
basically the the chances of anybody not
objecting themselves you know become so
oh no I'm out of it I said okay which
house on a mountain
well they all look the same okay do you
see a city in the background no alright
then do you I mean it's it's like really
fun to find it so it's so ridiculous so
there has to simpie realist once to grab
your checked button to send you back to
their hub it's really making the user
experience like harder and harder and
it's it's my bizarre and absurd so but
for the moment there's going to be this
giant like hub warfare people trying to
and yeah and the thing is look without
without let me just say they all suck so
that way I can be really fair to
everybody
yeah there's no hub that's worth it
right now alright none of them are that
great so we've got to figure out some
way out of this it's just like this
ridiculous problem but um they're all
kind of striving for it now like I don't
play with oculus venues they're all
trying to like people together yeah so
there's there's a bunch of them and I
have like the real fondness for a lot of
them we have women we got one at
Microsoft that started outside that we
acquired called the alt space really
sweet pea a really lovely fill row so I
worked on I worked with him on Second
Life years ago and he has high fidelity
now and he's really I mean they're just
really devoted people and I just did a
thing with sign space and they're super
devoted people like they're all these
people doing these wonderful there's a
bunch of them you know and I don't know
what we can do about that because what
if network effects really come into play
you know somebody will get will grab
this thing obviously Facebook would like
it most of all Google would love it but
anyway I kind of hope it'll be one of
the little Indies he gets it somehow but
then they'll get all sucky after that so
my favorite hub experience is the
inception hub are going to the Microsoft
cliff house and then going into the
steam bridge app from there you have to
click on my steam is up on the wall my
cliff house I got to go in there and
then get to my Steam games through there
cliff house yeah well for my for my
Windows headset I looked but you know
it's it's not the fault of any one of
the companies it's just like this in
giant this is exactly this is what
packet-switching was like before Al Gore
came along this was this was before the
internet there was like all these
different things and there were like
these awkward bridges and so
and if we wait steam could almost do it
because their your Linux and Windows and
Mac and oculus and v and other VR
platforms except they can't stop letting
people making school shoot-'em-up games
on their platform hmm yeah well there's
there's a number of platforms within
platforms on Steam in fact it's almost
impossible it's really your don't even
get warnings like you think you're
downloading a single game you've
actually entered somebody's platform who
wants a new ID for you and everything
and it happens all the time actually
that that brings up a kind of
interesting speculation whether there
could be a new Al Gore like figure who
comes along and says to the VR all right
we're gonna throw some government money
at you fix this or make this
interoperable this is stupid
hey this is how Trump could cement his
legacy the only yeah turn throw throw a
bunch of money and all those other
people would say okay interoperate you
bones like fix this because it Gore
succeeded at it why not
[Laughter]
well the art doesn't even need to be
like you just think about other things
as they got leave it doesn't even need
evolve a headset like it I think that
was only thing your book was bringing up
a lot of times and terms that whole
spectrum that VR is encapsulated so many
different things from large-scale to
small and then the ha and then the
Kinect is basically a type of a VR
experience in some ways I think I think
about VR right now everybody thinks
about the headset yeah and to some
degree expanding the definition of what
it means to be making this type of thing
loosening up a little bit getting people
listen what's locked into that well I
mean I'm really open-minded about myself
about it myself I like whatever works
the headset does have a kind of an
iconic appeal cuz like the thing I kind
of like the headset in almost the
opposite way than most people do like
the usual tech industry approaches let's
make it as small as possible so it looks
like glasses and I feel like it's a that
doesn't work because then other people
just feel like you're being sneaky why
this person is looking at me with
instrumented glasses what do they think
they're superior to me what are they to
but it would advantage are they trying
to get for themselves I don't think it
works no effect fly solo I'm getting
Valli glass all well we've seen we've
seen two experiments so far which is
Google's glass and then snaps spectacles
and both of them came to about the same
point now that doesn't mean that the
third one won't work but I I tend to
think three's a pattern so we only have
two so far that have been significant so
let's see if somebody can fix it on the
third time but if the third one also
fails that's treated as a pattern how
about that but anyway um I prefer to go
in the other extreme I want to say I
have this big thing on my head I am
proud of it it's like my Samurai helmet
I think it's great and I want to make I
want to protect on the outside like one
of the things a prototype I feel it's
not economical to sell it yet but it has
a multi-view display so from the outside
depending on the angle you're looking
you'd see my avatar making expression so
it becomes a dynamic mask an expressive
dynamic mask so it's for the benefit of
other people in the room not for me but
I think that that's like you should
advertise like I am gonna make the
biggest most elaborate most amazing
thing and I'm gonna stick it on my head
thank for out of it and I think that
that's the way to go and I like these
little sleek things III don't I don't
buy it I think emotionally it's
completely misguided that doesn't mean
I'm going to talk anybody into this soon
but that's that's why I'm like that's
why I'm for you do you think that means
like smart glasses in the whole world of
like walking in a mixed reality world in
your everyday life is that like
something that's problematic or do you
think that's like something is it
related to that like every day is a
session so to me yeah like let's say you
had a sort of a fairly large visor so
you have some air space you can talk
normally everybody can see that you're
in so there's there's there's a
fundamental question of honesty and
disclosure there's no there's no sense
in which you're faking and they can see
what avatar you are in the event you're
in avatar within mixed reality and they
can maybe they can see reflections of
what you're seeing so that it's not
entirely private I'm you have to think
what the power relations between people
people are social creatures who are very
very sensitive to that so if you have
something on your head that from your
perspective is giving you some advantage
and it's private from
else's perspective it's this power play
that's sneaky and I think like the
question is do you really want that does
giving that impression actually achieve
anything for you and I think the
answer's no I think it's stupid I don't
think there's any reason to do that I
don't think it's there might be some
specialized situations where you want it
heads-up displays can be great for
surgeons or whatever but when social
interactions I think it's stupid the
reason to do it is for beauty and to
have new things to share so why not
share like don't don't have sneaky
things have it be really open really
upfront really honest and then you can
do new virtual sports together a dancer
to make music together in the space
between your whatever it is but it's on
honest mutual terms of equality and and
trust fine you do all that I'll get his
wave cheaters of monsters running at you
one at a time
well the 20 years you know I'm kind of
optimistic about things like i but i
think the only way to be an optimist is
to sort of be pessimistic tactically and
then you can be optimistic strategically
so you have to be kind of a critic in
the short term and really push and push
and criticize and criticize and then
things actually get better so overall I
think we can we are really can turn into
a beautiful thing but in the near term
you know we have to be critical about it
you know yes it's like you mentioned
that and I think I think was the newest
book about like it were wrong Dan we're
all seeing different private worlds and
are accused to one another become
meaningless which makes me think about
we were mentioning there about like not
being sneaky yet between data and VR and
worlds like building a bridge to
communication versus you know I think
that the challenge now is you're getting
to a point where it's it seems like the
RNA are pushing more towards everybody
having their own experience versus a
communal yeah yeah well you can have
your own experience but it shouldn't be
hidden from other people so in other
words yeah if there I lik let's just say
hypothetically there's some weird flying
lion angel thing that's like hovering
and does whatever maybe nobody else is
interested in that maybe it's just for
you maybe it's
of it but other people should see that
you have it so they can understand you
see there's a difference between private
and hidden right so I I don't know I
mean like my shirt is private I don't
really want you touching my shirt right
now without you know said in friendship
all right but but it's not hidden like I
is it's just it's or you shouldn't drink
my drink or whatever you know
like you can have private things that
aren't hidden and and I think this this
hidden thing comes from the history of
computer science where we needed to have
protected areas of memories of programs
wouldn't crash so easily we need to have
security and secure directories and our
file systems and all that kind of stuff
and so now we're trying to apply it to
society it's stupid as a way to think
about people though I concern the
concern this brings up to me is do we
get to the point where for all having an
AR experience all the time that we
customize is that the ultimate
subjectivity of truth now Mimi we may
watch a certain news channel because it
tells us the news you want to see and
you're watching a different news channel
you get something different what if
we're all seeing what we want to see
just in the world does that drive is
Friday
well as I say in the book VR potentially
could be the creepiest technology of all
time
so if you blank out people I don't want
to see walking down spectra nation I see
is exactly that's a great danger yeah
and we're lucky we have a chance to try
to fix this stuff in the era of smart
phones and smart speakers before we get
to VR or some kind of direct brain thing
or whatever there whatever there might
be the current devices are pretty
created and this is the time when we
should work out these power
relationships and how a society can work
with them I I mean the the theme of dawn
of the new everything is more or less
this dual nature of technology that it
can do all these wonderful creative
sweet things then it can also be so
degrading and so manipulative and so
dark and so dangerous and this those
things are equally true and and this
question of what makes something go one
way or the other way is is the deepest
question of our times as the
technological species we have to learn
how we bring out the best of ourselves
in our tech as we get more and more
powerful and I was saying before you
know I used to think it was all about
rhetoric that's why I was bugging
William Gibson to make Neuromancer more
positive which is one of the more silly
things I've ever done in my life but it
was young but but the I've come to think
that what really makes the most
difference is economics and in economic
incentives that ultimately they seem to
drive things more than rules and laws
and traditions and rhetoric and all this
stuff and so if we have economic
incentives that reward people more more
for things that are non-creepy than for
things that are you know then maybe
we'll have a less creepy world and right
now by definition the only thing that's
rewarded is the creepy stuff you know
that that's it's just a bizarre thing
like you look at the money that a
company like Google makes and almost all
of it is from somebody being convinced
that they paid money in order to change
somebody else's behavior in a way that
the person wasn't fully aware of but
they got some kind of advantage where
they're able to sneakily get at people
it's a bizarre bizarre bizarre system
and it can't scale I mean you might
think it's big but it's not as big as it
could be if we'd like to direct brain
links and we're like a civilization
that's just based on people trying to
trick each other it's no civilization at
all you know information awareness yeah
I still worried that people are gonna
keep doing it that's my that's my
biggest yeah that's my ongoing as we
neared worst cause I want to make a
quick point that combines VR and social
media yeah thank you
yeah late was it no I guess it was
earlier this year I wrote a story on
scene it's just about some of my
concerns and feedback about the current
generation of VR just this is not the
generation of hardware that's gonna
manage great but basically even though
I'm a big fan and I like this and I like
that I got a lot of vert rollick
responses which I fully expected but my
favorite was from someone pretending to
be you on Twitter who sent me a nasty
note with you and your picture and a
link to your website and their Twitter
bio so there you go I was trolled by
your by your fake Twitter doppelganger
yeah so this is a kind of interesting
problem so I there's a bunch of fake
Me's including one called real jaron
lanier
there's a bunch of fake means on
Facebook there's a bunch of fake means
on reddit and whatever and the problem
is that the companies don't let you
complain about them unless you join and
I don't want to join any of these things
I think there's terrible schemes I
really don't want to join Twitter that
was their question I like people you
know do you know I hear about these
stories from people like you okay
sometimes my students will tell me all
these funny things
my daughter checks them out - she's 11
and she said one of she told me that one
of the jaron lanier Simon I forget which
service there might have might have been
when I'm Instagram or something is
giving people relationship and breakup
advice okay I was like okay I got
knocked by Karen and real Palmer Luckey
on Twitter like I've accomplished
something yeah yeah you know yeah well
I'm not sure how real Palmer Luckey
spell lightly but that's another story
we should check in on him in ten years
and see where he's gotten - yes
but yeah so I asked her if the advice
was any good and she said not really and
I kind of trust her on that so I end to
think that probably it's not worth
listening to any of the fake jaron
lanier is out on social media it's
interesting like a certain major media
organization wanted to do something on
Facebook live and I mentioned to them
that there could be fake Me's that they
you know that would participate and
their lawyer looked into and they
decided they couldn't do it on their
missus and so it's a it's what it's an
example of how creepy things are that
like it's not just I this is part of
what I feel like this whole business
plan which I call the bummer business
plan down Labette yeah behaviors of
users modified and made available for
rent or something like that I one of the
problems with it is it becomes like a
protection racket but it's an
existential one like you pay us or
nobody will be able to hear you or know
you and that's a kind of an ugly
business model but that is kind of
what's happening so it's like now either
join facebook or we'll try you out with
fake versions of yourself and you know
it's it's not ethical
it's a it's Kafkaesque in and bizarre
and ugly
and but you're given no option or gone
on Facebook do you really exist that's
the next book well I mean the way you
kill things these days is with denial of
service attack so if somebody wanted to
kill my website which is not good enough
for anybody to give a about oh
pardon my language today you can alright
anyway we're looking at red if you've
listened this long you can add the
laughs yeah okay but anyway if somebody
wanted to kill my website instead of
hacking if they do denial of service
right they get their botnet to to
bombard it and but the same things
happening culturally like if somebody
want if somebody wants to kill speech
now they just create a whole bunch of
bots that are similar but different and
create this storm of garbage and then
they disrupt the speech and that's
approximately was what was done to say
Hillary Clinton's campaign and and I got
to say I this isn't a partisan thing I
think I think we could just as easily
have had the first social media attic
president coming from the left and I
think would be just as bad I don't think
it's a left-right thing if you want to
feel you can read ten arguments for
deleting your social media accounts
right now but if you want to feel better
you can read on of the new every that's
right yeah we you know a lot of your
life and and it's something that VR it's
about our today and if you go back and
forth between them you can give yourself
positive and negative stimuli in order
to control your own Skinner box by your
behavior thank you so much thanks a lot
