generation of wireless networks which
promise speeds that are 10 to 100 times
faster than our current LTE connected
phones I paid a visit to the sprawling
Verizon campus in Basking Ridge New
Jersey where I got an exclusive look at
one of the world's first fuel trials
with a 5g network so standing here by
Verizon 5g base station now this big
clunky thing is going to shrink down
it's gonna be much smaller when it goes
to a market and I'll be on rooftops
they'll be on City lamps the idea this
thing will broadcast 5g signals
that's internet speeds that are 300
times faster than what you're getting at
home the test was little more than a
base station in two receivers the first
was mounted on a van to demonstrate its
ability to grab a signal to go while the
second receiver was placed in another
part of the building to show how well
the coverage is indoors and truth there
wasn't much to look at but it's the
implications for this test they're
fascinating so we're standing by
Verizon's 5g phone well no not exactly a
phone it's really a van with a giant
antenna on top of it this is mostly an
approximation of what your phone and
supposed to look like they've taken us
on tours around the block demonstrating
what 5g speeds are going to look like
again they're 300 to 400 times faster
than what you'd get at home and this is
on the road
well the van circled around the parking
lot picked up the signal going at 3.77
gigabits per second that's 377 times
faster than the average LTE connection
on your phone and more than three and a
half times faster than your fastest home
broadband service 5g could replace your
home cable internet line you can stream
ultra high-definition video to your
phone tank all of your mobile devices
without even a stutter it's all great
but there are still plenty of
complications that's why most industry
folks don't believe you'll actually see
widespread 5g service until 2020 Verizon
is hoping to beat the clock it promised
some form of commercial deployment by
that ship</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
