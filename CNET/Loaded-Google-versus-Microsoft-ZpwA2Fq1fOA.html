del Conte and you're getting loaded
before we get to the headlines I want to
talk a little about the show that you're
watching loaded is a daily news show but
it will also be more than that we chose
the name loaded not just because it
sounds cool but also because we want to
convey the fact that it will be loaded
with information we're pulling from the
various resources here at cnet to bring
you news background in depth look at
various issues or also pounding the
pavement here in New York to really go
out and see how technology is at work in
the real world thank you for tuning in
to the first show I hope you find
yourself sufficiently loaded in the next
few minutes now to the news google and
microsoft executives were not watching
the Super Bowl on Sunday they were too
busy issuing nasty statements about the
proposed Microsoft Yahoo merger on
sunday afternoon Google's chief legal
officer David Drummond issued a terse
statement saying that the merger is
troubling he says that Microsoft will
inhibit Yahoo's open web economy and
that a combination of the two companies
would unfairly monopolize the web
newscom Cena freed says that this is the
pot calling the kettle black and I agree
although I do think it's reasonable for
Google to question Microsoft's
intentions in terms of proprietary
products Microsoft's lawyer Brad Smith
shot a statement back which was equally
terse saying that Microsoft is committed
to openness and points out that both
Yahoo and Microsoft combined don't even
have the traffic that Google does so the
gloves are off now the Wall Street
Journal is reporting that google CEO
eric schmidt has reached out to yahoo
CEO jerry yang to offer any help in
getting rid of Microsoft how very
touching I have a feeling Yahoo will
play the shy bride a bit longer while it
weighs all options meanwhile pull up a
chair and be prepared to watch a
Microsoft Google fight they should pay
per view this one this all seems like a
lot of hullabaloo for a merger that we
can't even be sure will actually happen
but assuming it does how will this
change our online lives news coms kara
tsuboi has the story friday morning's
announcement of Microsoft's 45 billion
dollar bid for Yahoo with all anyone in
Silicon Valley could talk about one
concern is the overlapping services
the company's offer just to give an
example you have msn autos and yahoo
autos to really profitable places for
them because a lots of people come to
their lots of advertisers if they merge
those things together what happens is
that one plus one equals two is it a
three or is it actually going backwards
and a week a congressional task force
will review the merger and then from
there it's almost guaranteed to be a
long slow drawn-out process until any
sort of outcome is reached Kara Tsuboi
cnet.com for Cara's full story go to
news com if you missed any part of the
Super Bowl you can relive the best part
of it the commercials of course through
myspace the company has a profile page
for superbowl ads that was created in
collaboration with fox you can find it
at myspace.com / superbowl ads and
you'll see the commercials they are
parsed out by quarter my favorite one so
far is the talking babies for etrade a
lot of people are like aren't you too
young to invest in the markets and you
know a don't worry about it you know I
just look young yal is staying out of
the Microsoft Yahoo business the company
is keeping its eyes on its own paper
with an acquisition of its own it's
reported that AOL is buying GUI which is
a web based operating system and widget
company techCrunch reports that AOL
wants the company more for the widgets
then for the OS however so that they can
better integrate widgets into their
advertising platform details of the deal
have not been announced as of presstime
bad news for the ladies of tech a survey
from dice.com indicates that women and
technology jobs make twelve percent less
than their male counterparts dice found
that salaries for men increased by 2.4%
in 2007 while salaries for women stayed
flat I once read a study that said most
women don't negotiate their salaries
which accounts for up to ten billion
dollars per year just left on the table
here in the US so gals time to march
into your boss's office and ask for a
raise thanks for watching our first show
will be back tomorrow with a report from
the greener gadgets conference I'm
Natali del Conte from cnet TV and you
