Thrive was a solid device but it's bulky
design made it larger and heavier than
competing tablets the company's new line
of excite tablets or anything but bulky
at point three five inches thick the
Excite 10 is almost half the depth of
the Thrive and it packs a quad-core
processor a gig of ram and a full sized
SD card slot
how did toshiba pack better hardware
into a tablet that's almost half as
thick let's find out I'm Bill Detweiler
and I'm going to crack open the Toshiba
Excite 10 Toshiba Thrive was a very
laptop like tablet with its user
replaceable battery full size HDMI and
USB ports and SD card slot while this
design made the tablet easy to work on
it also risk making it too big and heavy
for some users at point three five
inches thick and weighing just over 1.3
pounds the Excite 10 is a razor blade
compared to the Thrive and luckily it's
not that much more difficult to crack
open using a combination of metal and
plastic tools I pop the back cover loose
from the front panel assembly and lifted
it off taking care to disconnect the
speaker cable in the process now that I
was inside the differences between the
Thrive and the Excite 10 were clearly
visible for starters the new tablets
battery isn't really designed to be user
replaceable and this eliminates the need
for a removable back cover which the
Thrive had also the excites flexible
battery is thinner than the thrives hard
shell unit second with the exception of
the speakers all the excites internal
hardware is mounted to the front panel
assembly much of the thrives Hardware
was mounted to a separate and rather
thick internal frame in fact nearly all
the excites internal plastic structures
are thinner than the thrives third the
excite tens display and front panel are
permanently joined this makes it
impossible to replace one without
replacing the other but it eliminates
the need for the lar
mounting plate which held the thrives
display in place
lastly the excites overall hardware
layout and internal design is just more
like a tablet and less like a laptop
gone is the separate Wi-Fi card gone is
the removable storage chip and gone are
the full size HDMI and USB ports but
what you lose in full-size ports and
replaceable components you gain in a
thinner lighter and for most tablet
buyers better tablet experience
especially when you consider the Excite
10 has a quad-core Tegra 3 processor and
a gig of ddr3 RAM now to see more tear
