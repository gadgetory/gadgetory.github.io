show that covers everything related to
alphabet Inc alphabet happens to own all
kinds of companies including Google
jigsaw flan Joe and verily one of those
is made up I'll let you figure out which
one I'm your guide I as actor and you
are the incredible audience today we're
talking about dual booting Chromebooks
5g phones the pixel three XL leaks again
and more but first up let's talk about
Google tracking you let's head on over
to the gardens of Google The Associated
Press conducted an investigation and
found that that Google is tracking your
location data even if you've turned
location history off this location
tracking would happen on both Android
and iOS devices the AP was smart
they even had researchers at Princeton
confirm what it had found out yep Google
is tracking even with the privacy
setting on so what happens when you turn
location history off Google will not add
where you went to your Google Maps
timeline so what's being tracked and
when whether or not you have location
history on or off the AP says quote some
Google apps automatically store
time-stamped location data without
asking end quote the AP points to Google
Maps storing a location when you open
the app and weather updates on Android
tracking where you are to completely
turn off all location tracking you'll
have to turn off web and app activity
where is that I had to do Google search
it's at this URL my account google.com
slash activity controls in a support
page Google clarified about what the
location history setting does the
setting does not affect other location
services on your device like Google
location services and find my device the
AP noted that page used to say with
location history off the places you go
are no longer stored to the chrome-dome
xda-developers has published another
report saying Windows 10 dual booting
it's coming to some Chromebooks this
time they say it's codenamed a campfire
and it would be like apples boot camp on
top of that multiple Chromebooks will
get this ability not just the pixel book
we may see the function in action as
soon as Google's October pixel event
we're going to head on over to Android
Avenue full line this is no rumor
Samsung head of mobile DJ Koh said that
the Galaxy S 10 will not be its first 5g
phone instead that honor will go to
another Samsung phone Kony is still
gunning to introduced the world's first
foldable phone to 5g wireless should be
rolling out next year Sprint and LG have
announced they will introduce a 5g phone
in the first half of next year Sprint +
LG you know that adds up to no
excitement whatsoever
Google revised Google fit the new fit
app will now track your movements and
heart points move minutes cover small
changes to your health heart points
tracks your activities fit will use your
watch or phones who automatically detect
your actions the new fit comes to where
OS and Android this week pixels are the
first devices to get Android updates and
that's not always a good thing
owners of the original pixel and pixel
XL found out that the PI upgrade
disabled their phones ability to fast
charge Google told CNN it's working to
fix the problem guess what the pixel
three XL seems to have leaked again yes
it happens all the time at this point
mobile syrup published a picture of what
looks like the pixel 3 XL in the wild
guess what it still has that ridiculous
notch on the top and a big old chin
Motorola has decided to introduce the
iPhone 10 I mean the Motorola P 30 look
at this thing
for some reason Motorola didn't put an
Apple logo on the back you done screwed
up moto
I know Omar will be happy because we're
covering the Nexus player over on the
XDA Developers forum people are
reporting that their Nexus players are
dying now why is that that's really
unclear factory reset are not working
for some one floor member said they had
to flash they stock android from the
developer site to get the player to work
again the player was introduced in 2014
and Google stopped directly someone the
Nexus player in 2016 to YouTube Union
YouTube removed an ad for the horror
movie than none
the six-second dad would play before
other videos apparently the video will
show a volume setting increase and then
lowering completely that's when the nun
would show up and start screaming
YouTube said the ad violated its
shocking content policy and that's why I
removed it time to head on over to the
newly named way my way
earlier this month Morgan Stanley said
that alphabets way mo could be worth one
hundred and seventy five billion dollars
one of its analysts said that way Mo's
autonomous taxi business could be worth
around 75 billion on its own it's not
too shabby onward to comment Cove this
is the part of the show where we point a
spotlight at the greatest audience in
the world you see ballin says Google
lost me at 4 gigabytes no flagship
devices shipped with 4 gigabytes when
even the mid rangers have more now the 1
plus 6 has 8 gigabytes ffs Mahesh writes
the pixel does not have a headphone jack
that's a bummer Google should learn from
Samsung and keep it prove the rumors
false also keep the price ahem under
$9.99 no we don't want a phone that
costs a grand
