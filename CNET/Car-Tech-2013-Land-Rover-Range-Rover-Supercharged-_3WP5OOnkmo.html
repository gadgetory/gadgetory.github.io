the ultimate go anywhere do anything
vehicle I mean there aren't many places
on dry land that you can't get in a
Range Rover with a little bit of
patience and a lot of preparation but
it's also a very refined vehicle on the
inside that you can spray down at the
end of a day of off-roading and valet
park at the finest restaurant without
the need to be embarrassed
now this 2013 model takes a step closer
towards refinement by moving from a
truck based body-on-frame to a monocot
unibody that's more car-like
but in the process hasn't lost any of
that off street cred
I'm an squattin Goodwin let's take a
look at this 2013 Land Rover Range Rover
supercharged and try to find out
now upfront here we've got new
headlights that are more range rover
evoque and fire and they wrap around and
in the middle more closely integrate
with the front grille I like that
generally speaking though the
proportions and lines of the vehicle are
still classic Range Rover you'll
definitely know that this is a rover
when you see it going down the street
you've got the classic front overhangs
that are very short out back we've got a
little bit of a longer overhang to make
room for your space here in the back but
you'll see the angle here is very steep
because you still get those very good
approach and departure angles when you
actually want to take this thing off
roads now underneath this clamshell hood
we've got a five litre aluminium block
v8 engine now by building the engine out
of aluminum you save weight which is
good because in the vehicle of this size
every pound matters now on top of that
engine we've got a supercharger that's
for feeding it air through two intakes
power is outputted at about 510
horsepower 461 pound-feet of torque
that's nothing that's enough you know
that it was interesting here is that if
you look closely you can see also that
we've got some of the pneumatic lines
for the adaptive air suspension you've
got the left rear the left front the
right rear the right front everything is
kind of compact and run off of the
engine so when you raise and lower the
height of the vehicle which we'll get to
in a second you don't actually need a
separate compressor now the EPA
estimates that you'll get about 15 miles
per gallon over a combined cycle and
sideo highway
I actually got 15.1 which now looks
pretty good
now power from that v8 engines gonna
come through an 8-speed automatic
transmission that you'll control with
this knob right here it's the shift knob
and it's interesting because it is
actually a knob that you twist it rises
up out of the center console when you
power the vehicle up this is pretty much
part spin Jaguar Land Rover stuff but I
really like it you've also got paddle
shifters here on the back of the
steering wheel and it's interesting
because with the menu here on the
dashboard you can disable them when
you're in the regular drive mode and
don't want to be shifting around that's
going to keep you from accidentally down
shifting when you kind of just want to
you know get around a parking structure
I like that ability a little bit further
down the center console we have all the
controls for Land Rover's Terrain
Response 2 system even automatic mode
that pretty much handles and evaluates
the road as you drive along and does all
the shifting of power between front and
rear left and right on its own when
things get a little rocky or a little
muddy you can hit that Auto button it'll
pop up into a knob and from here you
have the ability to select programs for
different types of terrain
you've got gravel and snow you've got
rutted roads you've got sand you've also
got rock climbing you put it in any of
those modes and the LCD screen will tell
you everything that you need to know
about what kind of terrain you're on
it'll also give you on-screen prompts of
as far as any other settings that you
may have to make that it can't
automatically make additionally our
vehicle is equipped with a air
suspension system with four different
levels of height adjustment the standard
adjustment is which are going to drive
around town in there's also an access
mode that'll actually lower the vehicle
down closer to the ground makes it
easier to get into and out of and keeps
you from scraping your roof when you go
through parking structures there are
also two off-road levels that will raise
it up above the standard ride height for
a little bit more ground clearance now
in the dashboard we've got the hard
drive based navigation system this too
is also kind of parts bin Jaguar Land
Rover it's pretty good not my favorite
system in the world
the graphics are good but the way the
menus are set up a lot of the features
that you would want to access on a daily
basis such as searching for a
destination searching for a gas station
these things are hidden
under multiple levels of menus what's
not standard is our 19 speaker 825 watt
Meridian surround sound stereo this is
actually a pretty good system and I
think it's worth the cost of entry
you've also got a number of cameras on
our vehicle which is equipped with the
vision package that gives you a on the
front of the vehicle a front facing
camera that gives you 90 degree views in
either direction from the front bumper
which is good for when you're nosing out
of a blind alley the problem with this
system though is you've also got other
cameras that are hidden under a menu
you've got these sort of side curb
cameras that kind of function like Neath
on an infinitive bird's-eye view camera
but you can't actually get to them
unless you dive into a menu so our
vehicle is also equipped with a comfort
package that's going to add heated and
cooled feet to the front row it's going
to give you a three zone climate control
and it's also going to add a massage
function you can hop into a menu and
then you've got to dive into another
menu where you control intensity and you
can set timers into different programs
but it's a lot of button pressing on the
screen when you should actually be
driving now you may be tempted to enact
a no food or drink from the car rule
this is that nice of an interior but you
may want to make an allowance for drinks
so you can take advantage of the
refrigerator in the center console
the Range Rover supercharged is at home
on the road but it is more at home off
of the road we're going to do a little
bit of that we're doing some grappling I
really want to call this off-roading I
know people whose driveways are rougher
than this now again as I said the
terrain management system its second
generation and it's pretty much right
now analyzing the ground below me so as
like one wheel gets a little bit of slip
one wheel kind of dips down into a rut
it's constantly analyzing the road
beneath me in order to give me the best
available grip without me having to do a
lot of fiddling around with different
drive modes now terrain or the situation
or anything it's too precarious I can
actually select those individual drive
modes to kind of get it sort of a preset
of what it should expect to do so there
is a lot to like about this vehicles
off-road capabilities it just handles
everything with stride and it handles
all of these things again in its
automatic mode now if I really wanted to
kind of climb up a mountain or scramble
up a gravelly Hill okay I actually still
have those uh the the low transfer mode
I can lots of differential I can do a
lot of different things in order to kind
of increase that but I think all the
offered survivability of this vehicle
and all of that is happening outside of
the vehicle while inside I'm enjoying
the massage seat the heated seating
heated surface is the air conditioning I
could be listening to the premium audio
system
I'm very isolated from everything that's
happening outside of the fact that I'm
getting kind of shaken around a little
bit but you can't really be helped now
it's a roll off of the lot in a brand
new 2013 Range Rover supercharged it's
gonna cost you about ninety nine
thousand one hundred bucks that's before
a $100.00 California emissions charge
and about eight hundred and ninety five
dollars in destinations charge now our
example here has eleven thousand dollars
worth of options added on top of that
didn't misspeak eleven thousand dollars
worth of options and that includes the
cabin comfort package that's going to
get you those heated seats the Meridian
surround sound system a variety of
upgrades including the around view
camera system and it's going to bring
you to an as-tested price of one hundred
eleven thousand one hundred and twenty
bucks now that's a lot of money
definitely can't afford one of these but
I'm gonna steal one when civilization
