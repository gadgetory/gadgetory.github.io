vacation and that means the flow of
Technology Development can once again
continue the proof well right here this
is the latest from Belkin the lynx is EA
6900 smart Wi-Fi router you know the
thing that connects your broadband
modems and prove the Internet to the
rest of the devices wirelessly and via
network cable now the e a sticky 900 is
not just another Wi-Fi router in fact is
them one of the most advanced on the
market because it come with a new Wi-Fi
chipset and is powered by a powerful 800
megahertz dual-core processor making it
very similar to the ISIS AC 68 you or
the Nepgear
our 7000 now the new router has offered
the Wi-Fi speed of up to 1.3 gigabit per
second on the 5 gigahertz frequency band
and up to 600 megabit per second on the
2.4 gigahertz frequency band of course
you need compatible client to achieve
the top speed but the rare here support
all existing Wi-Fi clients on a market
regardless of their standard the point
is is desired to be good for what you
have now and also good for what you are
going to have in the future now the e a
signal hundred look very similar to the
previous model in the EA series taking
the exact shape of an EF oh yes
exact trust me I'll prove me wrong on
the front our top rather it has one big
Y style slide and on the back it has one
LAN port and four LAN ports all of them
are gigabit and like all network ports
all of them come with their old port
light now if you don't like this light
on the back you can actually turn them
up using the rails web interface but the
other thing is you cannot turn the front
white light off I'm not sure how helpful
it is that you can turn up to the few
lights but not all of them but one thing
is for sure you cannot have a completely
dark bedroom with this router for me
it's a deal-breaker
doing we can't now to make up for that
the router also comes with two USB port
one of them we actually used to be 3.0
you can use these ports to host a
printer or a storage device such as
these purple
right here now one thing this is sick
900 is different from its sibling it now
come with a three detached bow external
antennas now in my testing this links is
6900 often leaked result on one hand at
close range it offer really fast
sustained Wi-Fi speed of up to 72 and
megabyte per second that's some 600
megabits per second on the other hand at
longer range it performance wasn't as
impressive other than that the new
router here shared the same features and
web interface at previous model you can
also you links his smart Wi-Fi cloud
features that allows you to remotely
manage your home network via a website
or a mobile app if you can make that
work within my trial the website worked
fine not so much the mobile apps
hopefully that just a temporary glitch
you know the EAC be 900 is probably the
best in the Linksys EA series of smart
Wi-Fi routers but it's not the best
among its type as with all arrows it can
get better via firmware updates but for
now as it costs up some $200 I believe
you better off opting for Ethernet gear
or the asu's
for more a lot more on this router check
out my full with Viacom and if you want
to tell me just how happy you are to see
me again well you know how to reach me
so do it though I know that you are even
if you don't that's because I'm dome low
and this has been the first look at the
Linksys EA 6900 smart Wi-Fi router for
balcony</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
