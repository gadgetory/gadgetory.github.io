here with the samsung UN 85 s9 this is
an 85 inch ultra high-definition 4k TV
the largest Samsung is coming out with
this in March so this TV is going to be
a little bit bigger than the 84 inch TVs
we've seen earlier but it does have
similar specifications one of the big
differences though is that this set has
a full array backlight around the back
which means it doesn't have the edge lit
it has full LEDs behind the back samsung
also included local dimming on this set
so those two might actually improve
picture quality a little bit beyond is
least in terms what we seen before this
set of course has 4k ultra high-def
resolution that means four times the
pixels of a standard 1080p TV on the
other hand there is no 4k content
currently available of course this TV
will upscale standard high definition to
fill that large screen and all of those
pixels as you can see this set has a
unique design Samsung calls it timeless
around the edge is a thin black bezel
and it kind of sits among a larger frame
you can actually move the set up and
down on the frame or you can even tilt
it a little bit horizontally so it's one
of the more unique designs we've seen
it's pretty cool there's actually a
little camera hidden along the top there
that camera is used for skype and also
for samsung's gesture control voice
recognitions another feature on this
television you can actually speak to the
TV like previous Samsung televisions and
there's a new touchpad remote included
on all samsung high-end smart TVs this
one's no exception you can actually talk
into the microphone on the remote itself
so all told a loaded television was even
speakers along the bezel there on the
outside so that's a quick look at
Samsung's UN 85 s9 UHD 4k television I'm
