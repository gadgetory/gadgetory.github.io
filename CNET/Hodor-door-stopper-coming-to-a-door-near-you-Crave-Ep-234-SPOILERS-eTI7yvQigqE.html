Thrones and Hodor on the Internet
well if you haven't seen the latest
episode then turn off this video now we
were all saddened by the loss of our
beloved Hodor in Game of Thrones season

door thing like you'd expect but one of
my favorite Hodor things is the Hodor

Etsy the Hodor door stopper features a
simple brown doorstop with an image of
our courageous Hodor holding the door

related Hodor news a game of Thrones fan
accidentally guessed the meaning of
corridors named way back in 2008 while
participating in an online forum about
Game of Thrones online forum user Merdan
was answering a question posted at the
top of the forum which was what does
fold or mean he responded with the
following the poor guy is just asking
someone to hold the door for him since
he's always carrying someone else around

finally snapped and now all I can say is
