they once said Hyundai couldn't make fly
I guess if it deserves a second
generation they proved them wrong here's
the new Genesis overall you're seeing a
fresher modern design to my eye
especially in the cabin things are just
kind of less gaudy and ornate on that
face do I see a touch of 2014 Mercedes
s-class
may as well copy the best overall the
car is the same length nose to tail but
they've pushed the axial line of the
wheels the wheelbase about three inches
further apart shorter overhangs should
make for a little better space inside as
well there's a revised head unit on that
touchscreen that I can't wait to get my
hands on but can't really analyze that
here at the show in terms of engines
still a 3.8 v6 and a 5 liter v8 the v8
carries over but the v6 is interesting
they've actually reduced the horsepower
substantially but increase the torque a
refreshing admission that that some
people actually drive cars not revving
them to 7000 rpm between the gears but
lumping along at 2 or 3,000 rpm all the
time like many cars at the show here
they're making extensive use of aluminum
and high-strength steel in this case not
to save weight but to have the same
weight that they had before but much
greater stiffness there's a big one for
those even live in the snow this car can
now be had with all-wheel drive not just
the rear wheels driven that's gonna open
up to a potentially much larger market
all kinds of technology gizmos have been
refreshed on this primarily in the
driver assistance area included
automatic braking adaptive cruise
head-up display lane departure and all
those things that you have to have in
this class here's an interesting one
though this is a great car to get a
muffler leak in it's got a co2 detector
that will detect levels of that gas in
the cabin if they get too high it blows
in more fresh air from outside I have no
idea why they came up with that this car
should be around 38 K or so based on the
v6 version so keeping it below that
$40,000 psychological mark we'll see in
the spring
