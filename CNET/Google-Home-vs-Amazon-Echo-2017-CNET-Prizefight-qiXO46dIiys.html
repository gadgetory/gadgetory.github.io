get down and dirty with one of the
hottest products right now the smart
speaker it's a prize fight punch-out
between the Google home and Amazon's
echo now we've waited a year for the
home to grow up a little bit so let's
get it out round one is design the
Amazon echo is $179 and brings a simple
cylinder speaker it's twice the height
of the home and it comes in black or
white it has a blue LED and a physical
volume control dial at the top it's
pretty basic and it won't turn anyone
off now the Google home is 129 and it
might look like an air freshener
actually you know what it does look like
one like this Renuzit one but it's still
a more elegant modern design with touch
controls on top and the ability to
customize it with different colored
bases is a nice touch beauty is in the
eye of the beholder always but we're
giving round one to the home next round
is personal assistant these are primary
voice assistants how smart are they now
most people are using smart speakers to
set timers adding items to a shopping
list asking for the weather and playing
music and they both do this the Google
home has a treasure trove of data with
the brains of Google behind it and it's
only getting better the home has added
support for up to six different users
with the ability to recognize different
voices and it will even customize
responses like traffic updates depending
on who's asking you know what
echo can't do that now the power of the
Google assistant brings a more context
aware system that allows you to ask
follow-up questions to the first
question the echo can do that with
weather but Google home can do it with
more types of follow-ups who plays
Katniss Everdeen Katniss Everdeen was
played by Jennifer Lawrence okay Google
what other movies is she in her movies
include silver linings playbook joy and
25 others and everyone knows cooking
with a smart speaker is one of its four
tastes the echo can find recipes through
the all recipes skill but the home takes
it to the next level with offering more
detailed true step by step instructions
from start to finish okay Google what
was that last
beat the three eggs in a separate Bowl
and measure the flour into another
separate dish now the echo counters with
device-to-device calling so it's
basically a speakerphone now while the
home can call other homes landlines or
mobile phones for free that's rad and we
cannot ignore alexis massive library of
over 10,000 skills that takes this
personal assistant to the next level
think of them as apps I can do
everything from ordering pizza or
calling in uber or even asking for sleep
sounds to help you go to bed I like
oceans or jungle nights now by the time
you watch this things might have already
changed the Google home is technically
smarter but the echo skills make it the
most versatile assistant you'll find
today Amazon takes round 2 next up is a
smart home if you've been around since
2014 you're going to make friends and
that's what the echo is done with the
most hardware partners you can find now
you can see here Google's started with
just four platforms but has been
catching up and they both have the big
boys like nest Phillips U and Logitech
Harmony now some of the echo skills add
even more smart device compatibility the
Google assistant is more flexible than
Alexa with brazing and how you word your
commands but if the smart home is your
top priority the echo can't be beat the
Amazon warrior takes round three next up
entertainment
this might not be a priority for you
right now but the smart speaker is going
to evolve even more and entertainment is
one of those places you can play audio
from any source to both the echo and the
home and treat them like a Bluetooth
speaker neither of these will blow you
away with their sound the echo sounds
good but with its size you'd expect
something more and yes you could just
buy an echo dot for 49 bucks and plug it
into a speaker which a lot of people do
now the home is smaller but it brings a
fuller and deeper sound but again you're
better off connecting them to better
sounding systems both support the
Logitech Harmony remote which is a dream
if you have a home theater system and
about 149 bucks to get started but it
can take some time for setup and
troubleshooting but what about quickly
watching or listening to something the
Google home can control any google cast
enabled speaker or any speaker that's
connected to a chromecast Audio streamer
now the home can also group multiple
speakers to play a song simultaneously
in multiple rooms of your home yeah they
got me there the echo can't do that now
you can also control your TV watch
Netflix or pull up a video on YouTube
with the chromecast video streamer that
starts at 35 bucks or a TV with
chromecast built in and you can now see
visual cues on your TV for things like
your personal calendar or weather or
YouTube selections when you're using the
home and TV at the same time Amazons
fire TV has alexa built into it but the
echo can't deal directly with the fire
TV at the moment and that's a big miss
now they both play games and tell jokes
and the echo has a lot more Easter eggs
because it's been around longer but when
it comes down to the fastest and better
yet the cheapest way to play with media
the Google home shines and takes round
four so let's break down this back and
forth battle Google scores in design
Amazon punches back as a personal
assistant and the brains for your smart
home but home comes back as the better
and tur tainer
believe it or not we're going to call
this price fight at eyes now smart
control is your priority the Amazon echo
is a no brainer
both are great personal assistants that
are only getting better but Google's
brains give it more potential in the
future and if you're a family that's
plugged into the Google ecosystem that
might be the better choice but all too
the choice always comes down to you
I'm Brian Tong thanks for watching and
we'll catch you guys next time for
another prizefight</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
