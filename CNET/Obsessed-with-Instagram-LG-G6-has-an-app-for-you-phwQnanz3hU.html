full of new features one of them is a
new camera mode called square camera and
it's designed to help improve your
Instagram photos the feature adds four
additional shooting modes they are snap
shot bridge shot guide shot and match
shot snap shot is pretty straightforward
the top half of the screen will act as a
viewfinder
while the bottom will show a preview of
the photo right after you take it this
means you no longer have to jump back
and forth between the camera app and the
photo gallery to ensure you capture a
great photo bridge shot removes the need
for a third-party app to create those
cool collage photos this mode lets you
capture four photos that are then placed
in a 2x2 grid and can be shared to your
favorite social network now the next two
are a little strange
there's guide shot which will show an
overlay of an image from your gallery
you can then use that overlay to help
capture multiple images with the same
composition
and then there's Matt shop this gives
you the option to take two images which
are then combined in a mini and sort of
playful collage LG use an example of a
dog with a person's body but we had a
lot of trouble matching different images
and it seemed more like a gimmick than a
useful feature but I did really like
snapshot and grid shot modes and I think
they could definitely come in handy for
