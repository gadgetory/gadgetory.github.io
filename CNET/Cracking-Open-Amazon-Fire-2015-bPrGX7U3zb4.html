tablet is definitely a bargain but it
looks so much like the company's
original Kindle Fire and is so cheap
that I got to thinking did Amazon just
put old hardware in a new package let's
find out I'm buildin Weiler and this is
cracking open released in 2011 for $200
Amazon's original Kindle Fire was a
moderately priced tablet with average
specs it was more of an entertainment
device and shopping portal than anything
else the new fire tablet takes this
concept to the extreme but does it at a
quarter of the cost it's dimensions are
nearly identical to the original Kindle
Fire but it weighs slightly less and has
a more rounded back cover it also has a
lot of features the older tablet didn't
have like cameras a microphone and a
micro SD card slot which is good because
like the original Kindle Fire it only
has 8 gigs of internal storage and more
than 2 of that is used for the operating
system also like the original Kindle
Fire the screen has a 1024 by 600 pixel
resolution so it's not high definition
like Amazon's Fire HD tablets and the
front panel isn't made with Gorilla
Glass so it's not as durable as many of
the other tablets on the market but this
is just what we can see from the outside
what I'm really interested in is what is
different on the inside time to crack it
open and see I cracked open the original
Kindle Fire back in 2011 and thanks to a
back cover that just popped off that
task was relatively simple
luckily cracking opened the new fires
just as easy using a guitar pick and
plastic tool I removed the back cover
which gave me access to the internal
components now both the new fire and its
older cousin share a similar hardware
layout with the speaker located at the
bottom battery in the middle and system
board at the top but that's really where
the similarities in the new fires
battery is both physically smaller and
has less capacity the fire also has a
single speaker compared to the early
tablets stereo setup the circuit board
has been redesigned to allow room for
the new cameras volume buttons and micro
SD card slot and there's also metal
shielding on the system board instead of
on the back cover the first component to
come out was the battery followed by the
2 megapixel rear facing camera after
disconnecting a few cables and removing
several screws I lifted out the system
board and speaker which is soldered to
it unlike the original Kindle Fire the
new fires front panel and display are a
single unit to remove them I would need
to heat the adhesive it holds them to
the plastic frame and pry them loose as
I don't want to risk breaking either the
LCD or the glass I decided to leave them
in place I did however remove the large
metal shield from the system board
underneath it is a 1.3 gigahertz
media tech arm cortex a7 quad core
processor an 8 gigabyte Samsung emmc
storage module and a one gig Samsung
DRAM chip so from our teardown we
basically found that the new fire has an
upgraded processor albeit a less
powerful one compared to today's
high-end tablets and the same amount of
RAM and storage is the original fire
no wonder Amazon can sell this thing for
50 bucks like its predecessor the 2015
fire is a no frills tablet designed for
browsing the web playing Amazon content
running Amazon approved apps and helping
you purchase merchandise from Amazon as
I said when I cracked open the original
fire this is really the tablets defining
characteristic it basically puts
Amazon's retail store right in your
hands which is a lot less relevant today
thanks to Amazon's mobile app but if
you're a prime subscriber who's looking
for an ultra cheap tablet like one you'd
give to the kids or to the host of a CNN
show and not worry about them breaking
it the fire is definitely worth
considering now for more information on
the fire including real world tests and
current pricing information check out
