the Apple by for everything good and bad
inside the world of Apple on to the show
and more stories point to progress on
the iphone 6 and next gen ipad air and
ipad mini now component information
website CEC b2b not to be confused with
the recent nkotbsb tour
see that clip was for all you guys who
make the girlfriends and wives watch the
show with them all right now the report
claims that apple supplier Taiwan
Semiconductor Manufacturing has provided
the first batch of touch ID fingerprint
sensors to be used in the iphone 6 ipad
air 2 and third gen ipad mini previous
reports claimed TSMC will be using the
same 8-inch fingerprint sensor process
used in the iphone 5s and it's a good
sign they're ahead of the game after the
5s launch with limited supplies due to
production issues with touch ID sensors
now it isn't a surprise they'll be
finally bringing this to the iPads but
my hope is that they use it beyond just
purchases and it could open up the
possibility for multiple user profiles
on iPads something Apple has never done
alright a new report from Mac toca para
says apple supplier pegatron has
received fifteen percent of the orders
for apple's upcoming 4.7 inch iphone 6
the report says pegatron is expected to
produce 50 million iphones this year and
will aid with the production alongside
up Foxconn now rumors still point to the
4.7 inch iphone shipping ahead of the
5.5 inch model due to display and
battery production issues and in another
story about the larger screen iphone 6
rumor site Weibo says 5.5 inch models
may also see a limited production volume
due to the high cost of quality sapphire
as display material now they estimate
the sapphire based display may cost two
hundred eighty dollars in materials
which is a huge jump compared to the
4-inch retina displays that cost roughly
forty four dollars analysts are throwing
around the idea that the Sapphire
display model might be reserved for
premium iPhone models at the higher end
like a 128 gig 5.5 inch model and who
are we kidding people will end up
wanting the Sapphire edition if it comes
to that you know it just rolls off the
tongue see try it sapphire sapphire
Gail stop that all right according to
9to5 mac apple is planning to hold what
they call an enormous iphone related
event this week in order to boost sales
beginning may 8th Apple will be
contacting upgrade eligible iPhone users
to come to their local apple store to
upgrade to a 5s or a five-seat say what
look Apple's going to try to move
through inventory and upgrade people to
a 5s or 5c when we're only three or four
months away from apple releasing a brand
new iphone friends don't let friends
upgrade their phone before a new iphone
in that's just a bad apple oh that's
just bad that's really bad all right
onto I watch news and a Reuters source
says Apple is considering a full health
and fitness services platform modeled
after its own app store now this would
allow companies to develop their own
mobile medical applications that could
tie into apples rumored biosensing
device that some people are calling the
i watch nike recently shut down their
entire Fuelband division it was my least
favorite fitness ban out of all of them
and their CEO said they will instead be
focusing on software for their nike
filled platform now creating a whole new
platform for a whole new device of this
nature would be a smart move for Apple
and let's hope they try to keep apps
around like spreadsheets that up track
your sexual performance and no it will
not be the app of the week because I
can't demo it on camera all right rumor
mills started buzzing after a suggestion
on the anonymous information sharing
platform secret that claims Apple is
planning to launch new ear pot
headphones with integrated heart rate
and blood pressure sensors that will
require the Lightning port but the claim
does have roots in previous apple patent
filings as far back as 2006 where Apple
proposed using sensors integrated into
accessories to collect physiological
data now apples concepts showed off a
clip connected to your earlobe or the
sensor adhering to your skin to monitor
pulse or oxygen levels and a more recent
filing show the sensor integrated into
the earpiece now other companies like LG
showed off their heart rate monitor
earphones at CES so this is something
that could happen and another legal
wrestling match between Samsung and
Apple
round two is finally over and a verdict
was reached rewarding Apple 119 point
six million dollars in damages
significantly less than the two billion
dollars they were seeking claiming
samsung infringed on their patents the
jury did find the samsung infringed on
apples slide to unlock feature and a few
others such as transforming text like an
email address into an actionable link
well the court also ruled apple had
infringed on some of Samsung's own
property and awarded the Korean giant
158 thousand dollars in damages the big
a was found guilty of infringing on a
samsung patent that deals with recording
and storing digital images and audio now
we have some exclusive recordings of the
conversations happening inside the
courtroom during the past month ladies
and gentlemen I would like to present
you to slide to unlock feature on the
iphone in those two cute little fishes
are aren't they so cute hey judge code
yes are you free later today maybe this
is so hard to read does that say $119 or
119 million hey fail don't those things
look like little candies mm-hmm I love
those candies um are you reading from
actual transcripts yeah these are
totally authentic man come on all right

show keep sending me your emails to the
apple bite at cnet com or tweet me at
