smartphone for those of you who loved
the s5 that aren't keen and it's plastic
design it's called the Galaxy alpha and
it's headline feature is of course it's
metal frame makes the phone feel
considerably more luxurious to hold and
the plastic galaxy s5 and it's a lot
more comfortable too and it's quite a
bit smaller it's only 4.7 inches it
borrows much of its style piece in the
s5 but the milled metal corners and
drilled speaker holes lend it an extra
touch of class it's not waterproof
though so do keep it away from the
bathtub and try not to spill your
cocktail on it the display for me is the
most disappointing part of the phone it
has a 720p resolution making it far less
sharp in the s5 or of course 2k phones
like the LG g3 a short 2k would be
overkill but I definitely like to see a
full HD screen on board as it would
definitely make icons and images look a
lot more crisp it's bright and bold at
least but for the high price you really
should expect more the phone arrives
with the latest android 4.4 point for
KitKat on board over which samsung has
slapped its usual TouchWiz interface has
some cool features like private mode and
s health which can track your heart rate
with a sensor on the back but it's very
complicated to you so may not seem to
Android newbies it's running on an
octa-core processor made up of two
quad-core chips which provides enough
power for anything you're likely to
throw at it and on the back of the phone
is a 12 megapixel camera to step down
from the 16 megapixel camera on the s5
but it still has features like live
always on HDR and 4k video shooting the
Galaxy alpha generally gets a lot of
things right with its more luxurious
metal design good camera and it's
comfortable size it's low screen
resolution is a huge disappointment
however that made worse by the phone's a
very high price if you're after a solid
all-around performer that looks and
feels good it's certainly worth a look
but there are other phones to consider
if the metal design is what you're after
I'm Andrew coil for cnet and this is the
Samsung Galaxy alpha
