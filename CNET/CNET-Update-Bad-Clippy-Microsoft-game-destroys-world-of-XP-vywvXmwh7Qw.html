out for Clippy the destroyer I'm Bridget
Carey and this is your CNET update
holy acquisition Batman Amazon purchased
the most popular comic book app
comiXology Amazon didn't say how much it
paid for it but comiXology is a big deal
in the comic world it's the go-to app to
purchase and read digital comic books
and it works with 75 publishers
worldwide it was the number one grossing
non gaming app for the past two years
last month it offered 700 Marvel comics
for free and its servers crashed because
it couldn't handle the demand it's yet
to be seen how Amazon's purchase will
mutate comixology Sony's via laptops are
hot no really I mean they're hot and
they can cause a fire if you have a
brand new vaio fit a which came out in
February of this year Sony's warning
people to unplug and stop using the
laptop because of a fire risk sony says
some of the internal non removable
battery packs made by another company
have the potential to overheat and burn
the computer casing there's no way to
get a refund or fix just yet but sony
says it's working on that in the
meantime just stop using it if you want
to be among the first people to own the
Google glass headset Google is opening
up sales of glass to anyone in the US
for one day only Tuesday April 15th the
number sold will be limited and sales
begin at 6 a.m. Pacific 9:00 a.m.
Eastern but to become a glass Explorer
in these early testing days it will cost
you fifteen hundred dollars plus tax
most of the world will probably want to
wait until there's a more finalized
version available at a lower price as
you may know Windows XP met its demise a
few days ago Microsoft will no longer
support the 12-year old system but
Microsoft decided to have a little fun
as it says goodbye to XP and to ie6 it
created a game called escape from XP as
the story goes long long ago Windows XP
rose like a phoenix from the ashes of
Windows 2000 but as newer operating
systems
along Windows XP clung to life a
pestilence on the peaceful developer
community most developers fled but one
still remains one man one hero still
supporting ie6 on XP and you must fight
the final battle to destroy it once and
for all jumping on ruins of Windows
shooting up broken zombie monitors and
flaming recycling bins that crawl
towards you with Clippy in the distance
destroying all in his path and at the
end you can blow it up with a reminder
that Microsoft will be there to help
with future developer support that's
your tech news update you can find the
link to the game along with more details

studios in New York I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
