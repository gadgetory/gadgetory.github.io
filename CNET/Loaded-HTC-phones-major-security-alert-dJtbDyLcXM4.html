get loaded owners of HTC android phones
beware there may be a security flood
that can give apps access to your
personal user information including
email addresses notifications last
network and GPS coordinates phone
numbers from your phone blog text
messages and system logs normally
Android apps only get access to
information set by user permissions but
the inclusion of an HTC system logger
left open a huge security hole HTC says
they are working on a fix for the
problem speaking of HTC they have joined
other tablet makers in reducing the
price of their tablets after the
announcement of the breakthrough price
of the Amazon Kindle Fire the 7-inch
android powered HTC Fire will now cost
just two hundred ninety-nine dollars
down from the four hundred ninety nine
dollar list price while still more
expensive than the upcoming kindle fire
the fire does support more storage and
front and rear cameras Windows Phone 7

up with websites to protect users from
malicious links on facebook for now on
