culling service that's now available for
Android and iOS in a way it's a
company's answer to Apple's FaceTime and
it works very similarly so here's what
you need to know about duo
first there's not not which gives you a
preview of who is calling by firing up
the camera on the other end of the line
if you're initiating the call you'll see
a little notice that says your video is
visible Android users can see
knock-knock regardless of whether duo is
opened or not in iOS though you'll only
see it if you're in the app otherwise
you'll just get a notification saying
someone's calling you now before you
worry about seeing anything you don't
want to see from the other line know
that you can only receive knock knocks
from people who are in your contact list
you can also block individual people
from calling you and if knock-knock
really isn't your thing you can disable
it altogether at this point you might be
wondering what makes it different than
Google's other communication platform
hangouts
well according to Google dual is
supposed to be way more specialized
whereas hangouts is cross-platform and
supports group chats and multi way video
and messaging duo does one thing and one
thing only video calls unlike hangouts
it reaches people through their phone
numbers not their emails and the best
difference between it and hangouts that
uses end-to-end encryption because duo
is more streamlined it has a very
minimalistic user interface before you
start a call you'll see icons to start a
video call and your contacts during a
call you'll see yourself and icons to
mute audio switch cameras and end the
call video from the other line fills up
your screen and that's pretty much it
