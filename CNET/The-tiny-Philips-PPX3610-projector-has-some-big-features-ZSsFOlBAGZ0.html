out at CES 2013 with the Philips PBX
3610 pico projector okay so this tiny
box of tricks will project your videos
onto a wall or ceiling any way you point
it basically it's quite price it's got
100 lumens of power if it's plugged in
and a slightly more moderate 60 lumens
if it's running on battery if you are
running this thing on its battery then
you're going to get three hours before
it dies check around the back you'll see
it's got plenty of connections it's got
USB HDMI VGA and SD card slot as well
and plenty of cables come in the box so
you've got loads of connectivity options
right off the bat it may look just like
an ordinary projector it's got a little
manual focus wheel on the top but
there's actually quite a lot going on
inside this device it's running on
Android version 3.2 bizarrely enough and
you can see on the top it's actually got
a trackpad so you can move around its
menus and it's got some built-in storage
so you can keep your videos on this
thing it's got a headphone out socket so
you can hook this up to some speakers
it's also got a Wi-Fi chip inside and a
built-in browser if you need to do a
quick spot of web browsing it looks good
and in this reasonably lit room it's
pumping out a seriously bright picture
which is definitely good news it is
expensive though it's 579 dollars which
is quite a lot to pay it's coming out in
February for more from CES 2013 check
out CNET on the west way and this is the
philips PPX 3610</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
