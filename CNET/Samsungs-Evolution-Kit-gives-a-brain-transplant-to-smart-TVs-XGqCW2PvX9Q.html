this is a 2012 Samsung LED TV with a
2013 user interface now that I've
completely blown your mind let me tell
you a little bit about samsung's smart
evolution kit that's how this magic is
accomplished the evolution kit is a
little black box you can buy today for
about 200 bucks it also includes a brand
new remote control that's a big
improvement over the 2012 version the
idea is that you graph this little box
onto the back of your compatible 2012 TV
and it upgrades it to have all of the
new 2013 Smart TV functions and features
that includes a brand new user interface
with cable box control and an on TV
recommendations engine there's also a
new web browser and the warm feeling
that your TV is no longer obsolete once
you take the kid out of the box
installation is a DIY affair you have to
pull a sticker off and from there you
can plug the kit right into a
proprietary port on the back once
installed the relatively think it
doesn't spoil the form factor these thin
TVs much although it does run pretty hot
also for using a wired connection you're
going to need to connect your Ethernet
port directly to the kit via this dongle
as opposed to into the TV as before
you'll also need to pair the new remote
with the television and go through a
setup process that involves pairing the
bluetooth dongle again and getting all
the program information from your cable
provider there might also be some
additional software upgrades to get your
2012 tv up to snuff with a 2013 kit
first thing you notice after you upgrade
the TV using the evolution kit is this
new on TV screen that includes six
currently playing programs as well as
six programs that are playing in the
near future from your current cable
provider the idea is that the system
will learn as you use it to suggest new
shows that you might like better
there is also an integrated electronic
program guide included with the system
although it's not quite as good as some
of the better program guides found on
today's DVRs there's the rub if you're a
heavy DVR user this on TV system isn't
all that great that's because the remote
control doesn't include a lot of the
direct DVR commands the most people like
to use for example play and fast-forward
you can get to those commands using a
convoluted system involving a virtual
remote on the television itself but it's
not nearly as convenient as using
buttons on your own
remote control which of course Samsung's
2012 TVs include a standard remote
control but usually a universal remote
or a DVR remote will do the job a little
bit better if you're not a heavy DVR
user however samsung system is a little
more appealing especially if your
current cable box UI is a little bit
under par in addition to that on TV
section there's four more pages in
Samsung's UI one called movies and TV
shows allows you to browse and search
for on-demand content from sources like
Netflix Vudu and a couple of the other
integrated services there's also a
dedicated page for apps a page for
social media which integrates Facebook
and Twitter as well as a page that
allows you to check out your own local
media via a USB or DLNA on the whole
it's a very organized system and I do
like the design a lot better than 2012
aside from the design however the
improvements are pretty slight compared
to the 2012 system another improvement
that comes with the evolve TVs is better
voice control you can speak into the
microphone and got a lot better
recognition of a lot of the phrases that
you're going to use to search as well as
commands that you'll give to the TV for
example volume up and down gesture
control is a little bit better than it
was last year but my arms still got
tired waving around at the TV and it's
really not all that usefulness you lose
the remote control
speaking remotes the evolution kit does
include Samsung's improved 2013 touchpad
clicker which is a huge step up from the
old 2012 model there's very few buttons
on Oh whoever so as I referred to before
you're gonna have to use a virtual
remote control to get to a lot of the
commands aside from that it's a great
remote especially if you use the browser
a lot because the touchpad comes in
really handy when navigating webpages
well it's a big upgrade for Smart TV
features the evolution kit really
doesn't do anything to improve the
picture quality and doesn't really add
much the TV aside from these additional
smart features so unless you're really
unsatisfied with the 2012 Smart TV
features it might be worth waiting until
2014 or later to use the upgrade that's
right anybody who bought a compatible
2012 Samsung TV or even 2013 TVs that
work with evolution kits will be able to
reopen following years when Samsung
releases the 2014 and future version of
the kit I'd like to see what kind of
features those future kits introduce
but right now the 2013 upgrade is
relatively mild that's a quick look at
Samsung's 2013 evolution
