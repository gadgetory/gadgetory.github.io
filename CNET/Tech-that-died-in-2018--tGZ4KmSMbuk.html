gathered together once again in this
dark corner of the studio with some fake
flowers to say goodbye to the gadgets
and technology that we lost this year
sometimes tech just gets outdated and
phased out over time and sometimes it is
just a hot mess failure that should have
never been launched in the first place
in either case here's our memorial to
the tech that died in 2018 let's start
with yahoo messenger which met its end
in july at the hands of its new owner
Verizon don't forget Verizon not only
acquired Yahoo but it also bought AOL a
few years ago that means Verizon killed
both Yahoo Messenger and AOL Instant
Messenger so Verizon basically killed my
online childhood but in Verizon's quest
to be a new hip media company it made
this new video app called go 90 which
totally failed and shut down in July
Verizon reportedly poured 1.2 billion
dollars to make go 90 a destination for
the snapchat generation a place to find
original web series and sports and
network shows but it was overhyped with
a dumb name go 90 has gone to the app
graveyard
remember path well I thought it was dead
long ago but surprise it officially
perished October 1st this social network
started in 2010 and it got a lot of buzz
for taking on Facebook with a different
approach users could only have 50
friends at a time so is more private at
one point it was adding 1 million users
every week and it was worth half a
billion dollars it made stickers popular
in chat and as you would expect
Facebook copied all the things that made
it unique sending path down a dead end
it was a rough year for social media
even Nintendo had to own up to failure
when it shut down miitomo it was
Nintendo's first smartphone app with a
social twist where your Mii characters
could interact with other Me's and there
was this little game thing that earned
prizes and there really wasn't much
substance to it but it was cute it had a
big launch in 2016 with more than 10
million
people signing up in the first month but
when the charm faded miitomo how to be
put in the meat tomb oh there's no
morning the next one on the list Klout
it was a service that ranked you for how
much influence you had on social media
but the ranking system was completely
meaningless
not to mention tacky too bad it took ten
years for the service to finally admit
it didn't have enough clout to keep it
going but here's one that will break
your heart curry the home robot has gone
kaput you may remember this little fella
from CES 2017 made by Mayfield robotics
a division of Bosch it was supposed to
be this little smart assistant like an
Amazon echo speaker with a cute face and
it wiggled around your floor and it
promised to be a security camera that
map's your house and you could tell your
dog get off the couch when you weren't
home but is an Amazon echo on wheels
worth $700 no and no it is not also in
the smart home category target couldn't
make fetch happen it halted a line of
products that would have automatically
ordered refills for you the program was
called fetch there was a smart soap
dispenser and a smart toilet paper roll
holder springy thing Target conducted a
limited beta test of these Bluetooth
connected household goods as a way to
challenge Amazon but target announced in
August that the program was no more some
deaths don't get much attention because
the world just moves on with new
technology demands Apple stopped making
airport routers in the iPhone 10 the
iPhone se and the iPhone 6s Amazon
stopped offering customers free storage
to hold all their music mp3s GoPro said
it's getting out of the drone business
and stop making karma and snapchat is
still around but it stopped offering a
way to send money to friends with
snapcash but the biggest death of the
year was one of the biggest frauds in
tech history Baroness the blood testing
biotech company claimed it invented a
way to do these comprehensive blood
tests with just a single drop of blood
folks said this would change the world
and thier nose was once valued at nine
billion dollars with the CEO
Elizabeth Holmes being called the next
Steve Jobs but after a Wall Street
Journal report investigations began to
reveal how the tech was flawed and it
didn't do it was promised the company
didn't just make false claims about the
tech but also its financial performance
the CEO agreed to settle fraud charges
with the US Securities and Exchange
Commission and the company has been
dissolved good riddance and if you're
wondering what's next on the chopping
block well some deaths have already been
announced for next year very soon we're
going to have to say goodbye to google
plus at geo cities Sony is gonna stop
making the PS Vita and the iconic
Volkswagen Beetle is also being ended
next year I'm Bridget Carey and until
next time good luck surviving 2019</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
