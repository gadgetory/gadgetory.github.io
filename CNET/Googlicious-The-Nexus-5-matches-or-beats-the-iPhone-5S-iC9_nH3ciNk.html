episode ever of Google Isha's now it's
everything google that we can pack
inside of a show each week and if you're
wondering how can the Apple by guy do a
Google show well all I can say is that I
love technology and it could be from
Apple or Google or anyone I don't care
but what I do care about is innovation
yes I use an iphone and an HTC One and
yes I'll be doing both shows let's get
to the Android goodness this week and we
start off with the Galaxy Note 3 and
Galaxy gear fans you'll love hearing
news that AT&amp;amp;T has announced October
fourth as the official release date for
both products online and in-store
carriers have been taking pre-orders for
Samsung's flagship phablet third gen
note at 299 and we'll see how the market
initially reacts to the 299 Galaxy gear
as a companion SmartWatch now I would
just caution people that using the watch
and note 3 will probably fri this
specific area of your body now we had a
chance to get our hands on the
impressive note 3 so let's check it out
in cnet's first look hi guys this is
bryan bennett for cnet and right now
we're taking a first look at Samsung's
latest beast of a phone tablet hybrid
that's right my friends I'm holding in
my hands the galaxy note 3 shipping now
and hitting US carriers in force in
October 2013 it's an impressive
engineering feat considering the note 3
packs a bigger screen than its
predecessor and my what a screen it is
spanning a massive 5.7 inches across the
note 3's AMOLED display is not only big
it has an extremely sharp full HD 1080p
resolution which samsung says provides
an ultrafine 385 PPI the high contrast
display produces well saturated colors
as well with deep blacks and boasts wide
viewing angles samsung has gussied up
the note 3's design to the edges are
molded info metallic silver complete
with distinctive ridgelines another
controversial design choice is the back
plate which flaunts a fake leather motif
it's pseudo organic patterned surface
has an
almost leatherette quality to it there's
even mock stitching running around it
the upside is it resists fingerprints
and is easy for your fingers to grip the
note 3 runs Android 4.3 jelly bean
powered by a blazing two point three
gigahertz quad-core Snapdragon 800
processor backing this up is not two but
three gigabytes of RAM along with 32
gigabytes of internal storage better
still is the phones huge 3200 milliamp
battery which samsung claims will power
the device for 15 hours straight it's
removable too so you can swap in a fresh
battery if you have one handy to add
more memory the note 3 has an SD card
slot but you'll have to remove the
battery to get at it above the screen is
a 2-megapixel front-facing camera below
is a physical home button and two
capacitive android keys buttons for
power and volume sit on the right and
the left side while there's a 3.5
millimeter headphone jack up top around
back is the notes 13 megapixel camera
with LED flash the note 3's camera app
comes with the huge bucket of shooting
modes you'll find on the galaxy s4 they
range from the very useful such as HDR
burst panorama to the strange like
beauty face golf and eraser which
removes people and moving objects in the
background on the bottom lip is what
really sets the note 3 apart from other
smartphones its S Pen Stylus Samsung
made the tool more compact and has given
the note 3 slick new abilities when you
pull the S Pen out of its sheath a
little fan shaped graphic called the Air
Command appears you can also activate it
by holding the pen close to the screen
and pressing its button Air Command has
five main options action memo
scrapbooker screen write s finder and
pen window just tap a selection to
launch the feature action memo lets you
create a handwritten note then email it
save it to your contacts use it in a
text or look it up on a map swiping
upwards from the home screen on the note
3 launches the my magazine news viewer
using technology from the popular
flipboard app my magazine serves up
articles and news stories from a variety
of websites I'm Brian Bennett for cnet
and this has been a first look at the
samsung galaxy note 3
be sure to check out our full review
this feature-packed behemoth has the
biggest buzz right now it can even make
you a sandwich now I'm a fan of the
leather backing and stitching because
really it feels soft against your face
and just to make sure we know samsung
recently confirmed that the entire note
family has reached 40 million units sold
worldwide now if androids are also
eagerly awaiting the release of the
Nexus 5 and just to satisfy their
curiosity the graphics bench t-rex tests
one of the most demanding out there show
that the nexus 5 appears set to match or
even surpass the iphone 5s in graphics
performance we saw the phone leaked in
google's recent KitKat promotional video
because this guy didn't get the memo the
handset has also been leaked by FCC
approval documents and is expected to
drop in the next month or so now Google
News a cool new video from Fast Company
showcase Google's garage and their
unique approach to putting wheels on
office furniture for collaboration when
you come in you can see that you can
write on the tables you can write
through the walls and then you can
reconfigure the tables to be in any any
position that you want everything is on
wheels and that allows people to be
flexible and to be more playful in a way
that the typical space and the typical
conference from just wouldn't another
observation from the video a lot of them
were Google glass like a lot and
according to a report from geek.com
google is preparing an XE 10 update for
glass that will officially enable apps
from third-party developers to do things
like get access to the motion sensors
and create their own voice commands
through glass we're giving the user the
ability to launch the app from the ok
glass menu and if you haven't had a
chance to try them on google announced
they'll be kicking off a road trip with
google glass that will give people
around the us a chance to try them out
first hand now we've had them we're
intrigued by the amazing possibilities
Google glass has to offer so we've
created a new segment for the show
