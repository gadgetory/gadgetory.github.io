laptops in that it doesn't really look
too much like a gaming laptop its body
is thick but streamlined and there are
no crazy-looking cooling vents or extra
lid lights just the old voodoo PC logo
there are no quick launch keys for
custom profiles or utilities for
overclocking or other performance
enhancements if it weren't for the red
edges on its keys and their red
backlighting it could easily slip by as
just another nice-looking desktop
replacement it's available with a
variety of components depending on your
gaming needs and budget this one is
priced at around 1800 and is VR ready
thanks to its nvidia 1070 graphics card
but you can get it for just over $1000
with an older 965 M card
also while higher-end configs have this
excellent Ultra HD display with Nvidia
g-sync technology that helps with
tearing and input lag while playing
games you can also opt for a more
affordable full HD screen this laptop is
by no means inexpensive fully loaded but
it isn't insanely expensive either and
the 1070 keeps frame rates at playable
levels even at its full Ultra HD
resolution with settings at high the
slightly slimmer plastic body does mean
the fans are constantly blowing at full
strength though and the laptop gets a
little too hot to keep on your lap and
like most 17 inch laptops battery life
doesn't compare to a smaller more
efficient ultrabook but this omen still
managed four and a half hours of
streaming video it has a respectable
port assortment too but USBC is
noticeably absent basically the 17-inch
Omen sheds some of the frills of other
new gaming laptops put in the priority
on what's on the inside then what's on
the outside</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
