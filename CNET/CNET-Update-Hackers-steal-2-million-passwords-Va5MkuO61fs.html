passwords I'm Bridget Carey and this is
your cnet update it's time to double
check that your antivirus software is up
to date because hackers have stolen
usernames and passwords for nearly 2
million accounts including passwords
from Facebook Google Yahoo and Twitter
hackers are gathering the data using
computers infected with a virus that
records keystrokes and attract login
credentials over the past month for all
sorts of websites and services credit
for the discovery goes to cybersecurity
firm Trustwave most of the attacks were
outside of the US but to be on the safe
side you should update your antivirus
software and download any patches and
updates for your browsers if you pay
full price for a smartphone 18t will now
cut you some slack on your monthly
service bill agency is changing its
mobile share plans to lower the cost of
data for customers that rather pay in
full for phone instead of getting the
discounted subsidized price with the
two-year contract bills are also less
for those that bring in their own phone
and for those that use the monthly
installment plan both t-mobile and
Sprint already do a similar thing for
their customers but now ett is following
suit verizon is the odd one out it
offers an edge plan that lets you pay
for phone over time but it does not
lower its service charge to make it
worth it you see when you get a phone at
a discount of 200 other price you're
really paying for the six hundred dollar
phone over time with your service bill
google added a new tool that lets you
download your calendar appointments into
a zip file it's helpful if you need to
backup or export your Google Calendar
into another service like Yahoo outlook
or I Calendar Google said soon you'll
also be able to backup your gmail
looking ahead to next week Instagram is
having a press event on December twelfth
to announce something and with the
invitation the company sent this 4 inch
square block with a photo printed on it
and you can hang it on a wall a couple
of us got these and they're just random
photos so perhaps Instagram is hinting
that there will be a service where you
can print out your
photos and turn it into art if so I sure
hope the quality isn't as bad as the
ones we got the photo here is grainy but
maybe it's because of the filter used
there have been reports suggesting that
the facebook on Instagram is working on
a private messaging service so that
could also be announced at the event
that's your tech news update but you can
find more details at cnet com / update
and be sure to follow along on Twitter

York I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
