look at nikon stop rugged compact the
coolpix aw110 now rugged cameras are
plentiful these days but the more
durable you want it the price here they
get the aw110 offers a lot of protection
though at a lower cost than most of the
competition it's waterproof 259 feet and
shockproof to 6.6 feet and it's dust
proof and freezeproof it's USB and HDMI
ports and battery and SD card slot are
all sealed up behind this door which
limits entry points though it could
probably use an extra lock along with
being tough the camera has built-in gps
for geo-tagging your photos and it has
mapping and electronic compass to help
you navigate it has Wi-Fi to which
allows you to shoot and share via
android or iOS device that includes
using your device as a remote control
photo and video quality are good though
you'll probably want to stick to using
it in daylight and while shooting
performance is good to the buttons are a
bit mushy which if you're trying to
shoot quickly might get in your way
otherwise this is a very good deal if
you're looking for something that is
easy for shooting and sharing and can
take some abuse i'm josh golden and
that's a nikon coolpix aw110</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
