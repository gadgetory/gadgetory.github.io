another month another podcast another
show support for our on Sina TV I'm Jeff
Bakalar and I am Justin you this is the
show where we go one step beyond what is
that I was just listening to that
massive song oh I'm sorry madness song
this morning man you know that song like
our house yeah yeah they do that other
song that goes like one step beyond kind
of sounds like the count from sesame
street oh yeah you know I'm talking
about how it goes like one step beyond
dananana
I don't know it is no idea what I'm
talking about am I taking crazy pills I
think you're just a terrible singer no I
smell a tone-deaf listen to this all
right I'm trying to listen all I know I
don't know that I play play play play no
oh yeah there you should I just played
like the Scout part that yeah yeah yeah
alright cool well this is a great start
to our way um you know not a lot of
stuff going on this weekend but how was
your weekend it was pretty good yeah you
really do much went to a birthday party
did you know they didn't plates a mass
effect two that's like really standard
we kick that's what Richard did really
Richard I did I play mass spec to Bobby
I'm a little behind a few years behind
your video it's fine no one's perfect
number one number two I have a problem
with the amount of hours you decided to
commit to the program there I mean two
hours you ain't making any headway with
two hours brother well I have a lot of
roommates and so they're always watching
TV yeah won't you get a TV room give
your own room but I don't have a TV in
my ribs yep come on let's get the
program here I can't when you're making
fun of Richard for saying that he only
spent two hours now Richard is saying
and I wonder if people have this problem
cuz i don't want married now so it's
like sort of i guess i have similar
issues but you're saying it's a it's a
it's a i guess a of the problems that
there's too many people in your living
room area yeah lack of the time right
okay so that so if he had more time
you'd be playing more yes do you so when
you used to living roommates was that a
problem for your other roommates like
didn't I know one of your rooms was be
gamer I they're playing like we played
wii a lot yeah we as a group game so we
would never have a problem with other
people interrupting is it that is it
that other people want to watch TV or
dictate out there watching to share
common and you want to play yeah is it
ever like guys come on really you know
Banda I would I could live like I
usually just wait till there's no one in
there and then I go in it's usually them
coming to me saying we want to watch TV
everyone watch a movie Oh magic game got
picked off like that none of your
roommates are video game Watchers then
that's what I am and I've done haven't
really Jeff and I wonder if that's just
me well you're a rare breed yeah not
even that prefer to watch other people
play video yeah because they're not
people that can't watch for sure there's
a lot of people who I guess they can't
in you're in the minority with that
right III just understand how people can
just sit there and watch people play it
looks like the same reason why people
like watching professional sports if
they can do it they like to see someone
else they can do it well I'm not sure
we're ready to video game I'm not sure
we're ready to equate professional sport
we're playing with like oh I'm good at
halo yeah I know there are a lot of
people say that I can't do well I guess
yeah I don't know but I think there's
certain games like the Bioshock sand and
the UH even mass effect is I think a
decent game to watch because it's an
entertainer a cinematic arm but I'm
curious i want to know if people out
there sort of like forced but they're
you know significant others or whoever
may be friends family having to uh you
know watch another person play games
there are you that kind of person cuz I
sure is crap him not yeah I it kills me
when they go come you know take me out
to see a game like oh this is a
hands-off demo so I'm that's when I'm
like packing up I'm like okay well what
am i doing great i don't want to watch
some you know person play video game for
you know two hours only because you're
seeing them make mistakes in the game
that you not at all not at all although
that's a super frustrating sort of thing
yeah it's a call used with the jump
there it's so obvious idiot but uh I
just can't watch people play especially
when it's something that I want to get
my hands on instead fair enough alright
so that was the weekend well over the
weekend yesterday was April Fool's you
guys play any pranks on your friends or
anyone else in your life I kind of
forgot about it yeah I forgot about it
too and I just want to you know preface
this whole thing with saying I am so
grateful that this day landed on a
weekend this year okay cuz it is so
stupid I mean the the lengths i watch
that why am I not surprised that's all I
know which people go yeah to do to
create the sort of elaborate things
right it's just it's the X we we can't
we just totally blow everything out of
the water every few smart pranker you
wouldn't choose because everyone knows
everybody's expecting it to happen yeah
you know that's a fun all
like no okay what so you want to round
up some stuff that yet others let's talk
about some stuff I mean April Fool the
internet pretty much ruined April they
did they kill the internet kill that you
really really kill their internet killed
April Fool's Day yes not what I show
titled ya been yeah dang it can we go
back and change the hell yeah we can i'm
gonna do it do it see if I q got added
out that whole one step beyond cover
fine beginning though I was lame
conversation it was terrible thanks
Richard will strike that from the record
so uh google had a pretty good one this
weekend come up with some creative idea
they do and uh they did April Fools
pranks cause all of their platforms but
uh you know like we've been talking
recently more about google auto drive
cars right I like cars i drive
themselves and i think there's a story
that came out last week that i thought
was an April Fool's prank it was about a
blind man testing one of the driverless
cars and he asked to take him to a Taco
Bell and I think it did you read that
story no uh but we were actually getting
ready to talk about that a little more
in depth as well yeah but I didn't hear
this specific blind this one actually
talking about through a drive-through
and he ordered a meal how did he know
into order what it was just all he
wasn't deaf to hear no I guess so that's
what I'm saying yeah I guess it just
said like I welcome talk about right
right so uh this did so this was like in
it wasn't like a closed environment
there's like get rid of real traffic no
man yeah and it's gonna do that really
narrow thing you know so excited to work
pretty well how did it go how did it
work uh so anyway the prank of involving
Google driverless cars they claim that
they started a partnership with NASCAR
to sponsor their own self driving Google
racing circuit oh my god uh so where
there was like a video that came out
that was hosted by sergey brin one of
the founders of google huh and it showed
them there's actually a video that went
along with it showing a bunch of cars
driving around all right a NASCAR
racetrack I want to get drivers I want
to get back that's pretty funny I want
to get back to that whole driverless car
thing look you can continue with april
fools can I tell you when I saw real
quick that I was not mad at what I think
it was think geek and I did you know
those meeps for Easter those like
marshmallow bunnies p
see peeps I said meeps need the help me
know uh they don't they're like oh
introducing this holiday for Easter
creeps and they were just these like
little zombie marshmallow uh but they
weren't real that's all I would you not
do that good idea is a good idea creeps
my dad is a peep fanatic yeah it's
insane um I remember the tauntaun
sleeping bag that thinking as yet
started out as an april fools prank i
believe a couple years ago yeah but then
the fans of Star Wars loved it so much
they wrote in to think he can made them
make it into like we want this joke to
be real yeah i'll show you can't really
do april fools prank some geeks you
can't or the internet yeah again what
else was there this uh mr. this weekend
uh more google stuff so google chrome
introduced multitask mode and there was
a video that went along with all these
pranks multitask mode basically enabled
the user to scroll with two different
mice there's like a video of a guy
editing of the UH like a video and final
cut yeah at the same time he was writing
like a document yes scrolling through a
web page not the only and they had like
a special Chrome browser that split the
screen into so you could operate two
browsers at once not a bad idea it just
seems like so much effort I I think they
should actually enable this because
people might be too much do ya two mice
at the same time are that's crazy yeah
no it's not do you think you'll be able
to train your brain to operate two mice
the same I have enough time walking and
chewing gum at the same time this is
like the 21st century equivalent of like
patting your stomach and rubbing your
head or vice versa yeah whatever the
same time yeah I don't know dude I'm not
down for that I'm sorry too I just like
a wax on wax off sort of thing I would
be I want to see you try to paint two
separate pictures in mspaint with double
minds I wonder how that would turn her
on if I asked you to like draw a dog
with one in a car with another may I
would to do we just alternate hands it
would be like I would I would hold them
but it would be a time no yeah that's
crazy but it is funny i'm not i'm not a
tease you're picking out good examples
well Google always has good ones uh they
revealed gmail Tap that basically splits
your smartphone screen into for Morse
code
uh section of guy you like literally tap
your screen I feel like the Ranger if I
feel like today they're starting next
year's what do you mean I mean this is
how much thought and in sort of effort
goes into this yeah there's like a think
tank for duty they're like all right
let's get the books out you have to
think about what we're doing for 2013 or
how much money it costs them I'm see
it's gotta be sizable you know they're
creating these graphics in and you know
they're making these productions yeah
that's true it's a big deal what about
that the Google Maps square by a big
google maps thing oh yeah yeah that was
pretty cool you know I see if I can
bring this up here we go this is like a
nexus seems like it's so much money I
don't know yeah I don't know I mean I
thought it was pretty cool this is like
the UH word that from the old Enix games
yes groans green eggs on NES yeah it
makes it look all the google maps yeah a
big computations cool pretty cool pretty
cool what else anything else uh-oh kodak
came up with one that was kind of lame
uh clearly they don't have a lot of
money to create these in april fools
budget was / yeah the april fools prank
is that they were going bankrupt what
happened yeah what will buy it was that
uh other came out with the service
called live print yeah um it's kind of a
play on the whole 3d printing okay trend
uh then so I lets users print out
kittens from retail kiosks in various
stores and like like Target and Walmart
and they showed uh like a kid coming I
be on way to be hip Kodak like wait a
minute things are real well yeah I feel
like coming out with kitten related
stuff is really appealing to the lowest
common denominator leave it's
low-hanging to yeah right like you could
put anything kitten related yeah is
trying to get the clothes guaranteed uh
speaking of of of uh April Fool's
announcements feel like this is one
April this is one real announcement way
too close to april fools yeah and when i
first read this i was like all this is
april fools but no it over the wrong
date about the wrong day because this is
borderline unbelievable uh reports are
out today that ashton kutcher is
actually going to be playing steve jobs
in the biopic i think uh I think we've
actually predicted this
or just Beijing the way that he looks
but didn't we do it jokingly I said it
seriously because I remember he look his
hair now looks a lot like Steve Jobs did
that's the thing if you look at this
photo from the seventies uh Ashton
Kutcher now yeah and and go back and
watch pirates of Silicon Valley he looks
kind of exactly like him but uh I just
grow a little flavor saver on his chin
there do you think he can do it on has
he ever been in a real drama before uh
butterfly effect hello has he ever been
in a real drama before I mean he's
played serious roles before when oh
right the day kelso got his girlfriend
pregnant yeah I mean I think he has let
me think yeah you can't know I know
aside from butterfly I mean dude where's
my car was a stretch dude where's my car
yeah that really made me think about is
that was not so he's done like romantic
comedies like no strings attached before
I ask again okay has he ever been in a
real dramatic role reindeer games I
never saw that okay I heard good stuff
about that but I think that was it I
don't know this is uh this is crazy but
yeah you know like obviously Steve Jobs
has a really big personality and he was
kind of controlling sort of a jerk
according to a lot of people according
to uh Walter Isaacson's biography I
don't know if Ashton Kutcher can play
that role yeah I don't know if we could
play a jerk yeah so this is uh this is a
story that came out yesterday and I
guess there's going to be an independent
biopic biopic I think it's biopic I
think biopic makes sense because it's a
picture of biography but by opeth is me
I got no money on me okay I don't know
what do you think Richard is it is it
biopic there's no way chaverim say not
because a biopic oh that's like biopsy
like like testing something if it's
cancer no I asked one of my friends who
majored in cinema in college he said
it's rhymes with myopic really it's not
my opick I don't know I don't know
anyway so by OPI would say by oh yeah
everyone in the choppa silver blade Eric
and silver blade no he drives out of
films hey JJ cool soccer yeah
bio dash dash dash pick that guy's 10
years old but if you know okay then Jeff
Scott stricken cuz it's bo bike haha we
have no jerem that's totally on the same
levels as that's why i love them that's
frickin funny as hell to release its by
its biopic how could it be biopic great
irregardless irregardless Ashton Kutcher
will be starring as steve jobs in the bo
pike I do like do you really call jobs
coming out isn't it you underst your
first knee-jerk reaction is like this is
ridiculous are you gonna have to ask
Miriam Webster right now is you know
crap about how you pronounce it i'm just
saying ashton kutcher as the legendary
and innovative genius Steve Jobs yeah
it's gonna happen no not in a million
years did you ever think that that would
have oh yeah it's kind of ridic it's
insanity dude can you turn my volume up
right now why there's nothing playing
dude there will be one second okay I Oh
pic Oh guess what dang it biopic all
right the robot said it my biopic better
you Justin you being wrong what is
merriam-webster no no one's ever cited
merriam-webster's what does she know
what is Miriam let me ask Siri she'll
know I want to talk seriously about
self-driving cars though okay I'm
serious because I read this article here
on usatoday.com from last week it was
like two weeks ago and it really got me
thinking about how this might be the
thing that makes our generation feel the
same way our parents generation felt
when the internet came out something so
alienating and I and sort of like
throwing you for a kerbal this article
and it's and it's definitely optimistic
ok but this article from USA Today it's
written by a woman named Alisa Priddle
Alisa Priddle Detroit Free Press hmm
that that I guess there's a little
undertone there the Detroit Free Press
what comes out about
Detroit okay anyway yeah uh she's saying
and she gives a lot of examples she
truly believes that cars in our
lifetimes and not so far in the distant
future will be driving themselves talk
24 7 she believes it is going to happen
and she says not only is it going to
happen like you said with with real-life
examples it already is happening right
and uh you know they're trying they're
actually getting to the point where
they're going through a trial and
they're doing a 10,000 mile um or it's
actually hitting the 10,000 mile mark of
these driverless uh clinics and sort of
trials and stuff like that right I mean
I feel like that's the one thing like if
you told our parents when they were 15
that by the time they had kids who are
in college they be able to like have a
phone with them anywhere they go yeah I
guess Mike it's the same for science
fiction barrier totally in that will
eventually happen but what I'm wondering
is will there ever be a time when you
have to drive a driverless car like you
have to be in a driverless car or will
there be streets that occupy both
driverless cars at santosh with drivers
that's great question either we have a
choice right like will the car go into
autopilot and then manual mode right now
have to like pop back into the front
seat and be like a hold on this roads
not on the map I'm gonna have to really
take over right here yeah and a lot of
people would lose jobs in the auto
industry I mean no they wouldn't Detroit
would pretty much fall off the plan what
are you talking about you know cars that
to be built yeah but I don't know what
do you you're also discounting people
that like driving cars too oh I love you
have the option would you prefer not to
be driving yes really yeah I mean it
would take a lot for me to get over the
whole I'm no longer in control of this
vehicle thing but if it's and the great
thing about this is that they're sort of
explaining how it will never hit people
all right you know I mean like you'll
never hit anybody there's no like
accidents there's nothing it would I
feel like self-driving cars would also
eliminate traffic as well of course they
would they would because there's no such
thing as rubbernecking anymore right if
it was it's the highway was all
driverless cars that's what I'm right
you can't have like
a mishmash what they would wind up doing
and this is me sort of taking a you know
a sort of science fiction freedom with
the whole thing they would imagine like
certain roads are our autopilot and some
are not and like once you pop on the
freeway you sort of just like let go and
the things like taking you to write
Atlantic City but if we're gonna have
driverless cars why don't we just invest
more in public transportation basically
the same thing just a bigger vehicle
right I don't disagree I mean it seems
like just a waste of space if we have
parking lot did work in Minority Report
did it no did it I don't you know what
I'm saying though like why do we even
need to have parking lots if we can just
have one a better public transportation
you're saying a full and total revamp of
mass transit public transportations what
I think eliminate cars entirely right
well I I'm a believer that there should
be no non taxicab cars in Manhattan
there said it there should only be taxis
driving that streets in Manhattan is
what I believe I truly believe the
explosion and over popular and this is
going and this and I have a father sweet
lose been driving back and forth to the
city for 25 years plus right and that
would negate what he's been doing that
would make it illegal they tried they
were thinking about doing that they were
gonna like cross section off summer
Manhattan right and only let commercial
vehicles in and then private passenger
cars were only going to get a certain a
thousand ATS right I was more recent
also yeah I thought mayor talks to dead
okay but okay I really think that it's
becoming a pro like think about the
amount of time human being sit in
traffic and the wasted man-hours and
like what that really does to a person
yeah when you find out you're like
eating like hey guess what two years of
your life were wasted in traffic is that
not the most depressing thing you've
ever heard I mean you would have to ask
somebody that drives the car to work
every day is it worth it for them to
avenge our country utterance and gas
vast majority the country does that
we're different here but okay taking a
sweet Lou for example what would be the
alternative for him going to work well
his car would either drive itself yeah
or but in your taxi only world well then
he would have to take a bus
but the buses do beep is gonna be so all
the right now this is like sit next to
somebody and maybe possibly touch knees
yeah that is I hate that though I don't
I don't like touching these uh but yeah
I mean I really think you know roads are
deteriorated there's just like there's a
lot of problems cars suck they're not
reliable as reliable as they used to be
you mean I do know Jimmy I think it's
time and everyone's like all you know
what it's all about the future of cars
going green and like flying know that
happen you know I just I just think a
practical future is a driverless sort of
you know look we have to treat us like
we are like it's an assembly line like
we're just little pieces pont you know I
don't know it's sort of like
totalitarian but right that's sort of
what it is do you would choose a
driverless car I think I would you won't
know why it's driving you want to know
why because I don't trust anyone else
driving a car it's painfully obvious
that a lot of people don't know how to
drive specifically in the rain right
yeah well in the rain people don't know
how to drive in the rain okay they have
no idea what to do there just like my
car is fine it's it's just like I can go
just as fast as i read in perfect
driving conditions people falling asleep
there's a million things that go wrong
how many people died a year in car
accident right right that's you know I
think it's like it's like wanna if I
think your odds of dying in a car car
like one out of like five thousand for
some like the first step needs to be
doors that don't open up and fly out you
know like particular you're not gonna
because your body to slay heard about
your beta slide open yeah you know I
mean I'm holding doors I want to know
what you think internet give us a call
866 404 seen it before we leave for the
day whatever happen ematic tubes that
was just thinking about that yeah it's
ramen the Jets right yeah at what point
in our history do we discard the idea of
pneumatic tubes well I don't know if you
realize but a lot of our innovation
seems to come from science fiction film
right like Minority Report is like a
huge influence another thing that in
minority part was that mag track right
was like magnetic and that those were a
driverless car they were all on
autopilot yeah
about how efficient think about how UPS
gets a package from A to B overnight
okay that efficiency most of the time
yeah most it would be a nice or having
tubes going into every building every
restaurant I'm not saying we should make
mail like that i'm seeing equate those
packages with you and I and Richard and
people right getting that sort of
efficiency and moving as quick as those
things move yeah that's that's make
sense to me it's it's like it's got to
be like a UH a very intricate you know
sort of design but I think it would work
right yeah I think oh no I'm we're
talking about overhauling the entire
department of transportation it was
right it's down and pitch it to dino
trademark trademark 404 it's calls from
the public time before we gotta roll for
the day time to show the love a jig 6404
cnet so last week what do you let
there's someone in the chart room and
the test sides he says I used to load
trailers at ups and no Jeff that's it
just know i watch something on that a
lot of people at ups at a business i
watch something on the science channel
couple weekends ago about how they
followed lobsters like frozen lot oh no
real live lobsters being shipped
overnight like halfway around the world
okay and that crap seemed super
efficient I mean I'm sorry there's like
these unbelievable conveyor belts and
they all just like spit off at each one
I mean yeah there's a cool music playing
as they travel the rude goldberg the
crazy factory pmas what you thinking
that right i forget that have anything
goes that riff goes anyway calls from
the public time last week we talked the
hell of a lot about the sony playstation
4 and even Justin had something to say
about this because he could relate to
the time in our lives when you would
bring a game over to a friend's house
yeah not hold you know reality is
probably going to disappear with the the
sort of fruition of anti used game
technology let's hear what our body has
to say about that I think he's going to
talk more about
sony locking the playstation 4 hey 404
this is atlanta from Elliott's I'm
really bummed that he didn't read my
email on the air so I'm going to follow
up to a question that yes and tie it
into email at listen you guys it's a
good protiviti was in relation to
subscription based gaming um ever loads
have been doing this for a long time
specifically a final fantasy 11 which is
their own for almost ten years you can
buy the game all of the expenses over
the years and every ad on scenarios if
it out for it about five dollars usually
on steam or on amazon com but you pay
twelve dollars a month continue to play
it so i don't think the ridiculous
notion do you combat piracy or what have
you for forgetting to moving forward you
like the game we're going to keep
playing it and it's almost another bed
of the deal when you consider you go and
play mortal kombat to in the arcades in
the 90 you're pumping a dollar into that
game every two to three minutes he's
right about that comparing a
subscription based gaming to the arcade
model we're like okay I'm in an arcade
right and I've literally dumped forty
dollars in quarters pinball machine yeah
um you know I guess that makes sense I
don't think that I think what it also
proves is that subscription based gaming
is the better deal to the consumer and
not necessarily a means to increase
revenue for the developers and
publishers so I don't know do me a favor
though I want everyone to read the
article I wrote on Friday because I
don't know people are like they're not
they're not mad not disagreeing but I
feel like there's just more to add to
this conversation okay about about what
exactly this future might mean and the
point I brought up was the psychology of
like buying a game like if I'm going out
to buy a game I'm paying 60 bucks for
this game if it turns out to be awful
you still have this like safety net you
mean that you can sell it but you can
sell it back it right if i'm still
paying 60 bucks for a game that I'm
stuck with and there's no way I can get
around that there's no way that's gonna
lead to more games hell right there is
no way not to mention not everyone has
downloadable uh has internet capable of
get delivering a huge multi gigabyte
game in a reasonable manner right me
yeah and I like that you sort of brought
up the Orwell novel in your show tell
because it's really appropriate here I
feel likes man sounds just the first one
to really put their foot down yeah I
mean X knocked up Microsoft there's been
rumors that the next Microsoft Xbox will
will have anti use game stuff too yeah I
mean they're all gonna do it it's like
having a book that will disintegrate
upon you finish exactly like
self-destructing game right that's
messed up I don't know I mean I just I
think it don't I mean it has to happen
eventually physical media cannot be
around forever but to that end there's
still a sort of psychology that goes
along with all idea of it finally let's
end things on a lighter note we have
some really dedicated listeners who
recall amazing anniversaries for our
show hey what's going on 40 14 love this
show I just wanted to call in and wish
you all especially Jeff happy punch a
tween in the head month where was it
mouth either way this is in response to
the story ran last year about a kid
calling in and saying I can't believe
you didn't have a computer when you were
13 I've got an ipad and iphone imac and
all that and jeff declared at punch
between in the mouth month and it's an
appropriate month since it's your
birthday mom to man so have a good one

march but April is officially put
between in the face month let's get on

probably have a little cousin who
spoiled yeah tha's Vita and his ipod
touch and his iPad yeah engines and you
dare how dare you show him your old game
gear right you know that your that you
should have in mint condition and it
just spits on it in front of you it
doesn't have to be tweens though just
punch anyone in the head that had stuff
you didn't have when you were a kid like
I was talking to a 22
euro the other day and someone was only
six years younger younger than you right
right but I get talking to her about
which did in high school and she was
telling me like oh you know I would fill
my friends doing funny stuff with our
flip cameras and then we would upload
them to our Facebook pages yeah and then
send them to our friends cool what that
sounds messy have facebook in high
school I don't care that we don't have
facebook I cared that we didn't have
little micro camcorders right fit in the
palm of your hand yeah I'm like the guy
carrying around this old you know VHS
camcorder shoulder shoulder mounted
thing that trying to be all artsy what
not have one of those in high school
come on I headquarters were more
advanced I know I know but it was still
big it couldn't fit in your wallet
exaggerating now you couldn't fit it in
your pocket like you could with a flip
cam yeah so we would take yearbook
photos there be the guy standing behind
the camera with a flash bulb that would
go off is it replace the bulb in a flash
