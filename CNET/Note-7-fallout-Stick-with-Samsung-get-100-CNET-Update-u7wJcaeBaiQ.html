galaxy note 7 customers if they stick
with a samsung for their next phone now
that the phone is officially recalled
for a second time customers of the fire
prone note sevens are instructed to shut
off the phone and return it immediately
customers that exchange it for another
samsung phone are going to get one
hundred dollars in credit to show
appreciation for their loyalty those
that want a full refund or want to
switch to another brand they're going to
get twenty-five dollars from Samsung for
their troubles and retailers including
Amazon are also giving money back for
accessories but exchanging the phone can
be a headache depending on where you
bought it from most retailers say you
can walk into a store to return it but
Verizon is asking people to do their
exchange online and verizon's going to
send a box to mail back the phone
Samsung is also sending people special
thermally insulated boxes to return the
phones because simply dropping a
potentially explosive lithium-ion
battery in the mail is a bad idea and
Samsung's return kit you only have to
return the phone it goes in a plastic
static shield bag and then into a box
which goes into another box and that
goes into a third box that's lined with
white ceramic fiber paper and that paper
may irritate skin so Samsung also
included gloves to handle the packaging
u.s. regulations prohibit shipping
recalled batteries by air so it will
have to travel by ground transportation
when news of the notes Evans continued
problems came to light earlier this week
some seen an update viewers wrote in to
tell me they just don't want to return
the phone most reasons were because
there's just not much out there like the
note 7 with its large screen and stylus
but these users are loyal and that
loyalty may mean we could see more risks
of fires that people continue to use it
if your safety isn't enough to convince
you remember its resale value is now
zero dollars which is why some people
also wrote in to say that they're going
to switch to older note models just to
keep with something similar that's it
