GPU than the a5 finding the ipad 2 while
this will definitely improve how games
look and run on the tablet will the
process are offering a new speed
advantages hi i'm eric franklin senior
editor for cnet and frequent Kimbo Slice
impersonator and today i'll take the
second and third-generation ipad and put
them through a general performance test
blender and see what kind of delicious
results i can come up with first up I
movie encoding we shot two 30-second
clips will export them to the camera
roll in 720p here we go the new iPad is
right out of the gate lot faster than
the ipad to the ipad 2 is lagging a few
seconds behind the new egghead it's
about halfway done now exporting this
720p movie yeah it looks like the new
ipad is going to win pretty handily over
there it is copying moving to the camera
roll and now it's done and the ipad 2 is
lagging behind maybe about five or six
seconds I'm not sure up there we go and
there we ended the new ipad is much
faster than the ipad to exporting an
imovie now for app lodging speed first
up puzzle juice here we go puzzle juice
starting up can't really tell which ones
winning yes up the new ipad one and
maybe a split second the ipad 2 is right
behind it so there you have it now real
racing 2 HD and there we go real racing
2 HD is going and new ipad beat this
ipad 2 by about one second this is
becoming a trend not that much faster
but faster and finally flip ship
and there we are a flip ship going I
like flip ship because as this great
progress bar making my job a lot easier
and they're both done that was really
close I think that's probably a tie okay
we relocated to the cnet labs we're
going to do some app download speed
tests and we need a router in order to
do that so let's get started and they're
off loading and downloading the
third-generation iPad got a head start
looks like it's downloading faster than
ipad to dive tattoos right right behind
it though and now it's installing the
ipad the new life has been sewing and
the ipad 2 is right behind it and the
ipad is done still waiting on the ipad 2
and now it's done so the new ipad faster
and the ipad to the downloading apps so
there are your freshly blend it results
you can be the judge yourself or you can
go to cnet com you see more details on
what I think</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
