Morris coming to you from San Francisco
this week and it's time to get loaded
Netflix will soon offer Disney and ABC
movies and TV shows to stream these will
be available in Netflix watch instantly
service and compete with Hulu the deal
comes just as Netflix CFO Barry McCarthy
announced his resignation Google
announced a much-needed update to Google
Groups this is an old service but it
lags in usage behind Facebook groups the
redesign lets you search and browse
groups and postings as well as add these
groups to your lists of favorites
it also responds to keyboard shortcuts
as well YouTube is running a popularity
contest quite literally my YouTube is
pitting recording artists like Justin
Bieber Kanye West and Shakira against
one another to see whose channel
attracts the most fans the winning
artists will be featured on the YouTube
masthead on February 12th the contest
ends February 5th
it's a shameless way to get subscribers
a few keen internet us have noticed that
the new google chrome notebooks are
missing the caps lock keys google says
this will improve the quality of
messaging since no one likes to read in
all caps it makes me wonder if this
could also be seen as an environmental
improvement after all what is the carbon
footprint of manufacturing that caps
lock key bings newest map search feature
is designed to help you in the mall Bing
has mapped out local malls so that you
can find your favorite stores and of
course the food court unfortunately it
doesn't work for mobile being maps which
kind of defeats the purpose I guess you
could print the maps out or just use
those mapping kiosks and the new study
shows that Android phone users consume
more data than any other smartphone
users this used to be true of iPhones
but now Android phone users hold the
title of data hogs probably because
they're just so many of these phones and
speaking of Android phones Google's new
flagship phone the Nexus S has arrived
here at CNET headquarters our own Kent
German is reviewing the phone right now
so make sure you visit scene at tv.com
to see what he thinks of it those are
your headlines for
day I will see you tomorrow I'm Natali
Morris for cnet.com and you've just been
