thing on any laptop shoppers wishlist a
brand-new fully updated version of
Apple's MacBook Air well after years of
waiting it's finally here but I got to
tell you one thing it's very different
from the air you know now why is that so
important for most of its 10-year life
the classic MacBook Air was the default
laptop for pretty much everyone high
school college student MacBook Air
writer a creative type back book air
office drone or startup guy MacBook Air
I was there for the very first MacBook
Air way back in 2008 and it was no doubt
a game changer in fact for many years I
called it the single most universally
useful laptop you could buy for most of
its life the MacBook Air was $9.99 not
cheap but an achievable luxury
especially with something rock-solid
that would last years and years but
lately I started to feel a little bit
like the old guy at the club still
showing up but kind of dated everyone
else moved to higher res screens that
went almost edge-to-edge on the lid
bigger touch pads regular component
upgrades thinner and lighter bodies and
for most of this year the rumor mill has
been surging with talk of a new slimmer
reasonably priced MacBook with a better
screen than would either update or
replace the air well the rumors were
right we now have a new MacBook Air but
I'd say it's an air in name only as
everything about it is different new
body check new screen check new keyboard
and touchpad check new processors check
I think it really keeps the air named
for nostalgia reasons if I were in
charge I might call it a MacBook Pro
Lite it even fits right into the Karnak
design sensibility a bit larger than two
12-inch MacBook a bit smaller than the
13-inch pro and much much different than
the classic air which Apple is still
selling at least for now let's look at
the screen on the old low res air that's
the single biggest reason I stopped
recommending it to people as my go to
default everyday laptop pick the big
silver border is gone and now the
13-inch screen has the same slim style
black bezel under edge to edge glass as
the MacBook and MacBook Pro
a resolution is also four times greater
and that makes a huge difference
what else did Apple fix about the
MacBook Air it's got new 8th gen Intel
processors instead of 15 or older ones
you can get more RAM and more storage
space tip it's bitter and lie there
although not quite in the top tier of
lightweight laptops it's even made from
100% recycled aluminum if you care about
that sort of thing which you should
there's a lot from the MacBook Pro line
that's trickled down here both good and
bad the Retina screen is a big plus as
is the larger more modern touchpad but
with that touch pad comes the infamous
butterfly keyboard that's the super flat
one where people's keys kept getting
stuck Apple says it's fixed the problem
now but it's still a shallower less
tactile keyboard than the old air I
really don't think it's as hard to get
used to as some people say but chances
are you're never going to love it but
that keyboard comes with the very best
part of the MacBook Pros touch bar the
fingerprint reader I've used one and a
MacBook Pro for a long time and it's the
best laptop fingerprint reader i've
tried by far
okay are you ready for the really
difficult part of this conversation if
there was one giant burning question
about a new MacBook Air was what support
situation you might want to sit down for
this
you already know without me even telling
you we're in modern MacBook territory
here so to paraphrase Henry Ford you can
have any port you want the MacBook Air
so long as it's USB see but hey you get
to so I can be plugged into power and
connect it to something else at the same
time and they're both Thunderbolt 3 as
well most of those super slim Windows
laptops or USB see only now so it may be
time to get on that boat if you're a
holdout or invest in some dongles that's
ok we can still pour out a little for
our old friends USB a HDMI an SD card
slot we'll miss you browse headphone
jacks still there can't say that about
most other Apple products these days so
am I telling you to run out right now
and buy new MacBook Air in a way I am
because it frankly hits almost every
mark on our years-long wish list but
there is a catch remember the good old
days of the $9.99 MacBook Air well the
new walk in the door price is 1199 and
that's kind of a blow to a generation
raised on the concept of being able to
get your first MacBook for under a grand
it's even $100 less then the 12-inch
MacBook or the 13-inch basic MacBook Pro
so you're gonna have to do some features
versus value mat to figure out which one
is right for you
the higher price may drive the MacBook
Air out of its impulse purchase
territory but at the same time I can't
think of much that I would do
differently in a top-to-bottom reboot
that the most popular laptop of all time
