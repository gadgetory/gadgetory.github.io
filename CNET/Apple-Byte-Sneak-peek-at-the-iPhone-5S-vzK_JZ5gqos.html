to the apple pie for all the good of bad
inside the world of Apple we have the
winners of our gelaskins give away and
another give away and kill a promo but
first let's get to the show and if
you've been holding out on the iphone 5
and you're waiting for the next one that
weight may not be too far away after
etrade supply posted several photos of
what it believes to be the rear shell
for the next generation iphone which
based on its shape is being referred to
as the iphone 5s now the difference is
to point out here are in the red boxed
area with the logic board screw holes
that you can see are aligned in a
different pattern the purported iphone
5s rear shell is on the left and there's
also subtle differences when you compare
the other colored highlighted areas
side-by-side now the origin of these
photos are still unknown and they could
just be an older prototype design from
the first gen iphone 5 that was never
used but digit times which has been
hit-or-miss reported last month that
trial production of the iPhone 5s is
already underway with the target of the
middle of 2013 for lunch we've heard
plenty of stories about Apple launching
their own Pandora like music streaming
service as far back as September but it
still hasn't materialized CNET's own
Greg Sandoval reports that his sources
say at a minimum a deal with all the
major music labels is nowhere near to
being completed and the deal Apple
offered to them in recent weeks has left
the record companies with a cold
response so even in the best case
scenario it will still be a while before
we see anything that looks like an I
radio service and don't confuse it with
iHeartRadio which has a heart that
represents love now itunes 11 was
released last week and I'm a fan of the
streamlined and cleaner interface really
just try using it without the sidebar
but if you guys miss it that much you
can get it back by going to the menu to
view and then show sidebar see you guys
will be ok now the iCloud integration is
a lot better the up next feature to add
songs to an instant playlist really
replaces iTunes DJ but my favorite part
about it is the new search feature that
can be accessed at any
now there's a lot of features it's
missing from the previous version but
according to all things D a minor update
is coming that will bring back the
ability to find duplicate songs missing
album art issues will be addressed and
movie streaming bugs to Apple TVs but
one thing Apple said is officially not
coming back is cover flow and it
affected some of the members on our
staff alright we talked about the imax
last week but here's a little sample of
the review of the incoming 27-inch imac
from our own rich brown hi I'm rich
Bradford cnet today we're going to take
a look at Apple's new editors choice
winning iMac so this is the 27-inch
version of Apple's new iMac and this
model in particular is the 1999 version
with a few upgraded specs it comes to
2,600 bucks with all the upgrades but we
find it's definitely worth it
considering how fast it is and how good
the screen looks now one of the first
things Apple mention about the new imac
is its new thin design so from that
angle you can see this bezel here it's
about five millimeters thick and it
really looks like this is a
revolutionary new display now we keep
going here and you'll see it's actually
not quite as thin as Apple made it out
to be this is big bulge here in the back
and from front to back the moderate is
actually about two and a half inches
thick now it's certainly not a behemoth
but it's also not the sort of razor thin
display that Apple put out there and of
course a standout feature with a 27-inch
imac is its giant gorgeous display so
this is 27 inch screen and it's 2560 x
1440 pixel resolution that puts it among
the ranks of the highest res all in ones
out there now on top of that high
quality screen Apple's also really tried
to minimize the reflections you get from
the glossy bezel Apple's had some pretty
good success here it's not entirely
reflection free but it's also better
than some of the other high in 27 inches
we've seen now rounding out the features
on the new iMac there's two microphone
inputs up here the hard to see but they
definitely improve voice fidelity when
you're making calls now as I mentioned
our imac review unit comes with a lot of
upgraded parts that puts its price
pretty high up at about twenty six
hundred dollars it starts at 1,800 bucks
though so that makes the system really
pretty competitive given that you still
get the core i5 CPU a standard terabyte
hard drive as well as the big display
now there are some points of
inconvenience with the system the lack
of a direct HDMI input and no optical
drive means you have to jump through a
few hoops
if you want to use it for home
entertainment but especially for serious
users that need a high resolution screen
and all the performance you get with the
system this is an easy recommendation so
I'm rich brown this is apple's new
editors choice playing 27-inch I thanks
rich and editors choice pick that's
legit and don't worry guys we'll show
you everything that goes down when I get
mine all right to the quick bites the
YouTube iOS app has been updated with
ipad and iphone 5 support now that's
right full iPad support and then
interface designed for it plus it also
brings airplay capability back to the
app videos are supposed to start faster
play more smoothly and they've also
approved voiceover support for the
visually impaired also I work fans I
know you're out there Apple released
updates for both the iOS and Mac
versions of I work with most of the
significant updates coming on the iOS
side for improved compatibility with
Microsoft Office apps and check this out
if black or white isn't your style a
service called a no style adds new
anodized colors to your iPhone 5 or iPad
Mini you'll have to send your device in
but it's more than just painting it it's
a chemical process that changes the
color and people with money to burn can
pay 249 for the iphone 5 and 299 for the
ipad mini to get a color change now
we've also talked about the Steve Jobs
biopic called jobs that will star aston
kutcher well the Sundance Film Festival
released a note saying jobs with a
lowercase J and then the rest of letters
capitalized will be the events closing
film and look at this picture released
Kutcher just really captures that sexy
nerd on a table appeal that SJ always
had alright let's announce our gelaskin
