worst enemy it's all about how you talk
to her so here are a few ways to make
sure the personal assistant works a lot
smarter for you
for instance Siri doesn't always let you
finish your sentence text my best front
just like that yes she totally cut me
off so there's an easy way to make sure
this never happens again when you say
your command tap and hold the microphone
and keep holding it until you're done
saying what you need to say like this
text my best friend I finally figured
out why the pizza didn't arrive
exclamation point she got everything I
wanted problem solved
sometimes Siri can't figure out how to
pronounce a name or recognize one that
you're trying to call so the next time
that happens do this that's not how you
pronounce also Bugatti okay so so that
sounds right select bull got to thats
right okay
okay I'll remember how to pronounce
self-serve Olga T from now on perfect
now we won't have any other problems
with that name even though she has her
quirks you have to give her some credit
Siri can actually understand commands
that go beyond the basic calls an
appointment setting let me show you one
scheduled dinner next Wednesday at 5:30
p.m. at Boca nova with Ellison pond and
since I have Allison in my contacts
she'll also receive an invitation for
the event if you need to launch an app
or toggle a setting using Siri can be a
lot faster than digging up an icon Syria
can handle both tasks so I can say
something like turn bluetooth on okay
and she'll get it done for me
I can also do something like launch
Spotify and there's my apps Siri is
smart but you can make her even smarter
by giving her constructive feedback so
for example give me directions to bar
Paco at this point swipe down to reveal
the original command and use the tap to
edit function to correct her
hit done and your correction will be
sent to Siri for a new answer plus
she'll understand you better in the
future
getting directions to our backhoe
personal assistance like Siri aren't
perfect but with a little bit of work
you can make the relationship a lot more
beneficial for you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
