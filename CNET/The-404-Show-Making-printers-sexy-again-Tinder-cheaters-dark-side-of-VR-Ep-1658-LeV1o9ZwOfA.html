April 22nd 2016 this is the 404 show
thank you for tuning in even though
we're all about to get together tonight
and celebrate the very important holiday
we're all yeah Justin to write standard
tonight yeah you come for that it's
Passover it's Passover this podcast is
kosher for Passover
can you bring guests to Passover dinner
yeah an invite from you oh we don't talk
about that I mean yeah I think like part
of Passover and I should probably know
this but again is inviting people ya
know it's like it's like oh let's open
the door to the whole not homeless
I don't think they want homeless people
coming Elijah oh no they they scoff at
the homeless but they want the hungry
and what about the invisible prophet
Elijah that shows up and drinks or wine
so there's a part in the service in the
in the dinner service okay is this real
or not Justin there's a part in the
service where someone opens the door the
front doors guy no to an invisible man
named will call him Elijah okay and this
could be real and Elijah has his own a
cup got incoming wine cup of wine in the
center of the table okay and they go
alright Elijah come on in you're late as
usual
yeah come on in have every time have a
sip mm-hmm we lie
I guess everyone stands up and welcomes
Elijah into the house wait is that real
is that real I think it is real it's
real because you're not laughing about
it
well it's hilarious but you actually do
get up and open the door yeah everyone
does it yeah there's a lot of OCD in
Passover there's like you'll wash your
hands four times that's determined on
like how religious you are obviously I
think like every book you
read from right has many many times you
you wash your hands you take one sip of
wine you basically go through a really
weird thing but it's also arguably the
best story in the Old Testament right
I'm not in terms of like action-packed
there's giant waves
there's insects there's death is flying
around it is a blockbuster it is it's a
summer it's a springbok yeah it's true
unfortunately it ends with really dry
brisket which is a bummer
yeah it ends with food that's like super
overrated and it ends with like you
being constipated for six days I think a
filter fish was one of the plagues
originally and it just got worked in do
you know what the plagues just yeah I do
of course I know about the place it's so
oh my god locusts then yeah I don't know
it's tough for like a little kid it's
fun for a little kid because you're like
oh this is a weird dinner it's a party
no I remember having a good time my
uncle who used to do the leading the
leading it sure it still does made it a
lot of fun for for me and my brother cuz
we were just like oh that's uncle Howie
he's crazy yeah he doesn't really take
this seriously cuz it's all bullshit
right he's having fun with it don't
offend the listeners there are some I'm
just saying the voice I'm echoing the
voice of ten year old Jeff right it was
just like I already said different from
adult he was less polite about it but
anyway yeah not only are our drinks that
were holding their kosher for Passover
Meltzer which is really the drink of the
Jewish man this is the choice of a
Jewish generation if there was any drink
that was associated with Jews it would
be something like the New Balance of the
earth choose and particularly it's it's
baby it's basically the bagel of
everything today
oh is it has really fallen in terms of
promotion the only reason I know that is
because city bike in New York is
offering free rides to anyone if you go
and sign up online Oh
you want to maybe not drive a car today
in respect but that's like signing up
for free Netflix for a day everybody
would have to pay for it yeah just for a
money-making scam well I think the
bigger story is that I read on Reuters a
couple weeks ago that apparently there's
been 23 million bicycles rented across
the United States and a bunch of these
bike share programs for major cities but
there has not been one reported case of
a fatality involving a bike show just
one there's no way that it's possible
that it's happened but just not has not
gone warded yet for some reason so
what's the big deal but it hasn't gotten
track always been my concern was the
second you open up these bike shares and
you have like tourists visiting New York
City I don't have the balls to ride a
bike in New York City let alone like
some guy from Ohio that's never been
here before there's no way that guys
renting a bike that I've definitely seen
tourists riding bikes for the street
definitely yeah yeah Park Avenue - well
there's that big shot you mean when they
shut down Park Avenue or like when
traffic oh yeah when it's actually
running yeah so there must like unless
all these cities are burying it yeah it
could be that you can the stand people
people died today on those share bikes
yeah 38 this is actually the new season
of The Wire they're bringing it back to
us for this really unbelievable 38 that
ain't that bad yeah that's been a very
green week so far I guess so oh are you
referring to well cuz you have right now
I'm just looking at a bunch of pot
leaves in your computer well that's the
thing not only you know it was at 4:20
this week which is very important to
people
20 is the new April Fool's can I just
say I was you didn't let me finish they
say for toys very important to people
who don't smoke pot like that is
essentially what that has turned into
but in the in the tradition of Passover
the ancient
holiday of Passover uh turns out uh some
sort of prolific rabbi has deemed
marijuana to actually be kosher for
Passover which of course it is cuz how
the hell else are you supposed to get
through all that time with your in-laws
yeah that's tough you gotta be stoned
and you gotta make that food taste good
leaven bread is
zero good yeah no one's ever been like
oh can I get some more that matzah I do
kind of like the apple nut combo what
you the chopped apples and corrosives
Carosa erosive I think it's called not
corrosive corrosive sets and the
horseradish also has a peel yeah it's
not a really good horse but everything
else is garbage I completely agree with
you it's pretty gross um so Belarusian
rabbi Haim Kavinsky yeah has said that
marijuana Manske doesn't matter
marijuana may be used by the Jews from
all backgrounds so I include Asian Jews
as well those exist they do exist I'm
looking at one urine by just by the
transitive property of a friendship and
the seltzer and the cell the same and
the mahjongg yeah so it doesn't matter
what kind of Jew you are any Jew at from
any background is allowed to smoke or
consume marijuana yeah yeah nobody
smokes pot just for no reason you could
get you know those jackets they have for
dogs that are like stress jackets get
them in a second right come on you're
telling me all the California has like
mad at medicinal issues yeah give me a
break no Paul it's great yeah isn't that
awesome
yeah been holding out Jeff I know I've
been waiting until somebody actually
made this okay
so bread no breads bad right
but pot go nuts yeah you know it's a
bummer though is cuz like I can't
imagine like you would want like a bagel
after smoking and you really can't have
that like your options are severely
limited like you're gonna have some fish
you know I guess what do you mean sushi
maybe it's sushi okay
no the rice rice would be bad you'd have
to have like sashimi and then not eat
the rice yeah exactly did you say
sashimi sashimi sashimi
whatever you're not Japanese don't
correct me it's not like you have any
authority on that right yeah no that's
good I don't like sashimi anyways it is
excuse me I'm excited man Passover this
year haunts my kids like first kind of
real yes I know but my first but Dylan's
gonna like
a part of it yeah I'm not excited for
him to be exposed to it I just like
enjoy you know watching him being
different situation and indifferent to
things yeah being indifferent and in
differences I was at his first birthday
party okay a while ago and he was doing
extremely well I was very impressed
because first birthday parties are kind
of a nightmare situation for kids yeah
because all that it's crowded and
there's all this attention scary he held
it down for way longer than I thought it
was gonna be he's a good man I'm gonna
have to bring him back into the office
one day yeah you know come on the show
and slap me like it does no no way he
slaps slaps the shit out of my face
just like and laughs the whole like
prompt him first having his hand just
like grab I just like put my face in his
face and he goes like haha yeah it's
like he's in slapping yes that's the
move there you go I'd love to see that
yeah it's pretty funny I'll have to
snapchat it or something
okay you sir mr. Justin you were talking
to me this morning around the bagel pit
as I like to call it and you were saying
this crazy story about like 3d printing
and tracking 3d printing yeah I know how
much you guys are aching for printing
stories and we actually have a few of
them in the right now yeah which is kind
of appropriate but of course I put it in
that's what you bring with uh with
yourself all right if I can if I can
take the challenge I will try to make
printing exciting for you guys I think
and this story is kind of cool I think
you make printing sexy oh I have not
owned a printer in five years and you
should so you've got an uphill battle
ahead of you but I believe in you okay
well this is 3d printing so it's a
little different that's cooler already
yeah so the story we're talking about is
uh so you see I which is a University of
california-irvine in Southern California
they're sort of re-examining the
copyright laws surrounding 3d printing
right now because last month they
discovered this crazy vulnerability
where you can actually make a one-to-one
duplicate of a three
printed object just by analyzing a sound
recording of the original printing
process so you know what the printer was
you don't have to know what the printer
was really just even crazy so if you
guys have ever if you haven't seen a 3d
printer in action it emits this kind of
crazy noise that's similar to the sound
of one of those old dot-matrix yeah
right it's like as it goes across the
printing platform because it's a it's a
real mechanical extruder that's laying
down material right um and but that's
not making that sound all the time it's
only when it's pressing down layers and
so that's how they do it as its
extruding that plastic you can steal
information to be used to recreate exact
replicas not even just a rough estimate
a one-to-one dupe so there's no variance
essentially it's either binary so it's
either on or it's off right there's no
like I'm putting in a lot of whatever
material name right right the only thing
that you might I think might not be able
to get correct is the dimensions the
exact dimensions of it as in scale
because I think if it's printing out a
thick layer versus a thin layer you
won't be able to tell but it doesn't do
that but it'll be yeah I can do that
but so then there is a varying amount I
think there's a slight variance but you
could still definitely make out what the
original product yeah that's crazy yeah
it's crazy because I don't think people
have really figured out what you can do
with it yeah it's just kind of exposed
in this vulnerability but you can see
how if a company is manufacturing
prototypes of something it won't keep a
secret Wow you can go in there with an
audio recorder and huh so think about
that that's some kind of like backwards
hacking I never thought you'd read even
like consider it reminds me I was
telling you before
reminds me of sneakers yeah totally when
voice is my passport verified right and
also the dude who's like in the trunk of
that car oh yeah any like explains what
a highway they're on due to the the
sound of the car I'm in a cocktail party
cuz he's surrounded by flamingos right
that's so damn good go back I feel like
a lot of real hackers say that
sneakers is the only like realistic
depiction of that ever in a movie does
that I guess it does I think I've seen
pictures of it the blind computer with
the Braille on it yeah like where it's
constantly changing is like super wicked
really yeah yeah it's pretty interesting
I don't know yeah I know a lot of blind
people use screen readers yeah as
they're like go-to now I'm curious
effect at the Braille we thought that
was a real thing oh I don't know
Wow sneakers 1990 and the cast was like
couldn't be stopped Sidney Poitier who's
Robert Redford not the Redford River
Phoenix isn't that movie as he mentioned
David's truth heron as the blind guy
Kingsley right Wow
it was like every single person in this
movie was a huge star yeah Wow you
everyone that Kinect came out a few
years ago people were kind of freaking
out about this same sort of copyright
law issue where people were just
scanning things oh yeah and I remember
Disney sort of took issue with it
because they were like well if you start
scanning our action figures you're gonna
violate our copyright laws and it kind
of had to adjust the rules based on that
but I feel like you could scan people's
faces too and just have a sort of a
picture of them which is sort of the
same thing as just taking a regular
photo right I think the thing with the
sound that a 3d printer makes it's like
you know I think that's just like a very
temporary thing too though cuz like odds
are that technology moves on begin and
changes and maybe become silent or you
just program it so it adds noise
randomly you know what I know that white
noise on top of a printing exactly yeah
I would wanna like make the noise and
print out the noise you know and see
what that makes like no you know if
Justin got it
you mean like onomatopoeia like you're
saying the noise yeah I'm saying the
printer noise maybe you just say like
desk this is so nerdy but there was a
YouTube video that I saw I'll try to
defend it to you after this but someone
used a spectral sound analyzer to use
their voice to do exactly what you said
to make basically make pictures sure in
the equalizer yeah so you could just by
going like this yeah like you know
create a spike and then use
now you could draw things like you know
we've talked about based on that the
crazy like hidden messages stuff before
right right in popular songs but though
and also that but like the sounds that
those pictures make and that make sense
in your head oh yeah they're all like
staticky crazy like right like weird
stuff
oh there was one song that was in that
segment we gotta go back and listen to
yeah are so we got to listen to what the
hell it is we were talking where it
painted over the course of an entire
track it painted a photo if you isolated
this guy's voice it pinned a picture of
a scary face yeah love that so much and
really creepy but I don't think people
put that level of effort in anymore well
yeah a little-little
Easter eggs just not like the whole
beutel's thing with paul being dead
right I don't know if that was fan
manufactured it 100% was not are you
kidding me are they they've talked about
it they don't need to talk about there's
so much stuff that's like as it goes
farther and further along once you dig
in all you do is get dirty like weird
backwards phone number and the cover for
Sarhad peppers Oh Steinem and it you
call it a number he's the walrus and
he's the walrus which is death
apparently I guess obviously it's the
Grim Reaper or the walrus it's a man I
whether it's real or not even though I'm
pretty sure it's real I love that stuff
it's so interesting why it's cool I love
having fun yeah what was the last really
cool thing like that
popular culture Jack White had that
special vinyl that came out a couple
years ago that people were freaking
their beaks about it was freaking their
beak so you know when a record turns it
created this weird hologram that was
projected on top of the record of a
dancing ballerina that was kind of cool
and then how do you set the needle
halfway on to a groove it would play a
different song there's like two
different versions of the song depending
on where you on the record how did it
make also in Reverse because there was a
photo that was printed onto the onto the
sticker yeah on the middle of a thing
and then when that turned I guess it
like reflected in the cartridge that's
crazy
picture and then you told me something
ll that was the crazy thing too is the
sticker they actually printed grooves
underneath the labels are you peel and
so you could put the you didn't have to
do that you could put did needle
directly onto the sticker and it will
play a hidden track very short that was
medical I remember there is something
super weird that they put in a magazine
oh it was an advertisement yeah a credit
card I think it was American Express
I remember you bringing that and what
could you do you could like play it
somewhere
ah what the hell was it a long ago
there's a lot of weird stuff like that
but you're right it does seem like the
fun of that has has been kind of you
know disappearing from the zeitgeist
yeah yeah I kind of wish that stuff's no
advice buys physical shit anymore yeah
actually I was gonna talk to you guys
about this - did you guys know that if
you print a print job using a color
laser printer you can actually track
that job back to the source and actually
find out what the serial number for the
printer way was built on wait a minute
now you said that I will try and Reese a
it to you yeah okay you're saying that
if I print anything using a laser print
color laser printer has to be has to be
color okay that's a huge caveat okay so
I print a photo of my kid on a laser
printer the color laser printer any good
some kind of warning factor yeah so how
does that work
so I don't think a lot of people know
this but it's kind of the only
interesting thing about consumer-level
laser printer and why only color well
the reason why is because way back I
think it was in the 80s they would
started doing this all the printer
manufacturers do this to Canon Xerox I
got the reason why service
yeah Norfolk County came out of it
exactly why so every color laser prints
a copy of a unique ID that goes back to
the printer manufacturer to prevent
counterfeiting so and it's like just
embedded so yeah and this happened back
when color lasers were invented I think
in the 80s the government and printer
companies established a partnership and
agreed to do this silently Wow
if you go back you can actually read
when this was discovered by the
Electronic Frontier Foundation I think
it was back in the 90s like ten years
after it was invented so if you look at
a printed page I brought something out
for you it doesn't matter because you
can't actually see it but if you held
that piece of paper that was printed on
a color laser if you held that
underneath a bright blue light or a
microscope you'll actually be able to
see these dots that you can trace back
to the source and you can't see them
there so so that's wrong actually a page
it's just in ones this is I know what it
looks like and I'm sorry for the maybe
you can narrate what I'm showing okay so
it kind of looks like a so this is a
sample of like a light see if you yeah
if you held a color laser printed page
underneath a microscope it's a series of
little yellow dots and if you sort of
start to decode this this is for Xerox
but every manufacturer has their own
code you can see that it shows the time
that a print job oh wow so there's like
a whole Colgate and also the unique
serial number for the hardware that it
was printed on so you could check out oh
this was printed on like a Xerox model
number whatever that's cool and exactly
when it was printed so it's like almost
like this like birth certificate kind of
thing yeah yeah where that's so weird
they know does like Epson know what
printer I'm using based on the serial
numbers so the lesson here that we have
to learn is never register your printer
right is that the serial number will
come back to you and if you ever end up
selling your printer or throwing it away
on the street where I see a lot of those
they'll stay it'll still stay with it
and if someone decides to you know try
to scan now that there is like you know
flatbed scanners and printers you try to
scan a dollar bill that will get
reported back to the internet they don't
allow like most printers correct me if
I'm wrong won't print or scan anything
that looks like a dollar bill yeah if
you try and if you zoom with Photoshop
yeah Photoshop won't let you import a
legal note right believe me I've tried
it'll actually pop up a little window
will pop up yeah try to photos yeah nope
not word it's like do you really think
it's that easy
yeah it's like deal do you think I'm an
idiot yeah do you think I'm a damn it
not the first time it's been tried
before but it still exists and it's
funny cuz printer manufacturers will not
acknowledge it but you can go back and
check out the e FF article and everyone
does it so what's cursing is I was smart
to not have a printer for the last five
years everyone yeah do not buy one or at
least just don't buy a laser
well inkjet look Justin you did it you
said you want you you know are you gonna
make burning sexy and interesting yeah
yep yeah
freakin nailed it very well cuz it's
just really impressive stuff that was
really rad yeah well I'm glad you
enjoyed it
well that was like 10 years worth of
printer attack Oh interesting tech and
now I could wait like another 10 years
yeah that's it we're good
you talked about this Twitter cheating
oh yeah yeah it's kind of crazy
wait do we have time to talk about both
this and the VRS
okay because I really want to talk about
the VR stuff this is your show today
buddy thanks guys yeah you guys let him
you talk about whatever and then maybe
DuckTales really important story it's
very important for us yeah so you can
check to see if your partner is cheating
on you on tinder Oh $10 Twitter no no
tinder you've definitely set a Twitter
before tinder which is apparently a
thing because I guess someone did a
study about tinder users and they found
out that 40% 46% of the people they
surveyed we're actually in a
relationship but also on tinder at this
yeah but how many of them cuz I've seen
like like women at parties and I'm not
making generalizations but I've
literally seen this where they like get
on tinder as like a fun activity and be
like no swipes why trying to cheat
that's just like so they're tourists
they're tourists exactly
especially for people that got together
before some of these popular dating apps
yeah like my girlfriend and I met on
OkCupid that's like love letters now
yeah compared to when they have oh you
mean it's like much more romantic yeah
exactly it's like the it was like the
eHarmony basically went
is the myspace you were literally
writing love letters yeah each other cuz
it wasn't just like a one-line text
marriage like tender well so what do you
think but but like tinder as much as
people knock on it like it does just
make sense like it's still it's the
least path of resistance for dating so
essentially you have to put the least
amount of effort in and I mean you get
out of it obviously the failure rate
presumably I haven't used it myself but
the failure failure rates got to be
pretty high yeah but it also the time
commitments very low so I just I me and
I don't and you know the I'm gonna say
what everyone thinks where it's like you
break tinder down yeah you are just
basically playing this game of hmm would
I have sex with this person of course
and that's but that's all what
everything is that whatever it is it is
but I also feel like the the path to
that end was in the past
it was more colorful it was more varied
yeah it seemed like trying to pretend
that it was like act like I come from a
better place of like relationships I'm
not trying to see it cuz I get it right
you're just we're just going a to be
instead of like a with a long hands role
Laden I'm your auntie you get a big I
get it and people do still use tinder
you have friends that have gotten
married that Medellin oh really I do
have one friend Wow who's marrying a
tinder yeah that's really I exposed a
friend on tinder last week what I don't
I'm not on tinder but I noticed that he
had uploaded a brand new batch of photos
on Facebook that were very flattering
for him and not that he's like an ugly
guy or anything like that but when
someone replaces all their photos on
Facebook you're gonna start to wonder
and I kind of put it together because
tinder takes the photos you can't really
control that shows you your mutual
friends on there and that's how the
website we forget how ingrained tinder
is with Facebook
like I noticed yeah you could upload
some flatteries yourself nice need to
hit the reset button a little bit you're
right yeah well that's the whole point
of this story too is that it's not
really easy to hide yourself on that
anymore
namely if you're trying to find it to
use it to find a side piece and a lot of
people are doing that so I think the
cool thing about this whole story and
it's I think it's the first thing you
should know is that tinder has an open
API okay which I didn't realize that
before we're reading about this I think
OkCupid does too doesn't it doesn't I
know they do a lot of their data sharing
but I don't mean it might not be
completely open yeah well tinder is and
I think that's really cool so it has an
open API which means that anyone can
develop apps based on the the open
source code all right
so someone use that code to develop an
app called swipe Buster oh all right
swipe Buster lets you see if your Esso
is cheating on you and all it costs is
five dollars so you donate five dollars
to the service and then you can type in
the name age and location of any person
that you want right so you type in the
name of your s o where they are and and
how old they are and then the app crawls
all of the data and tracks back to see
if there are any users basically just
doing a simple search through their own
API and then displays to you their photo
and all of their information so a lot of
people are starting to catch their okay
so let me ask you this question since it
already tracks what your mutual friends
are couldn't you just get a mutual
friend of your significant other to sign
up yes yeah and match with them yes you
could have always done that right yeah
okay
yeah so it's really easy and actually I
know someone who was caught that way to
my god but the thing is it's not always
a guarantee that just because a person's
profile is up on there it doesn't
necessarily necessarily mean that it's
them
right because we know somebody I'm not
sure if you even know this story but we
know someone that was not exposed but a
friend of theirs sent them a profile
that was using their photo on a popular
dating website but because he's you know
a good-looking guy yeah
it was sort of like they were getting
astroturf oh yeah and someone stole
their identity by using their phone and
I think that's happened a few tit has
happened a few times and that surprised
David of course not but imagine that if
your Esso comes up to you and is like
dude so my friend caught you on a dating
website yeah what the hell man you go
and be humming back trying to go on
dates with the marketing photo or was it
like that from their social media but
like on a profile page on a profile
because someone could just list and put
on their profile so it was trying to
catfish another person well the crazy
thing oh man it's just like and it was
like a different name yes like oh like
it wasn't Jeff it was Jeff right like
and it happened a few times I mean you
know it's good thing he didn't really
get in trouble for it yeah it could of
if it was one of us you told me like
someone on the street recognized yes
yeah but it wasn't him no because well
at that point count no his friend had
previously been like had sent him a
screen show right the profile was like
is this you yeah I think I was like no
it wasn't you know who we're talking
about I just someone says okay
unbelievable story and I wish yourself
but it kind of goes to show you that
even if someone catches you on here
that's not necessarily an indication
that they're cheating right you also
have to be super good-looking what what
is the like so tinder obviously is right
now the like lowest path resistance for
dating mm-hmm how much lower can we go
well there's happen okay what does they
know that one now that one sort of uses
your geo tag location okay
to show where other users are in your
area that you might have just passed by
which is kind of creepy but it's been
around for a while now a lot of my
friends are on it sure and so he's
actually one of my friends that's been
doing it demoed it in front of me and
it'll tell you when you've crossed paths
with someone and and the frequency of
which you've liked weird so like oh
you've like you passed this person every
day on your commute to work crazy you
can message them and they're like a mile
away from you right now I think that I
see I think like that's just as much of
a barriers yeah that seems yeah
yeah I mean I think when it first came
out that was kind of a creepy thing but
it's been off
while so that's like old I guess it's
like that yo app would be the lowest
right no I think like just photos of
penises and vaginas I think like peas
and Vees is what you call it like and
you just swipe through dicks unicorn
right here but that like makes sense
right like like what else do you need to
see yeah like just need you're just
looking at their face you're like well
is your face yeah what did you write
that in all honesty it should just be
nudes at this point but with maybe not
with faces in them
right that's what like a full body
that's why I just see at here at peas
and v--'s when you download our app we
make sure to always mosaic out your face
or not if you don't want or not you can
easily check that box with our
easy-to-use interface yeah
peas and bees in your local App Store or
Google Play stood a today use this QR
code it's just a dick jeez this QR code
I'm see like I don't think that's that
crazy yet inside it's not as yeah it's
not crazier than like an Ashley Madison
or something like that yeah for people
to just get straight to it it's just not
yeah I just want to know what 30 years
from now like what is the grandpa like
me as a grandpa looking at the new
dating app what am I like shocked at I
don't see how P how could it be more
shocking than peas and Vees yes already
there
I mean maybe like colon health becomes
like the most important no that doesn't
shop I can't see that I can't see is
going in that direction you never know
you never know that's weird man it's
weird but it really makes you think
about your personal information that's
online because it could be any of us
this happens to whether it's Facebook or
tender right it kind of just goes back
to that lesson that we always talk about
which is if you sign up for a service
that's free you are the product yeah
even if you sign up a service like
Netflix yeah totally it's really easy to
just go on there I worry a lot about
that like I just worry about one day
everything just getting out there yeah
you know also one needs to do is write
an app for it and then it'll happen yeah
I guess so
that's creepy I don't want to get creepy
tonight because it's Passover I want to
UM I want to talk a little bit
more about VR we haven't talked about VR
in a couple weeks I'm surprised I
thought you guys you know you're both
gamers you're not really into talking
about it we've talked about it a lot um
I I I've used oculus and and vive have
you used both I have and and what is
your general thought I love it yeah I
think it's really fun I mean I you would
why I'm kidding what do you mean I mean
oh you guys are we're not bitter about
I'm not bitter I just I just like you
know I just try and think about it
practically hope I thought I yeah I'm
like this is not fun for more than 20
minutes but that's the thing that I feel
like a lot of the best VR apps aren't
gonna be fun they're gonna be stuff that
seems mundane now but then when we know
like like for example I used one for the
rift that was like a VR replica a
desktop replicator that basically
replaces a monitor and it you know you
could have as many tab door/window
browser browsers open at once and you're
sort of just in like this giant like
Matrix Reloaded screen stack where
you're turning around 360 monitors
everywhere around and but is that
something that's what you want I would
love that yeah how long could you be in
that environment that forever I can't I
don't find video I find VR very cool but
it's really not relaxing so specifically
for like gaming where I like to like
relax and sit on a couch or whatever
it's not bad no I played rez oh yeah be
in VR and that was well that's awesome
and like was it Joe yeah I wish I was
playing it on Wednesday yeah it was
awesome
like I definitely felt a place of like
tranquility like I was just like oh I
not me it was basically the thing that
made me say mmm I need to get places
wait what is res so res is like a rhythm
kind of shooter game that's been out for
like it first debuted almost like 20
years ago I wanna see maybe even longer
ago and it's just very like vector II
you know that scene in lawnmower man yes
line yeah that's kind of like that okay
but it's like it's peaceful because it's
not violent and it's just like not scary
but they basically made a VR
version of it okay and there's music and
there's music and like a lot of fly
through and a lot of like I feel like
okay I kind of thing um have you played
it yet I'm playwrights now it's really
good and they did a great job with it
in psvr and I just feel like I could see
myself getting lost there I played it
for a half hour and I was like yep I
could do that I could do that can you
imagine putting a VR helmet on and like
taking a nap and then waking up and
you're just like in a stage it's gonna
happen tell you're really cool I mean
it's Pryor already happened they could
do totally like where they do like those
sensory deprivation chambers yeah like
that sort of environment yeah I still I
still and never totally tricked if that
makes sense like yeah I like VR is not
good enough yet where it's
indistinguishable from real but you've
never been in a situation where
everything is silent around you you've
never been like in like a totally quiet
room yeah no I've never been
incarcerated in solitary Plus everything
that you're doing is very graphics and
you so that makes it obviously not real
well I also mean like it doesn't look
real hmm but like it looks like
computer-generated Graham but how you
360-degree videos in VR um yes and I
still think there's a bit of like screen
Doering yeah like some stuff where I can
just tell like oh I'm looking at a
screen yeah I mean I think we've talked
about this a bunch like ten years from
now yeah that probably will go away when
you have like an 8k yeah projections
situations yeah you know like that'll be
great but I definitely my brain it's
gonna die yeah what does it job
simulator yeah I did oh my god that one
hilarious why it's hilarious and fun and
you really I mean I really felt like
you're reaching out and like grab and
stuff off the shelves like I just love
like grabbing all the shit off the
shelves and be like I don't need this
it's fun there's just no way to convey
there's no way that it doesn't sound
totally I know that's why I like I kind
of wish I could bring it like bring it
home this weekend you should yeah I
can't it's a vibe is a huge pain
oculus is like not what you want to show
people in my opinion right now no you
don't think I just don't think it's that
impressive like I think vive blows it
out of the water right now
what's the killer I guess some the space
game is the killer Eve Eve Valkyrie Eve
yeah I don't know uh what did you
brought it up because you want to talk
about like other applications yeah yeah
so I wanted to talk about some lesser
discussed games in VR I guess you
wouldn't even call them games because
it's not really fun so stuff that could
be a little bit disturbing mikono in VR
oh no Russ I'm glad that you brought up
torture okay that's what I want to talk
about yeah well you brought up sensory
deprivation that's not torture it's
relaxing okay yeah so I guess I can for
either either way like you want it like
like one of those like floating yeah
sort of exactly same tank so you guys
have read kill screen right we had a
Jamin war and on from that website yeah
so kill screen published an article that
I thought was really interesting talking
about the possibility of using VR to aid
in real life torture scenarios you know
either used by law enforcement or the
government or just criminals like people
that just are using it for bad reasons
and they interviewed this VR collective
called be another lab okay who make this
claim that the military is either
working on it right now or they will be
very soon have to be yeah definitely and
it immediately brought up a sort of
images of like a Clockwork Orange or
never in Street Fighter the movie were
they like made Charlie into Blancas by
just showing him like messed up photos
and videos of war is God Kyle's friend
who becomes Kyle yeah yeah he becomes
Blanca in that movie oh that's weird
that you know but you know it really
shows you since movies are a true mirror
of our lives right it shows you how
being subjected forcefully to some of
those images can really drive someone
crazy yeah yeah so you know think about
stuff like when you're in solitary
confinement people wind up going nuts
and maybe even committing suicide
because they've done that or you know
look at something another example in pop
culture would be the giver right yeah
yeah just like seeing messed-up stuff
you brought up the giver with Russ
that's right I do remember that how dare
you pick old scab there's there's
totally a handful of people listening
who remember all this this is prior to
the movie coming yeah Russ ruined the
book the giver to me and you know that
big detail about that book that you find
out that's all you can do in it now yeah
it's on one page I was at the page
before it was like 187 house on 185 it's
a great twist it's a great especially
because it's a book anyway anyway that's
a dark don't you think really I mean
there's no examples that we can really
sight right now because we don't know if
it's happening or not but I'm sure it
will exist on Guantanamo very very it
makes sense because think about it what
they're using now it's like sleep
deprivation which is what you're talking
about
we're just super bright rooms with like
blaring music or sound to keep people up
if all you had to do was put a helmet on
them
alright you could just have like eight
of those in a single room and it'd be
fine yeah yeah I mean yeah obviously
people will be upset about it the way we
are upset about waterboarding and stuff
like right I mean yes obviously if like
the military dabbled with like telepathy
and like stuff like that they sure as
shit are gonna do stuff that's real yeah
well you know like VR torture or think
about how you know how a lot of amputees
get PTSD and experience that thing
called phantom limb yeah yeah right
where you sort of don't really your
knowledge thing that you're not
acknowledging the fact that like you've
lost right limb well you actually you
feel pain yeah and so imagine you know
maybe your mind can develop this idea of
like feeling pain mental
being assisted by a VR headset that
could actually happen in a torture
scenario I'm it's a really you know and
it's just all this is happening so fast
yeah yeah it is
it's I think a very interesting I notion
of VR is like seeing just what your
brain is capable of doing right because
of just what you see yeah right so like
we know your brain is super powerful it
can like redirect you know you know pain
numbing things or you know I can it it's
really in control of your body right
like obviously but it also can do things
that seem unnatural right right so I
want to know like Oh what can we like
maybe we are able to activate something
yeah not like a stupid you know more
than a hood you presume your brain
minute like not like that maybe we can
activate things that don't occur in
nature that you can't see in nature but
somehow we can you know ring the bell in
in VR do you know what I mean yeah do
you already have something in mind no I
don't know maybe I mean anything could
be sexual it could be right
cognitive it could be who knows it could
be feeling yeah you know some sort of
feeling the most disturbing thing that I
ever saw an oculus rift was an app
called I animal have you guys seen that
one No so I animal you're already in the
the gulch of VR yeah yeah no no I've
just used it here okay but you don't
know why just until 10 o'clock yeah so I
animal is developed by this company
called
animal equity which is kind of like PETA
you see with this yeah I animal
simulates and puts you into the body of
a pig in a slaughterhouse which is
messed up because we've all seen those
PETA YouTube videos that take you sort
of like a first-hand look inside one of
those yes yeah but it's a totally
different experience when you become the
animal right so um I think the thing
that's really crazy about this is that
on they use binaural recordings do you
really feel the the room directionally
just by the sounds
so you're hearing things like like
grinding noises you're hearing like just
below where your ears are you hear your
throat right but you're not but you're
not a pig okay you're not a pig but when
you see it you're in the body of a pig
so when you look down you see pigs hooks
of course but like a head through the
whole lineup and Tony's it's really
really it is much more effective than
just watching I'm sure it is and I don't
want to I again like I walk a very weird
line when it comes to this kind of stuff
yeah I like up essentially when you
experience that you are just a human
being wearing a pig costume yeah you're
saying you don't believe that animals
have that sort of consciousness they do
well obviously a pig doesn't know it's
being led to slaughter or this be this
huge pig of upright you know upheaval
and there would be this uprising and
they'd be like fuck this I'm not going
in there again like I am NOT you know
endorsing inhumane treatment of animals
I eat meat I respect people who don't
eat meat and get it I just think like
you are playing a very confusing and
potentially deceiving game right that's
what that's the I get it your holiness I
get it the whole idea is like you know
pig is just as smart as you right right
you know like it's just it's just as
important and I get and I understand
that mentality I'm not trying to talk
shit about it but again what you're
simulating is a human in a pig costume
right right they're leaving it up to the
user to sort of right and I get it like
draw their own meaning totally right I'm
just saying that's what that is yeah
what if what about the people that say
like a pig is as smart as like a
two-year-old yeah sure
so you're but you agree with that okay
but a two-year-old would crawl into the
meat grinder none of this is real
there's no
it's not real that they're not actually
a pig when they put the headset on
they're not surprised when they take it
off
yeah human again I don't want people to
be upset I yeah I am totally
compassionate hmm - but it is messed up
it's it I think it is a messed up idea
that you're like they're not forcing
anyone to watch it and I also think like
if you're interested there's a value in
seeing like where your food comes of
course and I think everybody should
watch Austin Walker from Giant Bomb was
talking about this it's doc called like
our daily bread yeah which is like yeah
you see what just what happens yeah I
choose not to why of course u-turn
u-turn u-turn in a blind yeah right but
yeah some people just like to disturb
themselves what they do changing
lifestyles I guess guess so last one
that I wanted to talk about that was
crazy
sure um I haven't had a chance to test
this out yet but I really want to it's
called Taff Phobos what you know what -
phobia is know it's a fear of being
buried alone Oh No well your fear would
be getting drowned at sea yes I know how
much you hate you there's an app that's
coming for that in VR we're like here's
an app in VR where you're just like
projected into space yeah what is that
no that's not a drift drift no no not a
drift but just like in like this tons of
space apps where you're just alone in
space it seems boring yeah I feel like
no but then you just get sucked into the
Sun after like a couple minutes is that
good or bad I I have a fear of like
enormity okay the vastness of the ocean
at terrifies like that movie that movie
with a couple gets yeah that's that you
shut your mouth is that it's called open
waters water they're on like a scuba
diving tour and the boat leaves without
them and they're there for like two
hours but to get rescued that matters
the end of that movies they top movies
just like pieces of like flesh it shows
up like wearing a shirt shark like puts
a bib on
yeah that would be a horrible ending
alright so anyway to Phobos it's not a
real app yet but I think it was the it
was the result of a hackathon and these
two guys developed it and I kind of want
to show you guys in the studio cuz the
way it works is crazy so it's a two-man
game right one guide lies down but both
both people have the headsets on okay
one guy lies down right and in his
headset he sees that he's inside of a
coffin okay right posted on the
underside of the coffin lid you see the
guy sees a map right with directions on
how to get to him okay so this is the
other guy
the other guy is at a computer right
also has one of these things on and it's
his job to direct his character to the
guy in the coffin and you have to do a
computer yeah he's at a computer in real
life in real life yeah but with the
headset on understand he's directing his
character to the guy
why does he have the headset on because
he has like I guess it's so that he
could see how much oh you just need a
controller okay so the guy inside the
coffin has to direct him the other guy
to him in a certain amount of time and
the entire time he's doing it yeah you
can see dirt yeah into the the coffin
and again the the binaural recordings
are kind of a crazy thing because you
could hear the direction of where the
dirt is coming in kind of like tapping
around you're slowly building up
building up creepy yeah and if you don't
accomplish the directions in a certain
amount of time the guy dies and he's
really not in real life not in real life
but he sees the the dirt sort of go up
his throat and because close pass its
neck it's really scary you know guys if
you die in VR
think about how many phases of death
videos stopping just using I don't you
like it no I don't like you're almost
excited now you're not good you're very
into VR yeah well just when you think
about like the alternative uses like
this it gets really crazy I think you're
just realizing that VR could be the door
to like the dystopian cyberpunk future
that we're already in right now it goes
way beyond just like pretend you're on
like a scaffolding trying to save a cat
like it's those are like the very minor
sort of we're in the OkCupid phase right
now sure and this is the that's the end
result it's like it reminds me of this
game you're - uh you're just talking to
call keep talking and nobody explodes
you know very cool this is a game where
like you can play in VR you don't have
to but it's said one has it one person
has to be they don't have to be right
they can just not see the directions so
I think you print out a whole manual
okay and the game randomly generates
these sort of like bomb instructions of
how to defuse a bomb you have like a
finder of like 30 pages that you print
out in real life
okay and then yeah right and then all
have you played it yeah so explain it
yeah so you have this button so one
person has this binder that they're not
wearing a helmet the other person is
wearing a helmet and they see the bomb
in front of them and the other person
that they and the person wearing the
helmet basically has to say like okay I
see this bomb I see there's a clock in
the center of it there's a little blue
screw on the right side there's a code
on the left side and they have to convey
this information to the person with the
binder and the person with the binders
furiously flipping through it to find
the proper page to a disarm that bomb I
see and it's randomly generated so you
know depending on which challenge you're
doing it's gonna change like the answer
isn't always go to page 27 huh so it's
like you're frantically like it's like
very cool so what are you describing
when you see the parts is it like so
it'll be like are there no some of them
it yeah sometimes it's like here's a
blue wire and he's a red wire sometimes
it's like there's four press buttons and
you need to figure out what order to
pray Wow
and you have to do an assertive time
yeah yeah okay yeah it's real it's
really cool it's really really cool feel
like you would dig that just yeah that
sounds like a cool party game so we're
almost out of time to do this ducktales
thing are we talking about doctor and
save it if we're out of time it's fine
life is like oh we were just gonna sing
ducktales now you'll just have to wait
till next time - you're ducking I
thought it was Chippendales that you
wanted to talk about the Rescue Rangers
yeah no I
I mean since we weren't gonna play I do
want to mention the Chippendales theme
song has a long version that's about
three and half inch long yeah I'm
surprised that was the thing like where
did they use that probably on an album
like a Disney the album they released
just of the intro to Chippendales well
we just know it would be like all
business the answer would and also I
think a lot of those theme songs
probably have originally have a long
version like ducktales is a long version
shut it down so you're saying that
there's a very impressive solo within
the song
yeah that's right in rescue rangers
Google Rescue Rangers there's a three
and a half minute version okay listen
the whole thing because the whole song
is dynamite but about halfway through
about two minutes in is one of the best
saxophone solos I've ever heard in my
entire life you obviously haven't heard
a lot of sex um you guys talked right
over it so you missed all the magic of
it it's spectacular
it reminds me of the the sax solo in
when the going gets tough yes by Billy
ocean a song that you absolutely love
well let's go to do you know where when
you can start around 150 oh so you
actually memorized where we're at here
wait for it I mean this is like hot 80s
like I think this is how we should leave
everyone today real quick pop quiz if
you're a big Chippendales fan who were
the to Chip and Dale characters based on
you can tell by their clothing but quite
hypo I believe it's one of them no wrong
I don't know the one you should really
be able to tell my god he's got a hat on
is about leather jacket Indiana Jones
the other one who's wearing self why is
shirt in I don't know a magnum p.i oh
that's who they're supposed to be right
we talked right over the solo is know we
heard it was in the back it felt good
man I don't remember that being this
emotional when they're around the chips
are never down that's some lyricism
right there I feel like we should get
Bridget in here right yes your allusion
kinda looks like that character am i
right what's her name gadget Bridget
that's not an insult cutest kid I feel
like every young boy had crushes on that
character that cartoon time that could
be true or not your name gadget was it
really a gadget hack wrench was her name
oh that's a pain why the hell were they
even wearing clothes like they wore
these stupid outfits but like all their
junk is flapping in the wind anyway well
gadget wore clothes yeah she worked
those she was a little modest that's
funny man thanks for sharing that those
those those great they really put me in
a good mood for the weekend eight six
