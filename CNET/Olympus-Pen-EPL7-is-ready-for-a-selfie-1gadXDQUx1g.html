been waiting for the right camera to
upgrade from your smartphone then
Olympus has a solution for you it's
called the pen light EP l7 I'm Lexi CBDs
from seenot I'm going to take you on a
first look through the camera and a
couple of its features if you're
familiar with any of the old Olympus PEN
cameras then the EPL 7 what come as much
of a surprise to you but if you're a
newbie to it and you love your selfies
this camera is designed specifically for
you because it has a touchscreen that
comes down 180 degrees below the lens
like so now Olympus has told me that
this is because when the camera screen
is below the lens you're more likely to
make it look like you're actually
looking in the lens even when you're
checking yourself out so I'm going to
test this out here's me looking normally
into the lens and here's me looking into
the screen checking myself out as you
can see it looks like I'm staring into
the lens for both of those photos so
Olympus I'll give you this one elsewhere
on the spec sheet it is quite similar to
the EPL 5 camera from a couple of years
ago you get a live moss censor 16.1
megapixels - the same resolution
interchangeable lenses and a 3 axis
image stabilizer which is pretty handy
if you're holding the camera out at
arm's length taking all of those selfies
elsewhere you get full manual controls
plus Olympus's art filters there are two
extra ones included this time a vintage
color effect as well as a partial color
effect and this will also show on the
screen when you're taking a photo in
this mode the color wheel so you can
choose which color you want to emphasize
and make pop against a monochrome
background of course you get full HD
video recording at 1080p however you
don't get many selectable frame options
actually don't get any at all but
fortunately you do have some other
controls such as manual exposure and
audio control
connectivity is via Wi-Fi and the setup
is pretty simple all you have to do is
take a photo of the QR code on the back
of the camera screen with your
smartphone or tablet and this
establishes the connection with the app
on top of all that you get in camera HDR
a live composite mode for long exposures
and fast continuous shooting at 8 frames
a second the maximum shutter speed is
also 1/4 thousandth of a second which is
not as fast as a pro DSLR but it's
pretty good nonetheless flash is not
included in the camera body
unfortunately you have to actually
remove this on the hot shoe this little
port and then attach the included
external flash which you can also tilt
up and bounce around as required this
has been a first look at the Olympus PEN
light EP l7 check out heaps more specs a
photo gallery and more over at CNET</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
