out for dang so this happened late last
week but we have to talk about the the
Big Apple leaks from 95 Mac they they
posted some photos of the the new images
and specifically give gave us a name to
work on the iPhone X s or the iPhone 10
s if you want to go with the official
naming scheme and then a leak of the
Apple watch series for not a lot huge in
terms of difference with the iPhone in
particular but it has me kind of
confused about the the naming scheme if
it's the XS or the 10s but there are
three different ones tens or the ten
yeah how's that gonna work I I you know
what I'm not really excited about it I I
guess they have a new color or something
like that we going I mean I'm sure the
camera is gonna be better I'm sure the
processor is gonna be better I'm sure
it's probably gonna be some new way to
unlock your phone or like face ideas
improved well I think the big thing here
is the confirmation that you know we're
all getting notches if we're if you're
an iPhone user looking upgrade you're
gonna end up with the knotch notches
will be on all the new phones what if
the circle on the invite was actually a
very zoomed in headphone jack and
they're bringing it that's variable
thinking that is really wishful thinking
and highly unlikely well we also wanted
to talk about the Apple watch series for
that's actually getting a facelift after
three years of pretty much the same
looking watch it looks a little bit
flatter may be thinner I'm not sure and
like the iPhone 10 smaller bezels bigger
display give it give a notch on the
watch to the notch watch well I like
that the watch notch but you know what
that at least that's something for
SmartWatch fans get excited about it is
at least a new looking device and a
newish looking device next up we want to
wish a happy birthday to chrome the
browser celebrates its 10th anniversary
the 10th anniversary of its launch today
it's gone from this time project that
was initially laughed at to know the
most dominant browser in the world
it's insane so Google Chrome has
actually had the longest reign on
like popular browsers out of everybody
they surprised right like Internet
Explorer yeah and it wasn't even like a
default it's still not a default like
browser that's built in on any figure I
mean unless you're using Chromebooks
obviously right but people actively have
to like get out to use it right and look
there have been a lot of positives for
for Chrome we should list out the fact
that it's it's really sped things up
right and they've really kind of pushed
things push the industry to move faster
with browsers they made the mobile
experience a lot better
they've those helps up a lot of
standards but it's gotten the point
where it's so powerful is we have to ask
if that's a great thing yeah a lot of
people are turning on Chrome in the
sense of you know Mozilla now along with
other browsers like DuckDuckGo well no
duck taco is a is a great search engine
brakes are a blessing of have been
basically blocking trackers by default
Safari does the same thing now Google is
kind of in a weird area with that
because of the nature of how Google
makes its money exactly you know as one
of the top at probably the top like
advertisers online you know they really
rely on that tracking data so that's one
issue the other issues you know if
everyone's using Chrome then there's not
really that much room for like diversity
or changes or anything like that so like
if you ever tried using slack on an on
Chrome browser or even Gmail like
they'll keep nudging it's like hey would
you like to download Chrome yeah so I
think that's like the bigger challenge
for Chrome now lastly Facebook Google
and Twitter are appearing for Congress
tomorrow to talk about the impact of
foreign influence on social media that's
especially timely given the upcoming
midterm elections what do you expect in
here I mean I think you know a lot of it
will be Facebook Twitter and Google
basically running up what they've said
for the last few months now the efforts
that they've put in to try to detect
these you know influence campaign from
foreign nations this Iran discovery that
was revealed a few weeks ago that will
probably take a big part of it and as
well as a response or an answer to
president Trump's tweets about you know
right censoring conservative voices on
their platforms I think that will get a
lot of play time as well
all right so for full coverage of the
hearings follow us on CNET or mutter
Chang I'm alfred ring thanks listening
all right thanks everybody for joining
us for their court recording Wow
yikes cannot talk today though recording
of the audio podcast you'll find out
where to subscribe and listen that down
below and shortly in the show right now
we're going to dive into the chat and
dig out your questions and comments and
keep the conversation going
thanks everybody again for joining us
let's start off with one of my favorite
conspiracy theorist apec I think Apple
leaked this themselves ooh why I don't I
would like if they would leak something
themselves wanted they'd leave something
right there it was exciting I think they
got the information from a 95 got that
information from a source that was
within Apple that like was accidentally
streamed out so they I think it was
legally colleagues are from the
companies themselves right like this was
this was an unintentional stream right
they I think they were kind of running
yeah they definitely wasn't planned at
all this wasn't like a leak that they'd
planted of all the leaks this if this
you know this would probably be the most
boring one I've seen right here's a
phone that we've seen and well you know
the watches the content was kind of
exciting because it was confirmation
that we are getting a different even if
it's slightly different a tweet version
of the Apple watch
give me an Apple watch with a camera you
really want a camera no but give me one
like literally just give me an Apple
watch for Valley yeah can't help you
there and if it has a camera that's you
know the better yeah you know we the
original gear the Samsung camera like
awful yeah well there was a camera in
the the strap mm-hmm and when you did
this it looks super creepy
of course yeah walk around be like hey
you do this without a a camera actually
right but no I don't think this is a
Apple's attention they usually try to
keep a fairly tight ship obviously the
leaks happen all the time with Apple so
that's kind of a comical statement but
Apple I doubt this was intended right
you ready for another ready for another
I'm not yeah okay here's one from Connor
her and this was a recent one don't
worry I'll go back there's a lot piling
up
from Connor Hearn why not the 2018
iPhone is 6.1 inch the five point eight
inch be the iPhone pro itthat's why
would we go that boring you know with
the s convention if they gonna try to
work in the S convention
I feel like Apple does a lot of great
things naming products is not one of
them sometimes they're a little
arbitrary right there like they have
numbers and then they drop the numbers
and then the add words to them it's all
kind of it's harder it's a hard to guess
what Apple is gonna do because they seem
to switch things up a lot yeah remember
he s e we're right the like that like
name doesn't even really matter anymore
well I think there's gonna be nice okay
I like where they call it I'm just just
purely name name naming alone like just
that right right right
what are they gonna call like the SE - I
don't really like this doesn't make any
sense I think they just didn't though
for the sequel they just kept calling it
the iPhone se that that might also work
they should just do that they should
stop with numbers and just like come out
the new the iPhone yeah they just called
the iPhone problem is though they've got
three models with the iPhones I feel
like it's definitely all like a
marketing thing as IO do you have an
iPhone 10 or you have a iPhone trans
well it's gonna be a little rich are you
it's gonna be a little confusing this
time around cuz it's gonna be like via
the iPhone access with extra small you
can s what are you gonna call this thing
numbers are a very uncreative name way
to name your stuff yes so I think it was
fine when we're at the lower numbers but
now that we've gone through like 10
generations just call it the iPhone
that's what like the WWE did that with
like WrestleMania after like 30 they
just started just yeah alright take a
cue from Vince McMahon maybe like it's
such a household product their name now
that like you just call it that and you
sure have the new iPhone you don't have
to how do you how can you tell people
that you have the new iPhone if it is a
different name just put the ear on it
yeah if they're gonna be laying them up
at any convention anyway right just I've
got the iPhone gone to 2018
22 and the 2018 iPhone except there's
three versions of this so I've got the
really big version of the iPhone or 2018
version
there's a diversion we shouldn't even
what's really confusing is the at least
the rumors points you three models but
they aren't like large middle small it's
like there's the large one and then
there's a smaller one that's kind of
like the iPhone ten now and then there's
another large one but with cheaper
components so okay kind of confusing
going back in my previous analogy what
if they did this with cars what if there
was like a 2018 Corvette
excess Corvette XL I mean there are
right I mean sighs but I mean literally
car sizes no they're not sizes but
they're trims right if you decide you
get a Camry there's like the Le XE
there's always different shrimp they
know they sell the crap out of like they
don't they don't know that look like
sneakers either like you know they don't
call it the Air Jordan ones like 2018
edition or something like that there's
only one Air Jordans they sell right now
but they remake they make like og
edition no no but I'm saying like when
they release one they don't release like
three variants today kind of they do
like they'll be like the Gatorade
Jordans and like all these other stuff
but like you just know it from like the
way that it looks or something like that
or you can look on the inside or I'll
tell you the year I wouldn't know it
yeah what I care
yeah but like you can make the same
argument for like people's phones like
you don't look at someone else's calling
I would argue more people that's the I
would I would guess more people look at
the phones when they do are
hardcore but over here is largely the
phone like woof-woof like they're the
Smart Watch or like the Apple watch like
just call it yeah like I mean they'll do
like series 1 or series 2 or whatever
but like throughout it they just say
iPhone like Apple Apple watch yeah they
should do that for their phones like
just just avoid all this confusion true
and the watches aren't as precious as a
phone sorry to get us off topic I just
had this funny image in my head of like
clown car sighs sport cars pakka sighs
as opposed to like a smaller phone
screen sorry my imagination runs when
Apple gives me boring headlines let's go
ahead and take some more questions from
suraíh and Ahmed I is the headphone jack
back headphone jack back no probably
know they have a notch yes all the
offices all the time every I'm sorry to
say if you want to upgrade to new
I phoned this year you're gonna have to
have a notch so you guy started learning
to live with a notch because it's a
lease here to stay for another year or
don't upgrade your phone you don't
really need to feed into a consumer
culture everyday buy an Android phone
yeah but most Android phones don't buy
anything just be happy with what you
have you know you're like glass to do
for a pretty long time yeah I got a new
phone every year Alfred I'll be the
first to say it's been great working
with you you do know where we work right
yes okay I'm trying I'm here as the
counterculture
fight against the Machine guys okay
from Rakesh this is really premature
question but do we have any thoughts
about where the price is gonna take us
no I think everything we've seen is I
think the starting price might be lower
than last year's with that that lower
end model with like the bigger size but
the the cheaper components like no OLED
display I don't know if it'll have face
ID it probably will it won't have like
the nicer camera
I suspect that'll be closer to the
original 650 or maybe a little bit more
expensive that the pricing kind of began
at the year before like back in 2017
they kind of started raising the prices
with the iPhone 8 but I imagine the
prices will be very similar in in
alignment with last year's although
what's the thousand dollar price tag
that'll get you probably the bigger
iPhone 10s fall of you do you remember
when the 10 first came out and everyone
was like oh my god $1,000 per phone yeah
crazy no one's gonna pay for that yeah
then Apple sales like just kind of like
a hodge like joke's on you yeah and then
the note 9 recently came that's like
well yeah yeah what do you think we're
gonna get to a two thousand dollar phone
and why will it be Apple it will be for
a while I'm guessing like a few years
five years baby I don't know if you
think it started out it's $650 it took
us about 10 years 10 years to get to a
thousand you think it'll be another 10
years before 9,000 though he'll be like
it'll be like yeah maybe maybe 10 years
I don't know we'll see how inflation
works too
I like APEC suggestion that the iPhones
should just start using coffee sizes for
names that would be so oh yeah well
that's a Starbucks but I'm just go uh
Liam and large I'd be okay with that
give them t-shirt sizes if anything now
they partner up with Starbucks they
totally do it it's totally apropos I
know I would be pretty annoyed because I
get those sizes mixed up constantly I
don't go starbucks enough to like know
what the sizes are like i don't know
what a venti is that a medium that's
small
what's that i actually don't go to
starbucks yeah I don't either
so I don't get I don't drink coffee yeah
I try not to drink Starbucks coffee you
guys are in the minority here yeah let's
go ahead and take some more we got about
oh maybe seven minutes left in this show
help me keep an eye on the clock guys
all right we'll the iPhone be dual SIM
and that's coming from mode I believe
the rumors point to at least some
variants of the iPhone having dual SIM
but they won't be coming to the US so
probably be coming to India certain
emerging markets where dual SIM phones
are a lot more popular give me dual sims
on the watches that's a big watch yeah I
don't I don't need it at all yeah you
wouldn't pay for the one sim I have the
rumor that we didn't really break into
we did talked about in the podcast is
that I think the Apple watch is going
with all LTE models they're not gonna
have like a Wi-Fi all in the model like
you have to buy you don't have to
subscribe but you have to like they're
basically breaking it down to like
here's one like LTE plus Wi-Fi model for
you to get you don't have to use the LG
LTE capability but is there any ways
that is frustrating because like you
know the Wi-Fi only model was always
like the cheaper cheaper yeah see what
they get the pricing I do enjoy like you
know if I'm I am really like I'm really
interested in like using your watch as a
phone just because like I would like to
spend less time you know ranking at my
phone all the time yeah that being said
I know it's not exactly feasible like
from other reviews that we've done like
no bill if you if you leave your watch
and just I mean leave your phone and
just relying or watch solely
you get like maybe an hour yeah yeah
it's not it's not great
yeah and also that being said like I
don't even like I think I was really
excited about when I first was like oh I
can make all these calls with just my
phone and then I'm like I'm 25 I don't
really like make phone calls anymore
right like it's it's all just text so I
don't really need you can text yes so
there you go hey let's say hello to our
old buddy Carlos in the chat we haven't
heard from him in a while what's up
Carlos
he says I told you a few weeks ago that
the iPhone for this year is going to be
called the iPhone XS or 10s I wonder if
the other one could possibly be the
iPhone 10 C or 9 C is this a very subtle
way to like leak something to us because
if so I'm very interested yeah I think
they're getting away from the tents the
C naming record no it's just naming
scheme caller edition though right the C
might have might as well have just stood
for cheap yeah multicolored in one year
they only did it once and they just
killed it and serve like for gone it
wasn't even just to change color I'd
like course parts 5c 5s only the 5c is
that long I almost got one and then I
didn't yeah so that's the story that was
a good story
yep let's go ahead and take some
questions about peripherals from Yellin
R will Apple release a new MacBook from
Alberto will they be releasing an Apple
charging that see that's a good question
oh so yeah the air power it's air power
I believe the big charging pads that you
can do your phone and your watch
everything your uh your ear pods they
introduced that last year and we still
haven't seen it yet so I'm really hoping
that we actually get some sort of
confirmation on when they'll actually
sell this thing because I know a lot
people have been asking for it
MacBooks don't expect to see any
MacBooks next week they'll likely
announce those in a separate event or
announcement in October this next week
will be all iPhone and Apple watch got
it APEC why is Apple releasing the
iPhone 9 basically a month after the
iPhone XS and X why not release them all
at once
so you buy all of them wait what this is
like a release date thing yeah that's
gonna release dates why do they pile em
online they did the same thing for the 8
and the time oh just just
there is no iPhone 9 oh is there there's
zero there's no iPhone 9 at all it's
just the iPhone XS they're the three
models they'll all be introduced on one
day I don't know when the the launch
will will be I think it's the launches
will likely be dependent upon how
quickly they can produce these phones
and lasted quite staggering the release
date yeah I was gonna say oh do you
think that they'll spread it out like
they did for the 8 and the 10 well the
thing of it is with the 10 it got pushed
back because they had to because of
production issues oh it wasn't a
strategy that they had to like stagger
luisa if they could they would have
released everything at the same time but
there were production issues that slowed
it down to the point where they had to
hold that back a little and so and then
even early on like at least they'd they
sort of hinted at the fact that supply
would be an issue it turned out it that
wasn't the case but they were even sort
telegraphing limited inventory with the
iPhone 10 last year that's why there was
a bit of a staggered release and but
this year again to be clear there's no
indication that we've heard of like an
iPhone 9 I think it's all gonna be
iPhone that's why I'm really confused
cuz there's just on X now and they'll
all just be XS X whatever and it kind of
makes sense because they're all using
the iPhone tens design scheme of the
knotch right and face I theoretically
face ID so it kind of makes sense cuz if
you it just would be weird to bring back
the iPhone 9 yeah if there's any one of
those that doesn't have a notch like you
know that's gonna read the cheap one
well I think we all have not you yeah
yeah according to the leak at least we
don't know we I think we're pretty sure
that the notch will be on every phone
just the the cheaper one will have
cheaper specs we got a couple late ones
to the game here what's up James fever
couple questions coming in at the 11th
hour they're really good now that we've
talked about the Matt the wireless
charging Matt what's the status of
wireless charging in new phones do we
think we're gonna see a better improve
speed how much so I think inevitably
they're going to try to improve it but
will it really be something to you know
sneeze at secondly any updates to air
pods or air pod cases that's a good
thought oh we're getting new phones
you're right you know what that might be
possible
lots will probably be the most exciting
thing if there is air pod news honestly
I hope there is some sort update to them
maybe they're cheaper hopefully nah
that's all right I'm just being I'm just
being wishful there yeah there's a
there's a likelihood we'll see an update
I don't think we've seen a lot of leaks
on new air pods or new air pot
accessories but we might see something
kind of like how we saw the charge in
case last year we might see something
different I don't know maybe they last
longer yeah I mean they will probably do
like some sort of like software update
for it we're like oh this will connect
like more easily with yeah
yeah yeah they're new iPhone I don't
think and as for wireless charging
itself yeah I really hope that Apple
starts speeding up the charging times
other phones especially Android Samsung
phones they typically charge faster when
you're when you're wirelessly charging a
phone so I'm really hoping that Apple
has done a bit more world and worked
with the the Qi the wireless power
consortium this is a group that manages
the Qi technology to actually speed
things up a bit
just a bit off topic just but I'm just
some breaking news here sorry
Amazon's market valley has hit a
trillion dollars now Wow
second American company to do this after
a rapid okay good job Jeffy neither of
us have a stake in Amazon so we don't
really care yeah congrats to Amazon for
hanging that mouse alright we are damned
they're out of time and it's unfortunate
because there's still such a great flood
of comments coming in I'm sure we'll
have a few more episodes about this in
the surrounding weeks so make sure to
come on back but before we go I just
like that everyone now is like what's a
notch are you gonna get a notch on the
watch watch notch but before that one
word I keep seeing floating around the
chat is ceramic that would be an
interesting thought do we or is there a
ceramic material phone out there right
now and when do we think Apple or any of
the big boys are gonna go that direction
I can't rule out as something like some
Chinese maker having put out a ceramic
phone I feel like that has happened I
know Apple uses ceramic for their watch
the super high-end model of the Apple
watch is ceramic you know there's a lot
of benefits to it it's it's it's more
scratch proof I think it's more durable
and it's a different material
I don't think Apple is gonna to
introduce ceramic this year or in the
foreseeable future
it's really expensive and so it might be
cost prohibitive to I
at ceramic so you know maybe that's
what--when that $2,000
Apple iPhone kicks in is when it's all
ceramic only the notch is ceramic it
does nothing to help okay
thanks again everybody for joining us
