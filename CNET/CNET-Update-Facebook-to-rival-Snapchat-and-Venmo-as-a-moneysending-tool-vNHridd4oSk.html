friends I'm Bridget Carey and this is
your CNET update facebook Messenger is
the latest app to join the money sending
movement the social network will let you
send money to friends for free by
clicking on a dollar sign inside of the
chat app but to send money both the
sender and receiver need to give
Facebook their MasterCard or Visa debit
account it's rolling out to people in
the US over the coming months so you may
not see it right away
Facebook says in time it would like to
support other types of payment methods
you can require a PIN number to be
entered in before sending money as an
extra security precaution it's no
surprise Facebook is getting in the
payments game the network hired the
former president of PayPal this summer
so it could create its own payment
system there are a growing number of
apps that let you pay back your friends
such as snapchat and PayPal venmo
it's hard to get excited though about
giving social networks your financial
information when there are so many
reports of hacking fraud and data
breaches the latest drama is with the
health care provider primera Blue Cross
it reports 11 million customer records
may have been exposed with accounts that
go as far back as 2002 the data at risk
includes names birth dates and social
security numbers the company says it was
hit by a cyber attack in May of 2014 but
the breach was discovered at the end of
January
just days before health insurer anthem
revealed its data breach of 80 million
people laws don't require health
insurance companies to encrypt data
stored on their servers but let's hope
that changes moving on to a different
sort of insurance HDC has a sweet offer
for the accident-prone customer the
smartphone manufacturer promises to
replace the one m9 phone within the
first year of ownership for any reason
no questions asked it's called uh-oh
protection and it's only available to US
customers the one m9 Android phone was
just announced this month and it hasn't
gone on sale yet if you crack it or drop
it or even just want that new phone
field you can call a number to have HTC
ship replacement phone overnight and
then you have 20 days to send your old
phone back and Sony's PlayStation View
internet TV
streaming service is now available to
purchase for a whopping $50 a month if
you want to cut the cord to typical
cable packages and if you have a
Playstation 3 or Playstation 4 console
you can stream a mix of local and
regional networks over the Internet
it'll cost an extra $10 a month though
to add local sports channels which isn't
any cheaper than going with cable the
service launches in New York Chicago and
Philadelphia but more US cities will be
added later in the year that your tech
news update and you can stay updated at
