with its other end performance cars they
don't seem to think it quite qualifies
but I think it does
BMW used to offer a fairly limited model
range yet the three series the five
series the seven series and occasional
six and an eight but now go to a BMW
dealer lot and you'll be able to count
from two to seven without a stop
there's X's for SUVs and crossovers
there's also GTS and Grande coupes as a
long time BMW fan I find it a little bit
bewildering but then I drove the 2015
BMW m235i and it all began to make sense
again this is a really fun little car it
has fantastic handling easily tap power
this is really what BMW used to be all
about this is a very pure expression of
a sports car this is a completely stop
m235i so we have none of the options
that are available in the cabin tech we
do have this basic iDrive controller
it's a dial here on the console we got a
few buttons for audio and telephone and
main menu if I hit the main menu button
on this screen here I get some basic
functions here I get multimedia radio
telephone so this has hands-free phone
I've got my iPhone paired to the card if
I click this menu option I get my phone
book I get a ability to dial numbers
individually for audio I've got my
choice of radio or media sources right
now I'm on radio I've got HD radio here
so that's a nice standard addition to
the car if I go to my media sources
right now I'm looking at Bluetooth here
and the cool thing about this is that
I'm a go to the music search screen I
actually get a full list of the music
library that's on my phone not too many
cars do this so I can choose artist
songs albums podcasts whatever I want to
listen to with a wireless connection
from my phone to the car I also have a
USB port in the console here now I could
option this up with the tech package
that's $2,150 to get the full navigation
system app connectivity and BMW has a
lot of good features with all that stuff
so I would definitely consider getting
that I mean you might say well this is a
sports car you don't need all that stuff
but this car is just so comfortable I
might want that navigation system to
find the cool places to drive
the driving character the handling feel
that that's what this m235i is is really
all about it's just a great car to sit
in the driver's seat and drive really
anywhere under the hood we've got a
standard VW engine now it's a inline
6-cylinder three liter and it's got a
twin scroll turbo on it in this instance
they have a tune depth of 325 horsepower
302 pounds eat of torque it's great
power for this little car and that's
dialed in to a six-speed manual
transmission at least in this example
you can also get an 8-speed automatic
but with this car you're really going to
want the six-speed manual so right now
I'm in Eco Pro Mode that's this little
rocker switch on the console on that
dials it's most fuel-efficient settings
it activates that idle stop feature
don't be afraid of that will actually
save you some gas at the stoplight but
then I push it into sport mode and
that's where the throttle sharpens up
and that actually is different
suspension a little bit too because this
actually has an adaptive suspension
that's a pretty cool feature in this car
to get standard BMW usually charges you
extra for performance features like that
one thing I like quite a bit about this
car the suspension in this mode you know
it stiffens the car up a little bit
makes it handle better but it's not too
stiff it's still a very comfortable car
to drive I'm not feeling too many of the
bumps on the road now the trick is
pushing this rocker switch once more to
Sport Plus mode and that actually adds
BMWs dynamic traction control to all the
different sports settings and what that
does is that just lets the rear wheels
spin a little harder when you come off
the line when you come through a corner
it lets up back in swing out a little
bit further and that's come on
classic BMW handling that's really what
makes this car just loads of fun I mean
you really want to get this out into a
twisty windy road and just feel it run
I've been pretty impressed even in the
city streets just a fast corner and I
feel that didn't come out and it makes
me want to take this car and anywhere I
can find
let's price out our 2015 BMW m235i base
price forty three thousand one hundred
dollars now we add the technology
package as $2,150 BMW also wants five
hundred dollars for what they call
enhanced Bluetooth and USB I think that
makes the phone work better with the car
all in with destination we're looking at
forty six thousand seven hundred dollars
that's a lot of money for a small car
like this but it is a lot of fun and it
has a lot of BMWs great performance
technology with it
