iPhone was released so how far has the
camera come in that time we have an
original iPhone that still works and
we're going to compare it to the iPhone
10 I can't actually I can't even see the
screen very much oh wait iOS it's a
horse
I think it's iOS 304 the original iPhone
has a two megapixel rear camera there's
no flash and definitely no video
recording the iPhone 10 has two rear
cameras one wide-angle and one telephoto
it also has a flash and records video in
4k on the phones there's no comparison
between the OLED screen on the 10 which
blows the originals out of the water so
to be fair let's take a look at them
outside of the phone because the lens on
the original iPhone has a narrower field
of view you don't get as much into the
shot photos from the original look like
you'd expect from any point and shoot
camera with a small sensor but
surprisingly in good lighting conditions
they don't lose that much detail and the
colors look pretty similar between both
images the iPhone 10 can obviously
capture a wider dynamic range portrait
mode has been a welcome addition to the
iPhones camera but it adds yet another
step to taking photos the interface on
the original is so simple you can't even
pinch to zoom or adjust the exposure
there's just a shutter button and that's
it so we want to take a look at that
shot that we just took for it the
original iPhone well
touch screen is not super responsive
hello
selfies weren't really a big deal when
the first iPhone was released so it's no
surprise that the original has no front
facing camera instead we have to resort
to this alright that's the button right
here you know you know what that was the
good old days because you actually had
to shave yourself as somebody and be
like can you take my photo and interact
with humans on the iPhone 10 you can
even do portrait mode on the
front-facing camera but it's low light
where the original iPhone really shows
its age a smaller sensor and no image
stabilization means you're left with a
photo that's fairly usable the camera on
the iPhone has definitely improved but
maybe it's not as big of a jump as we
had expected considering it has been a
decade you basically just went back in
time what was shooting with that again
like so much fun I have forgot like how
exciting it can be like it's compact I
don't have to worry about dropping it
okay the photos are only two megapixel
resolution they're not that great but
the best camera is the one they have
with you but what would you miss most if
you had to go back to an older phone to
take photos I would definitely miss the
focus and the zoom but that's not bad
groundbreaking I mean in 10 years I kind
of would expect more maybe in the
portrait mode but for 10 years like this
can still hold up uh-huh and let us know
what you think the camera phone of the
future will look like specs features
