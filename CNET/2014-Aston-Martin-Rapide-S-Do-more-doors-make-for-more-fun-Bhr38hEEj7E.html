both beautiful and something to be
feared not only does it have looks to
kill but the power to scare the living
hell out of anything it comes up against
and it seats four people which leads us
to ask does having four doors and for
proper seats make it any less a sports
car the Rapide s is the second
generation rapide which itself was an
answer to a unique problem that many
faced in the noughties you see buyers
wanted a high-end car like an Aston or a
Bentley or a Porsche but they wanted to
fit actual adults in the back they
wanted more space but they didn't want
to buy the card the jaw a Range Rover
Aston released the repeat of the 2009
geneva motor show and it was something
of a looker and they'd be 9 with a
couple of extra doors and devastating
aston looks a 470 horsepower v12 gave it
the go it deserved as well and all of a
sudden Aston had a solution to people
that wanted something bigger but didn't
want to buy a range now Astin's added an
s badge which is asked annie's for made
faster it's got new traction control
settings and you face which Apes a
basking shark and the new power output
550 brake horsepower and you talk big
insane 427 pound foot that's quite a bit
a means nor 262 happens in 4.9 seconds
and it'll hit 190 miles an hour if you
committed its engine else it's lower in
the engine bay as well better center of
gravity means a better drive so that's a
good thing after has formed when it
comes to four doors remember the Lagonda
saloon well the first generation came
out in the mid seventeen you probably
didn't know about that one it was a
stunning food or take on the v8 of the
time sadly though only seven were ever
made then a gun that you know about came
out shortly afterwards and that was a
hugely ambitious car it had an LED
dashboard
pads and what have you it lasted all the
way to 1990 and over his time a few
special editions came about tickford did
a few a company called ruse engineering
in switzerland made a shooting brake in
1998 and there was even a series for
converted to a two-door called
interestingly repeat however it won't go
down as one of the world's great though
the electrics were incredibly
complicated the budget to make them well
match the budget to make the entire car
no mean feat and because they were made
in England in the 70s they constantly
failed they were awful and then there's
the look it was stylistically
interesting and often populates top ten
top twenty top 50 lists of the world's
ugliest cars oh dear the repeats name
repeat also comes from Astin's heritage
is named after nineteen sixty ones
llegando rapide hastens owner David
Brown had bought lagonda in the 40s and
wanted to revive the brand it had an
engine that would later wind up in the
Aston Martin db5 it was made to order
and only 55 were ever produced a shame
because he was beautiful so it's a
thoroughly modern Aston then and it's
got a decent heritage to boot but as i
said earlier not only is it beautiful
other road users should fear it because
with all that power and Astin's know how
it's gotta be pretty special right well
it is this is a heavy car it weighs just
shy of two tons and you do feel it when
you're driving but steering is just
lovely as is the throttle response it
just goes it picks up it understands you
wants an angry shout egt car and then
you can use the paddles to shift gears
as when you please and then well if
you're in the right gear at the right
time the engine just sings it makes
beautiful beautiful noise there's
something about an Aston v12 they just
get it right it comes on song not the
very top of the rev range but about in
the middle the exploitable bit so you
can have your thrills overtake and still
stay within the legal speed limit if you
want to that's some clever thinking
because it's quite big quite heavy but
incredibly well planted it's not one to
really go for it so you have to be
really pushing it to exploit that or you
could turn everything off yeah they let
you turn everything because they want
you to have fun because they know that
this car isn't only up against things
like s glasses or Range Rovers this is
up against 911s bentley continental GT
is hell its own cars so is it the
perfect car for the driver who doesn't
want to lose a sports car if they have
children is it the sports car saloon
crossover that aston martin says et's
yes it is yeah it's a bit tricky to get
in the back if you're a grown-up but
once you're in there you get to
experience full Aston Martin luxury
which is no bad thing at all so other
road users should fear it because not
only is it beautiful but it's
devastating in its execution
