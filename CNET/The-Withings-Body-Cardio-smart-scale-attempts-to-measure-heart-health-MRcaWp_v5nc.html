isn't your typical smart scale sure it
can measure a variety of metrics things
like weight body fat muscle and bone
mass and body water percentage
there's also Wi-Fi and Bluetooth to
automatically upload your information to
the Withings mobile app but these are
features most smart skills include what
makes the body cardio unique is at the
first scale that can actually determine
cardiovascular health it does this by
measuring a thing called pulse wave
velocity that's a measurement used to
determine arterial stiffness and is said
to be a key indicator of heart health
now that all sounds appealing until you
consider the $108 price tag that makes
the body cardio one of the most
expensive consumer scales on the market
and to make matters worse I found the
pulse wave velocity feature to be a bit
finicky about one out of every five
times I'll receive an error that say if
the scale was unable to measure it but I
didn't even know this until I opened the
app that's because the small display on
the scale doesn't actually show or we've
acknowledged that your pulse wave
velocity has been measured but once I
finally got a reading I wasn't really
sure what to do next with things has
said the app would offer personalized
feedback but to me it seemed kind of
vague and a bit generic but it bluntly
this scale won't be replacing a visit to
your doctor it's not all bad though the
body cardio features a micro USB port
but you won't have to charge it often
the battery will last up to a year this
gal is also very sleek and pretty
attractive as far as scales go and I
found all the metrics aside from pulse
wave velocity to be pretty accurate
overall you're better off buying the
$130 Withings body it's essentially the
body cardio but without the standing
heart rate data or the finicky pulse
wave velocity measurement and if you're
already invested in the Fitbit and
Garmin ecosystems then you should check
out the Fitbit Aria or the Garmin index
