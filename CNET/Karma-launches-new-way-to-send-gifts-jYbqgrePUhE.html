of karma and with my other co-founder
Ben Lewis we're launching a brand new
social commerce experience tonight to
make it incredibly easy to send a gift
and a thoughtful message in the moment
when you hear about an important event
in a friend family or colleagues life
with karma we break beyond the noise of
what's going on in your social networks
and we highlight the important birthdays
celebrations new jobs engagements babies
anything that you might not want to miss
karma will highlight right here in your
sort of dashboard so amy is a good
friend who I know has recently changed
jobs and gotten a promotion so I'm going
to send her congratulations note so I'll
go ahead and choose a a gift for Amy I
think the moleskine notebooks are a
great choice but here's where we come to
a place in gifting that's hard a sort of
analysis paralysis which of these
notebooks should I send Amy I'll go
ahead and let Amy choose which notebooks
you'd like I can search from Amy from
our karma single search box that
combines all your contacts from your
address book and from facebook add to
the gift we can write a card for Amy
arrived from the phone and select and
browse different browsing closings and
greetings and I could also schedule the
gift to arrive SE on the morning of her
birthday or 20 minutes before an
important job interview but i'll go
ahead and send it instantly because i
know she got her job today and that's
how easy it was within 60 seconds amy
will receive an SMS notifying her of her
gift from me this is Amy's phone and
she's just received a gift from Lee
Linden via karma so all she needs to do
is touch the link this can be opened on
any mobile device that has a modern
browser including a Blackberry or a
windows phone or an Android phone or an
iPhone she reads my card read from her
phone the bow unwraps and right then in
there Amy sees the moleskine notebook my
gift and she's offered the choice of
style just like that amy has received a
gift on her mobile phone chosen her
exact variety of product entered her
shipping address and now it's asking her
to enter a thank you note so right
her phone she can send me a thank you
have a post to my facebook wall or sent
to me via SMS let's hit next and used
that message and just like that amy has
actually received a gift read her card
and sent to thank you straight from her
mobile phone one of the big pains points
of gift-giving is really managing the
communication winning someone you know
right now and letting that recipient
respond with a thank you karma takes
care of all of that but what happens in
the real world when someone doesn't
enjoy their gift or want that gift well
there's a lot of waste and so with Karma
give all of our gift recipients 24 hours
to swap their gift and when we do we
present them with a list of choices of
other products or services in the
similar price range and so right here
Amy can go ahead and swap and she can
choose a different a different style
notebook she can choose a different
product altogether including rent the
runway or a spa package but we're very
proud about is Amy can actually donate
the value of this gift to our charity
partner this month is charity water and
if Amy would like she can donate the
entire value of this product straight
the charity water all the while from my
phone I was able to track Amy status so
i got to see when she opened her card
when she accepted her gift i'll see you
when it shipped and i'll see what it's
delivered and like that karma becomes a
form of communication between one person
or another one person who wants to share
that important moment the other person
who has received this this gift and
wants to say thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
