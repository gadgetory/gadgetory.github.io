downtown Louisville Kentucky with the
physics countertop draft machine this is
a hundred and seventy dollar machine
that's supposed to take your bottle of
beer and make it taste like it came from
the draft it's also nicely designed and
really easy to use you just put your
bottle into the machine seal the lid and
pull the handle forward and it'll pour
your beer nice and gently push the
handle back and it'll add that foamy
head oddly enough it's supposed to do
this by using sound apparently the
frequency of the machine causes
vibrations in the carbonation to give
your beer that nice draft like head I
think it sounded like infomercial
mumbo-jumbo but we've been testing this
comparing physics beers to the same
beers from the bottle and it really does
make a difference it gives your beer a
nice head every single time and it
actually does smooth out the flavor now
we didn't find that to be consistently a
good thing like on some hoppy beers and
on bitter Porter's it actually ended up
smoothing over part of that bitterness
which is part of the character of the
beer so it definitely makes a difference
but we really wanted to see how it
stacks up against actual draft beer so
we asked Matt Landon owner of the
Haymarket whiskey bar to do a blind
taste test comparing a single beer and
draft form bottle the form and from the
physics side by side by side to see if
he could tell them apart and to see
which one he preferred here's what he
had to say okay beer number three was
out of the bottle beer number two was
draught and beer number one was through
the gizmo beer number one had the most
calm carbonation it tasted the most
draft like it tasted more draft like
than even the draft beer
that it was actually draft it had more
of a head did I have him wrong did I
have them reversed was one the draft
into the gizmo yeah bummer I did the
same taste test and I found that just
like with the beers in the office it
does make the beer taste different if
not necessarily better all right so be
number one you're number two three
really close I'm gonna go three is the
bottle I'm gonna go two is the draft I'm
gonna go one is physics so they so
they've equalized a little bit but it's
good that they've equalized because if
the effect is only temporary then it's
not as good and you can taste the
difference between the draft and between
physics and between the bottle the the
draft is still the best one because the
hops come out the most you do lose some
of that with the physics on this beer
but it does taste more carbonated than
the bottled version so it's a step in
the right direction it's doing what it's
supposed to do I mean it is cool it
definitely made the beer tastes more
like fresh beer on draft but I think if
you're really into beer at home you're
looking to put a draft system in not by
a battery-operated gizmo that you feed
it beer one at a time so all in all it's
a cool machine it's well designed it's
easy to use and if you're really
passionate about beer and really value
the creamy and the sweet aspects it
might be worth the money if you value
more the bitter aspects of your beer
this machine might actually take
something away from your drinking
experience I want to say thanks again to
the guys at Haymarket whisky bar for
letting us use their space and be
willing participants in our test for
more be sure to check out my full review
