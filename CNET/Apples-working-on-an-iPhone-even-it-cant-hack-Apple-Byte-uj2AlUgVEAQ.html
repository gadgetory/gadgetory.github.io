vacation and back for your weekly dose
of the Apple bite and first you know I
would like to thank no show Tongass for
holding down the floor last week
although newcomers to the show probably
thought I was on acid which I was not so
let's get to the Apple versus the FBI
situation it's big and gets more
complicated by the week according to the
New York Times Apple engineers have
already begun developing new security
measures that would make it impossible
for the government or even Apple to
break into a locked iphone if Apple
succeeds in doing this it would make it
even more significantly challenging for
law enforcement agencies to crack into
the iPhone now it all started with the
FBI's court order for Apple to build a
backdoor into iOS so they could gain
access to data that was locked on the
iPhone from one of the now-deceased San
Bernardino terrorists they basically
want their own FBI OS clever huh now
Apple said no Tim Cook said it would be
a major setback to online privacy and a
dangerous precedent I'm onboard with Tim
and Apple and the tech world like Google
Twitter and Facebook agrees so how did
this come about it's been confirmed by
BuzzFeed that government officials
actually reset the iCloud account
password to the terrorists phone once it
was in their possession Apple said this
prevented an auto backup on iCloud that
could have potentially given them more
information but of course it doesn't
stop there in addition to the San
Bernardino phone The Wall Street Journal
reports the Justice Department is
pursuing court orders to make Apple help
them extract data from about 12 of their
phones so where are we now as of this
show will the deadline for Apple to
respond to the court order will be
Friday February the 26th and Apple is
expected to argue that its fight with
the FBI should be settled by Congress
it's Apple versus the FBI national
security versus user privacy on the
surface but it has really far more
reaching implications that could go as
far as weakening data encryption overall
which makes this a fascinating and
important case now in a recent survey
conducted by the Pew Research Center it
found that 51 percent
it's respond incited with the Justice
Department to unlock the iPhone versus
38% who said Apple should not unlock it
well 11% are still twiddling their
thumbs and said they don't know I
conducted my own survey on Twitter and
with nearly 1000 respondents 85% of you
all said Apple should not build a
backdoor in iOS
well 15% of you said yes now I honestly
see many sides of the argument so where
do you all stand this is a real chance
to have some great dialogue between us
so I'd love to hear what you think and
why and we'll get a few of Apple byte
nation's responses next week which my
result and you winning an Apple bite
sticker so email us at the Apple bita
cnet.com or tweet me at Bryant Tong if
you can fit it in 140 characters all
right in other news 9 to 5 Mac reports
as siri is finally set to make its way
to the mac in OS 10 10.12 and will be
part of its yearly update this fall the
report says Apple has been testing
versions of it internally since 2012
it started on the iPhone and has now
graduated to the Apple watch and the new
Apple TV with the Mac coming up next
also early betas of iOS 9.3 freaked out
iPad pro users after removed the ability
for the Apple pencil to be used for
navigation on the iPad pro like a stylus
hmm now report suggested the move was
intentional but Apple confirmed to the
birds that navigation was temporarily
pulled improvements are being made and
it will return in the next beta so you
will still be able to use the pencil
like a stylus
alright the Apple TV could be even more
important to you after the FCC recently
took the first big step towards
completely changing the cable business
in a 2 to 3 vote the FCC has decided to
move forward with a proposal that would
allow cable customers like us to go
through third parties for the cable
set-top systems so think about this how
about a Roku or Xbox one or Apple TV
branded box instead of being tied to the
same one that comes with your cable
service this is huge
now we're still months away after
revisions are made to the proposal and
then a final vote but this is happening
so you all should be going cuckoo for
cocoa puffs right now
we could finally get an experience
combining TV with apps with the same
cohesive look and feeling without a
monthly subscription fee to use a box
now tech companies should be thrilled
but cable companies should not consumer
choice that's what it's all about and
the new Apple TV has four new universal
search options on the latest for Chen
and now works with watch ABC disney XD
Disney Channel and my favorite Disney
Junior iTunes Netflix and Hulu were a
handful of the apps that supported it on
launch so it is growing and I do need to
address something from last week where I
said the new Apple TV doesn't play a
video podcast and sometimes my brain is
like all over the place and my head was
thinking iPad pro not having full video
screen podcast and somehow you know I
applied it to the Apple TV so yeah maybe
I was actually on acid you know what
that deserves a bad apple I'm sorry okay
alright that's gonna do it for this
week's show remember to email us at the
Apple Vitus cnet.com or tweet me at
brian tom thanks for watching and we'll
catch you all next time for another bite
