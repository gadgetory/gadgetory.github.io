ayah and it's time to get loaded toshiba
plans to come out with 3d TVs just like
everyone else except these TVs will not
require the pricey and silly active
shutter glasses the company created what
they're calling an internal imaging
system that sends out light rays at
different angles and this allows your
brain to process a 3d image toshiba says
you'll be able to watch from different
viewing angles which has been a problem
with the current 3d TV models the TV
should be out by the end of the year
Nokia and Intel want their mobile
devices to support 3d also the company
is partnering with me go an open-source
operating system to focus on the
emerging technology Nokia's handsets
could work similar to the Nintendo 3ds
or introduce a new technology that can
project Holograms a new version of
YouTube mobile is available worldwide
the new and faster mobile version of the
site was available in the u.s. last
month but now anyone can enjoy faster
streaming playlists and the ability to
like or unlike a video and share on
Facebook and Twitter the company has
also rolled out html5 support for
browsers like Safari and an optimized
version for the iPad and google is
testing out live search on the site this
means you'll see the real-time results
of any given search as you're typing and
not just after you enter a search in the
feature will pull from Google's search
suggestions feature and I don't see much
value in this feature other than being a
huge distraction but google has not
confirmed win or if this will go live
the galaxy tab will get an official
unveiling on September second but until
then we're left with a new teaser the
tab will run android 2.2 it has a 7-inch
display video calling swipe and HD movie
playback the teaser also suggests that
this device will use augmented reality
but we'll see what they mean in a few
days an apple is probably coming out
with new ipod soon we don't know this
for sure but the company is hosting an
event in San Francisco on September 7th
and it seems pretty likely the big
question is what other surprises that
they will announce those are your
headlines for today on Marcus
with cnet.com and you've just been
loaded</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
