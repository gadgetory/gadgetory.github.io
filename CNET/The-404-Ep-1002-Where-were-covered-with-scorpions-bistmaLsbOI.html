44 show on Sina TV I'm Jeff Bakalar I'm
Bridget Carey I'm Justin you this is the
show where we're covered in scorpions
what kind of a bizarre shows are we
though I mean without the reference i
think was flutterguy in the chat room
there was a weird echo before in the
pre-show yeah and her guy made an
amazing reference to the original like
1995 x-men animated series where i think
is like the Morlocks wow really dirty
out right now but yeah I'm fine digitize
Wolverine into thinking uh he was
covered in Scott the evidence all the
Wolverine you're just as vulnerable as
we thought you were so good we got
bridgie carry on the show today what's
up Bridget it's not gonna be here how
are you doing great thanks for uh for
being here it's a pleasure awesome it's
a pleasure for us as well so everyone is
being pleasured right now Richard gross
Richard is back as well yeah love that
thanks man we appreciate you doing this
we know you don't have to yeah well
thank you for choosing us thanks a lot
for a couple seconds and I pushed the
wrong button you're like say your face
if you want to do that you can you can
don't be afraid man you're here all
right there you go all right getting
used to that I'm loving it Jeff I'm
looking at a very cool photo that you
took and put up on Twitter over the
weekend uh can I want to call you a
phony though for saying that you spotted
this 404 sticker in the wild at windham
mountain while you're skiing I'm not a
phony yeah but in the wild meant that
you just put it up there's technically I
did see it yeah okay that's it after
feeling someone hiding and putting it on
the pole hey however it got there's none
of my business okay all right but I went
skiing this weekend at windham mountain
and it was delightful yeah I was and we
talked earlier in the pre-show
apparently you're you're not Ivan scheme
really long time but I feel like the
window of opportunity to do that at my
age is you know what are you Tom all
early years older than you I'm saying to
snowboard skiing maybe but you know
alrighty guys are we
yeah do you don't worry about it if you
want a snowboard snowboard okay if you
want to write your bike down the
mountain we do boards on the wheels do
it hahaha whatever you want to do to
play skee free at home instead of going
to the actual mountain I'm gonna do that
you remember that game with you
bominable snowman take me back what I
don't understand yeah are the people who
are in snow shoes walking up the
mountain like that's something to do
okay well hiking yeah oh do that I don't
know I just don't get that you're here
there's all these amenities available to
you and you decide to put tennis rackets
on and walk up the matter I'm sorry I
just don't get it yeah you know maybe if
you're walking up and then skiing down
that sounds maybe it's pretty that's you
know you're stretching out your day
they're right but at least you're coming
down and a lot of but walking up man I
don't get people who do tell me the
truth what color diamond oh we do I
didn't wide just don't do double blacks
and do black crazy one right those are
the ones that are just like hey nice
knowing you yeah you know yeah people
die on those no beginner one was it goes
it goes green blue and then black
diamond and double black I stay away
from double blacks I do everything else
yeah I do regular black blues I like
blue is the best very cool yeah but yeah
man it was fun I love him just sore
everything's my fingers hurt Oh buddy I
got angry so but I've never done it
what's what's better for you to try
first green or the or the snowboarding
or I would say you should try skiing
first it's just I think easier I think
Richard can attest to that skiing ZZ
yeah I think skiing is easier to learn
if you snowboard and as well boarded
once um jenny was it wasn't funny you're
all right yeah I hard time balancing
when ya with one foot facing Brett one
way you know I like both be facing the
same of course and that's understandable
because when you're on a snowboard you
have to trust physics a lot you have to
just put it past yourself that you know
what I'm leaning over and it feels like
I'm gonna fall but gravity and and you
know kinetic energy will take their
course and do what they have to do in
sup it's scary if you don't you know if
you know treasures up that's why
learning Young is so important because
when you're young you have no fear and
falling you're not gonna hurt as much
shorter what's gonna happen you're just
you're just a 40 pound ball of mush it
doesn't matter you're gonna hurt
yourself you know what I have noticed
though everyone's wearing a helmet now
oh really everyone wears a helmet as did
I remember your helmet that had an mp3
player and headphones rail right into
its you listen for sure everyone on the
mounds were in homes good and I think
that's the smartest and and I've been
you know on manza for you know 15 years
right and in the beginning that was a
rarity now everyone has which is great
you were like the full face hockey mask
no you know and I would and actually my
nose is a little red yeah from stuck
getting sunburned I guess I usually wear
like a scarf over my face and then the
goggle the right rabbit didn't do it and
I guy look like you know better than
that I know I know the only I don't know
why it's like a smaller mountain you
know it wasn't i wasn't expecting crazy
conditions but it was beautiful
yesterday and I just got blasted in the
face yeah never worn a helmet you know
you got a man I know it's time for you
to do that I'll start now yeah you gotta
do it even if you're just renting a
helmet dude yeah all right prop look at
me and promise me all right that's all I
want to hear well while you were out
skiing enjoying the outdoors I was
inside with 200 nerds at this aviary
photo hackathon really heard about like
these kinds of things so long aviary is
this website that lets you do online
photo shopping tools okay it's really
cool so it uh sort of democratizes the
whole photo editing experience and every
couple months they throw this thing
called the photo hackathon it's were
like 200 pro companies will release the
api's to their applications online okay
like things like aviary and face
match.com or things like that though
releases AV eyes invite developers to
come and build applications over the
course of two days and then at the end
of that they'll invite them to come to a
show guys really cool display everything
they made right so on like I attended
one of these things because my buddy's
works at aviary right I read your
friends yeah really cool so one of the
best things I saw there was this thing
called the ex remover and the idea is
that you know when you go on trips to
like Paris sure ever all you want to
remember those trips but if you break up
with the person you
when maybe you want to keep the photos
but not remember that person is
interesting you bring that very
situation up yeah so the idea why
because you just want a ski trip just
know I'm saying like because I just got
my wedding album back oh right some
people who are in that wedding don't see
not together anymore yeah so cool you
could use this thing so basically what
it does it uses every song on the EP I
yeah it really does it don't like
analyze the faces everywhere yeah in the
photo yeah and then it like goes online
and matches that face uses recognition
to find other phases of models that look
like the person sure and then replaces
all that they just pictures go into the
pest and kill them that could work to
invent it just I mean come on I talk
about a real photo shot that's right way
to do it I think I'm sorry this is cool
then it looks like you went on a trip
with a model instead of this
ex-girlfriend Beast you went with right
Rachel wants a river that changes it's
pretty cool stuff like that I think is
is a pretty interesting alright that's
cool so you did that this weekend yeah
very cool our last night was the Oscars
everyone watch the Oscars so much pieces
of it yeah did you like the pieces you
saw I saw the end mostly and I saw ya
Billy Crystal's intro you know yeah
classic yeah but a little don't aim side
sure I like Billy Crystal yeah this is
something a little awkward about him now
really well he I don't I didn't think he
was gonna be one of the guys to do all
like the plastic surgery sort of thing
tell he looks a little artificial I was
thinking that I was thinking that as a
key he aged and you know it's it's just
weird that's not city slickers you know
a billy crystal over there city slickers
Billy Crystal was like healthy look
right you know this guy's just looks
like plasticky I was also watching clips
of it cuz I didn't get to catch it live
right but did he dress up in blackface
to do a thing Davis jr. scale well he's
been doing Sammy Davis for years we're
gonna sin el mateys so so for him it
well like what he what he's known for
feel like he would rationalize it by
saying he was a Jew also you know that's
still not cool yeah wait Sammy Davis jr.
I believe so wasn't he converted to
Judaism was surprised because I grew up
watching a lot of old SNL so it didn't
phase me but then online everyone was
going on about it yeah I endless in the
chair go am I the only one that dislikes
Billy Crystal I think so i don't really
dislike him he's a lovable guy he's been
around forever isn't done a lot of stuff
lately but you know him coming back to
the I don't know it is weird it was like
man you're the same Billy Crystal 1987
right and you doing the same stick and I
would be surprised a lot of young people
watching the show drytown know who the
guy was exactly haven't seen what you
said i think what you said it's like
bringing Jon Lovitz out right no one
John leaping all the benefit yeah
exactly yeah they're more worried about
like remaking the matrix movie right
something like that I can't wait till
they do that ya know Billy Crystal's he
definitely has this place in hollywood
so we're there there any big surprises
or disappointments rewards surprised
that anyone won an Oscar because movies
this year sucked okay I'm sorry I just
didn't see in the artist but yeah yeah
when it comes out see it yeah that was
that was supposed to break it one board
that was no surprise i mean you learn is
something different so they're going to
get rewarded for it right i don't know
uh you know I Woody Allen won for best
original screenplay from Midnight in
Paris yeah it was good i enjoyed the
movie i don't know if it was you know
bad that i have judgments on these
movies that i haven't seen like I could
let me judge them by whether I would
want to see it or not midnight in paris
but i'm really excited that like the
Muppets 14 song yeah just face up Bret
McKenzie on flight of the conchords yeah
Oscar that was cool I heard that a trent
reznor didn't get nominated for the
growth Dragon Tattoo score I thought
that was supposed to be a shoo-in yeah I
don't know that and then drive wasn't
also nominated weird what are you gonna
do yeah what are you gonna do you make a
black black and white movie why not yeah
that's what works I don't normally odds
you guys catch the pre shows like the
red carpet I did a little bit yeah yeah
and cool happy with that all you heard
about the ryan seacrest i did I saw that
not funny and we're you know we're
personally afflicted by that just
because of him being a former seen at
alumni that's right yeah a lot of people
know that
no rest used to work at CNN he did he do
first look videos how'd it start other
gorillas late he started a podcast yeah
okay I don't know what happened but uh
you know Sacha Baron Cohen was in the
dictator outfit yet that new movie he's
back knew he had to what they are saying
no you can't come on the red carpet less
he promises not to be the dictator yeah
and then he did it and that was at any
he said he had Kim's is that was the
agent ashes any poor them all over there
all poor Seacrest I don't bad for that
guy like if anyone asks you what you
wear anywhere in Kim Jong is that what
he said yeah that's not bad man who did
the prank thing better Sacha Baron Cohen
or tom green what did Tom Green do just
pranks in general was he drinking with a
better prankster Oh Sasha yeah I mean
more like when you watch the HBO Borat
now that's I mean he got some people he
really shows the true side of of like
real you know dirty sort of places in
America right you know maybe one of
people that should be made of course he
makes fun of people who are ignorant and
racist yeah so that's great you know um
anything else cool happen at the Oscars
nip slips that's all like a JLo nip slip
dreamer see that I don't think it was
fully out yet it's there's no fully you
know it wasn't like the groundhog came
out yeah it was just more like a chance
of it right I did my research yes you
have the official like yes or no I yeah
I got to complete now like wave it off
no guy Google notification for nips
legit with the into the replay yeah yeah
you challenge the ruling on the field
alright so maybe we should get into a
little bit of news yeah you know this
new clip thing so what's going on in the
world is uh more Mobile World Congress
is going on in Barcelona my own world
expo mcgarin and apparently the big news
from there is that quad core is the is
the wave of the future in terms of
android cell phones is am i right in
saying that but you're the news expert
here my mind you are the expert I just
you know read headlines every yeah
quad-core everyone's talking about that
algae and and I'm looking at the names
of some of these new phones and I think
we went from this era of everything
very empowering and you just felt so
great having your hero or your epic and
now it's all letters really yeah it's
the 1x the 1s the 1v or the Xperia P you
again wait was that a real thing yes
interceptors ooh the pnd you it was like
this apu that's what we were talking
about this last we were saying you know
TV manufacturers should adopt the
nomenclature that cell phone
manufacturers have have sort of evolved
into in calling phones words verb
something trying to get them under one
family released HTC One X the 1s its
kind of playing off of samsung galaxy
and it's the gas samsung galaxy blink
right you always remember to go to that
brand and whatever kind of flavor it is
you figure it out I yeah and are trying
I think copy that success okay it's
interesting but but but to me the little
but the letters after it just kind of
become nothing Yeah right it's a little
bit more difficult to understand but
Sony I like that they just do single
letters right so it's Sony Xperia P or
zone Xperia you like that seems a little
easier than that well John will dry out
yeah soon as well there's it tell us
about the Samsung Galaxy Beam though
this is something that kind of interest
yeah this sounds yeah they Samsung
pulled out a cool card by showing a
smartphone the beam that has a projector
built into it I mean that that thing
looks really is on the top it yeah they
said with the first look of it in a dark
room the Cena editors were saying it
looked like a good quality of course
there's no you know facts on
availability or price there never really
is on these first days but right um it's
pretty it's kind of like an interesting
gimmick they say they're not targeting
business though they're targeting like
young consumers who just want to show
off videos photos to friends right at
least that's the impression that seemed
to be in the atmosphere there without
all the amazing applications for this
though yeah and I'm thinking in the most
perverse sense of things really mess
with your teachers class no like I'm
worse things are you men so like there
keep your teachers up in front of the
class yeah and oh no she's wearing a
white blouse or whatever Oh
so you just project something amazing
onto her I mean under whatever you know
like I'm just thinking of like that
scene in a sprint or two right you know
what I mean wait wheeler in the
projection room right that's what I'm
thinking right right these are endless
with this thing yeah okay here's a
picture my knees and I'm just gonna
project on the wall fine yeah but come
on man it's and have some fun I think
it's gonna be really weird to see a
bunch of crazy people just staring at
what looks like a normal wall but then
if you go up closer the rightly
projecting a photo on right right like a
brick wall or something I think a great
idea for commercial for me and this is
something that I would instantly relate
to I'm walking down the street and I
just see a guy on this like on the side
of the corner right he's projecting
slingbox onto a blank wall because he
wants to watch the end of the game right
that's kind of cool then everyone will
gather as a gathering and the police
come and lock them all about your
commercial Samsung so you know I'm
saying like that to me is really cool
yeah but does it work with any sort of
video outlet can you put says affect
anything that is green gonna project the
exact screen yes total just mirror what
I was on the screen that's really cool
and I'm sure the resolution is gonna be
better it's got it if they're really
come out with it they're not gonna it's
really cool I just a I don't know I
wonder how much energy it takes I wonder
how it must kill the battery here's one
I don't get okay so nokia comes out with
a camera phone or a phone that has a
camera 41-megapixel what what 41 41
point 1 i'm not missing a point that
seems like way too many megapixels
camera girl regular consumer cameras
don't anyways what is that doing except
for just you know marketing and killing
a onboard storage or your memory card
there should be a printer embedded into
that phone you can immediately print out
those hi Reza you want what what is this
for the the billboard is going to be
your view wow is that a game changer no
no that's a stunt that is a stunt here
it is this is a game ender your view 808
look at that 41 megapixels you have it
almost looks like you have to bring
along this attachment it's ridiculous to
carry on the phone
that's ridiculous man all right what is
anything else of note coming out of uh
mwc is what the is gonna happen it's
gonna be all week long and we're gonna
get lots more every day yeah guys I mean
there's apparently more coming at it
from Samsung to it seems like the trend
though is to have just larger larger
physical displays though I just wonder
like 4.7 I'm looking at this LG optimus
4x HD yeah where's name ever uh it has a
4.7 inch HD display they're all at least
four inches do I don't know if that's
for the trench yeah in fact i saw one
looks like the smaller 4 inch model like
four inches now the smaller but you know
what i don't know i think the end so i
think the next iPhones gonna have a huge
screen um i just i go back to my galaxy
nexus to someone's I've I'm just like
what is this giant what is this it was
this a little kids phone that you found
on the playground come on I do like the
the larger screen I don't know about
four point you know five inches or
getting up to five inches yeah but I
mean if we're doing more media and you
know you know surfing the web more of
czar one device right it is comfortable
to look at long yeah i was reading about
the gallic of the samsung galaxy note 3
OS three okay which is supposed to have
a 1080p resolution on a four point eight
inch screen that is mind blow ya and you
know is it me or is the evolution or the
sort of like proportionality of of where
phones and and and their speed sort of
like lineup that is just quicker than
anything yeah you know i remember even
with like personal computers it just
took a while you know things you know it
would go okay 16 gig 16 gigabytes of uh
60 megabytes around then yet 32 and now
they're like single core dual core quad
core within 18 months it seems like
there's a disparity between what these
two industries want like laptops are
getting smaller mmm tablets are getting
smaller than phones are getting bigger
at what point others gonna meet in the
middle and just finally decide on what
size we should all be used right this
one will be the galaxy note yeah
that's it totally I wonder with a sweet
spot is no also out of uh the the
Congress there uh there was an
unbelievable stat that I thought I was
worth sharing with everybody Android
operating system see 850,000 activations
a day think about that how many new
phones yeah new I guess it's the people
switching over to google or whatever it
is that's a lot 850,000 a day whether
what that is compared to iPhones I don't
know sup from 700,000 in January so
little food for thought yeah really cool
you're included in that list of people
well not real I've had a good I've had
an android phone for a while right right
but it's yeah it's it's pretty
impressive arm let's talk about uh
facebook and text messages this is a
scary headlines yeah you know speaking
of your Android this is something that's
affecting this community here so over
the weekend the London Sunday Times they
reported that Facebook has admitted to
reading text messages as part of a trial
program I guess in the future they're
gonna be planning to offer SMS messaging
embedded in their app okay so right now
they're testing that out part of that
trial to launch their own messaging
service involves uh looking at users
text messages that download their
facebook application to their android
phones and uh you know a lot of those
publications have contacted facebook
there's a statement admitting to it and
uh yeah i think this is more of a reason
why obama's privacy policy last week
should definitely be happening soon so
that companies can't do this or you
should be able to opt out okay i'll let
you know that they're doing something
yes well apparently there is a you know
there was a disclaimer when you check
out the term service agreement in the
beginning but no one reads one's dreams
I about this but that's the next sort of
legality that needs right yeah stay
right yeah we're not going to read the
20 pages but say up front here are the
things that are changing right right no
one's ever come out and said look terms
of service are nonsense who's gonna read
literally 15 thousand words on what
exactly is going on someone used either
like bullet point it or make it
digestible in a way that I can see it
right understand it and
move on I make it a law that it has to
be this easy to digest exactly it's all
fine print BS is is it's too much yeah
you know it's like at the end of those
radio commercials we're here guys speak
in a mile a minute right you're like
what the hell saying who knows what's
gonna happen right I hit OK and then
apps get updated all the time so much to
where there are like pages and pages of
new features and upgrades and no one
reads s up they just hit the upgrade who
does it the worst starting to piss me
off Sony does it with their PlayStation
stuff right when you want to install the
new version of the firmware for
playstation 3 right you gotta flip
through an entire friggin thing right
and no one does that who the hell well
you got a scroll down till it says
except like okay finally after you know
40,000 words I can play you know twisted
metal and only one verb change on line 6
of page 32 exactly why do you I'll put
out a play devil's advocate here and ask
if it's the consumers responsibility to
read it just like they would with
ingredients on the side of a package
before they himself there's a lot of
less ingredients on the side of a
package right there's a reasonable
expectation I think and I think it's too
much to ask to say why are you chain why
what is the update yeah what's the
highlight right that's you know that's a
lie a sort of trying to do stuff like
that we know they're there new privacy
policy that's taken effect march one
they've been blasting every time you go
check your gmail bless you bless you
bless you look we're changing stuff
click this and it gives you a decent
summary of what exactly is happening you
know they're being as transparent as I
guess we would like them to be so I
don't know that I would like that trend
to you know be universal we only have a
few minutes today because we have to end
a little early as a few other shows
coming in after us but let's get to some
