I've got dared I've got Sarah for the
past three years on the voice christina
has served as the social media
correspondent all right well we have
another question it is from Twitter
giving fans exclusive access to their
favorite contestants and coaches with
online bonus features behind-the-scenes
interviews and up-to-the-minute updates
during the live broadcast how's it been
being the social media ambassador it's
been great I mean I never thought I
would be I would have this title as a
job like I'm like total renaissance
woman now with everything done
singer-songwriter actress this and that
and now social media correspondent it's
really a new job like it's a real job
that people are getting hired for and
that are helping businesses so I love it
um this is such a great show and this
show has done so well with social media
because they're all about connecting
with their fans and so with my job I get
to speak to the fans show them the most
exclusive footage and do what we're
doing now where it's really just laid
back and it's not so like hey how did
you feel going up on the stage like it's
really like let's get into your story
let's get close and then the world is
really learning about them you know
through that moment so in a sense is
this a dream job for you absolutely it's
a dream job because I love what I'm
doing um I already looked like this was
something I did already and now to get
hidden do something that I love it's
like oh wow it's like I hit the lottery
from Instagram and Twitter to
up-and-coming apps like mobley christina
is active on a wide range of platforms
I'm huge and Instagram and love
Instagram I'll use social media to see
the pictures because I tend to find them
you know when people hashtag my name
I'll find it on Twitter or I'll find it
on Instagram or mobley mobiles another
one it's video and it's pictures and you
know a hashtag is pretty much starts a
story so it makes it really so much
easier to find everything my best ones
are like especially ones that are for
pictures because I feel the world speaks
through pictures now you know even if
i'm placing something on Instagram i
might have put it through three other
apps before placing it on Instagram or
Twitter or on our facebook page at the
voice or something I tend to go to leg
pic stitch and try to put in as much
pictures as I can gosh there's so many
there's a new one well I don't know if
it's new but it's called fancy and i'm a
shopper i like going up the fancy of
course i have it i have that app it's
yeah that one's so cool because it opens
your eyes to so many new products that
are out there and you could just fancy
it or you could buy it if you could
invent it out what would that have to be
if i can invent an app i have i've had a
couple different ideas other than
something like the songwriters pad i've
also had an idea to invent an app where
it's kind of like a travel buddy where
but it's geared towards women I find a
lot of women are traveling more often
now when they're having like girls
vacations and it's like all about girls
time I would love there to be an app
that is kind of a travel app where
you're kind of placing up pictures about
your trip and what you did where's the
place to go how much fun you had and
like you know you can kind of just share
it with your friends you know talking
about you know all the fun places we've
been and kind of sharing those moments
and the right places to go with each
other so how does Cristina stay so
connected to her favorite apps I have
two regular iPads like the first one the
second one and then I got them anyone
but the mini works out well in my purse
with the three other person or three
other phones so tell me what do you do
on your iPad's I think I just you know I
just purchased them immediately as for
you know as soon as they all came out
and I just thought it was genius because
was tired of kind of carrying my laptop
around everywhere so on each one I mean
they're kind of all very similar but
they might have more apps or different
apps on each one like maybe one I have
iMovie and that's where i'll edit like
movies or things that I'll put on my
youtube channel yeah and because it
takes up a lot more space I won't put
that on my other I've had my second one
I probably have a lot of shopping stuff
like guilt and I have fuel fab um the
foundry all of the shopping websites I
have probably on that one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
