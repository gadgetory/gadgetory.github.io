winter is coming so I know there's a
chance you could leave your gadgets in
your cold cold car that's what this two
hours in the freezer is about to
simulate what's so pretty all right see
you later little buddy all right let's
get this bad boy out of the freezer see
how it's doing
no we have our product read ipod touch a
portion of this does go to charity to
help with AIDS research ok so everything
seems to be working it really wants to
get on the Wi-Fi except the home button
is a little sluggish but it is working
so I would say if you do leave your iPod
in the car in the frozen tundra it's
going to be alright you change this song
Oh No
oh no my iPod
Oh
my iPod did not like that these out so I
can hear myself talking yeah
we have damage we got some little
plastic poking out the side we have a
see that was really realistic by the way
I have done that a bunch of times but
the screens not cracked let's see if it
comes on screen comes on
still functional
I'm surprised actually that the home
button is so functional because it's
coming apart so badly at the bottom here
but it goes press it up I wish to just
do a normal drop now well that was
dramatic but I still think we should try
to get oh my iPod oh it's so tricky it
it fell okay well that was a little less
for us we still have this little screw
really wanted to come out no damage to
the camera that I can tell it's pushed
that back in oh yeah screams all messed
up full lines there
so now
we have pretty much busted our
touchscreen it's no longer responding to
any touch at all I confessed that I
hurled it to the ground but that is not
okay
for $300 for two drops to completely
destroy this thing well it is starting
to rain I was going to dump this in a
puddle for the water test but I don't
think there's any point in that I think
it's sustained so much damage in our
drop test that is pretty much a goner we
managed to well and truly kill our red
iPod touch but I don't want to deprive
you of the full gauntlet of torture
tests so we bought another one and we're
about to put it in the oven once again
this is simulating what might happen if
you left your iPod in a hot car for a
while now we do a little hotter then
your car is going to get 200 degrees but
only for an hour only
good luck iPod time to rescue the iPod
all right oh I hope it's okay I can
smell it
not like a yummy bread way either in a
totally toxic I can't believe I do this
in my own home way I don't see any
obvious melting all right not even angry
temperature warning so I'm just gonna
let it cool off for a little bit ooh
that's hot and see if it comes back to
life
so I accidentally bumped it while I was
seeing if it was cool and it gave me a
temperature warning but now it looks
like it's just coming on and trying to
Seri me I was hoping I would get the
temperature warning again must have been
a relic but it looks like it is back on
definitely on the Wi-Fi seems pretty
responsive after about 10 minutes of
cooling which is not surprising because
it's really thin it's not like it's
going to retain a lot of heat I would
say iPod Touch has no problem with the
hotness
so it seemed only obvious for the iPod
torture test that the wild card should
be giving the iPods to children and
asking them to not be careful while they
play games and have snacks so I have Sam
ha
mm -
and Eli
and you guys are all gonna play games
right on our fancy iPods so I want to
tell you the rules oh wait what I know
you're gonna have to share and then
there's there's a rule for today okay so
while you're drinking your juice and
eating chips and fruit and pizza and
playing with iPods I want you to not be
careful that's right I remember that so
be careful all right you guys hungry
yeah and you want to play some games
okay no don't forget to share but go I'm
going to get out of your way and let you
play oh good job good job

pretty crazy game we're gonna I know
we're gonna put the two iPods on this
plastic and then we're gonna add

put them in the middle and let's go get
our juice we should turn them on
