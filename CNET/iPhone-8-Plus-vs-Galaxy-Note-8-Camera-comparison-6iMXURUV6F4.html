the note eight are worthy rivals they
have two 12 megapixel main cameras
optical zoom and a special feature just
for portraits so how do they compare in
the real world we took a trip to slide
ranch in California to test them out on
some kids and animals and less than both
on the default settings with automatic
exposure the iPhone in the note used the
two cameras to create a blurred
background effect similar to a DSLR with
a note it's called live focus and in the
iPhone it's actually called portrait
mode the one shot on the iPhone has
greater contrast and richer colors but
Taylor's face looks dark and the phone
had a hard time blurring out the edges
around the hair the notes has a brighter
exposure in the cutout around the edges
is not as harsh it also lets you adjust
the blur while you're taking the shot or
after it defaults to a medium blur which
makes it look more natural or more
intense which looks more like the effect
on the iPhone you can't adjust the blur
on the iPhone but you can't simulate
different lighting which is still in
beta
lura side I think people look better on
the iPhone the warmer tones are more
flattering on the skin like this shot
with more realistic details of Bella's
face the note washed out the image and
created a glow effect on the skin almost
as if it was airbrushed same goes for
portraits on the front camera the note
assumes you need airbrushing and
defaults to level two on its beauty mode
which smooths out the freckles on the
girls faces selfies on the iPhones are
more natural with more vibrant colors
and greater contrast even up close the
colors and contrast look better on the
iPhone the shot seems to have more depth
and detail even though the notes is just
as sharp the downside you can't get too
close with the iPhone it just won't
focus the note lets you get closer and
has a manual focus mode for more
precision both phones have a 2 X optical
zoom but the shot on the note captured
more detail with less noise up close
even though my skin tone is more
accurate on the iPhone but for
landscapes I actually prefer the cooler
temperatures of the note both shots are
incredible but the Golden Gate Bridge
pops out of the screen in the notes the
note also outshines the iPhone in
low-light landscapes the colors on the
orb look more intense on the iPhone and
there's less lens flare but the notes
lights up the entire shot and brings out
the details of the sidewalk and the
houses behind
this time around it might be too close
to call the note has a slight edge on
landscapes but for people I prefer the
iPhone and both have a long way to go
before they can compete with a DSLR for
that blurred background effect</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
