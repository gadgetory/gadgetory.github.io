coaching on your wrist does it work I'm
Scott Stein and I'm wearing the basis
peak basis which is an Intel company now
has made sport tracking fitness bands
for a couple of years now the base is b1
and the basis carbon steel were ones
that had 24 hour heart rate monitoring
and an ability to teach you habits so it
was kind of like achievement base
coaching over time if you play video
games and have gotten Xbox achievements
or maybe you've tried Nike FuelBand and
tried to hit those little milestones
well that's a lot what habits are on
basis but they've rebooted their watch
completely with the basis peak there's a
newly designed a hot piece of hardware
and it is waterproof down to 5 ATM as
four days of battery life the screen is
much easier to read more like a pebble
steel or pebble watch if you see in that
bright LCD good in broad daylight plus
it as a backlight what does it do it
tracks your heart rate all the time and
it also tracks steps it has an automatic
way of sensing when you move with a
technology called body IQ and it tells
you your sleep habits including REM
sleep within an app for iOS and Android
and it syncs wirelessly via bluetooth
with your phone if you had a previous
basis band it didn't yet to plug it into
your PC now that's fine what it does
best is be automatic it tracks my steps
automatically it shows my heart rate all
the time what does it do to help me on
the fly not quite as much in the future
the basis peak will be able to give you
coaching tips here and also send
messages to your watch that doesn't
happen yet right now it's about hitting
those achievements maybe waking up at
the same time maybe getting a certain
number of steps or getting active
exercise once in a while but heart rate
is such a variable term it tells you
resting heart rate but the rest of it is
a bit mysterious and a lot of products
are on the market now or soon that are
going to use continuous heart rate
tracking there's a new jawbone there's
going to be Fitbit and there's also the
Microsoft band and they're going to be
more to come so the basis peak doesn't
hook into as many things as you'd like
or that I would like it's okay it's just
not great and I feel like it's
competition is going to get
hot and heavy you necessarily need to
buy into basis as philosophy for long
I'm Scott Stein and this is the basis
peak two hundred dollars available now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
