you've probably seen the Google doodle
these are animations or images
celebrating national holidays and
historical figures but this year the
doodle team has done something a bit
different
they've made a game for Valentine's Day
called Pangolin love we're here at
Google to see how it was made I have a
lot of fun developing those like how the
like main character would look like I
was the lead engineer on the game I
build the initial prototypes I fill in
the gaps between design and engineering
there are two penguins who are in love
and because they're endangered this is a
very rare chance that they get to be
together
and so the Penguins are native to Africa
and Asia
so one Pangolin is traveling across
those continents to the other we came
like through like a bunch of like
different animals version of like what
animals could roll and I was like maybe
I could have like imaginary rolling
elephants or bears I made a bunch of
research of like pill dogs salamanders
like any animals I could roll and we
came up with like a whole game idea for
like a little armadillo which we really
liked in the desert but but then Kevin
came up like with the idea of like a
penguin which was actually really smart
because it's like an endangered species
it was super simple at first like trying
to get the idea that this little main
character would go like through
different countries having different
sized penguins like doing different
things like dancing playing instruments
making cakes then I spend more time
trying to develop this main character so
in Philippines level I believe you can
swim and then there are other levels
where you can attach your tongue because
penguins have these really long tongues
you can attach your tongue to it like in
the China level to a lamp and swaying
and stuff like that so the dynamic is
changing for every level
once I animated like in my software I
will export the sequence transparent
sequence and give it to the engineers
that would they'll put it directly in
the game
the challenge of a video game compared
to animation is like usually you can't
have too many textures because the more
color you have like the heavier it is so
and I love working with textures so for
me when I first and they're like no
texture no boiling effect nothing goes
but then they found a way of like making
it work started work on Pangolin which
embodies a lot of the art style that
helen had created one of the easter eggs
is if you type the name of the doodle
Hangul in love you get a special glyph a
lot of people that have played this have
told me it resembles Sonic
it's this really Wheaton phenomenon I've
like you're working on something you've
got to keep it super secret super secret
super secret and then one day literally
everyone in the world can see it like
you know you're crossing your fingers is
that people are gonna enjoy it
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
