to stash away photos videos device
backups and more in the cloud apple
offers users five gigabytes of space for
free however because it's five gigabytes
of space per Apple ID and not per device
you may find yourself running out of
space faster than you would like
additional storage can be purchased from
Apple but if you want to save some of
that hard-earned money there are ways to
free up space to see how much space you
are using enter settings on your iPhone
or iPad select iCloud click on storage
followed by manage storage there's a
good chance that backups are taking up
most of your space if you have backups
from old devices say from an iPhone 4 or
an iPad 2 you no longer own you can just
go ahead and delete those simply click
on the backup scroll to the bottom and
tap delete backup you may have also
backed up things in your most recent
backup that you didn't really need to
have saved in the cloud if this is the
case click on the most recent backup and
scroll down to see all of the backup
data if you find something you really
don't care about simply flip the switch
to off to delete the data this will also
make sure it isn't backed up the next
time you perform a backup the last thing
I recommend doing is the leading backed
up data from your photo library as you
can see mine is taking up almost 2
gigabytes of space this is an easy way
to free up a ton of space to stop your
photos from automatically upload to the
cloud go to settings click on iCloud
select photos and turn off my photo
stream there are a ton of cloud services
out there that will automatically upload
your photos and save them safely in the
cloud the best part is most of them
offer more free space than iCloud my
favorites are Yahoo's Flickr app
Microsoft's a onedrive app and the
Google Plus app for more tips and tricks
like this be sure to check out how to
cnet.com you can also reach out to me on
Twitter with any questions or comments
