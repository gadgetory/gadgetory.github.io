assistant we think of this as building
each user their own individual Google
and we have started becoming truly
conversational because of our strengths
and natural language processing for
example you can be in front of this
structure in Chicago and ask Google who
designed this you don't need to say the
beam or or the cloud gate we understand
your context and we answer that the
designer is punished couple here's
another example you can ask Google who
directed the revenant the revenue was
directed by Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu
and you can follow that up with the
question show me his awards notice that
I didn't say the name which I'm glad
because I find that name very very hard
to pronounce and Google could pick that
conversation up and return the right
answer so you should be able to ask
Google what's playing tonight and by the
way today if you ask that question we do
return movie results but we want to go a
step further we want to understand your
context and maybe suggest three relevant
movies which you would like nearby I
should be able to look at it and maybe
tell Google we want to bring the kids
this time and then if that's the case
Google should refine the answer and
suggest family-friendly options and
maybe even ask me would you like four
tickets to any of these and if I say
sure let's do Jungle Book it should go
ahead and get the tickets and have them
ready waiting for me when I need it this
could have gone many many different ways
for example when Google returned the
results I could have asked his jungle
book any good and Google could have
given me the reviews and maybe even
shown me a trailer and by the way I saw
the movie it's terrific and hope you get
to see it as well every single
conversation is different every single
context is different and we are working
hard to do this
billions of conversation for billions of
users around the world for everyone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
