represent the pinnacle of what a lot of
folks mean when they say a really nice
car the 2013 BMW 750 li and the 2013
lexus LS 460 in the F Sport trim let's
find out how they really differ in their
essence as we check the tech now rather
than go through these guys with an
exhaustive bullet by bullet head-to-head
comparison and spend an hour doing so
instead I want to find out how these two
cars that both can print CNET style do
so differently to let you figure out
which one is really right for you
first off these two cars dashboards
speak tech differently the lexus says
it's sort of loudly more button rich and
crisp and somehow busier the BMW is by
no means basic but it's tech interfaces
play second fiddle to creature comforts
in cars at this level the basics better
be standard so you'll find GPS
navigation with live traffic Bluetooth
calling and a backup camera with good
guidance overlays and those are standard
on both cars though it wasn't that long
ago that BMW nickeled and dimed you for
most of that stuff and speaking of
cameras are 750 has the optional walleye
cams installed up front and while
they're of somewhat dubious value
they're not found on the lexus you steer
the Lexus interface with this inverted
puck they call the remote touch
controller it moves the cursor offers
punch to enter and uses haptic feedback
as it bumps over things on the screen
but it badly needs a back button BMW has
endured the years of sneers and jeers to
turn I Drive into one of the best in car
interfaces you steer it with this I
Drive knob and handful of associated
shortcut buttons including one for back
and interestingly BMW has removed haptic
feedback as I Drive matured I found
voice command the Lexus was quick to
understand me but requires parsing an
address into many parts or button
presses enter an address enter an
address say only the city name or say
change state San Francisco BMW is also
quick on the uptake but lets you blurt
out an address the most complicated
thing you'll typically do with voice all
in one phrase one zero zero zero
Vaness avenue san francisco california
processing your input did you mean 1000s
Van Ness Avenue San Francisco
most cars play The Greatest Hits of
modern audio sources with just a few
differences the Lexus is the car of
these two that supports iTunes tagging
with its HD radio but the BMW has a 20
gigabyte hard drive - rip - both are
equally useless to most people which
brings us to apps Lexus is part of
Toyota that means they get the excellent
Entune app suite renamed n form here
it's a basket of name-brand cloud loaded
apps including Yelp OpenTable Pandora
Bing I Heart Radio and Facebook Places
and that's standard BMWs app support is
still optional and it just rolls up
Facebook Twitter and web radio via an
iPhone app no Android but built into the
car regardless of phone is Google search
which is killer and now Yelp as well and
note that BMW has built-in 3G in the car
where Lexus requires you tether your
phone to get connected whether you're
listening to one of those streaming apps
or AM radio Marc Levinson's 19 speakers
and 400 watts on the Lexus or Bang &amp;amp;
Olufsen 16 speakers and good greif 1200
watts in the BMW mean both cars can be
optioned with sound better than you can
hear cars like this don't just treat
backseat passengers like hitchhikers the
Lexus wins on total rear seat comforts
optional to include reclining shiatsu
massage butterfly headrests rear seat
cooler and air purifier you can tell the
Germans still inwardly scoff at such
nonsense but have dragged themselves to
include heated and cooled massage seats
where they score big is the best dual
rear screen entertainment system in the
biz there are generous size they're nice
and thin but notice what's really
interesting they are iDrive interfaces
with an eye drive controller you've got
access to multimedia radio navigation
all the same services you've got in the
front of the car you've also got
connected Drive so without having to
bring an iPad to the car you've got some
modest degree of online services right
here in the vehicle built-in
both these cars are v8-powered
the Lexus has the bigger 4.6 liter v8
but the BMW slaps a pair of turbos on
it's smaller 4.4 liter the BMW ends up
with more horsepower more torque and
it's quicker and even though that 7
Series weighs more and is faster both
cars deliver identical mpg so you got to
hand it to BMW here at least on paper
not to get that equal efficiency with
higher power and weight BMW had to add
complexity in the form of brake force
electricity regeneration borrowed from
hybrid cars an engine automatic
start/stop which I still find rather
crudely executed but luckily defeatable
being luxury rides both these cars come
on suave at first unless you dig down
into their powertrain but when you do
the BMWs power and Road handling make it
a more serious driver's car to my hands
even though the Lexus is an F sport both
cars have a handful of engine
transmission and suspension profiles
from eco to aggressive and they do offer
pronounced differences from one end to
the other though I think three settings
would probably be ample guys BMW offers
a head-up display to extend the
interface of the windshield as well as
night vision that is now actually not
totally disorienting but I really enjoy
the Lexus enform apps base on the road
and find its big interface and brands of
content more useful than BMWs rather
Stern translation of Twitter and
Facebook which I don't need in the car
anyway
if you need help driving both cars are
there for you Lexus has active Lane
drift technology but passive blind spot
tech
BMW's Lane drift and blind spot are now
both active in the seven each car offers
adaptive cruise control the Lexus can
also do front collision warning and even
bring the car to a stop at City speeds
if you're too busy fiddling with your
coffee to watch what you're doing BMW
leaves you alone to rear-end someone in
independent Bavarian fashion okay the
bottom line on these two cars begins
with the bottom line which is quite
different I checked up that BMW dialed
it in seen that style and pushed a
hundred and eight thousand then a
similar tech load on the Lexus and I
couldn't quite break 90 so about an
$18,000 Delta not silly money in terms
of their character the BMW has a real
serious executive sedan feel to it but
it's a real gutter fighter on the street
when you push it hard
the Lexus I think a little less so even
as an F Sport but it has more of a schwa
devii about the technology in it it's a
real tech toy play it that way
