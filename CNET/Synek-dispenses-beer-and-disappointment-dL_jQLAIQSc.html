dispenser is good at bring home your
beer in this bag put it into the
temperature controlled compartment here
and pour yourself a glass of suds simply
by pulling on the handle for three
hundred and thirty dollars you basically
have a countertop tap cynic includes a
co2 canister you'll need to fill this up
on your own but then you can twist it
into the regulator snap the hose on to
the bag on the valve marked with two
lines hook the beer line into the other
valve push in the bag and pull senex
bags are twice as big as growlers they
keep out light and when poured correctly
they keep out oxygen the idea is that
you can take one of these cartridges to
your favorite brewery and have them fill
it up for you so that you can bring home
a beer you might not otherwise be able
to obtain in bottles there's a map on
cynics website and it looks very
impressive but you're gonna want to
enter your zip code into the box and
make sure that there are locations near
you with a gold pin those are the ones
that are gonna have a fill kit some
areas are gonna have any they have
restrictions against filling up
containers without hard sides or filling
containers over a certain volume worse
once you go through all that trouble
you're not gonna get significantly
longer shelf life from a cynic bag than
you would from a growler supposedly a
cynic cartridge can keep your beer fresh
for 30 days growlers only do that for
two or three we taste tested four
different beers from two different
breweries and not a single one lasted
more than four or five days without a
significant drop in flavor
the main promises of the cynic
countertop dispenser are variety and
freshness right now it doesn't come
through an either one
