world 2017 do they even matter anymore
you might actually wonder that as a
scene that headline recently did upon
the announcement of new changes to
Apple's vaunted iPad line they almost
made the announcement in a thief in the
night soared away there was no big event
no gala no incredible showy presentation
just a press release that rolled out a
price cut and a little bit of
streamlining of the models they offer so
what's going on here iPads were supposed
to be a hundred and fifty million unit
per year business by now instead Apple's
only sold about three hundred and fifty
million in seven years
tablets seem to have suffered from
smartphones getting bigger and frankly
big enough the big phones or phablets
have grown three hundred and fifty
percent in the US market what do you
hand your kid when they're antsy and
bored a tablet bigger than their head or
just your largest phone also all
smartphones have a built-in 4G
connection to the Internet where that
still remains relatively rare on tablets
and most of us don't relish the idea of
adding another device to our wireless
plan cheap tablets have taken over the
market we don't seem to care so much
about having a certain brand of tablet
or at least having the latest model
whereas we are pretty aware and
up-to-date on having more or less the
latest smartphone but don't write off
tablets there are still a billion unique
users around the globe that have and use
one which is somewhat less than half the
number of those of us who use a
smartphone and the Microsoft effect is
being projected the surface line is
expected to go from under 9 percent of
the global market in 2015 to almost 20
percent in 2020 almost single-handedly
stabilizing the tablet market worldwide
and give tablets credit for stoking our
appetites that led to things like big
phones or phablets convertibles laptop
tablet hybrids all things we might not
even known enough to ask for before 2010
know what's next at C net coms last big
thing i'm brian cool</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
