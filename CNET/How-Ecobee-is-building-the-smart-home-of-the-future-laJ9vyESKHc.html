mattress comes from Caddyshack right
there's a point where Chevy Chase is see
your future be your future right what I
like about you know entrepreneurship is
you know you walk into the office and
you can have a real impact tomorrow and
and you know you can have this vision
and you can see what you want to achieve
and it can actually it can happen I
don't know how many times I watched
Caddyshack when I was a kid okay paid up
there you go I'm Stuart Lombard I'm the
CEO and one of the founders of you could
be
Cermak we're in software development I
went to work for a company called te
electronics amazing company because they
make flight simulators and what was
really cool about that company is they
made everything in that factory so they
made you know they actually made nuts
and bolts they like painted all the
sheet metal they made all the wiring hi
nurses they designed and fabricated all
their circuit boards and I was fortunate
that I had a horrible boss one day I
decided like you know what I just I
don't want to work in Florence Oh I
remember walking into his office and I
had a packet stack of papers and he was
giving me a hard time and I just like
threw the papers in the air and said I
quit I did the totals like take this job
and shove it and I thought okay I'll
just you know spend some time looking to
different opportunities and trying to
figure out what I'm gonna do next
so I think you know everyone has to
decide what they want to do with their
life right you know at that time I said
like well you know what I would really
like to reduce my environmental
footprint so let me do a few things to
see what I could do to reduce my
environmental footprint so what I
realized the insight that we had was
that heating and cooling is 50 to 70
percent of your home's energy use so
actually better managing your heating
and cooling is probably the you know
easiest best thing that you can do one
of the things I like best is is his
products right there's making products
building products figuring out like you
know how something should go together
how to make a great user experience all
those kinds of things it's what I like
to do and so actually you know program
my Honeywell thermostat that I had at
the time which first of all takes like a
PhD to do and that was kind of the
impetus for like there's got to be a
better way and that was really the sort
of the founding idea which was you know
how do we use technology to help people
conserve energy save money reduce their
environmental footprint and that because
heating is such a big part of your
energy use that if we can you know
to the Internet if we can use Internet
data we can put smarter processors in
our thermostat so we can have better
algorithms you know how much better can
we do I would like to do something great
I'd like to build a brand that
opportunity to build something than to
build something great people say like
what did you do did you wake up one
morning and decide you were going to
start a thermostat company it was like
pretty much what happened wasn't like
you know we've been building consumer
electronics products for years you know
we saw an opportunity we were like we
can figure this out
and so we set out on this journey so we
started calling up like heating and
cooling company's in Toronto and like
can we ride with your guys in the truck
like who the heck are you guys talking
about right we actually you know we went
out and we we rode with heating and
cooling service technicians was exciting
there were all kinds of things that we
learned you know I think first of all
just what it takes to you know to do an
installation you know what those heating
and cooling service professionals care
about you know how we could help them
make the installation process easier
well that's you know that's really how
we you know how we started the business
and you know it took us 18 months to get
our first product into market this is
like you know one of the first
prototypes of what Ernie could be
thermostat would eventually come to look
like this is it right here
at the time smartphones were just coming
you know into reality and we had this
idea what if we took a thermostat and
kind of mated it with with a smart phone
you know what what could we do what
could it look like how it work and this
is it it almost kind of looks like a
phone in a way
had a color touchscreen first Wi-Fi
connected thermostat in the market right
there was no other Wi-Fi connected
thermostats in the market and and you
know that was really around thinking
about convenience you know how could I
use one of this products how can I
always make sure it's comfortable when I
get home can we connect it to the data
can we use Internet data to make smarter
decisions for you and the answer is yes
people were like oh it's awesome it's
fantastic it's great it's you know it's
amazing and we were doing high fives and
all that kind of stuff and and then
neski
what we realized is that you know we
thought we were playing in the NHL but
we weren't really playing in the NHL we
were the champions of the you know North
Toronto minor Bantam hockey league but
we thought we were in the NHL right it
forced us to go back and retool and
think about the business really
carefully and that enabled us to release
a whole new generation of products which
was significantly better that you know
we believe you know is the best in the
market we have this vision for what we
would call the help Lahoma if you think
about you know the platforms you have
today you've got like desktop you've got
mobile we believe connected home will be
another platform and so we're really
betting on Barfield voice and really
integrating far-field voice into all the
products that we have so that we can
extend Barfield voice to any room of
your home where we are right now is is
what we call the audio lab and it is our
space where we can test our voice enable
products in today's Unitec today update
this is saying it and hear the stories
that matter right now for every new
software upgrade that we do on the
system to ensure that we are still
meeting the bar of good performance this
is the space that we use for it
the second is around sensors right and
and really being able to put sensors
into products so that they have more
contextual awareness right so a good
example was having our lights which have
a temperature sensor in it so it can be
a room sensor for your thermostat so
this is rich glass our latest Dali it's
also a temperature sensor in here so now
every room that you'll put a switch plus
in you'll actually get better
temperature management because it will
communicate the temperature of that room
back to your it could be Thomas that you
want to basically build Beauty and the
Beast in your devices right so how would
be your light switch become that smart
endless day you give it eyes and ears
and I would see in our devices we're
adding you know a microphone and
speakers those things are Alexa but also
there are sensors that can understand
the environment the key for us is not to
try it out Google Google right we can't
win by you know trying to do what Google
is doing we need really a different
playbook and I think you know when we
look at our strategy our strategy is
really built around focus and innovation
and I think if you look at you know
thermostats specifically you know we're
delivering more innovations to the
market faster than Google is it's taking
Google three years to come out with room
centers as an example you know in their
room sensors don't have occupancy
detection I feel like you know we're not
even you know we're describing the
surface we're just getting started and
one of the things that I'm most proud of
is it feels like you know we're just
getting better like I don't feel like
we're at that top end and we're like you
know limiting now and I feel like wow
there's just so much opportunity and the
team is so much better and our ability
to execute is so much better and it's
not only is it better but it's also
accelerating and getting even better
which which is very exciting
