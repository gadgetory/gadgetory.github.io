iron.i Oh ever built into a MacBook Pro
both the 13 and the 15-inch have four
Thunderbolt three ports dr. Bober is an
incredible 40 gigabit per second of
bandwidth now it also supports USB 3.1
gen2 and of course DisplayPort 1.2 now I
know many of you know that Thunderbolt 3
uses the USB C style connector and that
means that any one of the four ports can
be a charging port plug it into
whichever one you want left side right
side and that's your charging port but
it's so much more versatile than that
each one of the ports can be power can
be thunder bolt can be USB DisplayPort
video out with VGA or HDMI so here's an
example imagine you're a Final Cut Pro
editor and you want to set up your
macbook pro on your workstation at home
at work you want to build it out well
here's an example of what you can do
with this incredible system first you
want out a display and there many
displays you can add over DisplayPort
but this one is really special this is a
brand new LG display that we work
together with them on to make it an
amazing display for MacBook Pro
customers it's called the LG ultra fine
5k display it displays 5k resolution
it's wide color it is built-in cameras
microphones and speakers it has three
USB C port so you can plug peripherals
directly into the display and all of
that connects to your macbook pro /
single Thunderbolt 3 cable not only that
it also charges the MacBook Pro over
that same cable is the ultimate docking
station and it's so cool that why not
add to write so you could have two 5k
displays plus your built-in 15 inch
Retina display that's almost 35 million
pixels being driven by the graphics of
the 15-inch MacBook Pro with our two
free Thunderbolt 3 ports we're going to
add not only one but two RAID storage
arrays this is the new promise Pegasus 3
it's configured with 24 terabytes per
array here so we think about that
storage those displays this level of
expendability and performance is
not possible on any other notebook it's
truly remarkable</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
