of the panasonic be dt 2 30 PK blu-ray
player as televisions get progressively
smarter and more streaming services are
loaded onto inexpensive devices like the
roku all consoles like the ps3 people
aren't looking to blu-ray players as
much as they have in the past however a
blu-ray player like the panasonic is
both able to offer the same apps as roku
like Netflix and Hulu Plus while also
being much less power-hungry than a
games console this is a very competent
player with excellent picture quality
and fairly responsive operation but it
has two major flaws firstly its ejects
you to advertising and secondly the menu
system isn't very intuitive on most menu
pages you will see ads and the worst
thing is you can't currently turn them
off if you're paying full price for a
blu-ray player and its competitors offer
similar performance and no ads why would
you choose panasonic but i'll digress
the design of display is changed from
last year but it is an exact replica of
the sony player with a trapezoidal shape
and piano black accents the remote
control is fairly simple to use and it
does include a Netflix button but a wish
it had a shortcut to the smart TV viera
connect service because without that you
have to deal with the vagaries of the
menu system want to play pandora you
can't simply go down to music instead
you have to go up to network then right
to network services and then find
pandora from the menu system it's
complicated performance wise though it's
very good with excellent playback of
both blu-ray and DVD movies and a great
selection of apps but if you have about
120 dollars i'd suggest going for the
sony bdp s 5100 instead which if nothing
else doesn't currently subject you to
unwanted advertising this has been ty
pendlebury for cnet.com</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
