Bridget Carey on sina com and it's time
to get loaded I know you won't be
shocked when I tell you Netflix lost
customers this past quarter the company
fell out of favor with customers after
changing subscription fees and
announcing that short-lived Qwikster
spin-off but the impact was heavy
netflix announced it lost eight hundred
and ten thousand customers keep in mind
there are still more than 23 million
subscribers but this is the first dip
netflix has seen in nearly two years
every quarter for the past seven it is
added at least 1 million new customers
CEO Reed Hastings said quote quickster
became the symbol of Netflix not
listening Hastein said he would not quit
over the mistakes and his focusing
resources to improve streaming content
the chief engineer behind the creation
of apple's ipod has unveiled a smart and
chic home thermostat it's called the
Nest Learning Thermostat and the company
behind it is run by Tony Fadell Apple's
former ipod chief who stepped down in
2008 the new thermostat control is a
round wheel with a central display
simple enough to use without a manual
but it's smart enough to learn when
people are home and will auto adjust to
outside weather for efficient energy use
it even has a nap costing two hundred
fifty dollars it will go on sale next
month at Best Buy have you heard of the
startup zarley no well it just might be
the next big tool for finding cheap
services like finding a dog walker or
getting someone to paint the house it's
somewhat similar to craigslist but more
focused on buying and selling goods and
has a mobile app it launched nationally
this year in May but buzz is picking up
after the company acquired 14 million in
financing and it added Meg Whitman to
the board of directors who is the
current CEO of hewlett-packard and
former head of ebay prepared for mobile
payments to get a lot more popular
Walmart is the latest retailer to sell
square which aptly named is a
square-shaped credit card swiping device
that plugs in the headset jack of an
iphone or ipad it allows small business
owners to make card transactions just
using an Apple device and customers sign
their name with a finger on the
touchscreen you may have come across it
being used at a mobile business like a
a food truck and with Walmart now
selling it expect to see it more
frequently the company reports its
processing more than 2 billion in
payments annually President Barack Obama
has added another social network
presence to his campaign tumblr is a
short form blogging site where users can
share text and media like photos videos
and audio the campaign calls it a
collaborative storytelling effort so
people across the country can submit
their campaign stories or thoughts the
page admits it knows there will be
trolls but says quote we only ask you
remember that were people fairly nice
ones and that your mother would want you
to be polite those are your headlines
