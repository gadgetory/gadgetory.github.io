this is a quick look at GoPros mid-range
action cam the hero3 plus silver edition
at $300 it's $100 less than GoPros top
model the $400 Black Edition from the
outside they look almost identical
except for the silver 3 on the front and
gopro packages them with almost all of
the same accessories including the new
lighter smaller difficult to open and
less waterproof housing not included is
GoPros Wi-Fi remote control but with the
cameras built-in Wi-Fi you can still
connect to your smartphone and use it to
control the camera change settings and
view and download clips from the camera
to your device along with losing the
remote the silver uses a different
sensor and processor than the Black
Edition and that's really where the
hundred dollar difference comes in
because of that swap you lose things
like the black editions protune mode and
the capability to capture video and
photos simultaneously and there aren't
as many resolution and frame rate
options among other things what you do
get is a camera with good battery life
at about 2 hours without Wi-Fi and that
captures some pretty nice video at up to
1080p at 60 frames per second or 720p at
120 frames per second the clips aren't
quite as good as the Black Edition but
that's kind of the point basically if
you like GoPros camera design and just
want solid HD video you might be able to
save yourself a hundred bucks and get
this I'm Josh golden and that's a look
at the GoPro Hero 3 plus silver edition</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
