about to fall in love with chrome the
operating system hi I'm Seth Rosenblatt
frisina download.com and in this first
look video I'll be showing you around
Google's beta release of the Chrome OS
there's not a whole lot new here Chrome
OS feels and looks almost exactly like
chrome the browser the cr-48 Google's
demo notebook prototype of what
consumers can expect in the summer of
2011 and the computer we've got here is
powerful enough that the operating
system wakes from sleep instantly
currently Chrome OS is running the
stable version 8 of the Chrome browser
and that's expected to change as the
browser updates extensions bookmark
settings anything that you've synced in
Chrome will be instantly available in
Chrome OS the settings window has been
expanded to accommodate the requirements
of a full operating system although
there doesn't seem to be a way to change
the clock to 24 hours Chrome Web Apps
play a big role in the Chrome OS the
apps become essential quick links from
your new tab window to your email your
productivity suite notepad instant
messaging video and voice calling and
other programs that most people are used
to being separate from the browser the
Chrome Web Store link it gets you access
to even more another nifty feature of
the operating system is the logon
procedure when you first open the laptop
it asks for your Google username and
password and then takes a photo of you
with a dedicated webcam Chrome OS
supports multiple accounts and has a
guest account option that opens the
entire OS in incognito mode Chrome's
trackless browsing option the cr-48
laptop the only computer that currently
ships with Chrome OS comes with keys
that are indelibly tied to an operating
system that's also a browser the
function keys have been replaced with
dedicated navigation buttons back
forward refresh full screen and next
window controls yes you can not only
open a new browser tab but a new window
as well the caps lock key has been
replaced by a dedicated search key that
opens a new tab and puts the cursor in
the location bar you can change this
back to caps lock if you're really into
it there are a ton of hotkeys that have
been mapped to this laptop and they make
a huge difference hit ctrl alt
mark to see an overlay map that reveals
them all including ones for taking
screenshots revealing the task manager
and printing right now Chrome OS is only
available on the CR 48 laptop of course
you can download and install Chrome OS
as open source parent chromium OS on
most laptops or desktops for CNET with a
first look at Chrome OS I'm Seth
