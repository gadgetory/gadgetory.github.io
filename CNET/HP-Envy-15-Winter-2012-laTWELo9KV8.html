a look at the brand new version of HP's
NV 15 now if you seen HP's envy laptops
over the last couple of years you know
they're one of the few really reliable
sort of high-end brands that's maybe an
alternative to something like the
MacBook Pro this is the first time
they've really reworked the look since
the original Envy series and this new
one looks very different indeed instead
of that kind of all-over gunmetal gray
look now this thing is black on the lid
and on the screen bezel here and kind of
silvery over here with a slightly sunken
keyboard and one really unique visual
feature a bit of a red outline kind of
on the inside of the Sun keyboard very
hard to see very subtle but kind of a
cool kind of retro modernism beyond that
the envy is still really good high-end
laptop you got Intel Core i5 or Core i7
processors if you want to upgrade AMD
graphics I've got the upgraded screen
right here with the 1080p screen you can
also get a lower red screen the system
starts at about 1099 with the screen
upgrade which I recommend for a 15 inch
or larger laptop that adds about a
hundred and fifty bucks to it what
really makes this new version of the
envy stand out compared to some other
premium Windows laptops is this little
guy right here this is a physical volume
control wheel something you almost never
see usually the volume is either a
little touch button up here or it's an
alternate function key button but here
we have a wheel you literally flip the
wheel volume goes up volume goes down
never a miscommunication there's even a
separate mute button you tap this button
right here that mutes the audio and of
course if you hit the volume button on
the very top that brings up the Beats
Audio menu because like most HP laptops
this guy has that special Beats Audio
software and there that's supposed to
give you a better audio quality from any
laptop you're never gonna get something
that sounds as good as a pair of
standalone speakers but these certainly
rank way up there it's got pretty much
everything else we're looking for from a
premium Windows laptop a back from
keyboard big click pad edge to edge
glass over the display my one knock is
that with the with the lid open like
this if you just glance on this it's
virtually indistinguishable from a
MacBook
it's like not even trying anymore to
look differently but a lot of people
like that look and they want it but they
have to use a Windows machine and that's
why we've got stuff like this I'm Dan
Akron and that is the brand-new
redesigned HP Envy 15</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
