Franklin from C net and today I'll take
a first look at the HP Pavilion 27 X I
this is a 27-inch monitor with a 1920 by
1080 resolution screen and while his
actual bezel is shorter than what we're
used to seeing it's not an edge to edge
display still it sports a beautiful IPS
panel LED backlights and a very glossy
screen coating the XII can be tilted
back as well as swiveled around very
easily thanks to its light weight also
the display has a thin profile and
honestly feels very plasticky to the
touch yeah this is not metal in every
sense of the word the back includes
easily accessible connections HDMI DVI
and VGA there are 5 presets in the
on-screen display including HP enhance
Plus which is supposed to improve the
look of YouTube videos but I found it's
only marginally better than the others
when in the text preset you can
customize the color temperature as well
as the red green and blue values HD
movies look great as long as you're
using the right preset which is any
preset but the movie preset the movie
preset looks too grainy especially if
you're close to the screen which if
you're using the excise a monitor it's
likely you'll be pretty close when
watching movies it does look better
however the farther you are away from
the screen and its colors are definitely
more accurate and less saturated than
the others although a bit softer I found
the text preset best suited for movies
at close range especially since it
allows you to alter the color for more
information check out my full review
once again I'm Eric Franklin and this
has been a first look at the HP
Pavillion 27 X I</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
