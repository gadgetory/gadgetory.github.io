running Android meet the BlackBerry D
Tech 50 it features a 5.2 inch full HD
display with an octa-core Snapdragon 617
processor and 3 gigabytes of RAM even
though it's not the speediest processor
out there it does feel fully capable
other features include a 13 megapixel
rear camera and an 8 megapixel one on
the front the phone comes with 16
gigabytes of internal storage although
it does have a micro SD card slot so you
can add up to an additional few
terabytes of space as for battery life
the 2610 milliamp battery will last up
to 17 hours with mixed usage the phone
is a great size and is easy to use with
one hand which I really like the
textured back also helps you keep your
grip and I like the convenience key
which you can customize to quickly
launch s or an app or action my one
complaint is the weight it's just simply
too light for my liking and it kind of
feels cheap the software is pretty much
stock Android although it does come with
some edit tweaks like the BlackBerry
on-screen keyboard pop-up widgets and
the BlackBerry hub which is a one-stop
shop for all your email social media
alerts text messages and phone calls
then there's the D tech app this will
help advise you on making your phone
more secure right now you can see I only
have a fair score because I'm not using
a lock screen but if I change it to a
pin code it improves to excellent what
makes it detect if T special though is
the price tag the phone is available
unlocked in the US for only 300 dollars
although it's only compatible with GSM
carriers like AT&amp;amp;T and t-mobile we will
have a full review of the D tech 50 in
the coming weeks over at cnet.com</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
