drive with your hands at ten and two
it's been driving schools dictum for
decades kind of what I'm doing here you
got this big leverage at the top of the
wheel and one of the things that was
good about 10 and 2 is it gave you this
big kind of cranking force up here like
you're sawing away at the wheel of a
ship but that was then starting in the
80s cars began to come with power
steering almost universally and that
changes a lot of things about how you
address the wheel if anything steering
in the 80s didn't really matter where
you put your hands starting then you
could operate the car steering with the
least effort you could drape your wrist
over the top you can steer it down here
with one finger the classic kind of big
American car thing and people really got
sloppy about where they put their hands
too many of them just do this starting
in the 90s its power steering evolves
it's not so numb and dumbs
variable-ratio that means it requires a
different number of turns to navigate
the lanes at speed than when you're
parking for example the steering
movement from lock to lock is much
smaller this reduces accordingly the
steering effort required during the
entire parking maneuvers but the big
change is in the 90s we start to get air
bags
and they show up everywhere in the car
eventually but the one that we're
concerned about is this guy this high
explosive staring you square in the face
all the time this demands a new
discipline of how you hold the wheel
if this airbag goes off while you're up
here in the traditional 10 and to a
whole list of bad things can happen
including slamming these bony arms and
hands of yours into your eyes nose and
face degloving the flesh and muscles on
your hands and arms don't even ask
and burns from your hands and arms being
in this area and perhaps trapped while
this solid rocket propellant basically
deploys this bag in 30 milliseconds
let's get out of here so 9 + 3 or better
8 + 4 is where you want to run your
hands on a modern high-tech car and
notice most car makers prompt you to put
your hands there with the wheel design
and look at race footage you'll find
most race and rally drivers keep their
hands here as well for the best fine
motor control and so they never obstruct
the gauges as they work the wheel and
finally with today's power assist
systems which are often variable you
almost never have to turn the steering
wheel more than about 3/4 of a
revolution if you do however get in the
habit of shuttling the wheel between
your hands still in that virtual
position not riding them up and down
like this or even worse grouping them
and doing this nonsense that leads to
really clumsy steering dynamics and
again your hands are in a dangerous
place and of course it goes without
saying that 9 + 3 or 8 4 keep your hands
in position to use the steering wheel
buttons and paddle shifters that are so
common on cars today compared to 10 + 2
which puts your hands in a completely
different zip code</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
