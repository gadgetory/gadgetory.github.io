ways to get hacked time to get paranoid
we are ranking these hacks from least
likely to most likely to happen for this
top five we asked an expert hack five
zone Shannon Morse to help us out with
this at number five laser microphones
this hack dates back to 2009 and it was
accomplished by inverse path here's how
it works they pointed a laser at a
laptop and sampled vibrations to
determine keystrokes the team found
pointing at the hinges led to better
results in verse path did note that they
know it's kind of hard to get line of
sight to the laser microphone though and
number four is inaudible audio this hack
was built by the Fraunhofer Institute
for communication information processing
and ergonomics as a proof-of-concept in
2013 it used the built-in mics and
speakers of two lenovo laptops to
transmit data at a distance of around 65
feet
this method transfer data at a pretty
slow rate of 20 bits per second but
that's plenty fast enough to grab
keystrokes and number three hard drive
silence researchers at ben-gurion
University were able to transmit data
from computers by reading a hard drive
silence first malware needed to be
installed on the victims computer the
malware controls the actuator arm on the
hard drive when that arm moves it makes
a sound the malware would create sounds
through the actuator arm audio
frequencies could be picked up by a
receiver like a phone or a laptop data
speeds reached 180 bits per minute and
could travel up to about 6 feet in
distance this exact method would not
work on SSDs because they don't have a
clear arms and number two the hard drive
led this one was also by researchers at
ben-gurion University they found a way
to turn that little hard drive light
that flashes into a transmitter the
victims computer would be infected with
malware first then it would be able to
cause the hard drive LED to flicker in a
demo a camera on a drone was able to
view the LED flickering which will be
sending encoded data at number one
accelerometer keylogging this hack was
developed by researchers at Georgia Tech
here's how
or us the victim would download a
malicious app that asked for permission
to use the accelerometer so something
like a level app then the app will be
able to collect accelerometer data as
you typed on this screen from that data
the researchers could figure out what
the victim was typing in one test the
researchers tried this out on an iPhone
4 and found it's gyroscope helped clean
up the data it was scraping thanks again
to Shannon Morse for the help if you're
interested in hacking things and check
