welcome to the apple pie for all the
good and bad inside the world of Apple
now for those of you that were worried
last week about me I'm here you know I'm
alive I'm kind of invincible so let's
get to the show and the latest news
Apple released the second beta for iOS 7
to developers this week and also
included the ipad version as well it
looks like you'd expect a bigger version
of iOS with no device specific features
at the moment some of the new features
that have been added in the latest beta
are a revamped reminders app new Siri
voices and everyone who is asking about
voice memos they're back as well there's
also a lot of performance improvements
some subtle interface changes and bug
fixes that are part of the update but
9to5 mac reports one of the cool updates
that include several new camera oriented
features for developers Apple has added
new image detectors that can detect
facial expression characteristics like
blinking and smiling in photos let's
just hope they don't mess it up like
nikons did someone blink feature and for
those of you wondering we're not related
now iOS 7 will also give developers
access to 60 frames per second video
which could lead to high quality slow
motion effects and everything it just
looks better in slow-mo oh well it is
tummy it like looks like jello now there
have been plenty of talks about the
next-gen iphone getting a significantly
improved camera so all these features
could complement it nicely speaking of
that next-gen iphone the first batch of
high-quality photos of the new iPhones
panel have been published by fanatic
phone and show off the rumored iPhone 5s
is display assembly right next to an
iphone 5s they show up a longer
connector cable with different
connection points and lower quality
images of the iPhone 5s is logic board
and it's subtle differences have also
been posted on macrumors and they match
up with the high quality photos so all
signs that we've seen so far pretty much
point to the same iPhone form factor for
the 5s but we'll have to see what's
really going to make this
next iPhone worth paying attention to so
we thought this would be a great chance
to get you the Apple biters involved in
the show next week we want to know the
top five things you want to see in the
next iPhone and we'll post some of your
responses in next week's show and if you
include a picture we'll also put you in
the show unless you look like this
because no one looks like this all right
let's check out a how-to for my buddy
Donnell belt it's an oldie but a goodie
for households with multiple iphones if
you live in a home with multiple iphones
ipods and ipads and you've probably run
into this problem someone connects the
new iphone to your home computer and
loads up a few of their favorite songs
and accidentally ends up with your
embarrassing voice memos and all of your
contacts the first thing you need to
know is that you can avoid a lot of this
mess by wirelessly syncing your apps and
music and data using iCloud which is now
baked right into iOS my second tip for
avoiding this mess is to just create
multiple user accounts on your Mac or PC
you can have your itunes your husband or
wife can have theirs and everything is
kept separate and tidy all of that said
if you really want to sync more than one
iphone or ipad to a single itunes
library here's how to do it now here's
my iTunes library filled with all of my
media which my wife mostly hates but
let's say she's in a hurry and she
really wants to get this bjork album
before heading out I'm going to connect
your iPhone watch it pop up in itunes
here on the left click on it and you'll
see a panel of all the phone settings
the critical options here are the first
and the last we want to make sure that
this is not setup to automatically sync
when connected and then we want to
enable the ability to manually manage
music and videos after that we'll click
through on each of these other tabs just
to make sure that nothing else is set up
to sync no contacts no apps no podcast
books or photos none of it then hit
apply to make these new settings stick
now if this is the first time you tried
syncing this device with your iTunes
library you might get a warning that
says the phone was originally set out to
be used with another computer and that
you're about to erase this phone and
sync it with content from this library
some heavy language and if it scares you
too much you can try one of the other
techniques i mentioned earlier all right
now that that's done finally I'm going
to locate that Bjork album my wife wants
my itunes collection here and manually
drag and drop the songs onto the phone
icon now up at the top you can see that
they're copying right over when I'm all
done I can hit eject and check the phone
and I should see that the music i added
is right there in the music menu thanks
d onto the quick bites and according to
a report from Matt trast Thunderbolt
displays are again running low at third
party Mac resellers and they've been
told Apple is no longer making them
available to purchase we're expecting
new displays alongside of the release of
the new Mac Pro later this year and if
they're going to design them to match
well this apple byte rendering is a good
idea for the inspiration for their
next-gen display hey Apple call me if
you need someone you know to help you
guys out and following American Airlines
lead pilot to fly for JetBlue are now
being trained to use apples iPads in the
cockpit for whether flight planning and
airport charts replacing the laptops and
heavy paper manuals pilot kit bags can
weigh as much as 40 pounds and that's
really heavy if you don't wear no plus
bringing on iPads is also a good thing
because its employees probably won't be
quitting by using the emergency slide
anymore all right that's going to do it
for this week's show send me your emails
to the apple byte at cnet com and your
tweets at brian Tong and remember tell
us the top five features you want in the
next iPhone for next week's show i'm
brian Tong thanks for watching it will
catch you guys next time for another
bite of the Apple
