router from Google
hello I'm don't know and if you wonder
why Google decide to make a home router
or I have no idea but here's a hint you
need a Google account to use this router
and when in use is connect to Google or
the tan that's that this one here is
like no other routers I have seen in a
true dual band a/c 1900 router but you
can easily mistake it for a Bluetooth
speaker what maybe it's not a mistake at
all because on top here it does have a 3
watt speaker now there is no microphone
and there's no volume control so we can
expect to talk to it the way you do with
the Amazon echo or play music with it
either the speaker here only deities
that's right if he'll make the setup
process so much cooler now the router
does have a built-in food - but that's
not activated yet also not activated is
the support for ZigBee while standard
the hardware parts are inside but
there's no firmware or software for them
yet that's for the future also note that
the USB port right here is right now
pretty much a placeholder by the way the
router has only one LAN port and only
one one port Google say that it limit
them at a port so that there's less wire
coming out from the router that was the
good design here means you can put the
rarer out in the open hands better for
Wi-Fi coverage but what about trying to
connect this rail right here to that
modem at the far corner of the house
well there's no answer for it other than
running a long table now the owner of
here does not have a web interface of
the only way you can set up or manages
is via the iron hop mobile app for
Android or iOS the app works really well
and very slick you can easily add more
Google account to manage the same
unhappy unit or you can add more unhappy
units to one account you can quickly
view all connected clients and tap on
them to do more you can even do a speed
test but honestly there are many things
you cannot do with on hub for now for
example there's no support for guest
networking that's no pressure control no
support for dynamic DNS no web filtering
and so on in fact the list of what you
can do with the on hub which is right
here is so much shorter than the list of
what you cannot as for performance in my
testing the unhappier wasn't terrible
but it was an impressive either it has
the sustain win one speed at the
chlorines up some 290 megabits per
second and at longer range some 70
megabits per second and the range itself
is not super impressive either
effectively about 120 feet away now many
cheaper AC 1900 can do better than that
keep in mind though the our hub is an
evolving piece of hardware and can
deliver a lot more view of firmware and
software upward in the future for now
though it's kind of painfully liking so
for more this one you check out my full
review seo.com basically if you would
love to have your home connected to
Google the way you Android phone has
been keeping you these are happy would
be the best tuna dollars you ever spent
and don't worry about the privacy Google
say very clearly that the on hub does
not collect information about your
network or the website you visit and
blah blah blah and I totally and
completely trust it and that's because
I'm don't know and this has been the
first look at the our hub from Google</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
