fuel cell cars out there now in little
tiny numbers but for example their FCX
Clarity is out there in a modest lease
fleet around southern california has
been for a while very finished car this
is what's coming next this is their FCV
concept to be honest it's head-on with
the Toyota Mirai which is going the same
direction trying to get you around 300
miles of range on a fill-up of hydrogen
that takes just a few minutes to put in
all of that is very gasoline like as
you've noticed these cars hold five
passengers like a Camry for example the
key that these companies are trying to
do Honda in particular is to push
hydrogen fuel-cell as the most normal
alternative to the gasoline car without
range anxiety or weird packaging issues
now this vehicle is not coming to
production any time soon it'll be 2016
in Japan and later come to the US and
certainly will be in small numbers
they're not gonna put these anywhere the
people can't get hydrogen that's the
other part of the story they're going to
invest not a king's ransom but 14
million dollars with a company called
first element fuel which is building
fuel infrastructure here in California
that's almost a bigger concern than car
makers doing the in-car engineering
itself
now as with almost everything tech
getting smaller and more capable is a
big deal this is the Honda fuel cell
they've been using up until now and it's
the given size and it has two kilowatts
of power per litre of its volume where
the actual fuel cell guts are now here's
where the fuel cell is go on then over
here is the new one they've brought down
the size by a third and they've
increased the power density the amount
of power per the volume of guts by about
sixty percent so we're now getting 3.1
kilowatts out of a leader of capacity
okay real quick fuel cell vehicle 101 to
bring all this together first of all
here's your fuel cell stack that's what
converts hydrogen to electricity in
simple terms down here is your electric
motor up here is the high current
switching and control module and
interestingly I didn't realize this down
here is a turbo then you might say
what's a turbo doing on an electric car
this is an air turbo it's powered by an
electric motor to bring in air and
basically RAM enough air into the fuel
cell so that there's enough to react
with the hydrogen you can't just let it
drift in there atmospherically notice
this whole power unit is generally the
size of let's say a four zone or a v6
engine in an accord today or in a civic
perhaps that's the point of making
everything smaller not to say you did it
but to say you know what we can probably
retrofit this to some existing platforms
without too much work that's where you
get your investment back</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
