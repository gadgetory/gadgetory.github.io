getting better all the time
and on the ZTE star 2 it's one of the
most complete packages I've seen using
this sort of technology the main gist of
it is that it's always listening for
your voice command so after either
saying your passphrase for the phone or
pressing and holding the home button you
can give your voice command you can do
anything from open and close apps to
turn on Wi-Fi turn off Wi-Fi take a
picture and even turn off the flash or
switch the camera from the rear to the
front
while there are other phones that do
have voice controls that are also always
listening this one includes a
system-wide capability that's really
nice another thing I really like is that
when you hold the phone up to your ear
it will ask you who you want to call so
that's an automatic gesture another
bonus is that when you're unlocking the
phone with a voice command it's not just
listening for the passphrase it's
listening for your actual voice so that
if somebody else comes along and they
want to use your passcode to break into
your phone they won't be able to as for
the other specs you've got a 5-inch
1080p display on a phone that is really
thin six point nine millimeters really
nice looking extremely light I wasn't
even sure the battery was in here but it
is because it's embedded we've got
aluminum on the sides this black part
here is metal even though it doesn't
look it and some silvery trim here on
the accents and we also have glass on
both the front and the back giving it a
little bit more of a premium feel in
terms of other specs it's got a 5
megapixel wide-angle camera that is
complemented by a 13 megapixel camera on
the back and dual LED flash 16 gigabytes
of memory on here with room for
expandable storage 2 gigabytes of RAM
and for the all-important processor
we're looking at a 2.3 gigahertz
quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 801
chipset on here so it isn't the most
advanced we're looking forward to 810
but it is really fast and performance
should be very good the ZTE star 2 was
announced for China in December but it
will be coming out to other global
markets
we just don't know which ones yet I'm
Jessica doll Court for CNN taking a
first look at this phone here at CES
