buzz report and now for the gas for the
week the gadget of the week is the new
apple imac of course just announced this
week the new imac is thinner than the
old model and it's now made of glass and
aluminum instead of the previous white
plastic it features a new glossy display
and slightly faster intel core 2 duo
configurations but what i really like
about the new imac is that it's so much
more recyclable than the old models yep
apple's really taking an eco-friendly
tone here so go on check out your
impossible to recycle mercury Laden old
imac that you bought less than two years
ago and run down and get a fancy new eco
imac you'll feel so much better about
yourself and now for the news this week
Apple held another one of those events
where they invite the press down to the
Cupertino headquarters for an
announcement that we all know isn't
going to be a big deal but is
nevertheless slightly disappointing when
it doesn't turn out to be a big deal but
this particular press conference was
well I'm not gonna say it was boring it
was boring I was there in fact let me
take you back let me recap it a little
bit so the new imac starting at 11 99
okay so there's the new imac we
mentioned earlier which you know fine
and then whoo boy we get to watch the
new commercial oh i'm sorry i actually
use that time to send some updates to
twitter was John Hodgman in it yeah I
didn't think so okay then we moved on to
iPhoto which near as I can tell
basically just does something new and
fancy with like albums it takes these
groups of photos which we call events
and it automatically makes events out of
them so that you don't have to do it
manually and this is what I photo 08 is
all about it's about events pretty cool
huh come on who is clapping people is a
press briefing show yourselves you
shills now onto iMovie we get to watch
Steve Jobs make its own little
masterpiece I'm gonna go ahead and make
a movie and show you how easy it is oh
there's fun thing right here with these
guys go like that okay i'll put that
movie
and you know you just just know I'm
gonna put something at the beginning of
the movie there's just some just some
you know a scene of some of the
mountains and I've made a movie here so
let's just take a look like watch it
full screen if I want oh and finally the
big highlight of the day the updates to
I work it's got a spreadsheet net and we
call it numbers I got headers and
footers oh yes actually see now that is
fabulous just wonderful Bravo Apple and
other fine performance Bravo now to give
Microsoft it's due in the spanking
Department the company has officially
released two hotfix updates for Windows
Vista that deal with some serious
performance and reliability issues now
the updates are not yet automatically
available through windows update because
microsoft hasn't released them on its
normal monthly patch release schedule
but after the fixes were leaked online
over a week ago Microsoft decided that
if you really want them you can at least
download them from the website if you
really want them you know so that your
computer won't spontaneously restart
when you're using the desktop or so that
you don't have to keep hard rebooting
due to a display driver error message
that kills the whole machine that kind
of thing so yeah thanks i think i will
take that update microsoft thanks for
getting around to it myspace has
announced that is partnering with
satirical news site the onion to offer
audio video and print content on the
giant social networking site in a
related story the new york times issued
this baffling press release the children
are lost we surrender god help you all
huh what could that mean and my
prediction would be the google CEO eric
schmidt has finally answered the
question that we've all been wondering
what's web 3-pointer gonna look like he
recently spoke at a digital forum and
said that unlike the ajax based web
architecture of web two point oh web
three pointer will be characterized by
small fast customizable applications
that store data remotely and promulgate
virally making use of mobile devices and
social networking but will it have the
funny names because i really like the
funding
i'm molly wood and this has been the bus
