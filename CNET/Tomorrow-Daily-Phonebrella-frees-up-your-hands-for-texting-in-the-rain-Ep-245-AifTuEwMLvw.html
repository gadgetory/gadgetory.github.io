welcome to tomorrow daily the festy talk
show in the known universe except this
isn't really talk show these are
actually are many episodes while we get
our brand-new studio up and running
we're gonna give you a little bit
bite-size tomorrow daily to keep you
satisfied during the week until we have
our fancy new studio with our fancy new
co-host which by the way you can totally
guess uh TT host is the hashtag if you
want to try to make a wager on who you
think the new co-host is um could be
really fun there might be a prize
involved maybe I'll dig into my bag of
goodies and send you something if you're
the very first person to guess on
twitter um we said yesterday was a he to
dude and also uh he's had many shows on
the internet so it's not somebody that
you're not familiar with all right guys
we gotta hit the headlines if you've
ever been out in the rain and you tried
to send a text message you probably
looked like this while you try to hold
your umbrella and text at the same time
but fear no more a Korean telecom
company has you covered this is called
the phone briella the phone briella
looks like a pretty regular umbrella
except it's got a c-shaped holder at the
end of it and that handle actually has a
counterweight in it so you can either
hold it like a normal umbrella or slide
it on your wrist and get that double
handed texting action on again made by
Korean telecom company its full size
there's no wind resistance so if you're
in the middle of some heavy winds
probably not gonna be too happy and
unfortunately for those of you out there
looking to buy the phone briella it's
actually a limited edition release so
unless you have a friend in South Korea
who is thinking of you one day as they
somehow thought to themselves I'd really
like for my friend to text while holding
their umbrella first logon no stop it
okay next story let's talk about this
flying robots have a little bit of
trouble building rigid structures we
know this it's a little bit difficult to
get a carry weight and everything but a
group of researchers has decided that
maybe they shouldn't be making rigid
structures maybe they should be making
rope structures this is a collaboration
between eth zurich institute for dynamic
systems and control and an architecture
firm named grommet co Cola research
these quadrotors to weave a bridge
across a seven point four meter gap oh
that's pretty awesome and they also used
a bunch of knots and different things
that you're probably familiar with if
you've ever been camping it's not quite
an autonomous system though there's a
really expensive piece of machinery
monitoring all the quadrotors to make
sure that they didn't crash into each
other while building that bridge or you
know strangle themselves on the rope
which would be very bad this could be
great for lightweight structure building
in the future but generally speaking
it's a little cost prohibitive so you
won't be stuffing this kit in your
camping a backpack and taking it with
you to Yosemite next year sorry okay
very last headline and then we'll talk
about new releases have you ever wanted
advice about solving a problem and
wished that you could get advice from
dr. Sigmund Freud yes that is right a
group of researchers at the University
of Barcelona have done this and they
found some very interesting things about
their participants in that study so the
way it works is there were 22 people
that were using an oculus dk2 to give
themselves advice in virtual reality one
time as themselves a real-life full
version of themselves and the second
time as dr. Sigmund Freud talking to
themselves in virtual reality I know it
sounds weird bear with me okay so they
describe the problem as themselves in
first person and then would jump over to
the other person whether was Sigmund
Freud or the likeness of themselves
giving advice on how to solve the
problem well the interesting thing was
every single one of the participants
decided that getting advice from dr.
Sigmund Freud in virtual reality made
them feel better they felt like they had
a really good reaction to that response
even though it was the exact same thing
that they advised themselves looking
like themselves this sounds super
inception and really really meta but at
the end of the day it's a really
interesting concept that might come in
handy for helping future mental health
professionals treat patients or it could
be used to treat yourself now you're
probably wondering why Freud that seems
a really odd choice why not Oprah dr.
Phil or somebody else well because all
of the students on campus when asked
what famous person they'd like to get
advice from for a problem they had
picked dr. Freud so there you go all
right guy
