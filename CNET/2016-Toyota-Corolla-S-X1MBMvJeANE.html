stretching back uninterrupted to about
the mid 60s
as a matter of fact for about as long as
there's been a Toyota in North America
there's been a Corolla image lineup and
the decades have been good to the
Corolla
it's enjoyed a long period of success
where for many years it's only real
competition was the Honda Civic but then
things went a bit pear-shaped almost
literally the Corolla got little fat got
a little lazy in it just sort of stopped
innovating at the same pace as the rest
of the market yet the Corolla is still
one of the most popular cars on the road
so we've picked up this 2016 Corolla s
special edition to find out just what's
so special about it
now despite its really aggressive
probably over designed exterior the
Toyota Corolla isn't really packing what
I'd call a modern powertrain for example
your average cruller driver is only
nominally interested in the fact that
the 1.8 liter engine puts out 132
horsepower and 128 pound-feet of torque
the 1.8 liter engine is paired in most
Corolla models with Toyota's new CVT if'
that's continuously variable
transmission that has a manual shift
program on the road on the highway the
engine and transmission combo we're
together pretty well for that sort of
basic transportation sort of driving
style it responds particularly well to
smooth inputs so for example if you want
to pass someone on the highway don't
stab the pedal just sort of roll on to
it and even to the gas if you kind of
personally treat the accelerator like an
on/off switch you're gonna start
noticing a little bit of hesitation and
uncertainty from the transmission and
choosing its ratios which is gonna make
the whole car just feel a lot more
disappointing now at the base of the
shifter we've got a little button that
says Sport don't press that
don't ever press that as a matter of
fact get a screwdriver pry it out of
here and forget it ever existed end up
with a lot of that sort of rubber band
II hunching for the right ratio and
hesitation that you typically associate
with bad Phebe T's and the car ends up
feeling less responsive than
as in its normal mode you absolutely
must Chuck your Corolla ass into a
corner just reach down and flap the
transmission into its manual shift mode
it's going to give you access to the
paddle shifters where you can choose
from six fixed ratios much like you
would with a standard automatic
transmission there's a lot of body roll
and squat and dive which ends up making
extended passages on a twisty road just
feel a lot more fatiguing than they
probably should be the curl is interior
design is a bit old-school it's got a
high dashboard in its infotainment
system is down low in the dash where the
rest of the market is sort of pushing
the infotainment up higher into the
line-of-sight and using larger screens
here we've got this relatively small
Intune system but it's a pretty good
infotainment setup it's not what I would
call cutting edge but it is snapping in
its performance and things are generally
where you expect them to be now what I
don't like is the base six speaker
stereo system that we've got with this
Corolla in it's probably the worst
stereo I've listened to all year granted
most of the cars that come into our
office have a premium audio system but
my 1999 mazda miata bose system sounds
better than this with the top down if
you absolutely need more performance
than what I just described there here's
a really cool trick I'll be your Toyota
Corolla head down to your Toyota
dealership and then trade it in for a
Scion fr-s it's about the same amount of
money and you'll thank me later it can
be a bit difficult to speak critically
about the Toyota Corolla because for
many years it set the standard for what
this class of vehicle is though it was
the standard I'm not sure it's the gold
standard anymore vehicles like the
Hyundai Elantra in the new Mazda 3 are
really eating the Corollas lunch right
now and it's old rival the Honda Civic
just got a really big update that's
looking really good by comparison am I
about 18 to $25,000 any of those
vehicles is probably a better pick but
this one's that's not bad</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
