Alfred Aang
uber temporarily halted its autonomous
car program after one of his vehicles
killed a pedestrian in Tempe Arizona
but this marks the first fatality from a
self-driving car accident on a public
road what do you think this means is
this this is pretty bad fub√° right well
they had to completely halt it I think
that this was inevitable for any
self-driving car testing program
eventually there was going to be there
would be a fatality for it to happen at
uber a company that has had so many you
know negative headlines yeah yeah yes as
a bad rep I think this just piles on top
of I think if this happen or like Ford
which is also testing its own self
driving Google we know I think I think
this would still be like a historic
moment in tech yep for sure but like for
it to happen at uber like definitely
adds to all the controversies going on
with the company now it's important to
note that this at least the SF Chronicle
after deal--but fall purporting they
talked with the police chief local
police chief who said that the way the
woman emerged out of the shadows that
basically no driver either autonomous or
human probably would have been able to
see her yeah this is something that's
been brought up and like the moments in
self-driving cars were kind of like
announced the idea of if it gets into a
car accident like who's at fault and
things like that
right there's gonna be a lot of
interesting developments here I also am
interested in because the argument for
self-driving cars has always been that
they're much safer right even than a
person driving though now that this has
happened I don't know that like opinion
has shifted at all right and I think
there were a lot of concerns maybe you
know some folks were arguing it's safer
but I think a lot of people in the
public had fears about one denied truly
was yeah
all right next up 18 T and Time Warner
are about to set butt kick off their
legal battle with the Justice Department
the trial begins tomorrow
Varane colleague Maggie Reardon has a
nice curtain-raiser sort of explaining
why a teen teen Time Warner one emerged
why this court case is so important for
the future of median for streaming TV
and it's actually this was a surprise
that the Justice Department would
actually block this deal
a vertical integration where as you know
two companies that don't copy each other
are getting together what wasn't the
original reporting though that they
decided to block it because you know
President Trump wasn't a fan of CNN and
all that yes and the interesting thing
is the the judge for this trial has all
kind of thrown out any references to
Trump
they basically you know ATT initially
tried to get access to some memos and
between the White House and Justice
Department that's not part of the case
they're really just gonna be arguing on
the merits of whether or not this deal
should go through mm-hmm all right
lastly we learn more about Cambridge
analytic up the firm that worked with
dog the Donald Trump campaign last year
after an undercover report from the UK's
channel 4
now the executives from the data form
were caught on video offering to use
everything from sex workers and
spreading false information to describe
political rivals this just isn't like
another step in this Facebook drama the
craziest thing about that report is what
does any of that have to do with data
analytics nothing right
it's basically we'll just basically do
whatever it takes to help your political
candidate it's just like we're a company
that uses data analytics from social
media also sex workers and blackmail
it's just like if there's any like sign
that like there's shady activity going
on there and like what they on top of
what they had already done with Facebook
this like this kind of is just like a
blaring like and just just reminder this
is a firm that basically took data from
a Facebook third-party app to
politically to target better target
Facebook users for the Donald Trumpkin
did you see camera Jenna Lucas response
for that report but basically like the
video was taken out of context job they
said that we purposely said something so
exaggerated to save the person that we
were talking to from embarrassment like
hypothetical scenarios like we would
never do that we just did that as kind
of a joke that it was really yeah sure
all right for boiling these stories
check us out at CNN I'm Roger Jiang I'm
Alfred aying thanks for listening
so we say how bad this looks for uber
and it certainly does but this is the
shine negatively on Volvo at all being
that it was a Volvo model car that's an
interesting point I'm you know there's
not there hasn't been a lot of
discussion about Volvo I think it's a
lot of it is looking at the autonomous
driving technology the sensors the
cameras that are supposed to detect
people I haven't seen a lot blowback on
vulval yet mmhmm yeah I think it's
because people you know like to pile on
uber that's true too you know I think
could have been any car company and
either way would it just the headline
still would have been like uber that
said do you think if it was way mo or if
it was Ford like do you think well
Ford's about example cuz it's the actual
automaker but yeah if it was way mo what
people would be piling on to way mo or
would they be blaming so yeah but I I
think I don't think they'd be saying way
mo though I think they should be saying
Google yeah that's real self driver yeah
I think but the the the broader point is
I think they folks will be pointing the
finger at the company that's pushing the
advanced driving technology not the car
makers yeah I I didn't hear the part
about the from the police chief though
saying the way that this woman like came
out like even if it was exact came out
that came out late late last night from
them but yeah the word the wage she
described it the woman was holding a
bicycle came out the street emerged out
of the shadows and very suddenly even
the person in the car said like I didn't
see her yeah until after the accident I
think I think the issue for me is
essentially that I still have like a lot
of faith in self-driving cars only
because so they've been testing them for
what like four or five years now yeah
and this is the first accident from a
self-driving car I mean maybe it's like
a because there's way more like well you
have to remember that they haven't been
on public roads for yeah that's been
like a year that really looks bad on
this one is it we're only aware of it as
customers now well no they have been
testing it significantly and they really
have put a lot of load of research and
development into the program a lot but a
lot of the research allow the Rd a lot
of the time spent with these cars have
been on closed track yeah who know
they're had they're not even accidents
there were that's that's a whole
different ballgame this
in terms of public streets now they've
only been on public streets for a year
right at this point so I mean it's it's
still a decent amount of time but yeah
it's still like one
I guess fatal car accident know how many
normal car accidents there are where you
know just I mean there was one it was
one fault yeah but I'm still saying
though like one in a whole year compared
to like the ten that happens in New York
City every day is true but if you're
looking at your volume of cars and
drivers we've got how many yeah that's
not honest cars versus actual cars with
terrible drivers in New York City alone
yeah okay so certainly ideally one is
too many right but there's going to be a
huge deferring perspective on this and
we're seeing it in the chat right now
thanks everybody we're getting to your
questions here in a second
from one we've got Steve Allen who says
straight up Banneker and maybe from
other circumstances I could agree with
him to a certain extent then from Lewis
he says NASA has some accidents in their
history killing more than 20 people and
they're letting us explore the universe
more concretely Mars with the discovery
so what what's the question of the
greater good and who is really really at
fault is it going to be a technician and
the developing program is it the entire
company at large because in the past if
you hit a person the drivers at fault
that's how it goes yeah I would I would
say there's a difference with the NASA
analogy though and the fact that NASA is
a public like organization whereas uber
is a private company and like stands to
make a lot of money off of this
excellent point
Roger do you have any I mean really I
think it's Buber is probably held liable
for this but I think it's it is
interesting that this this is happening
because it does give us a sense of
ultimately who's gonna be liable I think
the law this is going to be debated in
courts but yeah I mean this provides a
lot of clarity
ventually will prevail about clarity
yeah and that's gonna be an ongoing
conversation yeah that's been that's
been a scenario that like has been
brought up like plenty of times but you
know it hasn't actually happened yet so
now for this to happen I I am interested
to see if there's gonna be any like
charges pressed or anything like that
well that's what I'm saying is how do
you find the true Fault in this can you
just charge the
at end of the CEO of uber and I don't
think that's really the know I think I
mean yeah not knowing I don't think any
individual yeah so we on the liability
who gets whittled down and now has to
fix something what was wrong and whose
responsibility is it to fix it because a
company again it's got to be another
thing it's not you can't single out an
individual you can't sue an individual
that's what I was trying to coach gonna
be the gray area that it's still gonna
be the company yeah yeah coming in from
Matthew dacher as always hi - thanks for
joining us one thing to be said about
the uber accident in Arizona is that
there will be no shortage of evidence
from all of the data gathered by the
sensors on the vehicle and that should
make accident reconstruction fairly easy
that's interesting in that scene at some
point already dug into that fairly well
and discussing about the lighting
scenario and all the circumstances
that's the thing like I don't think that
police chief would have gone on records
so quickly if she didn't have access to
that kind of video footage from the car
itself so you know they could they can
tell pretty much right away what
happened what the scenario was like and
she could see from the footage like the
woman wasn't visible until she was in
front of a car yeah yeah I mean I guess
that's the silver lining in this is that
it's it's it's iRobot testifying in
court to an extent yeah I mean with all
these sensors with all these cameras
it's gonna be a lot easier to figure out
who is to blame what what happened and
how to avoid this stuff in the future
one more extended thought from Matthew
dad sure is my fear as it regulators
will halt the abilities of vendors to
continue testing is there any discussion
of that already I don't think you need
to be worried about this specific
scenario for you know politicians to
halt like testing considering that it's
already being done in so many other
cities without any like legitimate
reasons like they tried bringing it to
New York City there were all these like
issues that like New York City like
politicians brought up San Francisco
when Hooper just tried rolling it out
without permission
yeah like what are you doing no and that
this is before like this had happened so
I think yeah for sure there's going to
be new like you know ledge not ledge
but like arguments against it like
pointing at this incident but right like
there has already been like a heavy like
history of a lot of politicians just
saying we don't want this in our city
and like here are all the reasons why
like even without this scenario yeah and
hopefully I mean this this is obviously
a tragic event but this definitely
brings up the need for I think clear
regulations from even a federal level as
to what house-elf cars self-driving cars
should be treated mm-hmm right now it is
sort of city by city I think politicians
have kind of kicked the can with with
actually regulating this stuff woman
from a national yeah I mean I would
still make the argument that
self-driving cars are safer than like
people driving them yeah but you know
the counter-argument was always if you
mix self-driving cars with unpredictable
human drivers and that is probably less
safe then but there's no evidence all
one or the other no there's no evidence
of it but again it's cars run on
algorithms humans do not yeah when you
mix the two it's we don't know what will
happen everyone should just mean
self-driving cars it's including the the
human element of unpredictability will
always skew whatever results you could
come up with if you have all the robots
you have concrete ish data yes
absolutely I told you no they decide to
take over the world yeah let's not go
down the road again
from Alex Mitchell fantastic comments
from aligment Alex Mitchell this is a
tragedy but the silver lining this is
the first from a thousand hours driven
by a self-driving degrees what you were
talking about yeah this could be better
for liability or could that could be
better for liability in car accidents if
they're going to happen at least we know
who and why they're at fault and I still
think that's a that's a very gray area
though I don't think we you would know
100% who or why is that like like who is
at fault here in in the sense of you
know was it like the bad code that was
written was it like a person that just
happened a dart out of the corner and
the car couldn't see it why couldn't the
car see it kind of like perspective is
there a way that we can fix it so like
cars could see this in the future
was it the human driver that was just in
the front that like wasn't paying
attention and like could have prevented
it I mean I guess the the other silver
lining is that they can look at this
footage they can look at what happened
here and figure out how to make
self-driving cars safer to avoid this
kind of accident again yeah you know
whether it's code
whether it's better sensors whether it's
stuff that's whether it's night vision
sensors right so you know there's
there's that there's that hope from Josh
Boyd I didn't California allow fully
autonomous cars without a driver I'm not
aware of that only not no no no they
still have to have so I have captain
there to maintain yeah it for like
basically for safety reasons they need
to have yeah like yeah baby got it
one more about autonomous cars Mike Shaw
this poor lady reportedly stepped in
front of the autonomous uber car like
Roger said a human would have struck her
just as well there will still be
backlash but on the long run the
self-driving cars are still coming and I
think that was kind of the largest take
away we have here this is this doesn't
stop the program if anything maybe if
we're gonna be optimistic it'll help
push it in a even safer direction right
again the the calmness from police chief
she had no she has no stake in what
they're not self-driving cars will be
popular or not right I'm just basically
yeah stay in the facts yeah I'm just
curious on how long over plans on
stalling its program for cuz they they
stopped the entire testing for it now
they said temporarily yes so you're
right it's I don't know I can't imagine
it's gonna be that long but yeah we wait
for this to blow over and quietly start
this thing up again let's shift gears
over into the 18 t court situation from
Alex Mitchell stop AT&amp;amp;T and Time Warner
from merging breakup Amazon just like we
did the Microsoft this is cool and nice
for consumers now but it's going to be
bad down the line for competition oh he
has an excellent point there they this
continuing world of conglomeration
that's all what consolidation thank you
when when will it finally stop and when
will we just have a Megamart
I don't know I feel like it's still
gonna keep going there are constant
rumors of more consolidation not less at
this point whether it's wireless
providers whether it's telecom companies
and media copies media companies and
other media companies you've got Disney
and Fox trying to get together as well
well a portion of Fox portion of Fox I
mean the portion that you actually
remember about the comic book stuff I
care about yeah that we care about you
know that's the thing like this dear
this
this court battle between 18t
time-warner and the Justice Department I
mean if it goes badly for 18 t that
could have a chilling effect on what
happens with Disney and Fox and that
could mean your favorite Marvel
superheroes will all be under one
umbrella
that's very true all my favorite Marvel
superheroes already aren't under wait
you're not you're not an x-men fan no
but like Deadpool is not yeah he is now
he's no yeah they all are yep
they go we did it they have dropped the
balloons they haven't done it yet that's
the whole point right it's still in
negotiation could make the deal a lot
less I know what spider-man and
spider-man is still under Sony so but
you know they got that deal with Marvel
yeah but venom and all the other ones
I'd be fine with having more agreeable
just sharing but that's in a very
specific instance when it comes to the
intellectual properties here right
there's a reason why Incredible Hulk by
the way can't have its own movie but
it's tied up with Universal Ruffalo can
do his own movie but these
considerations and rules don't really
apply to media acquisition or right
telecom 418 Time Warner they their
argument is that they they're not really
competing against each other anymore
they're competing more against Netflix
and Google YouTube Amazon Amazon Prime
these are these are the threats that
they see it's less about you know who's
offering you Wireless serve or telecom
service and who's you know who's running
your networks it's more about this
bigger threat firm and you know I sort
of see their point
I don't 107 agree with it but I can
definitely see that the shift in the
competitive dynamics is different now
right
your eyeballs are not just looking at
like NBC or TNT or CNN you're looking
Netflix and Amazon you're not actually
looking at traditional telegram I mean
what has the argument from the Justice
Department been the Justice Department
has argued that that there's too much
ATT owning Time Warner would create too
much of a powerful company in terms of
both distribution and
a creation of content that basically
they would the fears that they would
charge other people more money for the
rights for Time Warner content like Game
of Thrones and CNN and programs on TNT
they'd basically other companies that
need to carry these channels 18t could
theoretically charge more than they
would themselves giving themselves an
unfair advantage hmm so I r18 T's argues
the obvious that they say no it's it's
we're trying to like distribute our
stuff across even more platforms than
ever
no they're not they're just trying to
line their pockets so any good
businessman would how is Comcast able to
do it with like NBC and like the concat
that's the thing Comcast and NBC did
this how many years ago at this point
seven years ago different administration
obviously and a lot of the arguments
that are that were used to fight that
merger which ultimately did go through
are being rehashed for this deal as well
so would they be able to use that as
like precedent and like that so the 18 t
feels good about this case because they
can point to Comcast and NBCUniversal as
a precedent for why the government
didn't let that almost identical deal go
through mm-hmm
but I mean if you look back at it folks
would make the argument that like
Comcast NBC maybe that deal should have
gone through the - place it makes me
wonder about things that aren't exactly
related but in a similar fashion where
the consolidation ended up bringing the
doom and gloom to all I'm gonna
reference most recently like Toys R Us
yeah being - it tore us went bankrupt in
what was a 2009 they filed for
protection 9 and then they were acquired
like a six billion dollar there's a
leveraged buyout by some VCS yeah by a
debt consolidation firm which was the
exact same one that did that the KB Toys
and sunk them yes when have they sunk
their own boat in putting so many eggs
in the same basket well I mean it's a
different scenario because what the
these venture capital firm - a Toys R Us
with KB was they saddled these companies
with tons of debt and the idea was like
well we'll get the business going so it
makes enough money to pay off
interest payments for the debt problem
was it never happened right it has other
outside factors like Amazon people not
going into his arrest so you're saying
it's just an investment in an already
dead industry well no I think they I
mean yeah the the model of loading up
massive amounts of debt to acquire this
company just only prolong the inevitable
for for certain situations for some
companies that works out just fine
because you're able to turn that
business around start making profits and
pay down the debt pretty quickly mm-hmm
problem once toys-r-us faced Amazon
right yeah the last two or three years
in particular was really really bad for
brick-and-mortar retailers and that's
why that's why Toys R Us got sunk yeah I
was thinking now the 18t Time Warner
deal is definitely different it's less
about it's less about leveraging or or
or adding more debt to the business and
more about combining the idea of yeah
you're basically you're paying them for
phone service and you're also you're
watching the movies that they create
basically they're controlling everything
you see yeah how it's how it's being
shown to you I think it'd be really
interesting in a couple of years as this
generation of children start to become a
little more cognizant teenagers and such
yeah what their perspective yeah like
here's what happens we don't watch
anything on Time Warner and everything
you just watch everything on YouTube no
I'm far as like the the declining
appearance of a brick-and-mortar store
in every industry almost yeah yeah what
the concept and experience kids have
without going to a toy store because I
can't imagine not going to a toy store
as a kid it was this enduring endeavor
where yeah you had to formulate a
strategy and work up the sympathy to
your parents it's like well I was good
this week right my veterans and again
you get the warm and fuzzies thinking
about like you're you're running down
the different aisles looking for like
that that toy I'm actually trying to go
to Toys R Us to see if there's any sweet
deals so I went this weekend manual
thing you've ever talked to them gonna
go to this dyeing company and try to
scavenge the rest no no everyone was
doing that yeah no they are never seen
this photo of like a Nintendo switch
this isn't some other state but it was
like a Nintendo switch for like $30 off
like new really yeah
from what I understand that why I talk
they roll out forever it's different
role and they're still getting stuck so
the sales aren't coming yet so they're
not trying to get rid of inventory
they've got inventory is still coming
mm-hmm so I was I was told this weekend
was when sales would start to show up
but you've got that like game you have
to play where like the longer you wait
the better the deals are but the fewer
choices yeah there's actually really
cute my dad offered to take me on Sunday
I thought he like never took you to
arrest no he took me every day after
Christmas yeah what yeah he offered he
offered to take me on Sunday actually we
were having dinner and I'm late because
this could be a good deal yeah I was
telling like I'm thinking about going to
Toys R Us to like see if they have any
deals like you want to go like now I
don't like we're having dinner do you
know for a good deal people will go the
extra mile it would be the last time my
dad takes a Meszaros yeah and I just
wonder is there any final thoughts about
how that that kind of consolidation how
that will reflect on on this eight
potential ATT merger or fall out however
you want to put it I don't know I know
18 t feels pretty good about this case
usually when the the DOJ steps in and
says no to a deal like that's the end of
the deal like the companies almost never
go to this length they always either
settle is this fairly landmark as far as
fighting against the man and the system
China with their own system yeah I mean
yeah it's hard to say that's 18t
fighting if the man cuz AT&amp;amp;T is a pretty
gigantic player by itself so but it is
it's fairly unusual for a company to go
this far to win over this deal yeah yeah
well it is interesting to watch I don't
know who I'm rooting for in this case
we'll just have to see how it plays out
yeah and on that note we are out of time
we are all right if you liked anything
you saw her here check us out on CNET
our podcast is available on itunes tune
in stitcher feedburner you can play
music and the amazon echo thanks
everybody we'll see you tomorrow yeah
unless there's another snowstorm
