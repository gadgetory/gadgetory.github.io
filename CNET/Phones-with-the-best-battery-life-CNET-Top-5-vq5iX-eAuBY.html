need to be charged these are the top
five phones with the best battery life
as compiled by CNN editors Lynne LA and
Jessica del Court at number five the
Xiaomi me five fitting huh now it
doesn't have a microSD card slot or a
battery that is removable but it does
have a pretty design it can handle two
SIM cards at once as for battery life
the me five survived fourteen hours
before needing a charge at number four
is the one plus three huh that's fitting
too since one plus three is four anyway
Lin law called it our perfect mid-price
phone and it's a CNET Editors Choice
winner it's got a great camera and packs
a powerful processor but what about the
battery life 14 hours 17 minutes at
number 3 is the Huawei mate 8 15 hours
and 30 minutes that's how long this six
inch phone managed to keep going during
our battery tests to make eight which is
also fun to say also has a fingerprint
reader and takes pretty good photos too
at number two is a Samsung Galaxy j-3
yeah I've never heard of it either but
in our tests it lasted 15 hours and 40
minutes the j-3 is relatively
inexpensive you can find it online for a
little over $100 it's a low end phone
but it does have a micro SD card slot
and a replaceable battery and at number
one three phones because they're all
part of the same family the Samsung
Galaxy s7 series those phones packed the
most battery life the galaxy s7 clocked
in at 16 hours the s7 edge 19 hours the
s7 active 21 hours they would drop the
mic if the mic wasn't built into them
what there are so many more top 5s at
top 5.2 Netcom mi as actor and I'll see
you online</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
