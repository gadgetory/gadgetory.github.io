Android 8 hours of battery life Wi-Fi an
adobe flash neither have a camera
bluetooth or 3g though but the note
tablet will come in at two hundred and
fifty dollars the extra fifty dollars

compared to just eight gigs and no
expansion on the fire that may make a
big difference when you don't have Wi-Fi

company has offered a preliminary list
on its Facebook page with the devices

include the new HTC vivid sensation
sensation XL and XE and the resound
owners of the evo 3d evo design 4g and
amaze 4g will have to wait depending on

android phone owners who have to contend
with lagging updates from the carriers

mobile products is a sign of things to
come barclay capital has announced in a
report that it will be slashing its
global pc growth forecast for the fourth
quarter of this year from 7.2 percent to
just 4.3 percent the investment bank
sites continued weakness in the market
and a worldwide shortage of hard drive

proven to be a drain on the company the
