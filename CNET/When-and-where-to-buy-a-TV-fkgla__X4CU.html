back-to-school shopping some people like
me are terrified of Black Friday so
we're here to ask David Katz Myer senior
CNET editor and television expert all
the questions of when and where to buy
televisions Jamie R doll here at CBS
sports.com home sorry David when is the
best time here to buy a TV please don't
tell me black friend don't be afraid you
can shop on Black Friday and your
underwear from you know online but yes
that's really all the best times right
around the beginning of the holiday
seasons when prices really start to fall
they'll stay that way through the Super
Bowl and then TV manufacturers are gonna
be blowing out their old models to make
room for the new ones and then you'll
find the really cheapest prices but the
TV you want might not be around still so
we recommend starting at Black Friday
and going from there so people like my
dad like to go into the store and wax
and wane with the salesperson over
different features and whatnot but
others just like the TV delivered right
to their doorsteps so what is the best
situation to purchase your TV is it in
store or online
I say definitely go online to get the
best prices and then you can go into the
store and trying to get them to match
you can also do things in the store you
can't do online obviously check out the
TV make sure you like the styling of it
play with the remote get to know it
called showrooming not illegal
that's why doesn't like it but you know
when you're in there you can get a
really good idea the TV but you got them
to have them get the best price ashtag
showrooming I like it or in any other
last-minute TV shopping advice I'm away
the extended warranty always not a good
deal even with the TVs they don't break
that often I would also say no matter
where you buy from make sure it has a
great return policy because you're
spending a lot of money on the TV you
want to no questions asked money-back
return policy just in case you don't
like it wait when you mentioned TV
matching prices for different stores
does that mean you're gonna go online to
that specific shop and then go away to
that store is it like a general tip
depends on the store and some guys have
really good policies where they'll you
know store they're desperate to get you
to buy the TV from them so you know if
you walk in sometimes they'll match
prices if you have a printout from
wherever you know Amazon or
legitimate online vendor they can often
match those prices just to make it happy
and get you out the door all right you
want your best televisions to watch
football TV Katz Meyer an entire series
on which are the perfect setups to watch
your favorite team so check them out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
