hey good morning and welcome to the 359
podcast the show that occupies four
minutes of your life with relevant
information and then waste 20 on
Thursday August 23rd any plays it is
owed 448 and cents since we are dark
tomorrow we just want to celebrate a
little bit early tomorrow is in fact
Pluto is no longer a planet day yes
August 24th commemorates the day in 2006
when Pluto was downgraded from Planet to
dwarf planet oh is it a downgrade to not
be a planet anymore from quanta - not
Planet downgrade there's nothing
important about being a planet it's a
huge by definition but I had no idea
that you were planning this news you
don't have to be a planet to be
successful right let's stop talking
about planets cuz our shows at the new
plants today we'll be talking about a
lot of robots yeah we've got some new
news on the Sony AIBO the new Sony AIBO
that robot dog that they showed off the
CES we got a bit more details on that
Ben's gonna talk about that on the
podcast we'll be talking about
LG's planned exoskeleton suit bought the
sounds cuz it sounds way cooler than I
though by the way soup pot soup body
it's a wearable robot soup it's a soup
so you drink it's a suit that you wear
no soup for you man
alright then lastly we'll be talking
about the the DNC hack that was in the
hack
now furs got all the details as always
if you have any questions leave them in
the comment section but I will pick out
the best and we'll get them in 3 minutes
or 59 seconds see then and three two
welcome to the 359 I wonder Chang I'm
Ben Fox Reba and I'm out for dang you
willing to spend almost $3,000 on a
robot dog well Sony has the pup for you
Ben's got all the details on the new I
Bo wait I do yeah yeah yeah it's $2,900
it's the that's all you need to know
bundle I don't know why they made the
bundle so much more than what what
exactly comes by it includes dog toys
they have they have the quote I bone the
I bone for the eyebrows and also a pink
ball which is reminiscent of the
original I bow that they discontinued 12
years ago so what does it actually do
why would I want to spend three it's
literally a robot companion it doesn't
really serve much of a practical
function as far as I can tell it does
have a ton of really cool tech built
into it but basically it's meant to be
like a companion robot it goes and it
finds you talks to you or like it barks
at you you can teach you tricks it can
map your house but yeah it's it's
basically like meant to mimic a dog but
not be a dog all right speaking of
robots LG says it will show off a
wearable suit bot next week at the ephah
trade show it's essentially an
exoskeleton that you wear to enhance
your strength it's really for factory
workers moving heavy boxes that sounds
totally sweet you know what this is and
you'll be a Tifa next week
I should really try this this reminds me
of the exoskeleton that they had at CES
one year that made you old made you a
geezer this is way better this is pretty
much the exact opposite no this isn't
the first time we've seen exoskeleton
suits that that augment your physical
capabilities but this is part of their
new LG's sort of focus on robots and AI
and all this all this new fancy tech
stuff hmm
but basically how close are we to pull
blown Ironman suit I mean really
hopefully by this pretty far from that
holiday parade but yeah this looks
nothing like Ironman
really all you need are the arms and
it's kind of like the beginning of the
also need a laser cannon in your chest
not that for the laser cannon I just
want the suit part that's the limited
edition that is a actually comes on the
I load the laser because that's worth
two thousand nine hundred dollars at
least yeah so we'll get more details on
this next week
unfortunately Ben will be at Aoife in
Berlin - hopefully check this out in
person yeah
lastly the dnc there was a bit of a
security scare with the DNC yesterday
but it turned out to be a bit of a false
alarm Alfred what happened here so
security researchers on Wednesday
basically discovered a phishing page
that looked identical to vote builder
which is what the DNC uses for their
voter database so you know this kind of
brought back this whole sense of are
they trying to hack our election are
they trying to send this to our like DNC
staffers to try to get their logins and
their passwords which is what these
security researchers had believed so the
DNC looked more into it yesterday and
then they basically discovered this was
a false alarm
yes there was a fake page of vote
builder but it wasn't built by any
foreign adversaries or anything like
that it was built by it was built by
basically a test like like a test for
like a lot of websites do these where
they test their own employees to see if
websites wait so this is built by the
DNC not by the DNC but somebody within
like a Democrat like Organization there
were reports NBC and PC Mag both
reported that it came from the Michigan
Democratic Party I've reached out to
them to confirm that but apparently
somebody within those ranks basically
commissioned this test and didn't tell
anybody about it oh my god so there was
this whole like big concern about that
well given the DNC's past history with
hacks i guess it's it's good that
they're being extra yeah I honestly much
better for them to be cautious about
this than to just think it's probably
nothing
all right for more on these stories
check us out and see that remoter check
I'm Ben Fox ribbon I'm Alfred aying
thanks for listening
yeah good way to go nice job guys you're
actually nailed four minutes that's
Roger gave me one talking point about I
bow it was it seems like I'm why I want
to talk about making fun of it I was
well I wanted to talk about the LG one
that seemed way cooler than the robot I
disagree with you the LG thing doesn't
have a personality you know how much the
suit bot
I mean I don't know I think this is a
concept I don't think we know
unfortunate and if it's for factory
workers it's gonna be priced for the
enterprise which means I'm thinking like
if somebody comes up to you and says
like would you rather have this robot
dog companion or these robot legs that
you can put on and like helps you lift
stuff and like probably kick things much
harder like which would you pick yeah
the freaking legs see I thought I was
gonna be the one that was gonna be down
on I bow on the show but you guys are
even more down on it oh it's it's $3,000
I kind of I thought you could hate
something more than me Joe that being
said that I think you guys are
significantly discounting the enormous
amount of I both loyalists fervor there
no it's just small definitely that kind
of retro nostalgia oh my god thousand
dollars no they do they take them to the
robot dog park and they do have they do
have like AI bow meetups but there were
people you should go to you should Japan
maybe I should do this down so there
were people that love their AI bows and
like really enjoyed having them so much
that they would spend hundreds of
dollars to repair them after Sony
stopped doing maintenance work on his I
bows in 2014 so like people don't just
like these things they love them and I
get it again you could form an emotional
attachment there and they serve as a
companions and Sony is very
intentionally creating like a lot of
elements to say like it's worth $3,000
by saying by saying they're know - I
Bose are the same
they have a because what they do is is
that they actually like experience
things and so like from the people they
don't remember yeah I remember
interactions they actually develop a
personality these are all the things
they're trying to trigger I mean get
interest in the AIBO community I would
have been interested in like this for my
kid if they were like 50 bucks or
something like a hundred yeah even a
hundred consider it maybe when my kid
gets older but $3,000 is a lot of money
it was the original Ivo was two thousand
dollars which when factoring in
inflation it's fairly similar and you
get the I bone so I don't know why I'm
defending this thing because I don't
actually think it's not going beyond a
niche product at that price you could
literally I wrote this in my store you
could buy two mid-range MacBook Pros for
the right price are you a spokesperson
nice try
Sony questions are we doing that now
I hate it but it's awesome
let's get an eyeball in here we'll paint
our logo on the side it'll be our
official mascot
Jacob Lombardo is kind of stemming off
of this recent sympathy that you guys
are just discussing seriously who in the
world can this possibly be catered to
this is the greatest thing I've ever
heard
a robot dog he scoffs I would assume
that it's for very lonely people you
know like older people I mean
companionship they're marking in it
marketing it as like companionship like
they have you know like stuffed animal
onic like seals or whatever yeah Patrick
Holland did a great story on that like
like the dog it's like they look duck
these kids suffer from cancer like to
help with their treatment they have
these like robot ducks like Affleck
ducks I guarantee that those are not
$3,000 though probably not yeah and this
is not meant for that kind of thing I
mean I suppose you could use it for that
kind of thing but it's really meant more
for a mainstream audio
we rented a mainstream audience they get
important a $3,000 dog like twice or so
it's for lonely rich people yeah it's
only a banana what could it cost like
$10 that's what an expensive banana you
just pulled a total Lucille Bluth there
didn't you yeah you know that's the
thing like what mainstream for the
$3,000 robot dog like get out it get out
of here all right Alfred here's some
money go see a star war Michael Brown is
officially relabeled burger Larry and as
the eyeball whisperer so one thing I
love it Ivo whisper from Michael Brown
as well what's the purpose of this robot
dog and what's the difference between I
bow and the small toy dogs in the toy
stores
hashtag r.i.p Toys R Us yo those those
toy dogs in the toy stores are awful I
got them for Christmas two years in a
row you mean those little one Mike last
year's lit yeah no no not those like
they they had some stuff like a very
smart dogs like something like that but
they kind of looks like Ivo but they
were like oh you could plug it into like
your your like iPod and it dances or
something like that and it was just like
it was really crappy and I was a
terrible Christmas gift dad yeah so I
would say the difference of this one's
probably like much smarter and like
dozen more yes more what does it
actually do it like goes and it's it's
interesting it goes and seeks you out
and it wants to control you have a
conversation it can recognize a hundred
different faces or a member so know if
you're like sad and like comfort you or
ill know if you're like happy and like
dance around or something it does it can
detect smiles or words of praise I don't
know if it can detect if you're sad or
nine into ten you can also create it and
it will respond if you pet it on its
head under its chin or put to sleep or
something I don't know you know it can
find its own charging point because it
port because it Maps your house so it's
it's gotten so nice oh it's a Roomba
that yips why doesn't it just go at
least the Roomba is clean your flooring
but answering Michael Browns question
is the the from a companion standpoint
this is in effect the same thing
conceptually as a pet rock because a pet
rock you just have it in a shoebox you
have it as your friend you take care of
it whatever but like it's it just does
more than a pet rock but it's like a
companionship thing it's just like it
has the capability to do like actual
like practical things like it has like
cameras on its eyes and like sensors and
stuff to like map out the house like if
this was marketed like oh this is like a
like companion like robot or something
but also it can patrol your house at
night for like any potential burglars or
anything I do that no it's not good at
that what hey I don't even have any
knives dude so no that's the premium
model that's only the eye knife for Sony
did mention that through the app you can
go get a video feed of like the dog so
you could use it you can see what the
dog is seeing yes yes so you could use
it as a quote-unquote
watchdog grouse move around like gross
okay I hate it Wow
I had to touch it I hate it I hate it
yeah touchy hate it Wow Chloe they make
me like it danced you had to my kit
which oh am I thinking of the wrong one
I think I'm on the wrong one what was
the the creepy bot the humanoid bot no
no this is a humanoid Bob this was like
a small bird thing oh the one that took
the nosedive off the desk yeah and I
didn't save it it was adorable hardcore
but it just didn't work yeah I know what
you're talking about okay not gross take
it take it back yeah hey let's get some
more questions we're gonna run out of
time yeah our wallop says it's a lot of
money how much would you spend for a
real dog though dog food and vet bills
and that brings me to another question
when this thing dies do you have to go
to the shop you have to take it to like
an engineer or does it go to a vet you
bury it in your backyard dude
take it apart you know I'm assuming
there's some sort of service plan or
something there's a service plan yeah
they have like a puppy like AppleCare
kind of thing yes they're constantly
trying to upsell don't spend this money
on a robot dog especially when there are
so many robot dogs in shelters that you
can adopt you know and there we go
mm-hmm but to your original question I
mean like a purebred will cost like
three thousand five thousand dollars
right so there are pure brides that
costs anywhere between a thousand plus
and that doesn't even take and then
overseeing it you can adopt a dog free
but you're right there is that cost of
feeding it taking care of it but the
other I swear to god like I know doesn't
puts an apples to oranges comparison
you're talking about a robot dog which
is a toy that was a question of living
being though it is true but it's not
even remotely the same right I vote as a
poop so there's that one point in its
favor
you'd have to clean up dog poop it
doesn't go they did it doesn't eat it
doesn't stink so what does it do doesn't
have steak after a while does it have
Google AI or Alexa capabilities it has
should it has Clym Oh turn on the stereo
yeah it has cloud-based artificial
intelligence which utilizes what is the
ws what is it
come on you know exactly what I'm bass
artificial you know I know but was it
what does that mean to look at normal
person I remember I would never say oh
this thing is cloud pay say ìokay I
remember every kid you know like around
December around the holiday season would
you know they'd go to Santa at the mall
Santa I want a puppy that has cloud
based AI based on the AWS what's the
what's the the Christmas story I want to
admittedly all our best podcasts are me
just getting dunked on for 20 minutes so
is the audience coming back fine that's
what I'm here for Ricky B is kind of
worried about that somebody might hack
the dog you'd be able to scoop up a
house that's holy that'll probably
happen especially if it's cloud-based
the dog will attack you there's there's
a very high chance that this is like
some security researcher will find
vulnerabilities on this how many times
have we seen like vulnerabilities with
AWS based services what is that what we
should look into that I'd be kind of
interested to see if we could get like
we should hire a hacker to see if they
can crack the dog and we're gonna see
that story's inevitable someone's gonna
be able to hack in all these things and
use the cameras the dogs cameras to
check out what yeah or instead of
barking it'll get it to say something
offensive or uses OLED eyes to do this
is like Ocean's thirteen or something
like like a heist movie where they like
hacking the dogs camera can scope out
the what Kingsman Kingsman right scope
out the house so you know what exactly
to either steal stuff or break in or the
dog explodes right if it's Kingsman like
this nah you're gonna be amazing
exposure that the robot dog thing was in
the second movie actually really I
realize that they had two robot dogs
okay yeah don't get a robot dog robot
dogs but they were like killing robot
dogs so I just want somebody to hack the
dog have a roll me like I can't do that
Dave can I speak can I take noises it
that's always dogs why can't they be a
robot cat hey that's the exact question
coming in from it was a peck who was
asking this I totally lost track of who
was asking this know Timothy do Timothy
do says how come there's no love for
robot cats and do they think that
they're gonna make any other robot pets
that you don't need I think they think
they did exist let's see a robot wrath
my like actual size or make a robot fish
and the thing instantly shorts out when
you throw it in the tub I mean like the
I bow is not a new product I first came
out in 1999 so no really interested in
having Brobot pets it would have already
happened already
mrs. that they're way too expensive so
even for somebody like you that you
would be like I'd love to get this for
my kid
there's no way in hell you're spending
$3,000 on it so you know that's the
that's the end of it I am NOT the AIBO
whisperer
all right we are moving on let's move on
eww to exoskeletons APEC says that suit
would be so handy for my dad who works
at an airport that's a good point yeah
heavy lifting they're all the luggage
all the equipment reminds him of call of
duty
oh the the latest one or the last one
not so first on the Call of Duty dance
library yeah it says aw says that yeah
yeah I mean this is this stuff right out
of like sci-fi right I mean and we've
seen some of this stuff before I'm most
interested in this they only have sandal
type shoes which like automatically
adjust to the wear because my feet are
fat and so I can't even I customized
just hope they can do that with fabric
Roger I'd like to do you know in your
heart is for me to find a comfortable
shoes
it's I I'm skeptical about this product
because I feel like it would be like
really janky at first it needs to go
through at least a couple generations to
I would assume actually be able to like
function properly somebody's working in
an airport lugging stuff all day I don't
know that this thing would actually work
really well yeah wouldn't it I will try
it I would make more sense if it's for
people like carrying things to have the
exoskeleton on their arms I guess you're
supposed to lift with your legs back
yeah but like I always have a hard time
carrying stuff because it's like a
strain on my arms mm-hmm weak dude yeah
so if I had the exoskeleton for my arms
that wouldn't be a problem it's coming
that's next year's model that's true
they only they start with like the
bottom half yeah into the top half next
year I want the exoskeleton just because
it is essentially like wearable seat
pants so you can just walk around and
pop a squat wherever you tired so I'm
like Lexie was demoing that in the video
I was like I want that I just want to be
able to sit wherever I want like this
thing is a different I know
irrelevant exoskeleton footage I have on
file so they basically function the same
way let's move on from Michael Brown
again on the subject of the false
alarm of the cyber attack on the NC why
is that the US government so much weaker
at combating this attack than the
Silicon Valley juggernauts Alfred um
well it's extremely different across the
board for everybody so like the Silicon
Valley juggernauts you know that's like
Google and Facebook and Apple they
control every element of you know their
infrastructure like Google can tell all
their employees we're using two-factor
authentication now when you take a look
at something like the DNC the RNC even
like your local election county
officials there's no set like standard
for everybody like the federal
government can't just like Trump can't
sign an executive order that's basically
like you have to have these security
measures with in place so there's so
much like you know fractured like stuff
going on that it's hard for them to
basically have one security standard
among everybody and it's hard to like
coordinate at all yeah and that way that
makes it easier to find weaker links
obviously all right we are just about
out of time but I like all these
suggestions coming in in the chat about
where the exoskeleton exoskeleton could
actually be useful someone who has a
grandmother who's perhaps physically
enable or those with general handicaps
could really see a lot of fantastic
usages keep sending them along we want
to hear more where you think this could
be a practical implementation in the
meantime though coming back from APEC
could the suit become weaponized at all
and I want to propose this as a closing
thought what's first to weaponize the
exosuit or the I bow the suit wait I
mean I bows basically okay but have you
seen I bow like that thing is so tiny it
like makes for the most it's unlikely
assassin I'd like to see an eyebrow kill
a man do you want to see a dead body so
what are you saying that the eye boss
just going to nurse ratchet somebody I
don't know what that means you've not
seen one foo of the Cuckoo's Nest it's
been a while
roben I go watch it this weekend I think
the mango is better
so either way yes the the exoskeleton
will probably get weaponized first and I
feel really surprised if the military
wasn't all
development sure there's already
something yet in like Rd mm-hmm they're
protesting yo knows well yeah we have
that video if the third arm thing in the
army right
whoa there's like I know what you talk
about times a day that's that stuff is
uh yeah it's already in development
yo social is listening tweet that video
again today alright we are down to the
wire and out of time so thanks everybody
for joining us thanks to USB for
sponsoring the show we are done for the
week we'll see you guys on Monday who
wants to take us on out of here
I guess I'll I'll do it nine is
available in iTunes tune in stitcher
feedburner cool to play music google
podcast Amazon echo of course sina.com
we'll see you all next week and join me
though every week everybody he's gonna
be he's gonna be Berlin I mean looking
for I Bose track been on Twitter while
he's at the deadly fall on Twitter and
hopefully he gets a chance to check out
the suit but maybe I will make it my
mission weaponize it bye bye bye
