iPhone 10 that's according to a report
from Nikkei though the publication
didn't quote a source so here's the deal
originally Apple planned to make 40
million phones in the first quarter for
2018 but that number is now supposedly
20 million this could be another blow
for Apple's flagship phone last week we
also heard a report that said Apple
might discontinue 2/10 altogether when
the next generation models are released
later in 2018 according to KGI
Securities analyst Ming Shi quo the
thinking behind this move is that Apple
would rather axe the phone rather than
drop the price so it doesn't affect
sales of other phones quo also said
three new iPhones are in the works for
2018 a 5.8 inch and 6.5 inch model
possibly the iPhone 10 plus with OLED
screens and a 6.1 inch LCD model at a
lower price all would get facial
recognition with the true depth camera
this is a big week for Apple with the
companies set to hold its earnings call
on Thursday February 1st it's also when
we'll learn about sales during the
holiday season and will be the first
earnings report to include the iPhone 10
keep an eye on CNET for all the latest
Apple news and let me know what you
think about slashes to production of the
iPhone on Twitter or in the comments</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
