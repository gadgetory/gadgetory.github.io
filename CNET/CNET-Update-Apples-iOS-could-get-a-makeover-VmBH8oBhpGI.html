makeover I'm Bridget Carey and this is
your cnet update there's been much buzz
about how the next iPhone will have a
completely new look for the design of
the operating system and the icons the
word is is that Apple doesn't want
applications to mimic the look of real
life items for example the Notes app it
looks like a yellow legal notepad with
ripped pages and the blog 9to5 mac is
reporting that the new iphone interface
will be simpler and flatter without so
many textures and the apps will lose
their shiny look it's expected that
Apple will show off this new look with
iOS 7 on jun 10th at its developers
conference so we'll have to wait and see
and if you're in the market for a
smartphone now's a good time to shop
best buy is taking fifty dollars off
iPhones and the samsung galaxy s3
starting may 26th and a few other
android phones are also going on sale
ever since the xbox one was unveiled
everyone has been getting pretty worked
up about what Microsoft is going to do
about used games microsoft says you'll
be able to play a use game but if the
game was already played once on someone
else's account you may have to pay a fee
to activate it what Microsoft is keeping
quiet about the details and we don't
know what this fee would be or even how
it might work but the latest report from
gaming news site MCV says that Microsoft
and gaming publishers are creating a
system so they get a piece of the sale
of used games if this is complicated
this could destroy gamefly the video
game rental service and say goodbye to
getting a good discount of gamestop Sony
might also change how it handles used
games with the new PlayStation 4 but we
have to wait until the e3 conference to
know more which just so happens to be
the same day that Apple has its
presentation on jun 10th if you're an
ett wireless customer you'll notice this
month your bill went up 61 cents AT&amp;amp;T
added a new 61 sent monthly admin fee
for all contract wireless customers and
although that seems small for the
individual The Wall Street Journal
reports this will help ATT bring in more
than half a million dollars 18t says
this B is similar to what other carriers
charge and that it will help cover
maintenance expenses digg announced that
its RSS reader will be called get this
digg reader and it will be incorporated
into the current dig app when Google
Reader announced it will shut down July
first dig said it was going to step up
and create a replacement service for
people to pull in the feeds to their
favorite sites digg reader is expected
