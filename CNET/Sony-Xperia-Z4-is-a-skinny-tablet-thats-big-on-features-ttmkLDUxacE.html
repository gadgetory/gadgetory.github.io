I'm taking a first look at the Sony
Xperia z4 tablet not to be confused with
the smartphone that goes by the same
name this Xperia z4 is a 10-inch tablet
in a stylish Li skinny package sitting
at 6.1 millimeters thin and weighing at
389 grams it's one of the slimmest and
lightest tablets around
despite this the tablet feels sturdy and
solid it's also a waterproof to boot
running on Android lollipop
Sony modifies the user interface to make
it a bit more user friendly and
customizable you can change what order
your apps appear in the app tray easily
download themes change the icons in your
quick setting menu or even designate an
app to launch when you connect an
accessory like setting Spotify to launch
as soon as you connect headphones in
addition to pre loading the tablet with
Microsoft Office Sonny offers an
optional Bluetooth keyboard for those
looking to get some work done on the z4
the tablet snugly fits into its top edge
and it can close shut like a laptop
though it's also thin and light it
unfortunately doesn't feel as solidly
constructed as a tablet itself the
experience d4 houses the 2 gigahertz
Qualcomm Snapdragon octa-core CPU 3
gigabytes of RAM and up to 32 gigabytes
of internal storage with a micro SD card
slot that's expandable up to 128
gigabytes it features a 24 60 by 1600
pixel resolution display and it's
stunningly crisp and bright with an
impressive range of colors considering
expects the z4 is fast and smooth
performance is unsurprising casual tasks
like checking email surfing the web and
streaming video run without a hitch even
if taking advantage of the lightweight
multi window capabilities and large
games and apps are quick to load any
performance is also notable in 3dmark
benchmark testing the Sony Tablet scores
were right below the Google Nexus 9 and
NVIDIA shield tablets
two of the best Android gaming tablet
surround the 8 megapixel rear camera on
the z4 packs a bunch of fun features
aside from the usual scene modes you can
overlay cute graphics or text on the
photos or even turn yourself into a
weird book
animal if you're into that kind of thing
with the razor-sharp screen trendy slim
design powerful specs and feature rich
software the Sony Xperia z4 is an
impressive contender for the best
Android tablet for more details keep an
eye out for the full review for Cena
