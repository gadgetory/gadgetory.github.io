not a PlayStation now event obviously
the big announcement PlayStation now
streaming the legacy of PlayStation
games across multiple platforms it's
pretty cool stuff
they have hands-on ability right now I'm
gonna go check out the games and see
what it's like streaming PlayStation
games so let's pop into the Last of Us
and it's just the regular Vita operating
system but uh through the streaming
service we're gonna be able to play The
Last of Us check this out
the l2 and r2 those buttons are emulated
on back so it's kind of tough to really
make it work or at least play
comfortably I'm here with Peter director
of marketing for PlayStation now how are
we streaming those games yeah it's it's
really leveraging the technology of
cloud that's for priority 2 PlayStation
our goal is to really offer a diverse
lineup of popular PlayStation titles
that you can play on playstation devices
but also just as great on non
playstation devices that opens up the
PlayStation the world to a whole new
group of people who may not have had a
console in the masses being able to
experience games like not a war so
that's cool so it's you know I guess the
big surprise is like it's not just going
to be backwards sort of compatibility
with PlayStation 4 there's all these
other platforms that it's now available
on our goal is to provide PlayStation
quality on regardless of the device
right and that's
for most in our thinking and it is
streaming technology much like Netflix
sure you're able to get a similar
experience on a tablet or on your TV we
have announced that we're gonna have two
ways that you can enjoy a Playstation
now one rental service okay it's very
much gives people the ability to try
before they buy sure I've been right on
and also subscription package will they
get a broader array of titles that they
can enjoy her price alright so there you
have it
interesting playing those games there's
a little bit of a latency going on a
little you know sort of lag something
you're gonna have to get used to I found
out when you set up PlayStation now it's
gonna figure out your connection and
then you'll decide whether or not you
want to go through that it'll let you
know if you're gonna have a great
experience for maybe a not-so-good so
that's going to do it for me at the
PlayStation now event for Cena I'm Jeff
