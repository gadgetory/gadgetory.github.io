tax season and the Fitbit charge 3 has
just arrived this could be fitbit's best
overall general fitness tracker but how
does that compare to the fitbit Versa a
watch that I've already really liked and
how does it compare to Apple watch
series 4 well I'm here to tell you after
wearing it for only a few days how it
compares and what you should look out
for how it stands out the Fitbit charge
3 is $150 which is significantly less
than the Apple watch series 4 but it's
also $50 less than the Versa so if
you're looking for value that's it it
also has better battery life than the
fitbit Versa and for the first time the
Fitbit charge 3 compared to the charge 2
has water resistance for swimming which
is great so you can wear in the shower
wear it while swimming it has a larger
screen and its really touch enabled this
time so it doesn't have any of that tap
to touch stuff which feels a lot
smoother to operate the charge 3 also
gets notifications so you can tap in all
the notifications from your phone
feeling a lot more like a SmartWatch so
in that sense isn't it kind of like a
SmartWatch that's a thing it's probably
enough of that if you just want basic
functions and what it doesn't have no
music support so and no ability to store
music and there's no music remote and
while there is Fitbit pay for a $20 bump
up version which is not bad because
you're also getting an extra band Fitbit
doesn't support a lot of banks at this
point compared to Apple pay and Google
pay other than that it's a pretty basic
fitness tracker experience no GPS but it
does have the step-up heartrate that's
been on recent Fitbit models called pure
pulse this heartrate is supposed to give
more accurate tracking and also help
with more accurate sleep readings so far
it's been a little bit up and down but
we're gonna keep testing it and give an
update as we do a full review even
though the charge 3 has a larger screen
than the charge 2 it's significantly
smaller than the fitbit Versa or other
smartwatches and it's not color however
it is a pretty bright grayscale OLED
screen so it looks crisp and moves
smoothly and there are a few watch faces
that you can pick within the Fitbit app
but there is no watch based store unlike
the Fitbit Versa and ionic and there's
no app store while there are a couple of
app like functions there are no others
that you can shop for an ad
the interactions with the charge three
are done using your finger or with a
really clever little hectic kind of
button on the side there's an
indentation and when you press in it has
a vibration and it feels like a button
it brings you back to the main menu
turns the screen on and off or if you're
in an exercise it'll pause and then stop
the workout navigating is a little bit
wonky in the sense that you do have to
do a lot of swiping to pick features not
a lot is immediately done with the side
buttons so if you're looking for instant
get up and go workouts the Versa has
more shortcuts you see here you can
start run there's basic fitness stats
not a ton but enough you can bring up
relaxed which is fitbit's breathing
relaxation app where you take breaths
and it will tell you if it comes you
down these are always kind of weird
because I prefer to not look at
electronics to relax
there's also timers which is timer or
stopwatch nice to have alarms the
vibration on this actually feels pretty
strong weather is there although
sometimes it doesn't sync it's a little
bit funky certainly not nearly as
effortless as using say an Apple watch
with an iPhone and that's it it's a
pretty bare-bones set of stuff but a
step up over what you've gotten before
on the charge - for $150 this basically
has all the basic tracking tools you
need and fitbit's app is really great
it's got a great community there's a lot
of tools in there I really like using it
but you might not need to charge three
if you already have a charge - or you
might prefer to wait for a holiday sale
and see if the Fitbit Versa which has a
lot of other watchface options is
available - versa does a lot of the same
stuff and again it's the watch faces and
apps
the Apple watch series 4 doesn't have
sleep tracking it doesn't have longer
battery life like these fitbit's do but
it does have a lot faster hook ins not
to mention speakerphone much more robust
music playback better contactless
payments the ability to add cellular so
that's kind of in its own territory a
couple of annoying things about the
Fitbit charge 3 it has yet another
proprietary charger this keeps happening
with fitbit's and this clip-on one
is not the same as the clip-on ones from
other models so hang on to your specific
Fitbit charger and the bands are also
new this time so if you have previous
fitbit's they won't work the good news
is that these new bands I tried out a
silicone perforated sport one and a nice
woven one they detach and attach a lot
more easily than the fitbit Versa
hope that helps we're gonna have a lot
more on Fitbit in the future and I'm
gonna keep wearing Fitbit charge through
my wrist so far it's only been about two
days and I'm down to about 64% battery
life more soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
