Bakalar for cnet.com reporting live from
CES 2012 we're down here on the show
floor checking out Nico's line of new
products Michael is getting in to the
Amazon Kindle game and they've had some
accessories out on display and they're
going to be ready in about April first
we have the Amazon Kindle speaker stand
this is pretty cool basically allows for
physical volume buttons on the device
there's no volume buns I just learned
this but there's no volume buttons on an
Amazon Kindle so they're going to be
right here easily accessible on the back
is the stand and this is going to work
horizontally or vertically as well The
Stand also doubles as a stylus which is
pretty cool too should be able to get
audio out of this device use the stylus
as well like I said horizontal and
vertical and that's going to go for
forty dollars in April then here we have
the kindle power case this is going to
add twice the battery life and something
really cool about this as well they
added the volume buttons on the speaker
stand before the power case they're
adding a front facing power button which
the Amazon Kindle does not currently
have it's on the bottom so this is
really cool also going to provide a lot
of protection as well this is going to
go for sixty dollars when it's released
in April finally PlayStation Vita coming
out februari 22nd this is the PS Vita
speaker stand which is slated for the
launch window as well what's really cool
about this is it allows for the audio
out of the Vita to be projected and it
also take a line in as well only one
power source required right in the back
it'll go right in and power the Vita and
this speaker stand as well nice
amplified audio so excited about that
finally comes with a cool little
keychain remote with the access of
buttons unless you change the volume and
change the input and also a power on and
off button very cool nikon has a lot of
interesting stuff for accessories coming
out this calendar year so really it's
like to check them out get them in the
cnet offices and get some reviews for
them when they come out this will go for
30
when it's released in the launch window
that's going to do it for night goes
lineup this year I'm Jeff Bakalar for
