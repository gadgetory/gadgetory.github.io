this is a look at the TiVo mini now
unlike most of what TiVo sells this is
not a DVR so you cannot record TV
directly to it but instead it connects
to a TiVo premiere 4 or XL for DVR over
your home network extending access to
your premieres recordings as well as
live TV now there is no wireless support
so it connects to your network either by
Ethernet or over MOCA which uses your
coaxial cable in your home to meet the
high bandwidth demands for smoothly
streaming live TV setup is fairly
straightforward just connect the coaxial
or Ethernet to your wall HDMI to your
display and plug it in for power it's
small and lightweight - so you can
easily hide it by mounting it behind the
TV or somewhere else out of sight so
once it's connected and finds your DVR
you'll have pretty much the same
experience on the mini as you do on the
premier all controlled with the included
standard p-nut remote along with access
to recorded in live TV
you also get on-demand and streaming
content services though at the moment
Netflix and Amazon Instant Video aren't
available however if all you're after is
streaming services you'll probably
better off going with something like a
Roku also you currently have to dedicate
one of your tuners for the mini to
stream live TV which means you lose it
for recording though TiVo says this
eventually won't be necessary now the
price because you're getting the TiVo
service experience on the mini there is
a subscription fee involved six bucks a
month or a hundred and fifty dollars
lifetime and the device itself costs
$100 this isn't entirely out of line
with the cost of similar setups from
other providers but still might be more
than some TiVo users are willing to
spend
I'm Josh golden and that's a look at the
TiVo mini</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
