scenic coming at you from Mobile Con
2012 in San Diego I hope in my hands the
Moga Bluetooth controller now this is a
gaming accessory right now it's here
with the Samsung Galaxy Note 2 for
t-mobile t-mobile is going to be selling
this controller at stores so it's just a
fun little add-on that you can get to
help you play games on your phone the
reason you might want this is because
phones like the Galaxy Note 2 are now
coming with quad-core processors and so
they're going to emphasize gaming more
than ever before so we're going to start
to see a lot more accessories like this
pocket full disclosure is that I am NOT
a gamer I'm not even really a casual
gamer but I am an excellent driver so
I'm gonna demo this a little bit now
this is Need for Speed it's a car game
like I said I'm an excellent driver so
the controls right now to my unpracticed
hands they feel pretty good they're
sliding really easily there are a lot of
buttons here there's this joystick that
kind of pops out and that you're able to
pause the game or keep on playing there
are some other buttons as well it's very
comfortable to hold in the hand feels
very natural very grip achill as well
there's a latch here to help keep your
phone in place keep it from sliding
around then when we turn the controller
around we see that it's also adjustable
so it fits multiple phones there are
also these left and right buttons here
that you're able to just very easily and
comfortably use for games that optimize
with these extras so it's got this nice
rib surface as well that's gonna help a
lot with grip so overall it looks pretty
good but will of course have to put it
to the test with a very practice serious
gamer over here at CMS I'm Jessica's all
for it this is the Moga Bluetooth
controller that will be sold at t-mobile
stores</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
