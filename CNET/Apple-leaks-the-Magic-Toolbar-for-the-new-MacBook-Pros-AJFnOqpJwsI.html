from Apple's new MacBook Pro
announcement but Apple has accidentally
leaked out images for this rumored OLED
touch bar that is now believed to be
called the magic toolbar based on
trademark filings images hidden inside
of Mac OS Sierra 10-point 12.1 they
relate to Apple pay and showcase this
dynamic magic tool bar in action one of
these images features apple's new
keyboard layout now this might be hard
to see but if these mock-ups from Apple
are believed to be true you can actually
see the touch ID sensor is located in
the top right hand corner of this
toolbar and it's actually its own
separate section that is part of the
entire magic toolbar the speaker's here
are also thinner in size but they align
with the top and bottom of the keyboard
in past macbooks though the 13-inch
never had speakers only the 15-inch
model did so either they squeeze this
into this new design or the image that
we're seeing is from the new 15-inch
macbook pro also if you guys look
carefully the arrow key layout has taken
a page from the macbook 12-inch the
ultra-thin design and the Escape key is
completely missing because that's been
replaced by this entire magic toolbar so
we'll wait for apple's official
announcement that's coming up at ten
a.m. on thursday october the 27th it's
happening to apple's headquarters but
this is just one of those tidbits the
magic toolbar you all wanted to see it
that we just couldn't keep from all you
