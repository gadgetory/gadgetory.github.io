and several interesting new security
features take root in a vast eight hi
I'm Seth Rosenblatt for cnet and today
we're taking a first look at a vast 8
premiere and all the new features that
have been crammed into it don't worry
avast 8 free fans we're also going to be
taking a quick look at what's in the
free version much like the windows 8
operating system that it's been designed
for you're either going to love or hate
the new advanced interface personally I
like it I think it's easier to navigate
I find the big icons are easier to see
and read the marquee functions have been
reorganized or tweaked to be easier to
use and it still offers advanced
settings and configurations for power
users and avast obsessives in addition
to its highly rated infection prevention
tools the new avast has several new
features most of them are in fact
excellent the new browser cleanup tools
available in all versions of avast it
checks the internal storage and registry
for internet explorer firefox and chrome
searches for plug-in and toolbar
references and then it helps you
uninstall the ones you don't want the
new software updater doesn't just tell
you when your programs are out of date
it provides links to update them
directly from within a vast it's level
of automation depends on which version
of avast you're running the free or one
of the paid suites but even in free
it'll automatically download the update
and open its installer for you premiere
on the other hand goes whole hog and
runs the update silently two new
features are only available to people
who splurge on a vast 8 premiere a data
shredder and a remote access tool called
access anywhere while the utility of the
data shredder is readily apparent gets
rid of stuff you don't want left on your
computer the access anywhere tool is a
bit under baked and requires both ends
of the connection to have a vast
installed other players in this space
like teamviewer or logmein are much
simpler to use still a vast continues to
earn high scores from independent
testing agencies for protecting you it
also remains one of our favorite free
solutions first look at a vast eight
