laptop gets a little bit better and a
little bit less expensive i'm dan
ackerman and this is the 2014 version of
apple's 13-inch macbook air this is a
very minor update to the macbook air
compared to the 2013 version what
Apple's done this year is take the same
body fact the same body we've seen for a
few years now and given it a slightly
faster processor and it's also cut the
price by a hundred dollars for the base
model from 1099 down to 999 and I think
getting below that thousand-dollar
markedly psychologically makes a big
difference makes it a lot easier to move
into a macbook air now we saw some you
know minor improvement in performance
scores in this model versus last year's
but if you've got a recent macbook air
there's not really a real reason to
upgrade if you've been holding off for a
couple years or you have an older
macbook air then this is certainly a
lower-cost way to get in there and the
performance is a little bit better
battery life still excellent of course
we're all waiting for a more thorough
overhaul of the air because the hardware
vault still looks good is starting to
feel a little bit dated newer laptops
have higher screen resolutions
edge-to-edge glass over the display some
of them have touchscreens obviously OS
10 is not really built around touch but
you see a lot of Windows laptops moving
that way it'll be really interesting to
see what Apple does next when they do a
more complete overhaul or redesign of
the airline beyond this very very minor
upgrade i'm dan ackerman and that is the
2014 version of apple's 13-inch macbook
air</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
