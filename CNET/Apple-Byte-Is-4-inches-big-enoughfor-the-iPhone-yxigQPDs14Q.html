welcome to little show we like to call--
the Alpha by for all the good and bad
inside the world of Apple and if you're
good today class we won't give you a
spanking onto the news and we show you a
lot of Apple parts that get leaked early
but this is believed to be the front
panel for the next generation iPod Touch
with the Mac rumor source claiming that
it will be taller than the current model
with an opening measuring 4.1 inches
diagonally with the viewable display to
be slightly smaller it's a pretty safe
bet that app will use the same screen
size for both its ipod touch and iphone
line since they have done that in the
past and this is new evidence supported
by a 9 to 5 Mac report that says there
are a few next-gen iPhones in testing at
Apple locked in shelves to disguise
their exterior design now two of them
spore display that is three point nine
nine nine inches diagonally and a pixel
resolution of 640 by eleven thirty six
that's an extra 176 pixels longer than
the current display now the screen is
very close to a sixteen by nine
resolution so videos can fill out the
screen at their native resolution and
Apple is currently testing builds of iOS
6 custom built to the new display that
fits five rows of icons now all this is
juicy stuff but based on the recent
reports and time tables I think we'll
see a whole bunch of OS 10 mountain lion
at WWDC and the hot new hardware will be
the new MacBook Pros and IMAX we've got
to see a preview of iOS 6 just something
even for developers to preview like they
have in the past but I don't think we'll
see the next iPhone until a later event
I know a lot of you might be a little
bummed out right now but I just wanted
to prepare you mentally because I know
how some of you get I don't like that
Apple now we plan on seeing a lot of
mountain lion and a few more Nuggets are
coming out automatic downloads were
hinted at earlier and the latest build
allows you to enable the feature for
installing new purchases on multiple
computers with the same iCloud account
it's not active right now but it's
pretty similar to what happens on iOS
devices and another feature and looks
like we'll see is voice dictation
humming - max after 95 Mac found
resource files inside of Safari inside
of the latest OS 10 build that show the
key command to bring up voice dictation
but not everyone is fond of Apple voice
recognition apps IBM isn't the biggest
fan of Siri and is blocking the feature
on their own internal networks because
of the way your speech is recorded then
upload it to Apple servers and then
deciphered before being sent back now
there concern that commands and
sensitive information or the company
like contacts and more to be potentially
stored on Apple Zen but shouldn't we all
be a little worried about that yeah we
should be now let's check out this cool
project called leap that allows the
controller computer by using your hand
it's a little small box that tracks your
hands motions it's similar to
Microsoft's Kinect but it's a lot more
accurate and can track your movements
down to 1/100 of a millimeter it'll be
interesting to see how this works with
real applications because all I do with
my Kinect displayed am central alone by
myself now the leap will cost you 69
bucks and you can pre-order it on their
website
alright guys for the quick bytes word on
the street from boy Gina's report is
that Microsoft is set to release the
full office suite for iOS and Android
tablets in November an image back in
February was leaked out and Microsoft
said it was fake so we should believe
everything they say moving forward and
jailbreakers you should know that the
absinthe 2.0 untethered jailbreak for
iOS 5.1.1 is planning to drop this week
so keep your eyes open for that and you
know me I'm a fan of some of these
amazing Kickstarter projects so we
wanted to show some love to the gee-tar
it's the first digital iPhone powered
guitar with a built in iPhone dock that
uses sensors to relay what's you're
playing and also has a built-in app that
teaches you how to play songs it's
pretty amazing and finally we talked
about an Apple Store concept in the past
where you can walk from the sidewalk to
the inside of a store seamlessly it
looks like that store is currently being
built at Stanford Shopping Center under
a black cloth and this concept drawing
gives you a peek at the over 1,200
square foot 23 foot tall single-story
store it's expected to be open by the
end of the year and is described as
making the space between the outside and
inside almost indistinguishable
translation more idiots waffle
middle-class all right that's gonna do
it for this week's show send us your
emails to the Apple bite at cnet.com and
ideas or things you'd like to see will
respond thanks for watching I'm Brian
Todd we'll catch you guys next time for
another bite of the Apple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
