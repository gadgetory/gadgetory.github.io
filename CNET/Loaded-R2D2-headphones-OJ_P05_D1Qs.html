Morris and it's time to get loaded
microsoft plans to show off tablets at
the 2011 consumer electronics show in
las vegas now i know they did this last
year with the HP Slate but that was
never really a real thing microsoft says
they are ready with tablets this year
and they will be real and they will hit
the market manufacturers are to include
Dell and Samsung Dell is working on
acquiring a data storage company called
compellent technologies compellent is a
cloud storage company perhaps indicating
the Dell wants to start selling machines
with less on-board storage and more
cloud based strategy the deal is said to
be worth nine hundred and sixty million
dollars Google wants to help you help
out technology noobs the company has
launched a site called teach parents
tech it has simple tutorials to help
people in your life who can't fly around
a browser and a keyboard like you can
you can find these fun tutorials and
watch them and also send them at teach
parents tech org a new study shows that
Americans spend just as much time online
as they do watching television in fact
the amount of time people have spent
online has increased 121 percent in the
last five years according to forrester
people under 30 are spending an average
of 12 hours per day online while people
over 66 are spending an average of eight
hours per day this all makes me very
glad that my show is on the internet and
another study that's bad for old media
comes from in stat it shows that
physical disks sales like DVDs and
blu-ray discs are expected to decline by
4.6 billion dollars by the year 2014
people will opt instead to stream movies
and videos increasing the revenue of
streamed content from 2.3 billion
dollars to 6.3 billion dollars again
making me glad that i work in online
video and finally here is the perfect
gift for the Jedi Knight in your life
the r2d2 headphones from kholoud cost
about fifty dollars they also come with
ear cups designed in the vein of
stormtroopers Darth Vader or an x-wing
fighter those are your headlines for
today remember that you can find links
to
anything we've discussed here at cnet
com / loaded I'll see you tomorrow I'm
Natali Morris for Cena back home and us
