thousands of showers my entire life so I
wanted to find out what this neviah
thing is all about my name is phillip
winter and i'm the co-founder and CEO
nebia on average Americans take about
eight minutes to shower for the normal
shower that's over 20 gallons of water
of the nebia it's only six that's 70%
less what what goes into actually
atomizing this water so it uses less but
also just covers your whole body I mean
when we started working on this we
looked at sort of other areas that we
could sort of pull from and learn from
in atomizing water we're leveraging sort
of a technology that's been around for
in some cases a century and it's always
used in industrial applications and jet
engines turn combustion engines and
agriculture always for different
purposes essentially what we're doing is
is taking water passing it through a
nozzle that has different geometries and
creating millions of much smaller
droplets
and it creates a surface area of water
that's like 10x a regular shower that's
why you get this for a much more
efficient use of water and it's very
like soft sensation can you talk about
you know just the mentality of there's
so many iterations that we won't even
see but what good what went into that
process as well for you guys I mean we
worked with so many different ideas and
played with the idea of color and
different materials and we sort of
looked at everything that's in the
bathroom and everything the bathroom is
like chrome and it's been that way for
decades and we said we could do Chrome
where we can do something a little bit
different and we chose anodized be
blasted finish which is sort of what you
see on MacBooks familiar but different
in the bathroom are you guys playing
with any other ideas of kind of like a
deluxe edition you know as things
evolved like what's going on in your
minds with that additional features will
be things that really add value and
they'll probably be in future
generations so you can track how much
water you use and how much energy you
use in the future we'll design the
faucets so you can like pick your
temperature and it just stays there you
don't have to every morning sort of
guess and I think that will sort of be
the most interesting thing so if I like
am listening and paying attention it
sounds like you're alluding to like
smart features built in conjunction with
the Nebbia for future iterations or even
the first one coming out would be
to talk to them for future iterations
yeah at the end of the day the proof is
always in the pudding of someone
actually trying to shower out we're
gonna check it out but how would you
describe your first
nebia experience you'll see for yourself
it's we always tell people look you got
to try for yourself you'll get it what's
up guys welcome to my shower you can see
over here this is the Nebbia prototype
we've seen what the final ID looks like
outside and I've got to tell you I have
taken thousands of showers but I have
never taken a Nebbia so I want to see
what it feels like
I will tell you they feel like this is
the softest that I've had for sure
alright I gotta say we coming to this I
didn't know what to expect from the
shower I thought the water pressure not
be strong enough but no it feels great
it covers your whole body it doesn't
feel like you're missing anything and I
gotta say I'm super excited when the
deb√≠a comes out this thing is tight
though now it's warm</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
