a look at the new dell inspiron
17 are now you may ask yourself wait a
minute didn't I just see a dell inspiron
17 r well that was the Inspiron 17 r SE
4 special edition that laptop took a
basic low-end mostly plastic bonded like
this and packed in some actually
reasonably high end components giving
you kind of the best of both worlds
decent performance and a reasonably
decent price about $1000 this is just
the regular Inspiron 17 r and it is part
of an increasingly rare category of
laptops the the budget desktop
replacement in fact you don't really see
that many desktop replacements big 17
inch laptops anymore at all Apple of
course recently got rid of their 17-inch
MacBook Pro and that gives you an idea
of where this category is going people
are just more interested in taking their
laptops with them now with the Inspiron
17r you get again kind of a thick bulky
plasticky body it's not radically bigger
than previous generations of 17 inch
laptops but people's expectations have
changed in the last year or so with
ultrabooks and other super thin laptops
moving up from 13 inches into the larger
14 and 15 inch in even bigger categories
so this guy even if it's only an inch
and a half
still looks and feels really big
compared to other 2012 laptops now what
they pack into here for $6.99 is a core
i5 very reasonable 750 gig hard drive an
optical drive nothing really surprising
you could knock a hundred dollars off
and trade down to a core i3 but I
wouldn't recommend it in order to get
the really high-end parts including a
discreet graphics card you're gonna have
to move to that 17 r se the special
edition series that we've reviewed
separately the other thing that really
makes us feel like a budget laptop is
the fact that the screen even though
it's a big 17 inch screen it's only a
1600 by 900 screen not the 1920 by 1080
that you really expect from just about
any 17 inch laptop really makes it
perfect for HD video viewing or blu-ray
or anything like that so if you're
willing to live with the lower screen
resolution although I it's hard to
figure out why you'd want a giant screen
but allure red
Oshin but you want decent performance
and you want it in a big body but you
don't want to pay more than let's say
$5.99 or $6.99 then you're one of the
very small subset of people and they
certainly could be out there who this is
perfect for I'm Dan Ekman and that is
the Dell Inspiron 17r</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
