obd2 compliant meaning you can grab all
of your cars diagnostics through a port
that's a lot like a USB port for your
car in most cases though only mechanics
have access to this port but more and
more apps are allowing the user to put
all of that data into your pocket in
this case I'll show you how to use an
app called - which is free for both iOS
and Android with it you can turn any
dumb card into a smart car so you can
see diagnostics like fuel economy rpm
engine temperature and a lot more plus
you can even diagnose the check engine
light all on your own here's how it
works first you'll need an OPD - device
these costs anywhere from $15 to $100
depending on what the brand is and what
features it has you can go to Dash's
website for recommendations on both iOS
and Android in this case I already have
my obd for an android phone and i'll
plug it into my car in most cases it's
underneath the steering wheel now we're
ready to pair the obd with my phone so
the first thing i want to do is turn the
car on to give power to the obd
then I'll go into my bluetooth settings
find the obd link it up then we'll
launch - and in a few seconds the app
should find the obd that's it we're set
so let's take it for a test drive
as I'm driving all these Diagnostics are
updating in real-time so I can see my
fuel economy rpm temperature engine load
if you don't know what one of these
means you can actually just tap the
square and it'll give you a really nice
explanation
it becomes a little bit addicting
because the goal is to get as many of
these squares into the green zone as
possible it's not always in your control
but oftentimes you can prevent it from
going into red by controlling how fast
you accelerate or how hard you break
so here's how it works from the moment I
start my car to the point that I take my
key out of the ignition that's
considered one trip and at the end of
every trip I get a driver's score from -
that's dependent on how fast I was
accelerating how hard I was braking and
if I was idling for too long so let's
see how I did good my trips so I see
here that I got a score of 81 a lot of
that is because I was idling too much
probably because of some San Francisco
traffic but it says I have some great
fuel efficiency and I avoided hard
accelerations
luckily my overall score is still a nice
93</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
