shoulders in fact nothing less than
recruiting the next generation of Lexus
fires that will sustain the company for
like the next 20 years and this
particular model is their longest ball
toward that goal let's drive the 2012 CT
200h premium with the F Sport package
and check the deck now as I've told you
before we review the previous Lexus CT
we had I love the ergonomics in this guy
this lay down console is kind of mid
sixties thunderbird and it's exactly
where your hand wants to go for climate
your media controls but here's where the
ergonomics start to fall apart this hole
right here is for this thing the Lexus
electronics holder pretty clever huh you
stick it in there and it kind of sits in
the hold you turn that around you can
stick your phone in there and a little
Universal kind of a clamp holds it but
it's got issues first of all when you're
driving it rattles in creaks that is not
in the Lexus playbook of quality then
there's this deal it's always crooked
that makes me crazy it gets in the way
of reaching other knobs how do I get to
the drive knob how do I get to the
tuning knob without kind of contorting
myself and worst of all if the steam
heater buttons are up and your passenger
turns this thing they share that button
off right there
okay enough of that the ergonomic
nightmares continue small as they may be
here's your USB aux port right here
where a door wants to close on it but
can't because anything you plug in there
is going to keep the door from closing
and even if it didn't where's the little
port for the cable to trail out so I can
leave that closed the little Lexus
details are missing right here made me
nuts
now more substantial stuff we've got the
head unit here with a generally
excellent Lexus interface and it's a
little pop up kind of a deal you can set
different angles of tilt and we've shown
you this many times on Lexus cars I like
everything on it I like the way they lay
things out it's clear it's easy to use
and I have actually fallen in love with
this the remote touch controller which
has this little upside down little jog
puck right here you move around things
by moving a cursor
it has haptic free
back which locks you or makes those
things sticky really great for using
this with minimal distraction and in
these days when the federal government's
talking about killing Hall distraction
this is a leader once you get to where
you're going you use enter menu map or
this scroll rocker here to make things
happen this big knob here does not
control the interface it just controls
the drive mode counterclockwise for eco
push to be normal all the way over for
sport sport puts this guy in a mode
where it's going to have a revised
throttle curve more aggressive
acceleration it ups the voltage from the
battery to the electric motor to get
more oomph out of it and it tightens up
the electric power steering over here is
easy mode if you press that the car will
do whatever it can to run up to one mile
add up to 25 miles an hour on battery
only direct link to the electric motor
and things on the dash change as you
change the drive controller when you're
in normal mode you get a charge or
discharge gauge turn the sport and that
dynamically turns into a tach very trick
and notice it all turns red to the media
options are pretty excellent you got
am/fm satellite radio a single slot CD
and you've got aux and USB as I showed
you Bluetooth hands-free and bluetooth
streaming a general note about all these
options I'm only going to Ballpark where
all this tech cost somewhere between
fifty one hundred and sixty five hundred
dollars to get this car CNET style i'm
ballparking it because this car has the
most complicated configuration i've ever
seen in any car in all the years we've
been reviewing tech in cars it's
bewildering on their website you're
going to need the dealer to help you
through it or just buy what's on a lot
under hood of CT 200 is basically prius
stuff 1.8 liter inline-4 atkinson cycle
which is a lean-burn motor and then
coupled to that's an electric motor the
numbers are kind of funky 98 horsepower
on the engine 80 horsepower electric
motor but it sums to 134 horse it's not
totally additive 105 foot-pounds of
torque but that doesn't include the
electric motors various contributions
depending on drive mode and throttle
profile gets this 30 150 pound car 260
in the mid to high nine second range and
delivers 43 40 mpg one choice only on
the drivetrain it's an electronic CVT
gearbox with that little funky upside
down putter shifter front wheel drive
only and of course the drive mode
selector is the key tech feature it's
the thing I want to find out mostly on
this little quick drive is how does the
sport mode compared to the standard mode
or the eco mode so when I go to sport
here I get my tach I get my read gauges
now and we'll try a little acceleration
so I've been driving the car around
mostly in normal mode I think I'll
detect if it's significantly different
in a one two three sort of a launch here
yeah definitely a little more spine in
it when you get to the sport mode the
steering does tighten up a little the
ratio seems to change or the weighting
changes at least as electric power
steering in this car
at no point does it make a very
interesting sound
it's the hybrid it's meant to be more
refined than it is growling
and that EC VT keeps the RPMs largely in
one range all the time but I think what
Lexus has done here is they put together
a car that has that Lexus quality with
the exception of that damn phone holder
and a lighter footprint it doesn't have
some of the bum bass that you associate
with Alexis being this sort of Mercedes
fighter but I could definitely learn to
light this car an awful lot again the
ergonomics in the cabin are one of my
favorite things second favorite thing is
the integration of the powertrain it's
very elegant and third thing is the
practicality of the body style it's a
small car but you can get enough in here
to make it an everyday sort of a hauler
for small runs for things okay the CT
doesn't seem that style is going to run
you in a 37 38 grand giving one of those
complicated option arrays you're gonna
pick that's not bad for a Lexus but a
lot of folks look at this and say that's
not what I have in mind as a Lexus it's
a compact car that's one challenge
they've got to figure out the bigger
issue though is Americans have yet to
find a place in their head for the
concept of a premium compact it's gonna
have to be a matter of time before this
car and others like it make a slot for
itself
