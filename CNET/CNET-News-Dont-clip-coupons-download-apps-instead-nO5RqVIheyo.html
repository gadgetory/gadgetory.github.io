grocery coupons that alvera Gomez
painstakingly clipped on a weekly basis
I was spending way too much time
organizing my coupons and purging
expired coupons and then I just kind of
gave up because her busy family of five
could use the savings gomez put down her
scissors and picked up her smartphone to
try ibotta
a new app that earns users cash for
buying everyday products if it's
something is fun interactive and easy I
can and it's valuable to my shopping
experience then I will try it you can
add credit to your account by watching
videos taking polls and so forth and
then you go purchase the products in the
store you take a picture of your receipt
actually using your phone and based on
the information on the receipt we
immediately send you cash to your
account
there are several dozen coupon apps
already on the market snip snap
RetailMeNot and coupon cabin to name a
few but unlike the others ibotta rewards
users with real money and not points or
credit and as adding a gamification
feature in the coming weeks based on
exactly which products you buy and where
you shop you unlock certain games or
bonuses and these are like challenges
once you complete them you earn more
cash in three months gomez has earned
fifty three bucks and says I bada is
here to stay for its convenience because
I can forget my coupons but I'll never
forget my cell phone since I bought as
launched six months ago they've credited
users with more than 1 million dollars
in earnings that money can go into a
PayPal account or directly donated to
one of a hundred and thirty thousand
schools or to the United Way in San
Francisco I'm Kara Tsuboi cnet.com for
