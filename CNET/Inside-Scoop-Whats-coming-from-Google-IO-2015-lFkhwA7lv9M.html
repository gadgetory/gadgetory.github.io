Lexus avedis from cnet and today rich
neova staff reporter from CNN news and I
going to be discussing google i/o the
big Google Developers Conference kicking
off on Thursday now rich what are the
big things were expecting from the
keynote so Google likes to use this
event to talk about updates for Android
which is its mobile operating system we
had google android l last year which is
lollipop and now MVC and so are there
any going to be any sort of big
announcements obviously the design and
the look in the field is probably going
to say consistent but what else are we
expecting in terms of features we're
expecting some new mobile payment things
a couple months ago the the android
chief said that they would be doing
something with something called android
pay and they're expected to talk about
that more obviously the Apple watch has
been a huge release this year and
wearables are the hot topics on
everybody's risks i should say now what
are we expecting from google in terms of
wearables can we see Android wear
updates anything like that possibly
google introduced a new or they
announced a new update to android wear a
few a few weeks ago where they would let
you you hook up the watch to light Wi-Fi
so it means that you don't have to have
your phone around all the time when
you're using it they may be talking
about other things are you referring to
blow your socks off because i see that's
a tagline for wearables now what are we
going to see there do you think right so
they're being really mum about that
whatever it is it'll be from their kind
of experimental forward-thinking group
and that groups been responsible for a
whole bunch of things included a virtual
reality push from google now cardboard
was something that we saw a lot of last
year are we expecting to see anything
new and exciting from that this year
they've actually been making a push
there they've had job listings for
people to grow the team they talked
about this project with Mattel where
they remade the the viewmaster now smart
home and associated technologies have
been on everyone's lips over the past
couple of months now what is Google
doing in this space that we can expect
to see announced at i/o Google is trying
to make
this smart home platform that will
connect everything around your house it
will rich thanks so much for your
insight and make sure to check out the
rest of Senate coverage / google i/o
starting with our live show at nine a.m.
