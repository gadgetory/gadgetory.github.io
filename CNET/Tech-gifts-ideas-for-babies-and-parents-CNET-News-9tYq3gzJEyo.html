regular changing pad but it does a lot
more it's a smart scale that helps
parents keep track of baby's growth and
feeding patterns the hatch connects to a
mobile app that records baby's weight
while he's on the changing pad and keeps
a daily log nursing moms can also use it
to determine how much baby is eating by
weighing before and after a meal and
once baby's ready for solids the BAE
Abba baby cook makes for an easy
transition it's part steamer and part
food processor so parents can make
healthy baby food in half the time and
with half the mess put the right
ingredients into the basket and steam
once it's done dump the food and blend
you'll have a fresh meal in 15 minutes
babies and sleep don't often mix but
this bassinet may help baby and parent
get a bit more shut-eye
this new has a built-in sound machine
and rocking motors that lull your baby
to sleep but thus new won't even turn on
unless the baby is safely swaddled and
clipped in when baby starts to cry the
microphone signals the snoot to
intensify the rocking motion and changed
to a more soothing white noise the
outlet gives parents even more peace of
mind during the night it's a cute baby
booty that tracks baby's heartbeat and
oxygen levels while he sleeps the outlet
connects to a base and an app to let
parents know how their baby's doing
green indicates the baby's doing well
but it will immediately turn red and
sound an alarm if baby's vitals drop and
