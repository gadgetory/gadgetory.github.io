the Apple bite for everything good and
bad inside the world of Apple there's
plenty of stuff to talk about but let's
get you all caught up with some of the
latest iPhone news first now we've been
hearing reports that the total number of
expected iPhone 10 units has been
decreasing for its launch because of the
difficulty of manufacturing its complex
true depth camera but the latest report
from digit Times says the iPhone 10 is
on schedule to meet the 2017 production
demand which is different from the
actual consumer demand now reports even
say Foxconn has started shipping its
first finished iPhone 10 units but don't
be fooled this might be the hardest
iPhone to get on launch day even if you
preorder on the 27th which is about a
week away now KGI Security's minke quote
says all of the phones Apple plans to
produce now in 2018 are likely to
abandon the touch ID sensor in favor of
facial recognition Kuo was also the
first one who reported that it would
take two to three years for Android to
match the camera for Apple's face ID
that's right Android will still be
trailing on an emojis now he predicted
all upcoming 2018 phones will feature
the minimal bezel design of the 10 and
we will no longer see any new models
with the iPhone 8 and a Plus design
we've also seen patent applications for
this and according to the investor Apple
is mulling over the idea of launching an
iPhone with a stylus who wants a stylus
you have to get them and put them away
and you lose him yuck nobody wants a
stylus yeah it looks like Apple does now
the report says it would be a new
iteration of the Apple pencil obviously
and the report says Apple has been
recently working on a new iPhone that
comes with a digital pen with the target
launch of 2019 no and if we look even
further down the road the investor is
also reporting that Apple is working
with LG to develop an iPhone with a
foldable display Apple is said to be
working with LG so Samsung can't get a
hold of their sensitive tech we've seen
foldable displays at the Consumer
Electronics Show and rumors about a
foldable Apple phone have gone as far
back as December of 2016 so this isn't a
surprise but guess what it's happening
you know what's also happening on your
iPhone the nude app touted as the
sexiest app ever now check this out the
app automatically scans your iPhone for
nudes moving them to a protected vault
in the app and then deleting them from
both your camera roll and iCloud like I
don't have any nudes on my phone but I
wanted to do some more research on this
for you now the app uses Apple's core ml
framework M L stands for machine
learning so the images stay on your
phone they're never moved to any server
and the machine learning image
recognition can happen on the device so
how does it actually learn it scrapes
naughty sites now nude is a free
download from the App Store but requires
a $0.99 per month
in-app purchase let's see hey guys that
you got an extra buck right now or
anything oh thanks
alright let's take a break from the
studio with one of the best-looking
correspondence I've ever seen thanks
Brian that's really nice of you alright
guys and gals so check this out you know
it I travel all the time and normally I
just throw all my cords and cables and
accessories in my bag and it becomes
like janky tumbled mess and this is
called the bento stack and what makes it
different and unique so check this out
this is think of it as like a bento box
for your gadgets and devices and
accessories I'm gonna take off this
elastic of piece right here because
that's what keeps it together but it's a
stackable multiple compartmental
carrying organizer for your gadgets this
top here it can hold your Apple pencil
but I didn't even realize this guess
what boom I could stand my iPhone on it
like an iPhone so you have that but also
these different compartments you could
put in your chargers your cables these
are slidable and adjustable compartments
as well it just makes it easy to
organize one of the compartments also
has or these dividers it has a slot for
two Apple watch wrist straps which I do
rock so overall I just thought it was
something that surprised me it was
simple and then I'm like hey I'm gonna
look out for you all on the Apple byte
to try and hook you up so what they've
done is this case stackable case with
two compartments and two dividers
normally cost fifty dollars so if you go
to this link down there we've got an
Apple byte nation special for it it's
coming out soon sometime in December so
there you have it look you
these multiple compartments dividers I'm
just like stacking it back up making it
look fancy and you know what um before
we go nice haircut Brian thanks Brian
that's really nice of you to I'll write
in some more serious news you've
probably heard of the widespread crack
Wi-Fi bug that makes nearly all devices
Apple Android and really millions of
devices on a Wi-Fi network susceptible
to this wpa2 Wi-Fi standard exploit it
allows an attacker unauthorized access
to the network effectively opening up
the possibility of exposing credit card
information personal passwords messages
emails and practically any other data on
your device sounds like fun now Apple
says they've already patched the
vulnerabilities and the exploits have
been addressed in the current iOS TV OS
watch OS and Mac OS betas that are
available for developers and will be
rolling out to consumers soon lucky for
our good friend Mac O's High Sierra
you're safe and in the Apple management
quote of the week
Apple's Eddy Cue senior VP of Internet
services and software was interviewed by
Indian outlet live mint and when asked
about how some critics believe Apple's
pace of innovation has slowed over the
past decade here's what he said no way
first of all the iPhone is ten years old
that is the last decade the iPad came
after that and the watch came after that
so I disagree vehemently with that and I
think we've been incredibly innovative
that doesn't even take into account the
work that has been done on the Mac iOS
and Mac OS from that standpoint where I
think we've led the market now when you
think of the products that we've built
over time you own a lot of them and you
just assume that every year was a new
product but it wasn't you can't do
revolutionary new products every two
months or six months or whatever they
take time you tell him Eddie but what
was Eddy Cue supposed to say yes we have
slowed down now look the iPhone and iPad
were s J's babies and was the Apple
watch really innovative I mean I love
the Series three but I'll just leave it
at that right there and since everyone
has an opinion and we like to share them
let us know in the comments and I will
definitely read ones next week that
don't call me a ladyboy and speaking of
innovation this is a perfect time to
wish the Mac Mini a happy third birthday
that's right the current Mac Mini is
three years old since the last time they
updated it yeah you know that was coming
that's a bad apple so here's to 2018 all
right let's talk our NBA 2k 18 winners
from last week the NBA season is here
and I am pumped
even if my Golden State Warriors lost
the first game of the season but you
know what I think we'll have a real
chance at the title if we just get a few
more pieces now the correct answer for
last week's show for what we dropped on
a home pod was an emoji boo-boo so
congrats go out to my Twitter winners
michael LED good peter ponte jr and
smallwood oh nine one eight and over
email Steven Estrada Mickey Shi and
Miles Kane who said hey Tong I know
you'd be putting that poo poo emoji all
over that home pod just like you poopoo
on them haters that's right I do do but
there were so many of you who just
responded on the youtube comment section
when I asked you to tweet me or email me
and then a lot of you didn't even tell
me which version you wanted you have to
listen people we all have to listen to
each other yeah I just went deep all
right that's gonna do it for this week's
show you can email us at the Apple bye
to see Netcom
or tweet me at Brian Tong thanks so much
for watching we'll catch y'all next time
for another bite of the Apple
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
