eyes gradually weaken just like other
muscles what if we could improve our
eyesight to the point of not needing
glasses by exercising our eyes that's
the aim of a handful of mobile apps like
glasses off and Ulta mice that present
games and exercises to retrain the way
the brain interprets images we can
potentially improve the image processing
unit in our brain to do a much better
interpretation of whatever visual image
coming in from the eyes glasses off is a
free download but access to the program
cost $60 shy Novik claims when the app
is used correctly 90% of users will no
longer need to wear their reading
glasses play the game three times a week
15 minutes each time for approximately
three months and then you reach in most
cases the status of glasses off you
don't you're really independent of
reading glasses at that point in time
you are I have the option to move to the
maintenance stage medical experts say
there is some validity in these claims
as the brain can be continually improved
with practice I think that's what these
apps really are talking about is is not
so much improving the eye but improving
the brain because the brain is actually
as are more important than the eye in
terms of developing high levels of
visual function at Stanford University
researchers have developed their own
vision related app called sight book it
offers a series of vision tests a
patient can do at home in order to help
diagnose problems this is going to be in
very much the way that we all have a lot
of our care rendered in the future and I
don't mean 20 years from now I mean in
the next year or two or three or five
years giving us yet another reason to
keep looking at our screens in San
Francisco I'm Kara Tsuboi cnet.com for
