but there are times where no matter how
many times you have press that shutter
button it just can't focus on your
subject for those times manual focus is
the best option it is a little
intimidating at first and it will take
you some getting used to but once you
get the hang of it you'll have much more
control over your photos say you're
shooting a small object up close this is
one of those times when auto focus
especially on an introductory lens can
have a hard time finding your subject
first flip your lens to manual focus
mode then find your focus ring which is
different from your zoom ring this is
what you'll use to focus in on your
subject some advanced or studio
photographers will actually use careful
measurements to focus on their subjects
but when you're out and about you'll
need to eyeball it once you're in manual
focus mode turn the ring until your
subject comes into focus but before you
snap the photo check the focus by using
your camera's magnifying tool while
you're in Live View mode press it to
zoom check your focus and tap it again
to exit back to the regular view when
your subject is in focus hold steady
and hit the shutter besides close-ups
there are a few other occasions where
manual focus is the better option for
instance if you're trying to shoot a
subject in a busy scene or one with lots
of similar objects the camera might have
a hard time identifying exactly which
one you're trying to shoot so use manual
focus another common one is low-light if
your lens has a smaller aperture it's
going to be difficult to autofocus in
dimly lit scenes so switch to manual
focus and be sure to hold the camera
really study when you get your shot
finally if you're shooting landscape
autofocus will often find something in
the foreground leaving the rest of the
scenery blurred
in this case focus on something far in
the distance while you're in autofocus
mode then lock that focus by switching
to manual before snapping your photo
focusing manually might take you a
little bit longer at first but once you
get the hang of it you'll master it in
