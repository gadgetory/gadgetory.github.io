tablet market with a 7-inch device that
looks nearly identical to the company's
Galaxy Tab plus but costs half as much I
definitely want to see what's inside
this tablet I'm Bill Detweiler
head technology editor at C net sister
site tech Republic and I'm going to
crack open the Galaxy Tab 2 7.0
thankfully Samsung didn't use any hidden
or tamper resistant case screws on this
tablet to open the device you just pop
off the back cover now I use the thin
metal tool to start the process and then
switch to a plastic spudger as I worked
my way around the case once inside the
case I found an incredibly clean
Hardware layout in fact it's one of the
best internal tablet designs I've seen
there's a single circuit board each
component is attached to the main PCB
with a snap-on connector and with the
exception of the display nothing is held
in place with adhesive in fact my only
complaint about the devices construction
is that the display isn't easily
separated from the frame now let's take
a closer look at some of the internal
hardware like the Galaxy Tab plus the
tab 27.0 has a four thousand milliamp
hour battery two speakers an IR blaster
and a seven-inch PLS display with a
resolution of 1024 by 600 this isn't the
highest resolution display among 7-inch
tablets but it is the same resolution as
the Kindle Fires display Samsung
replaced the pluses 2 megapixel
front-facing camera with a VGA one but
the 3 megapixel rear camera remains just
without the LED flash now as for the
tablets engine Samsung used a Texas
Instruments 1 gigahertz dual-core 4430
OMAP application processor which is
mounted underneath the units 1 gig ram
chip this is a step down from the Galaxy
Tab plusses 1.2 gigahertz Samsung Exynos
4210 processor but as with the display
this chip is also used in the Kindle
Fire
rounding out the tab 27.0 other chips
are an 8 gig samsung emmc memory module
wolfson WM 18 11 audio codec and
Broadcom PCM 4330 wireless transceiver
so how does the Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 stack
up against other 7-inch tablets like the
Galaxy Tab + and Amazon Kindle Fire well
as Eric Franklin pointed out in his CNET
review this tablet offers an excellent
value and a full Android 4.0 experience
that no other tablet can currently match
for the price at 249 the Tab 2 7.0 is
$50 more than the Kindle Fire
but the Samsung device lets you expand
the memory to 32 gigs using a microSD
card and it can function as a TV remote
on the other hand the fire puts the
power of Amazon's online store in the
palm of your hand
comparing the tablet to other 7-inch
devices is a bit trickier
does it have the processing power of the
Galaxy Tab plus well no but the user
experience is still good and a half the
price you get a lot of bang for your
buck to see more Galaxy Tab 2 7.0
