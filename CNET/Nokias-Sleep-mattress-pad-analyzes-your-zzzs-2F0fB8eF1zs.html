here at CES 2018 is sleep devices and
specifically we're here looking at the
nokia sleep it is a $99 device it's
available for pre-order now but will be
sold at the end of this quarter so
sometime in early spring or late winter
it is a smart sleep pad that basically
goes under your mattress and you get two
for you and your partner you put one
under your side of the bed one under
their side of the bed above the
boxspring but under the mattress
and it's designed to track breathing
rate heart rate and restfulness or
restlessness how much you're getting in
and out of the bed and at the end of
each day week and month you'll get a
sleep score and an update on trends on
how while you're sleeping as well as
recommendations on how you can actually
improve your sleep one of the really
neat things is that this also integrates
with IFFT so basically you can set up
your own custom trigger so you can say
if I get out of bed then turn on my
Philips you LEDs or some other
integrated light that I have in my home
adjust the thermostat or any other crazy
thing you want which is a really cool
integration it also will work with
Amazon Alexa so you can do
voice-activated commands you can say
Alexa how did I sleep last night and in
theory should be able to tell you thanks
for watching this guys it's a really
cool thing to see all this new sleep tag
that's happening here at sea
20:18 and this is a look at the nokia
sleep</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
