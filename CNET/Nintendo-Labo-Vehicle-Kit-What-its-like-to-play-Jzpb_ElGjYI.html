to tinker with this is toy con 3 the
vehicle kit it's coming out September
but we got an early preview to check it
out and I'm excited popping out pieces
I'm a newbie to the lab Oh
build-it-yourself world of cardboard
accessories for the Nintendo switch but
it was pretty easy to jump in and start
building in under 10 minutes I figured
out how to fold together the parts for
my vehicle key which holds a joy con
controller but if you do the whole set
you're gonna be spending hours building
a complex steering wheel with multiple
levers and knobs a foot pedal joystick
and whatever this is it's designed to be
used for the included game insert the
key and different cardboard contraptions
and you switch from car to plane to
submarine and complete missions in this
open world adventure you also build a
cardboard spray paint can to give your
vehicle a custom design there are even
stencils you hold up that use the
controller's infrared camera the spray
can actually sounds like it's break-in
when you shake it so what about gameplay
the open adventure world has various
little quests filled with goofy Nintendo
humor things get more entertaining when
a friend jumps into the mix if you have
extra joique on controllers one person
can steer while another shoots off
weapons forcing you to work like a team
we only got to really play for about
thirty minutes it all flew by so fast so
it's hard to get a sense of depth to the
quests there seem to be plenty of
missions but I can tell you what I loved
the most the punching cars weight fight
the computer or find another friend with
a LeBeau wheel and jump into battle mode
there was a Super Smash Brothers vibe to
it I was pulling cardboard levers to
have these giant fists fly from my car
knocking the other guy out of the arena
while try to grab power-ups this was a
real party game treat but what if I
don't have a friend with our own vehicle
kit wheel and pedal Nintendo opened up
the possibility that you can make your
own extra card war controllers using
household objects the toy con garage
section encourages users to tinker and
make their own creations take for
example another side game four players
can race slot cars using foot pedal
controls you do not want to buy for lab
oak it's to get all your friends a
cardboard pedal so instead just follow
the included instructions on building
extra pedals using a binder and some
kitchen sponges I love to pleasantly
surprised that how silly it all was I
love crafts racing weird humor this was
my jam the vehicle kit is available
September 14th priced at $70 but I
wonder how long all the construction
tinkering and gameplay would keep me
entertained and I would love to see
other racing games be programmed to work
with this steering system so it doesn't
become useless when you beat the main
adventure game Nintendo you left me
curious and wanting more</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
