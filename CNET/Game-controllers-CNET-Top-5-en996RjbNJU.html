are all the rage these days but a
touchscreen is no replacement for the
bond between a man or woman and a game
controller I'm Donald Bell and in this
scene at top five we're paying respect
to the all-time greatest console game
controllers starting off at number five
the Atari 2600 joystick this guy's a
classic had its limitations and it kind
of looked like it was carved from a
piece of Darth Vader but because
absolutely anybody could use it this
controller assured in the first wave of
mainstream console gaming in many ways
mobile games have brought us back to the
Ataris one-button philosophy at number
four the Super Nintendo Entertainment
System sure the original NES controller
was more iconic but it was the SNES that
got us used to the four button design
used on all major consoles today more
importantly and introduced us to the
idea of shoulder buttons opening up a
whole new vocabulary for button
combinations and giving the 90's youth a
way to play Street Fighter 2 from the
comfort of their home number 3 is a bit
controversial the scene that UK piece.i
originally based this list on gave the
number 3 slot to the Nintendo 64
controller but our scene that gaming
expert is Dan Ackerman Scott Stein and
Jeff Bakalar threatened to stop talking
to me if I didn't give this one over to
the Sega Dreamcast this design laid the
groundwork for the Xbox 360 controller
and it had a unique expansion port that
could be used with a tiny screen for
extra content
it was way ahead of its time and that's
why it's on the list at number 2 and
this was a hard choice the PlayStation
DualShock in all of its forms here was
the first controller to include built-in
haptic feedback debuted in 1997 and Sony
is still essentially using the same
design today it ranks right up there
with the Walkman in terms of some of
these legacy for industrial design now
before we get to our number one pick
let's take a minute to acknowledge some
of the worst game controllers ever made
there was the boulder that Atari made
for the Jaguar the Intellivision thing
that looked like a phone but the most
worthless controller and one of the most
heartless scams perpetrated onto the
children of the 80s was the Nintendo
Power glove
it looks so cool but it was so so bad
and now the number one game controller
as confirmed by popular vote on top 5c
Netcom it's the Xbox 360 controller now
unlike Sony Microsoft had to go through
a few revisions before they nailed it
but they deliver built-in wireless
control a year before the PlayStation
and because the Xbox has carried so many
blockbuster games this thing just feels
like the embodiment of a great gaming
experience now if you want to
