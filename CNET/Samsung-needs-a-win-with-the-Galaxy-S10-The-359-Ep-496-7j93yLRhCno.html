Jeff Bakalar Samsung is feeling the heat
from Huawei which is developing better
and better phones that means Samsung
needs to come up with something good for
it's expected Galaxy S 10 early next
year
seeing that phone and reviewer Jessica
dull Court has a rumor roundup about the
s10 so let's run through some of the
weirder ones okay six cameras that's
five too many
wait a minute most phones have two pixel
my pixel has one and it's just fine hold
on hold on six cameras four in the back
and two in the front great I just I
understand why that's needed and for HDR
and for like I read something that like
oh it might take different angular
options at once and you'll be able to
choose or maybe hot-swap someone's face
in real time like okay come on what are
we doing these are not really gonna get
people to buy more phones I don't know
if you could ship Photoshop on the fly
and superimpose on the fly is that a
selling point I mean I don't know it was
so maybe this will be as well you're
absolutely right
okay okay next one so instead of a
knotch apparently it's gonna have like a
like a pinhole for the front-facing
camera so that's gonna be like a little
dot on the side yeah for the camera it's
a it's a chad i that's actually the one
thing i think is really cool
I don't like notches I think they're
dumb I realized why they exist but if
they could fit the technology into
something where the obstruction is just
a tiny sort of hole punch in the front
of the screen I think that would look
really sharp and yeah now that I have
like a notch phone I can never go back
to something that you know impedes on
top yeah oh you don't like the knife I
don't like the notch on any phone but I
realize why it's there but like I said I
just would like something that's
completely getting with a little dot for
the camera I realized you need something
for a camera to be there yeah I mean I
don't even like the pinhole I kind of
feel like you should try to you want
somehow a camera to go through a screen
somehow yes
yes look that's not it's technology
you're right it's not completely out of
the realm possibility I endorse that
let's skip the whole punch go right to
the invisible camera I would say so so
speaking about in screen technology
potentially in in screen fingerprint
sensor well I hear though interesting I
hear their crap I got an insider friend
your friends on it's a guy that crap you
don't want them I mean even if the first
generation isn't that good I like this
idea I go back to the camera concept was
that just a simple sheet of glass that's
it that's how it should be you shouldn't
have to like fish around for a spot to
where you need to press your fingerprint
against I am all down for that if they
could incorporate those two big picture
big deal features I think the essence
got something going for it yeah I would
say so
the last one and I know we're running
out of time a bit here maybe there's
gonna be a virgin that's gonna have 5g
and because I have a high bitin in front
of me I'm gonna press it yes 5g phone
next year that deserves a high button oh
you'll have service in all of one city
I'm sorry all of one block in one city
cuz you think five g's gonna roll out
fast you don't know what you're talking
about
not only that but the first leg probably
the first year at least a 5g is gonna be
not that good you remember how 4G rolled
out how terrible it was I don't know it
was no I don't remember
I don't know kindergarten back then yeah
it was really bad okay and when you had
a 4G phone your battery lasts about
three and a half hours that's a good
point
all right so anyway next up wanted to
get to an interview that our own Apple
reporter Shara tip can had with apples
VP of Product Marketing he said he told
Shara the iPhone 10 R is selling great
better than the 10s and the 10s max
which okay that's good news I guess for
Apple but I can't help but read this
story and feel like there's there's this
like odd desperation that's not well
what are your impressions on that I
don't know I think like ever since they
talked about how they were gonna change
the way they talked about yeah sales
things have felt a little weird in the
room
that they're trying to hide something
right it seems like they're trying to
conceal something about it I don't know
I think it's more of them saying like oh
that doesn't accurately reflect how well
the company's doing I mean I feel like
it would reflect that right like you
guys sell stuff I mean like more
information to me feels like that's good
but anyway it's just forcing them that
somehow justified the fact that they're
selling these things well which I think
comes off a little strange sure either
way if you want to read more about these
stories check them out on CNET I'm Ben
Fox Ruben I'm Jeff Bakalar thanks for
listening we always I think we did a
great job I think it was the best
podcast we've ever done all right thanks
everybody for joining us for the
recording of the audio podcast you can
subscribe to that and take it along in
your pocket using the links below until
then we're gonna go ahead and take your
questions and comments from the chat
starting right off with one from our old
buddy Matthew dacher who says how
freakin expensive will the s-10 be the
mainstream phone vendors have lost me
with these outrageous prices yeah you're
totally right I switched over to Android
and I got an S aid what was it a year
ago
because it was way cheaper than the
iPhone and boy was I right because the
newest versions of the iPhone have been
really really expensive now granted I
got my wife an iPhone 10 which is now a
discontinued model through Verizon on
Black Friday for under $500 that's
pretty good that's a reasonable price
for a new phone especially for three
years that's not a new phone I mean it's
a brand new out of the box phone it's
not reflexive use right it is a year old
model and it is discontinued which is
why you got it cheaper but what
justification do I have for buying a
brand new absolutely new phone for this
year's model for twice the price no it's
not simply not worth it plus like when
you have an iPhone and again like I own
I have an Android I don't I I think
iPhones are fine I think when you get an
Android when you get an iPhone it's like
living in SF or New York there's just
like the cost of living is higher
you know I mean like you the things you
need to buy for it or more expensive
what for a knife yeah it just feels like
a more expensive product to own as
opposed to getting by with maybe a
cheaper Android maybe not a flagship
Android but like a cheaper one so there
might be a budget s10 which I think
would make - happier but also that
they're still like three versions of it
yes three versions one of them would be
that 5g version right also be a budget
model and also a plus model who the hell
are you buying a 5g phone when there's
no 5g it's literally bleeding edge
people that just want to tell people and
they have a fight and they want to fly
to want some 12 hours order where it
works and that's gonna be it's gonna be
somewhere and yes it's just like um it's
just like you know when when the TV's
come out like people who own 4k TVs and
watch nothing but like you know 720
cable on it I don't understand these
people I their light show it's just
insane you're filling up your rocket
ship with like you know unleaded it's
just it's it's crazy to me my hope is
that the budget phone stays well below a
thousand bucks yeah I really hope so
usually Samsung does the note more
expensive but my s phones they tend to
be a little bit more reasonable this is
another thing I mean is it really gonna
kill you to get an S 9 or like the like
an older model I don't know like maybe
maybe everybody wants to get the
absolute brand-new technology but
generally speaking you're gonna get a
much better deal if you buy a new phone
but it's a year old model or two years
old and I think we're at a point now
where phones are so good like anything
you buy is pretty pretty damn good
pretty good and they last long - I had
my original pixel for two years and it
was that's not even that long it's not
even that long usually I keep a phone
for like at least three years minimum
that's that's all let's I feel like
that's above real urge oh you know what
I mean like I put it in a velvet case
every night yeah I guess a good night
what you mean like those are important I
get it you know it's your baby you take
care of it I'll carry your phone my
point being you don't need to get a new
one every year
to feel that effect of like the brand
new thing like you can get a phone
that's one maybe two years old and still
feel like you have this new fast thing
yes especially when it comes to 5g I
mean this thing won't be out till March
right or so right yeah run February or
March so I don't know if I can't see 5g
like making a miraculous turnaround plus
who knows if this thing will even have
it yeah anyway great question - lets get
to some more well a lot of people are
still talking about 5g lost legacy Mario
chambers wondering if the upgrade is
going to be in time for this March
release you really well covered this but
I like syringe always follow up saying
5g drooler czar literally drooling for
red phone until last month where are
they now
silent mm-hmm 5g jewelers those are some
fighting word that is that's a tough
like word combination to say 5g jewelers
yeah yeah we could make out like a dr.
Seuss book about 5g drew lers drool
drooling like egg I don't got 5g in my
house I don't get 5g in my car I don't
get 5g on my roof I mean do you with it
I get some freaking secret either like
it is very is very public information
that 5g is not where it needs to be to
support it feels very clear to me that
this is a marketing ploy I would think
from Samsung to come out with something
this early to say we had one of the
first five drones or we had the first 5g
phone in the US or something like that
right just to plant their stake in the
ground sure it's just about as valuable
as being first in the comments on
YouTube
totally less so pays at least there's
posterity on YouTube comments right yeah
just remember to spell it right it's
first you think people do that a lot I
think people do that on purpose as to be
funny
white Frist yeah yes exclamation point
don't at me Jeff don't at me all right
here's one from Joseph asking if we
think that the actual upgrade from our
to the s10 from the s9 will be a
significant one enough to justify
actually paying that money we've talked
about like what the gaps are Jeff you're
saying you got at least two years out of
your last phone do we think that with
any of these rumored implementations on
the s10
that drop in the s9 this early on in
your experience with it would be
valuable enough to go to that s10 I
don't know I'm a I'm a cheapskate I I
think you should hold your phone for at
least two years aside if you're if
you're a power user I know there are a
lot of iPhone people out there that they
get the newest one every single year and
that makes them very happy I mean I
don't think that that's what every
consumer needs to do or should do
there's two sides to it you know one
it's a thing of whether or not money is
an issue for you personally I think like
a lot of people who do the
year-over-year upgrade wind up selling
their old one or whatever it is the the
the value for use phones in just a year
kind of stays pretty high yes you know
you can get your phone if you sell it on
eBay just don't sell it back to your
carrier because oh yeah unless unless
they're a good deal rare unless there's
a deal but yeah I mean like that is a
good point because yeah my wife yeah so
my wife is had an iPhone 6 for years
good for her so it has no value to sure
and just like oh that screen is cracked
yeah there is no money attached to it
whatsoever so what we purchased it for
four years ago guys mean that we've run
it into the ground though it has no
resale you you drove that 1989 Honda
Civic right into the ground that's right
four hundred and thirty thousand miles
on it it was on its last leg and you
just like why is it ever donated it to
charity all right fine eight hundred
cars for kids so yeah I think like for
most people the year-over-year upgrade
is kind of a silly thing again you can
do whatever the hell you want
it's don't more money it's your money
you ultimately have to make the decision
like I feel like I realized people want
advice and you you you heard it but it's
good you know whether or not you're
gonna do it right you're not gonna not
do it because we told ya I mean you know
what you're gonna do just be smart about
it is what we consider wow you're such a
good dad advice you know look I'm a dad
now so I got dad
that's great that advice personally I
think if you got any extra expendable
cash you should just go ahead and get a
Honda Civic yeah here's one from tech
slacker why is Samsung struggling so
much isn't the note nine the best
Android available I don't mean I don't
mean to give the impression that Samsung
is struggling they definitely they had a
real big problem with the note 7 right
that was a very dark time for them the
issue that I was the point that I was
making especially with that headline was
Huawei is now the number two phone maker
just below Samsung Samsung still number
one but Huawei is definitely nipping at
their heels and they're coming out with
better and better phones and that's why
Samsung needs a good phone it needs to
show up really well for this under no
circumstances do I want to present this
as Samsung is in crisis because that's
not the case if say if if I and I think
this is kind of unrelated for me I will
never buy a phone that's not a pixel
unless the Google could somehow work it
out with these third-party manufacturers
and offer a vanilla version of Android
on their phone that's the only reason I
stay away because I want the latest
update right away I want pure I want
vanilla oregan Android I don't want your
dumb ass overlay that has like Bixby or
whatever the f Samsung uses I don't know
what it is it's pointless it's worthless
they know it everyone knows it
right I enjoyed that soapbox but does
anybody like I bought my galaxy for
Bixby no nobody no one's ever said that
I think it's a long-term play for for
Samsung I get it like they want they
want to somehow like have a foot in the
door between and they were in Google
they want the data I mean look it
reminds me of Apple maps which came out
and was a hot mess I mean the greatest
navigational software in the history of
phones yes yes exactly that was leading
people into lakes and they yes but that
was a couple years ago after they rolled
it out they got a lot of data they fixed
the bugs there were a lot of bugs it has
improved is it as good as Google Maps no
it probably hurt you know not reuse it I
think a lot more people use it than you
think what I would who love Maps is
still the gold standard like what like I
would love to see what the with the what
the pie chart looks like for I don't I
don't have a say yeah I want to say the
sliver that's Apple Maps this is not
even a slice no I I don't actually know
I wish I had that context but I feel
like they've definitely improved it to
the whole not a mess let's get that data
on the screen I'll get verses Google
Maps I'll get right on that until then
take another question
Marcus Marcus tube 80 will the s10 have
the snapdragon 845 I don't know I don't
know I used to cover chips I don't cover
chips anymore I'm gonna punt on this one
yeah I'm actually going to punt as well
I'm actually going to turn around and
kick the ball through my own goalposts
on that okay this is a little I know
about chips now if that is the newest
chip from Qualcomm then great that
probably will go in the s10 because
usually Samsung gets the first bite and
that's also usually why they come out
with that phone in February or March
usually it's time for Mobile World
Congress it's this nice handshake that
they do with Qualcomm where Qualcomm is
like hey here's our latest and great rep
one guess what it's going in the you
know this phone from a major carrier but
unfortunately I apologize that it's not
an area that I look into nearly as much
as I used to yeah I don't yeah I have
really nothing to add besides snarky
stuff so I'm gonna just why you're here
right here
alright I'm still digging for this
information but I think I got something
I just want to make sure we validate it
before we move on to that so take
another question Ryan says isn't the dot
more annoying than the knotch though
he's disruptive to me I still hate the
notch though there there this goes on
Iowa Thatcher says I would prefer
bringing back the bezel instead of
getting rid of the notch I don't know
why I don't particularly like notches
but the pin hole in the screen would
make my OCD go crazy oh no I don't I
don't agree I think like if you look at
your phone and if you have a notch
already it like it's also about real
estate too right
like yeah pinhole will take up so much
less real estate if you if they put the
look we're talking Android anyway right
so you don't have to worry about it
being like this awful you know
unlockable Apple disaster if you just
build it into the software like where
you're where the time is on an Android
phone
just move the time like they could
program it to move the time over a half
a centimeter and you're done and then
your phone's perfect and everything's
perfect
like it's not you know what I mean like
yeah you kind of have a point there I'm
saying like it is so easy to do for
Android it is so easy for that to be a
thing you kind of have a point there
however and everything's really over
whoever commented and said it would
drive them crazy from an OCD perspective
god they're wrong you know I totally
disagree with you
it would really drive me at all I don't
want to show my screen cuz I got I got
nasty stuff on here but it's just you
just push everything over to the right a
couple millimeter okay stop looking at
porn while we're doing this a personal
working on when people see in my email
fair enough yeah enough yeah I mean if
it's any validation we're only running
at 1080p so a resolutions not good
enough to read your email anyway so it's
fair haha
fine it's fair what else we got well
let's go ahead and talk about the the
market share in this one so the first
thing I came across was this article
from Colton Mac that says Apple maps is
dominating Google in the UK if you look
post it's actually from 2014 so that's
only a coven Apple maps came out
aggressively stole a significant portion
of the market within only a couple of
years now but wasn't Google also not on
the app store for a very long time I
don't I don't recall that I don't know
hey that's super old and be it's the UK
no one has phones there nobody had
phones in the UK everybody knows that
the UK doesn't have smartphones I mean I
realize you know it's not your job Brian
I realize but like that's you know what
else we got so here's the more relevant
one that actually shows a little bit of
the market share and how its fluxed and
this is from 2017 and this is coming
from The Guardian showing another
British thing god forbid
whoa he's doing it on the fly I mean we
are in the US but nevertheless either
way we're actually seeing that there was
a chunk taken out of the Google Maps by
Apple maps right but Google still leads
overall it looks like people have
settled into their ecosystems and if
you're there you're there and if you're
not you're not and that's exactly right
that I think you are failing to consider
the fact that iOS is a very powerful
operating system it's like people don't
even know they're just like I'm Maps
this is Maps if that's the default
basically you open the email you open an
email click on your iPhone you click on
it and it opens up Apple Maps sure it
takes is a different it takes a certain
type of person maybe somebody that's a
little bit more sophisticated like their
technology change my default no not even
changed my default I'm gonna I'm gonna
copy this and then I'm gonna open Google
Maps and then I'm gonna put it in Google
man you do that and I do it all the time
no no and then iPhone can you yeah
change default apps you have to be able
to I mean I really it's like the most
lockdown OS on earth but you have I have
an iPhone for work and I don't believe
you can do that it's the way I could it
would make my life a lot easier I don't
necessarily know the the ins and outs of
all that but anyway if any of the
commenters know that question know the
answer there's no way apples always like
nope we're first there's no way I was
like a very Apple thing to do so maybe
Apple in like 2012 that's when it came
out I'm saying like Apple in 2018 maybe
they're a little more flex we're gonna
we're gonna try to do some more research
on the fly on that one all right what
else we got alright we're closing in on
the end here so let's just kind of see
how many we can fly through on the fly
our wallop wants us to throw back to the
in screen fingerprint reader seems like
a lot of tech reviewers had favorable
thoughts about using in screen
fingerprint reader I don't recall which
one you made the comment but he wants
you to expand on why you think they are
not working well cuz Lydon Lin review it
we we reviewed one yes there are some
early and she was like this is dog poop
she said she's like this is that's not a
direct quote
she did someone said I I'm positive I
read her I don't know if it was like
what the hell is the one the one with
the in screen one that's out now like
I'll leave it one way Huawei Huawei mate
20 me to me yeah leave and she said it's
not great and it's also slow which is a
deal-breaker for me once you get used to
that rise me though of course first once
you get once you get used to the instant
unlocking with with fingerprint scan
tech I mean that's it
like I'm not saying it's not gonna get
there it will definitely get there it's
just not there yet so don't buy
something in my opinion that is a step
back from what's currently out there in
terms of experience just your I mean
what are you doing unless you're unless
you're willing to you know sacrifice
that you know best experience for having
you know the first two latest and
greatest stuff yeah I I really like the
idea for fingerprints on it totally that
so like pop although you know what like
I really love it on the back just going
like that I mean I'm just like Boop done
I have that on my ass eight right yeah
s82 and I don't love it I don't it's
uncomfortable for me and that's a very
personal subjective bird fingers maybe
that's what it is
got this little you've got those little
baby bird fingers I don't know I just
think it's not nearly it's accurate as I
wish it was I miss just being able to I
would for one I'd rather it be on the
front for two I would rather not have it
at all and just use keycode really you
can do that you know I know I was trying
to give it a fair shot and like after
I've had this phone five six months now
maybe and everything else is fine I just
don't love the fingerprint scan it
doesn't work right
we both have similar phones dude two
years old it's a year old okay yeah
sorry but it doesn't work great like if
I'm logging into an app and the finger
prints quick you saw that yeah yeah
mines it's I have to tab it like three
times for it to work which can be pretty
annoying that is annoying I the first
fingerprint one I had I think was a
Nexus 6p and that
was a subpar experience my opinion so I
that was really early on in that it was
so I abandoned it and then I just
started drawing little patterns to
unlock my phone hmm all right shout out
to the chat Ryan Williams does verify
that Google Maps was not available for a
little while was not years though
Timothy tells us that when you try to
uninstall Apple maps you get an error
I'm not surprised by that at all thanks
guys but we still don't know if you can
change the default map app then go try
do it now but I have to dig through
settings all right everybody just will
let you on tomorrow's 3:59 how this
shakes out this is what we call in the
business a cliffhanger all right so
let's talk about those cameras that
thing's gonna have way too many cameras
and way too many cooks undef
indefinitely fresh Shawn Kumar asks will
the s10 inevitably have 8k camera
support oh god I really hope not what
would the point of that be yeah I don't
know this is a k camera support I mean
you can't see an 8k there's no point and
why would you want it in your tiny
little screen anyway marketing marketing
ploy yet again a marketing ploy just to
say that we've got it just to get you to
spend more money you know I don't
actually like the fact that the Google
whoa is at Home Hub doesn't have a video
camera in it why because it's like video
chats with the display is a big reason
why you would have a smart display in
the first place I guess you're right
however they don't have the camera and
they actually like paid it forward to
the consumer and lowered the cost which
is beneficial so like if you're gonna
have 8 K if you're gonna have 6 cameras
you think they're not gonna charge you
for that stuff and it's all these
additions they like not really necessary
but it causes you to spend more money on
this stuff yeah the whole resolution
porn just drives me crazy like how
people get these overly capable pieces
of hardware and then don't take
advantage of it it's more just like I
got this trim line of this car just to
say I have it but I don't drive the
thing since that is how a lot of stuff
works right now it's just awesome
Tech slacker says you cannot change the
full apps on the iOS but you can choose
to open files with another app like a
document so there's that's what that
sounds like that's a that's a confirmed
right that you cannot switch a well you
said you gotta cheat the system you
gotta cheat the system whoa this is a we
play by the book here this is a hot take
show this is we can't detour ourselves
yeah
no no oh good pun to we're talking about
maps you got it nice all right let's
take one kind of off in the left-field
here from sir enjoy do you see a
positive effect of Samsung's 1ui program
in the Android Market rolling into 2019
I don't know that sure oh god what is
one UI I remember we wrote about this to
me if from what I recall about one UI it
was a lot of promises about them really
streamlining their user experience and
their operating systems problem is their
version of Android overlaid version
consistent across all brands yeah and
they're gonna and they're gonna make
improvements to if I remember like
messages and the clock app and the
problem is is that it's it's hard to
really believe Samsung because they have
so much bloatware and they have so much
stuff that kind of gets in the way
question sorry to interrupt a question
you're telling me that the note 10th
word of that note 10 I guess the 9 all
right whatever run 9 now the note 9s
Android is different than the s nines
Android no it's the same so then what's
what are we talking about
so one UI is generally like it's it's
the way that they presented it and
syringe oi probably remembers us a
little bit better than I do is this is
this is we're doing an overhaul on the
way that we have the user experience
we're trying to make it much more like
understandable for users much more
simplified cuz I remember when I
switched to a Samsung phone there were
like 15 different ways to do all sorts
of stuff okay and so like hey we're just
gonna make it a little bit easier to do
we're gonna also like just improve some
of the basic apps like the clock app to
have you be able to do more stuff that
you want to do with it so
okay it sounds like very positive
promises the entire pitch sounds like
this is exactly we won you guys to be
saying but I would love to see the
actual execution of this and that's
where I'm a little more skeptical okay
all right well there you have it
yeah all right we're at the end of the
line here so let's just talk real quick
about what the future implementations
are going to be to actually make phones
worthwhile I like this comment from Tim
he says I think cell phones have reached
a plateau with design hardware design is
something that's somewhat overdone
software's where they need to aim
google has call screen and nitesite
that's amazing
Akmal says people want folding phone
right now
bingo that's way more valuable than
resolution or about ton of cameras and
even modularity could potentially be
something on the horizon I know they've
kind of shot at that and failed in the
past but these are the things that are
actually gonna make phones exciting
again I don't care about your friggin
emojis I don't care about your giant
cameras that do the bouquet effect I can
do that too I'm with these guys I'd
rather see something actually innovative
and interesting that bring a new use
case to to the form factor like all
those voce there was a lot of modular
stuff in a meaningful way it just
doesn't make sense well yeah I'd rather
stand try at that than just shoving more
cameras under the hood I mean you know I
don't know unless there is some
earth-shattering benefit from all of
these additional cameras which I feel
like I still have yet to be really
convinced the coolest thing I saw was
like what some someone showed me like a
facebook 3d photo I thought that was
like marginally cool like on a scale of
1 to 10 that's like a 3 doing the cool
cool but where does it become valuable
ya know doesn't it does not become
valuable that's the guy I just think
like you're gonna see the biggest
innovations in software and that's
really kind of it I'm gonna disagree
with you again good did the foldable is
I don't want that look what do you need
a foldable phone it could end up being a
gimmick well why do you need it because
the idea would be that you would only
have one device that would be both a
phone and a tablet for you if
you want a bigger screen to actually get
more work done how you what is my thing
my thing like if it's this thick folded
sure I think they might eventually get
to that the early designs oh we not
years for this stuff that being said
this is the first major new innovation
and again this is coming from Samsung
and it's expected next year it's a first
major new innovation on the hardware
side that's really gonna get a lot of
the stuff out of our like a lot of us
out of our funk about all these phones
they all look the same they all do the
same stuff all they're doing is I've got
cameras that being said again it might
just end up being a gimmick it might not
be utilized properly from a software
perspective and I would also argue
people need to be patient with it
because the first generation it's
probably gonna be crappy you know I'd
you know if they see enough value in it
they're probably gonna come out with
more I would expect same something to
come out with more regardless I'll admit
I am intrigued by the notion of a
foldable phone but it is going to be a
very fine line for pass/fail for me
because if it's if it is significantly
thicker than this which is as thick as I
will go these days believe me I will not
support it until it gets thinner well I
think we got a peak at first we've got a
peak here at the the folding phone and
granite this is just a prototype but it
doesn't look too bad I think we've seen
what the silhouetted oh nice that was
the best Gameboy they ever made that
gameboy was the shiz what did you have
an SP no I did not you definitely had
one Brian no I had og Gameboy and it
stayed alive until about four years ago
wait wow you had the you had that's was
your Gameboy yeah first edition
so you didn't play as twenty more
advanced friends had him I would borrow
them and play them but mine kept running
so I stayed with that D s 3ds never
owned one interesting okay guys were we
are out of time I actually have
something else to do soon yeah these
were great questions before we go just a
PSA we're
everyone that tomorrow is international
computer security day began in 1988 it
serves as a reminder to protect a
computer and information run antivirus
spyware and malware scans update your
passwords and encrypt your backups to
the cloud
tell us how you celebrate computer
security day and then go ahead and take
us on out of here alright and that's a
wrap for the week that 3:59 is available
on itunes tune in stitch or Feedburner
google play music google podcast the
amazon echo and of course cnet.com Jeff
a pleasure you're a gentleman and trap
me and Taylor I love doing this okay and
we'll we'll see you again on Monday five
