Sony is selling a new suit PlayStation 4
called the ps4 Pro on November 11th for
$400 it's got a 1 terabyte hard drive
inside and also better hardware so you
might be asking yourself why do this
well on paper the ps4 pro should be able
to display a higher resolution better
frame rates improve performance and
better textures but which of these
enhancements again gets depends on the
developer because the downloadable patch
is required in order for games to
support it and we were only able to test
a few games side-by-side on identical 4k
OLED TVs to see if we could notice a
significant difference between standard
and ps4 pro updated games for the most
part it was really difficult to tell the
last of us remastered barely looked any
different though we did see better frame
rates and crisper visuals when we
compared two versions of shadow of
mordor for black ops 3 which is another
game available before launch there was
absolutely nothing that stood out as
enhanced now this is side by side we had
a really good setup for that the most
dramatic difference is really when you
activate HDR in a game because it can
really make the contrast and brightness
and the variances and color pop they
really jump at it off the screen I think
that's gonna be the most noticeable
difference for most people at launch ps4
pro will have 30 or so games with
patches and 45 by the end of 2016
game sold with pro enhancements have a
little badge on their box that says ps4
Pro enhanced so we're very eager to see
how well all of these games will perform
moving forward then of course there's
psvr
PlayStation 4 Pro is fully compatible so
don't worry about anything like that but
a ps4 game needs a patch to support
better performance at the pro can offer
at review time we were only able to test
out one game and that was battlezone
which did seem to improve the overall
fidelity but it really wasn't as much as
I was hoping it would do okay so real
world stuff should you actually go out
and buy a Playstation 4 Pro if you
already own a Playstation 4 probably not
we just haven't seen enough compelling
mind-blowing enhancements in performance
to warrant a purchase now if you don't
have a ps4 yet this is likely the one to
get but it's still tough to recommend
against getting an original PlayStation
4 because it's only three hundred
dollars and it can likely be bundled
with a game for free now if you already
have a 4k HDR TV or plan to get one in
the near future that extra hundred
dollars you're gonna spend on the pro is
probably worth it making it a much
easier pill to swallow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
