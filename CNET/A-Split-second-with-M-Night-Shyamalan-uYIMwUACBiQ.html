are you
and I went on too long awful things to
people and he'll do awful things to you
why did I choose to split so split was
actually a story from a while ago that
I've been wanting to make and this last
couple of movies have been making kind
of smaller kind of funny / scary movies
and this tone of like dark humor is
something that I find really really
provocative right now and I it's
something that I'm interested in doing
and this idea really lends itself to
that okay and Anya I mean your character
doesn't really have a lot of fun was it
a kind of a fun experience for you I
mean it was amazing I was learning so
much every day you know working with
James in such close proximity it's
really like an acting masterclass
because he's just bouncing around from
so many different things working with
night is unbelievable um very specific
demands excellence which I really thrive
in like I love that environment but um
ya know we had to have a good time
because it's a dark film otherwise you
wouldn't really want to go to work
alright so this is a film about you know
a mental health issue were you concerned
about betraying mental health we worried
that maybe there's some suggestions that
this kind of story might stigmatize
mental health how did you approach that
yeah I mean you know it's by the end of
the movie you you feel great empathy or
for him every single human being that's
watching it is rooting I know it's
strange I don't give anything away right
but it's breaking with convention and
taking darkness and talking about
humanity and complexity and talking
about trauma and what I'm making a
mainstream movie about trauma I you know
I love to imbue these kind of ride
movies with real real drama real real
conversations about life and you come
away with great empathy for those
individuals and it's strangely you're
kind of you know conflicted and inspired
at the end okay
and speaking of real things I mean you
both have in terms of your background -
born in you're obviously I believe
you've lived in Argentina and all around
the world and looking at sort of this is
a story about someone who has divided
personalities within themselves looking
at the world do you see the sort of
bitter division and
are you concerned about the kind of
division that we're seeing so the
political cultural social landscape that
we're seeing moment I you know I'm I'm a
super optimist and guys I feel like this
was an inevitable moment of having
everyone dealing with globalization this
is it's inevitable this conversation had
to have it have to happen this is a last
moment of can we have it back the way it
was and the answer to that is no you
can't um you know you you this is just
right here this is this is you're seeing
movies by an Indian and Argentinean
that's just the end life is not it's not
going to get Senegal back the way it was
like a week I don't want to say that
they're there that's bad and we're good
or anything like that I understand
there's a loss there's a loss of the way
it was and I can understand where
they're coming from but the reality is
that 20 years from now the world is
gonna be a very homogenized place and
you're gonna see everyone and everywhere</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
