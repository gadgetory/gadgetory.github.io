the Galaxy Note 8 we at CNET have had
some time with the Galaxy Note 8 so this
list is based on our first impressions
this could change after our full review
let's get to it
and number five is a parent Samsung's
Note phones usually get neat software
features ahead of its other phones with
a note 8 you get a fancy new
multitasking option called app pair if
you frequently use two apps together in
split-screen mode you can link them
together and open both with a single tap
seems like a great feature for power
users number four is the S Pen if your
person who wants to write on your screen
the note is the way to go like the note
7 the note 8 comes with a stylus that
features 4096 levels of pressure
sensitivity samsung also included the
ability to write on your note 8 without
having to unlock the device and number
three are the dual rear cameras the note
8 is the first Samsung phone with two
rear cameras surprising right anyway
both cameras have optical image
stabilization which should help the
capture clearer photos and smoother
video it also allows a note 8 to take
photos where the subject is in focus
while the background is not you even get
a 2 X optical zoom number two is it is
unlocked from the start
unlike other Samsung phones the Galaxy
Note 8 will be sold unlocked immediately
from its release normally if you wanted
the latest Samsung phone as soon as
possible you would wind up getting a
carrier lock model with an unlock Note 8
you can pick up the phone and hop
carriers without any trouble that's a
pretty big bonus before we get to number
1 let's talk about the reasons not to
buy the Galaxy Note 8 it's not that
different than the s8 plus while the
note does have a slightly larger screen
with a slightly different design the
resolution is the same it does have more
RAM though the note 8 also has a smaller
battery than the s8 plus if you weren't
a fan of that rear fingerprint sensor
location on the s8 you might not want to
hear this the note 8 also has a rear
fingerprint sensor reach away and then
there's that price the full retail price
ranges from 930 dollars to 960 dollars
you can get an s8 plus were around $700
online let's get to number one and the
number one reason to buy a Galaxy Note 8
is you owned or wanted a Galaxy Note 7
the note 7 was really well liked by
reviewers and its users alike battery
issues for Samsung to recall the phone
but people did not want to give up their
note sevens Samsung let the public know
that it would give a discount on the
Galaxy Note 8 and they are standing by
that note 7 owners who go to Samsung
comm will get an instant trading value
of up to four hundred and twenty-five
dollars when they upgrade their current
phone for a note eight the note eight
should be everything the note 7 was
supposed to be - that fire problem a big
