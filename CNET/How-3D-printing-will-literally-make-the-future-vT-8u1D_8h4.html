probably think of this Star Trek chess
set or this dr. you transform or maybe
even 3d printed pizza forget that low
res noise over the last 5 years
resolutions have come up and the
printing has become so much more
sophisticated like now you can print
functional tools with moving parts and
get this there's now a 3d printer in
space aboard the International Space
Station's this means if something breaks
those astronauts don't have to wait for
a resupply shuttle that could take a
month to arrive they just print out a
replacement right there on the space
station or check this out
a guy made a near-perfect replica of a
sixth century Viking sword which means
visitors to the National Museum of Art
in Norway can touch and feel it without
damaging the very fragile original 3d
printing is well on the way to providing
cheaper construction to in China they're
making mansions and apartment buildings
and in Amsterdam they're building a real
working bridge and Medicine 3d printing
can help build prosthetic hands for kids
bone grafts that fit perfectly into your
sockets and delicate internal organs
that can either replace your own broken
parts or that can help a team of
surgeons figure out exactly how to
operate before going in for the real
deal and look at all these happy animals
we've achieved all this in less than
five years yeah it's pretty impressive I
guess but I'm holding my horses until
the European Space Agency gets around to
3d printing it's face on the moon yes
that's a real thing that's really
happening I'm telling you 3d printing is
already making the world around you
literally and I can't wait to see what
happens next
