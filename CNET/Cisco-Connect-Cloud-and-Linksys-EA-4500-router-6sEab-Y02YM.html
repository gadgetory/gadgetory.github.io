change some of youse home Network for
good and of course for better much
better seriously for the first time the
router is no longer what you think about
only when your network is down but
something you want to check on daily and
you can do that from anywhere on your
iPhone your new iPad or your new MacBook
Pro or in my case from on all three of
them at the same time just because I can
now the routers or routers in question
are those belonging to links is EA
series from Cisco such as this links is
EA for 500 right here now I pick this
one because this is the top tier and
nine headed router that offer two dual
man
with each band providing up to 450
megabit per second on the bike it has
four Gigabit LAN ports and one gigabit
WAN port they also a USB 2.0 port to
host printers or storage in my testing
this router here offer very good
performance and also very good range
what is new is the Cisco Connect cloud
that welllike just a few days ago as a
firmware that enabled the EA for 500 as
well as other support routers to offer a
lot more features and they can also be
managed via the internet using a web
interface or mobile apps for iOS and
Android devices now to do this you first
have to register an account with Cisco
Connect cloud which is very easy and
fast to do it's also free after that you
can use that account to manage multiple
routers or multiple home network status
for example here I have a two of them
one of them is CNET labs which is this
one right here and the other is a
gateway for my secret lair even I don't
know where it is as you can see I can
easily see between a two network without
having to log out and take a look this
iPad right here is actually connected to
the Internet using Verizon 4G LTE that
means I can do this no matter where I am
with there having to be at home at the
local network
now the Cisco Connect Klauss interface
has two parts the rural settings and the
embedded apps
the router setting part include all the
basic setting commonly found in routers
such as local at work setting firewall
wireless network port forwarding and so
are embedded apps a special feature of
the Linksys router now the big is also
the most common feature foul among EAC
rear errors is something called media
parties ation this allow for up to three
devices and/or web services to be put on
the high priority list you can easily
move a device or service on or off this
list those on the list will have the
Internet bandwidth before the rest of
the connected devices and the same goes
for parental control feature see how you
can enable this and pick what type of
restriction easily again you can do that
even when you are not at home the Cisco
Connect cloud enables third parties to
develop app for your home network for
example here I have the block the bestop
apps from fresh consulting using this f1
login with the Cisco Connect account I
can quickly turn on the web filtering of
the home network there are three
filtering levels level 1 most can go
through never - not so much and at level
3 the Internet is basically useless from
my friend Eric Franklin now Cisco
Connect cloud is not perfect however
whelps in nothing is perfect but for
more on that and also the performance of
the links is EA for 500 check out the
full reviews etsy.com once again my name
is Domo and this has been the first look
at the Cisco Connect cloud and the links
is EA for 500 router</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
