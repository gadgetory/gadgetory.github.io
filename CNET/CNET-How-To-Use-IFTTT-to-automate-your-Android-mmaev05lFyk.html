I'm going to tell you how to get the
most out of the new if this then that at
for Android if this then that which goes
by IFFT helps you set up automatic
cause-and-effect commands using online
tools social networks and more basically
if this happens then do that other thing
for me my favorite example is if I get a
new email with an attachment then send
that attachment to Dropbox if tis now
available for Android and the app
includes a bunch of new features that
are specifically aimed automating your
phone I'm going to walk you through
three ifs recipes for your Android phone
using those new features first I'll use
if to mute my phone when I arrive at the
office so I'm going to open the app tap
the plus sign to create a new recipe and
I'll set my trigger by pressing that
plus sign scroll all the way over to the
Android location choice and select you
enter a new area then the little map
will populate with my location I can tap
to unlock it to move it around and
Center on the C net offices you might a
little bit if I want then hit next now
I'm going to select my action for this
recipe by tapping the red plus scrolling
all the way over to the Android device
tab and hit mute ringtone and now my
recipe is set all I have to do is hit
finish and I'm done now every time I get
to the office no one has to hear my
annoying ringtones next I'm going to set
up a recipe that sends a text message
response every time I miss a call from
any phone number so I'm going to create
a new recipe choose Android phone call
and then do any phone call missed now go
over to text messages and put send an
SMS and in the phone number area I'm not
going to enter a specific phone number
but I'm gonna hit that plus sign to
select an ingredient and do from number
that means any number that's called me
is the from number in this recipe hit
continue hit finish
so if I want to set the message that's
being sent to someone who missed a call
we go to the recipe and hit edit and I
can change this field to say sorry I
missed your call and I'm well done so
now when I get a phone call and I miss
it the person who called me will get a
response letting them know that I'm
sorry I missed their call the final
recipe I'll show you is every time I
post a new photo to Instagram set that
photo as my hand red wallpaper for this
I'm going to create a new recipe but
head over to the Instagram channel first
select any new photo by you and then go
all the way over to the Android device
area hit update wallpaper so now every
time that I post a new photo to my
Instagram account it'll update my
background on my phone with that
wallpaper these are really just the tip
of the iceberg of what you can do with
if on your Android device

including how to use it with smart
gadgets in your home I'm Sarah Metro for
