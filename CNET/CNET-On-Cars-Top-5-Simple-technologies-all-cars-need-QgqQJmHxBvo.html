innovations in cars lately like
pointless 3d maps voice commands that
emulate a moron and head-up displays
that looked as if a five-year-old got
bored halfway through the job but I've
got some better ones I'm Brian Cooley
with my top five simple technologies all
cars should have number five smart seat
heaters now even if you set your seat
heater to lower medium it should be
smart enough to start at high until it
gets to lower medium any modern home
furnace can do that and those things are
about as smart as a milk carton also why
does the automatic temperature control
on the dash and the seat heater have no
communication with each other there's
got to be a link there now I put all
this at number five because I've just
seen this show up in a tiny way in a few
cars but not nearly enough considering
how much we love this creature comfort
number four small car keys drive a
Jaguar lately you better wear strong
pants the key is the size of a small ham
and slightly more dense and they're just
the poster child for an entire industry
trend toward these huge heavy
transponder key fobs any tech that makes
you miss the way they did it back in the
60s is tech that's gone wrong number
three speed limits on speedometers one
of you needs to patent this right now
and make a grip here's the idea a number
of cars already have the ability to know
and display the posted speed limit where
you're driving but they typically show
it way the hell over on the GPS screen
no car I've driven yet takes the simple
step of illuminating the correct numeral
on the speedo dial what could be more
elegant and glanceable don't forget to
share some of your patent troll earnings
with old cooling number two Bluetooth
time sink in most cars you still have to
set the clock here in 2014 that's VCR
like now some cars with factory
navigation do auto set the time from GPS
but many don't and non nav cars can't
yet there you are with a paired
bluetooth phone a perfect source of
accurate network time for the dashboard
clock and yet it doesn't talk to your
phone surely a Bluetooth spec to do that
could have been done years ago
number one is media unites all media I'm
fed up with cars that still have
separate buttons and often separate
interfaces for radio media and what they
call media apps guys it's all media put
it in one place I bet you've had some
brilliant simple ideas for car tech if
you care to air them out in public shoot
him at me and I'll share some of the
best on a future show on cars at cnet
