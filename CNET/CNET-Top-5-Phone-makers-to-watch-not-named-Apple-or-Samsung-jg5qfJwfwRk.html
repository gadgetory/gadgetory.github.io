countdown things
I'm your host I as act are in the phone
universe there are two top dogs Apple
and Samsung but they're not the only
game in town today we're counting down
the top five phone makers you should
keep an eye on there aren't Apple or
Samsung at number five is one plus this
company currently only makes one phone
it's called the one plus two which for
some reason I can't help but add to call
it the three in my head anyway the two
puts together lots of great specs and
good build quality with an affordable
price one of the key features that sets
apart smart phones these days is the
camera and the oneplus two packs of
great one to drum up interest oneplus
sells its bones using an invite-only
method that must be done online it's an
interesting strategy that could build up
a cult-like following like other
invite-only things and number four is
Xiaomi this is the company that Hugo
Berra a Google vice president at the
time left
Google for Berra took the position of
vice president of international at shall
make the company makes some pretty
awesome phones at first glance the
products look like Apple knockoffs but
I've never heard anyone write Samsung
however its phones are well built and
affordable plus its Android skin is
actually pretty polished with Bera
as its VP of international expect to see
these phones in places like the US
eventually at number three is Motorola
yet another company that knows how to
build low-cost well crafted phones after
a brief period of being owned by Google
Lenovo snapped up Motorola Mobility
that's the company that makes those
snazzy smartphones like the Moto X the
deal closed in late October 2014
this wasn't lenovo's first go at buying
another company Lenovo famously
purchased IBM's computer business and
did a great job with the pink pad line
recently Lenovo had been making a number
of phones that didn't really see the
light of day outside of Asian markets
perhaps we'll see some of those arrive
under the Motorola banner
and number two is LG this company is
desperately trying to get your attention
you've seen the series of commercials on
TV with leather being crafted to fit the
LG g4
the thing is LG makes some pretty
awesome phones the LG G series of phones
are considered some of the best Android
phones for Android fans it's also made
three of Google's Nexus phones the four
the five and the new 5x LG's Nexus
phones were generally well liked
- will it ever have a monster hit like
the Samsung Galaxy S line I think it's
very possible and that number one is
Huawei this is the company that makes
the brand new Google Nexus 6p the
company name might not be terribly
familiar to some but Huawei is making a
big push right now the company is the
world's third largest smartphone maker
and with Google's stamp of approval
this will garnered a lot of attention
from ski nuts time with the 6p we found
it to be really well built and its specs
are top-notch it's also really party
maybe the peak at six P stands for
pretty anyway keep an eye on Huawei and
there you have it the top five phone
makers to watch not name to Apple or
Samsung do you think meizu or Oppo
should have been on this list let me
know on twitter i'm matt is for more top
fives like this visit top 5 dot-com
thanks for watching and we'll see you
later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
