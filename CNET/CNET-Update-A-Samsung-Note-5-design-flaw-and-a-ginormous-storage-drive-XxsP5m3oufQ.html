Samsung's got a 16 terabyte SSD I'm Jeff
Bakalar filling in for Bridget Carey
this week this is your cnet update a new
microsoft research project lets people
use their smartphones to create
high-quality 3d images in real time it's
called mobile fusion and it requires the
user to take a quick 360 degree video of
a subject the software then compiles the
images and renders out a 3d object on
screen okay so why would anyone need
this well a 3d scanner in your pocket
would make it easier to convey scale
maybe take better photos of something
you're trying to sell online or share
that extra dimensional detail then maybe
couldn't be captured any other way
samsung's new note 5 phone suffers from
a fairly obvious design flaw that could
actually cause users to break a feature
on their phone the phone's s-pen slot
for it's stylist allows for the pen to
be inserted backwards but if you do that
you could actually bust the pen
detection sensor that's located inside
the worst part is there's little to no
resistance when popping the pen in the
wrong way so just a big heads up to
owners of their new shiny note 5s Swiss
watchmaker swatch is taking some jabs at
apple SmartWatch the company's chief
executive has brushed off the gadget as
an interesting toy that can't last more
than 24 hours I mean he's not he's not
wrong anyway swatch plans to start
selling smartwatches again later this
year but focusing on the watch side of
things before anything else swatches new
watch will use NFC for mobile payments
and other functionality but don't expect
it to monitor your heartbeat or track
your steps however swatch says it will
be water-resistant and have a battery
that lasts for nine months and finally
Samsung has debuted the world's largest
hard drive earlier this month at the
flesh memory summit hey don't knock the
name because that show has the best
parties at the summit Samsung showed off
a 16 terabyte drive but best of all
somehow it's remarkably an SSD it's
using nuveen and technology and the
drive is able to cram an insane amount
of storage in just a small 2.5 inch
encasing no word yet on how much it's
going to cost but estimates have it
clocking in roughly at just under eight
thousand dollars so if you know you wait
like a year or so it'll be like 150
bucks or something that does it for this
update for the very latest head over to
cnet.com from our Studios here in New
York I'm Jeff Beck</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
