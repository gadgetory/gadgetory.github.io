air purifiers before it's also made fans
and heaters but this is the first time
is for them all into one unit it's the
Dyson pure hot + cool link let's check
it out so the design we've pretty
similar to anyone who's seen some of
Dyson other air pushing products this
bit around here is where the air comes
out whether you want it hot or whether
you want it cold it can rotate so that
it pushes there all around the room and
down here is where the filtering happens
so inside here there's a HEPA filter
Dyson says that you will need to replace
it roughly once a year if you use this
thing every day the Machine knows what
the air quality around it is like
because just at the back here there are
a couple of little sensors to give it
clues as to how much dust there is in
the air and how many volatile organic
compounds or vocs up until some examples
of those could be if you've had a fire
in the room or scented candles maybe now
being a modern piece of home tech of
course this thing comes with its own app
now from this app you can do a fair bit
as well as the basic functions like
controlling the actual temperature and
the power of the fan it'll show you what
the purity of the air is like it'll give
you historic records of what air purity
has been like in the past and you can
set schedules as well it runs pretty
quiet and one feature i do like is this
button here on the remote which triggers
night mode now what that does is it
limits the fan power so it won't be too
noisy and as a nice touch it also dims
the lights on the front so that when
waking you up in the night all modern
conveniences then but all that tech
doesn't come cheap that seems pretty
pricey in fact it's going to cost six
hundred dollars or five hundred pounds
in the UK when it goes on sale in
September that's all for now but stay
tuned to see nuts</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
