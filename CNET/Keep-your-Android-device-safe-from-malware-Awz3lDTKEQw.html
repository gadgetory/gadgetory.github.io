computers than they are phones but why
is it we don't protect them the same way
recent studies have shown that more than
half of all pcs are protected with an
anti-virus program compared to only just
5% of smartphones and tablets Android is
the most used mobile operating system
which is the reason why it's targeted by
cyber criminals more than any other
mobile platform I'm dan Graziano and I'm
going to share with you some of the
easiest methods for keeping your Android
device malware free when downloading
apps stick to a legitimate app store
such as Google Play
Amazon's App Store Samsung Apps or one
of the marketplaces from your carrier
even when you're on these stores you
have to be on the lookout for suspicious
apps with odd permissions and bad
reviews many times malicious apps can
look similar to legitimate ones this was
the case with a fake bbm app that
surfaced a few months ago then there's
the issue with sideloading apps case in
point
you're opening up your device to more
malware if you install apps outside
these major stores if you must do it
make sure you get that from a trusted
developers website most pirated or
cracked apps tend to be infused with
malware and let's face it in the long
run you'll be kicking yourself you
didn't buy the real version devices
running Android 4.2 or higher also have
access to a built in malware scanner for
sideload apps this can be enabled by
going to settings clicking on security
and enabling the verify apps option
while you're in settings scroll down to
about phone and check to see if there's
any software updates available
manufacturers carriers and Guler are
constantly pushing out updates with bug
fixes enhancements and new features that
can make your device more secure the
last and most obvious way to protect
yourself from mobile malware is to
install one the many antivirus apps from
the Google Play Store for more
information about protecting your device
including a list of some of the best
antivirus apps check out my article on
how to see Netcom you can also reach out
to me on Twitter with any questions and
feel free to share with me so the tips
you use for keeping safe I'm Dan garage
