huawei p9 with some slight tweaks but
that's not necessarily a bad thing it
has that same beautiful meadow and glass
design with a unique dual camera setup
on the back the phone feels nice and
hand and is very pocketable although it
is a magnet for fingerprints and smudges
when you flip it over you will find a
fingerprint sensor which is nice and
speedy but more impressive was the new
smart button feature the sensor is
actually a programmable button so you
can set it to launch specific apps with
a single or double tap another cool
feature is the knocking gesture you can
double tap the screen with your knuckle
to snap a quick screenshot or double tap
it with two knuckles to begin recording
screen these are features we've seen
other Huawei devices buts the first time
they'll arrive in the US and lastly you
just can't forget about the camera there
are two 12 megapixel rear shooters one
is monochrome and the others RGB this
setup helps deliver more vivid colors
and greater detail it also lets you
change the depth of field to give your
shots more of a DSLR look as for specs
the honor 8 has a 5.2 inch full HD
display with a huawei made octa-core
processor head with 4 gigabytes of RAM
32 gigabytes of internal storage and a
micro SD card slot to add even more
space there's also a 3,000 non removable
battery with fast charging through the
phone's USB C port other goodies include
an IR blaster NFC and yes there is a 3.5
millimeter headphone jack pricing and
release information wasn't finalized
when we first saw the phone but we will
have it in our full write-up over at C
