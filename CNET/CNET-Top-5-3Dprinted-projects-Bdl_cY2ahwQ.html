tech products is the 3d printer a
machine that can construct physical
objects using layers of plastic sounds
cool but what exactly are people
printing out with these things Donal
Bell and this top five I'm counting down
some of the most popular 3d printing
projects provided to me from the fine
people at thingiverse.com and ranked
using a combination of likes collections
and downloads starting off at number
five the SMAP together mini lamp
designed by MakerBot industries they
probably can't legally call it the Pixar
lamp but I'm going to there's some
assembly required you'll need to source
a pair of Springs and you'll have to
provide your own electrical lamp socket
if you want this thing to function but
it's a great example of how 3d printers
can create complex useful objects number
four gets even more useful an adjustable
wrench now I know what you're thinking
you already have a wrench and it's made
out of metal not plastic but here's
what's cool about this the wrench and
the adjustment dial work right out of
the printer no assembly required
this idea that objects can be printed
with hinges and gears and moving parts
all in place is a critical concept if
everyday keep our going to be putting
these things in their homes at number
three cellular lamp by nervous system
who said that 3d printing has to always
be practical you can also make beautiful
organic sculptures use as an LED lamp or
as a bracelet or is just something
pretty to put on your bookshelf the best
part is it'll look cool even if the
printer is a little sloppy on the other
end of the spectrum at number two a
fully functional automatic transmission
you'll need to assemble this one gear by
gear but that's actually part of the fun
if I had a 3d printer in my home I have
no doubt that this would be the first
thing my son would ask me to make you
get six different gears plus a gear for
reverse and a hand crank now before we
get to number one let me take a minute
to acknowledge the 3d printed projects
that almost made the list at number six
the open-source action figure by Jason
Welsh it's more like one of those
articulated art mannequins except this
one can be customized and scaled up or
down using software make yourself a new
friend and feel
God all right and now the most popular
and beloved 3d printed project on
Thingiverse an elephant designed by l'a
fab shop this adorable elephant toy has
more to it than meets the eye
like the wrench this is an all-in-one
print with moving parts no assembly
required the legs move the trunk bends
and it's artistic enough to put on a
shelf or gives a gift so there you go
five of the most popular 3d printing
projects plus a bonus a huge thanks to
the good people at Thingiverse for
providing this list and to all the
makers out there for sharing these
designs more top 5 videos visit top-5
