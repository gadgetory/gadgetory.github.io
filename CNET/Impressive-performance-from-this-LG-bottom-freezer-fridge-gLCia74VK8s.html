with another refrigerator review today
it's the LG LD c24 370's t this is an
$1,800 bottom freezer model so the
freezers down here in the bottom and the
fridge is up top you get 24 cubic feet
of total storage space sixteen point
three of which are inside the fridge now
I like this interior quite a bit it's
got a lot of user friendly features from
the crisper humidity controls to the
glide and serve drawer down here it
pulls out really nicely with that hinged
top kind of lifting up and out of the
way if you also get LED lighting up top
and here in the door you get a drawer
that lifts up out of the way to make
room for taller items you get these
slider thingies in the drawers that help
you section things off oh no a lot of
nice little touches in this fridge but I
also really like about it is that it's a
great performer one of the best that
we've tested so far here at CNN
appliances take a look at this average
temperature heat map that shows you how
warm each zone gets in the fridge during
our three-day test with the fridge set
to 37 now you can see all those numbers
are slightly above 37 there's a little
north of the target but they're very
consistent very even even in the doors
and the butter bin which usually gets
really hot and if you look at the graph
showing the averages over the entirety
of that test you can see it's kind of a
mess it's a jumble all those lines are
all on top of each other it's very tough
to read but that's a good thing that's
the whole point the lines are very close
together it's a very tight range from
region to region that's about as good a
result as we've seen from any of the
fridges that we've tested now the
downsides at this fridge first off 1800
is about as expensive as bottom freezers
come they usually start right above
$1000 so you are paying a lot for it
also the stainless steel finish is white
fingerprint prone if you just wipe it
here you can see it's smudgy it's really
hard to keep clean you're gonna have to
wipe it down a lot a little more high
maintenance than I would like
worth noting though you can get the same
fridge with a white finish instead of
that stainless steel finish for one
hundred bucks less I think that's more
tempting than usual because of all the
smudges all in all though the solid
performance user-friendly design and
large capacity leading me to say that
this is a very good fridge that you
should consider if you're shopping for
one at the 2000 and below price range
thanks for watching check out the rest
of our refrigerator reviews and all of
our plants reviews
cnet.com for CNN appliances I'm right
