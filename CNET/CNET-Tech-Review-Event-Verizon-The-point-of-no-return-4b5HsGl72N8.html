Verizon iPhone is coming we've got it
now but is this the right time to buy it
plus google launches the Android Market
News Corp launches the daily and tap
that out brings lunches to your doorstep
it's all coming up right now
hi everyone I'm Hollywood and welcome to
the Sina tech review where we collect
our hottest videos of the week and tell
you what's good and what's bad in the
world of tech plus offer some unique
tech wisdom in the form of a bottom line
let's start with the good the wait is
finally over for so long it was just a
pipe dream but now the iPhone 4 is
really coming to Verizon and Kent German
was among the lucky few to get his hands
on one before they went on sale is it
the answer to all of your iPhone prayers
here's Kent with his first look hi I'm
Kent Sherman senior editor for cnet.com
today were to take a first look at the
Verizon iPhone 4 indeed I was very happy
when Verizon and Apple announced this
phone in early January sure it's great
that ATT is no longer than exclusive
carrier but I'm more excited that long
discussed rumors finally been put to
rest so what is the Verizon iPhone well
the answer is the Verizon iPhone is
almost the same device as AT&amp;amp;T
counterpart there are a couple of
differences and one that's pretty
important but it's still the same phone
in most regards I'll start with the one
difference in the design to accommodate
the CDMA antenna the ringer switch has
been moved slightly closer to the volume
rocker also the gap that's currently on
top of the AT&amp;amp;T handset has been moved
to the top left side Apple would have
discussed the specifics of the redesign
but implement retesting we didn't
encounter the death grip that we found
on the AT&amp;amp;T iPhone unfortunately though
the antenna change means that many
current iPhone cases like these here
won't fit so they need to buy new ones
also because it runs on CDMA the Verizon
iPhone doesn't have a SIM card slot
otherwise the Verizon handset is exactly
the same you'll find the same controls
camera features headset in charger
Jack's speaker and microphone and Retina
display Verizon says it will carry the
white iPhone but we still have no idea
when that will be last time we heard was
just signed in the spring now inside the
Verizon iPhone is one major difference
unlike the AT&amp;amp;T handset the Verizon
iPhone can function as a personal
hotspot for up to five devices you will
need to activate the hotspot
functionality with Verizon first but
once you do it will appear in the
settings menu so after you set a
password and you turn on the feature you
can get started you can connect devices
through Wi-Fi Bluetooth and also a USB
cable it's really nice as you can use
all three connection types at once
another difference is the Verizon iPhone
currently runs iOS 4.2 6 while in
comparison the AT&amp;amp;T iPhone runs iOS
4.2.1 Apple said 42.6 is a version
unique to the Verizon handset and the
only change that brings our CDMA support
and hotspot feature the other features
of the device are exactly the same so
expect to see no changes from the AT&amp;amp;T
phone of course there are a few things
that Verizon iPhone can't do unlike a
tMT's handset it can't perform
simultaneous voice in data if you're on
Wi-Fi it does do that but if you're on a
7 at work no and it doesn't offer global
roaming for GSM networks also the
Verizon is growing its LTE 4G network
it's currently Verizon iPhone tops out
at 3G we're still in the midst of
testing the device you'll have to read
the review for our full performance
analysis voice quality however we
noticed few differences but this
preliminary testing so I want to
emphasize that whatever our results
though I have to stress that you
shouldn't expect a Verizon iPhone to be
a miracle device you'll see differences
no doubt but don't expect it to
completely cure your reception woes
you're still using a cellular network
that will vary according to your
location interference and how many
people are using it at one time the
expectations for Verizon iPhone are
immensely and ridiculously high and this
handset I have to say runs a big risk of
not living up to him that's why it's
important to keep those hopes in check
just recognize it as a phone it's still
gonna have problems once in a while more
importantly though the less smartphone
landscape is very very different than it
was in 2007 when the first iPhone went
on sale not only are there are many
other hand fantastic smartphones on the
market but also there are a lot of
people that are perfectly happy with
their non apple device and don't want to
buy one the iPhone is on a new care
that's great there's more customer
choice and it remains a very good phone
but it remains just one player in a very
competitive field I'm Ken Sherman here
were the first look at the Verizon
iPhone 4
way to manage expectations Kent
personally if I was looking to buy an
iPhone right now I would wait to see
what the next generation of hardware has
to offer but that's just me
for more reasons why you might not want
to rush into a new relationship with
Verizon stick around for this week's top
five coming up later in the show so
maybe you don't like AT&amp;amp;T or Verizon or
phone contracts in general but you still
want to jump on the smart phone
bandwagon well if you're willing to go
the Android route and you should be
you'll want to check out
LG's optimus v that's B as in virgin
imma Kohli senior associate editor for
cnet.com and this is a first look at the
lg optimus V for a virgin mobile the lg
optimus V is almost identical to the lg
optimus s in fact he has the same design
and everything however the only
difference is that the bottom placement
is slightly different for example at the
bottom here you do get the hot sensor
keys for the Menu key the HOME key the
back key and the search key otherwise
the overall interface is pretty similar
to the other lg optimus phones you get
up to five customizable home screens and
the lg optimus v comes of his own virgin
mobile skin it's nice and slim as you
can see here and is coated a nice
comfortable soft touch finish on the
back is a 3.2 megapixel camera the lg
optimus v is built as an entry-level
smartphone but that doesn't mean it's
lacking any features in fact it has
Wi-Fi GPS as well as EVDO Rev a it also
ships with Android 2.2 however it
doesn't have flash video in the browser
and it does not allow mobile hotspot
tethering aside from the usual Google
Maps that include Gmail Google Voice
Search and more
it also has Virgin Mobile Maps like
Virgin Mobile live that lets you view
and stream music videos from Virgin
Mobile festival artists a few other apps
included in here are of course Google
Maps so as YouTube and we're a
location-based app the lg optimus me is
affordably priced at only a hundred and
fifty dollars without a contract I'm
Nichola this has been a first look at
the lg optimus V and of course once
you've taken the Android leap there's
nothing stopping you from loading up
your new phone with a bunch of apps up
till now that process has been a little
bit tedious but luckily this week Google
unveiled its new App Store
I mean Android Market Web Store Google
finally they view their long missing and
long demanded way to get your apps on
your Android phones and tablets a
web-based marketplace hi I'm Seth
Rosenblatt frisina and in this first
look I'll be taking you on a tour of the
new Android Market at Android Market
comm one of the best things about the
market that's sure to make iPhone users
jealous is that you can search for apps
directly from your browser and without
logging in once logged in you can push
apps directly to your phone or tablet
the majority of Google's development
work here is clearly focused on app
presentation featured apps takes center
stage on a large rotating carousel of
highlights but the key thing here is the
new search option that persistently
lives at the top enter a query and a
slick black bar appears between the
bottom of the search box and your
results click it to reveal search
filters you can install an app directly
from the results or a click through to
learn more about each app when you do
hit the install link the market will let
you choose which device to install the
app to as well as show you a list of
permissions that the app uses and its
cost you can also push an app to
multiple devices as long as they're
associated under the same account
currently pushing an app is kind of a
slow and tedious process and definitely
a bit buggy it's not clear whether
that's from the crush of users from app
syncing problems or some other nefarious
Google bug at one point jumping into the
market app on my phone actually got the
app to finally install properly so it
does work eventually when you're logged
in you can also jump to your account up
at the top right of the page it takes
you to a my orders tab that lists all
your installed apps these are organized
by date last updated
the name of the app category price and
status currently these headings can only
be sorted by date although it looks like
the kind of layout that will receive an
update with more sort parameters in the
future a second tab labeled settings
currently shows only a list of the
devices associated with your account
chose nickname visibility make model
carrier last used and registered on date
clicking the edit button on the right
lets you give the device a nickname and
choose whether to hide the device from
Android menus users who have routed
their devices and are running custom
roms will not see data for make and
model it appears that multiple
simultaneous account logins a feature
recently pushed to Gmail users are not
supported at this time either
hardcore Android fans will notice that
the market currently offers less than
third party markets like app brain you
can't create customized lists of apps
for one thing and you can't uninstall
from the marketplace either that all
being said it's a good sign that Google
is finally entering the market for
markets because at the very least it
will force third party markets to up
their game or become irrelevant for the
first look at Google's Android Market -
s Rosenblatt for senior now if you end
up going a little crazy and downloading
too many apps be sure to check out
Antoine Goodwin's video on how to free
up space for apps on Android 2.2 you can
find that like all of today's videos and
more at Sina TV com turning to today's
news News publishing magnate Rupert
Murdoch was in New York Wednesday to
debut a new publication for the iPad
called the daily we'll call it a
newspaper for lack of a better word but
as Caroline McCarthy shows us it's
definitely a paper custom-made for the
digital age
I'm Caroline McCarthy for CNET news and
we are at the Guggenheim Museum of Art
in New York where today News Corporation
unveiled the daily what it says is the
first daily news publication optimized
and designed specifically for Apple's
iPad I'm pleased to welcome you to the
launch of the daily a national news
publication for the iPad that we have
created from scratch right now the
contact from the daily is available only
on the iPad app and on the web behind a
paywall
currently there are no plans to release
it on any other tablet devices though
Rupert Murdoch has said that when the
tablet market beyond the iPod is a
little bit more mature that he wants to
be on every major tablet device as for
subscription fees the daily costs $0.99
per week or $39.99 if you want to pay
for an entire year upfront News Corp
executives made certain at the launch of
the daily that they want this product to
be a completely new brand and a
completely new experience it's heavy on
audio and video hello I'm Erin Eaton
welcome to the inaugural issue of the
daily as well as touchscreen friendly
features like scrolling between
different stories and clicking on
interactive 360-degree photos the
content in the inaugural issue at the
daily is anchored by a cover story about
the ongoing political upheaval in Egypt
but among some of the other headlines
you can see are the snow storms that are
all over the country right now Natalie
Portman's pregnancy and a New York disco
for dogs but what excites me the most is
there is a crossword puzzle
I'm Caroline McCarthy for CNET news
now before you get too excited you
should know that I have already
submitted my virtual silly putty out to
the App Store for making transfers so
back off all right speaking of apps I
guess yeah a lame transition I know
anyway this week's installment of tap
that up is serving up some hot and tasty
treats that bring the joy of ordering
takeout to your phone app style okay now
that's more like it hey everyone here's
a good trick for the supremely lazy meal
hunter who's always on the go instead of
calling in an order for delivery you can
just create one with an app before you
even get home I'm Jessica's all-court
and this is tap that app the show where
we show you the latest and greatest
mobile apps this time we're taking a
look at grub hub and seamless web on
iPhone and Android you may be familiar
with both these services online and
indeed the mobile apps mostly recreate
the menu viewing and meal ordering
services I think it's easier to create
your account online first but you can
also register from the apps now the grub
hub app may be more makeshift than the
full online version but it is still
usable you can search your current
location and look for restaurants
ordering online pulls up a menu you just
tap an entry to add it to your order add
in your address and finalize the order
then there's the bizarrely named
seamless web it sounds like a web
standards consortium but really it's a
grub hub rival that does a better job on
the mobile app seamless web has a few
more options for placing an order for
delivery or pickup and it also gives you
a map and filters apart from that it
works pretty much the same way after
viewing the menu tap your selection and
any additional lunch or dinner items to
add them to your bag you can also type
in special instructions keep in mind
that both these delivery services will
require a minimum dollar order they also
have limited databases and don't service
every US city so if you've got your
heart set on a little neighborhood Thai
restaurant down the street you better
forget these apps and just pick up the
phone otherwise these apps are a great
option for quickly ordering food from
anywhere you've got a Wi-Fi or data
connection so what's your favorite app
set
your suggestions to tap that app at
cnn.com I'm Jessica Belcourt and keep on
tapping I guess these apps are pretty
handy if you don't know what kind of
food you're in the mood for or you don't
know what's nearby but if you're just
ordering from the Chinese place around
the corner is it really that much easier
to use an app than to just call them on
the phone with your phone actually yeah
I guess you're right sometimes it is
easier anyway while you go pay the
delivery guy don't forget the tip let's
take a quick break and we'll be right
back with more tech review right after
this
welcome back to the sina tech review our
weekly video digest of all things good
and bad we've seen here at Sina TV
moving right along
let's see what we've got this week in
the bad once again it's time to open up
the how to vault and offer some good
solutions to bad problems first up how
to make sure that creep in the coffee
shop doesn't steal your facebook login
and then I'm gonna show you how to help
your friends and family members stop
paying to use AOL because you stopped a
long time ago right our little secret
take a look hi I'm Sharon Vaknin for
cnet.com and today I'm showing you how
to safely browse Facebook and fend off
hackers with an EZ security setting
recently Facebook learned that even its
own founder can get hacked
Mark Zuckerberg fan page was hijacked
and now the company has finally decided
to do something about its users security
until now the only way to encrypt your
facebook sessions was to download a
browser add-on or manually enter HTTPS
in the address bar what HTTPS does is
ensure that the communication between
you and your webserver is private so
that no one can eavesdrop on your
activity so let me show you how to
officially enable HTTPS browsing from
any page had to account and select
account settings from here had to
account security here check off browse
Facebook on a secure connection if you
don't see the option yet be patient
Facebook is slowly rolling out the
feature to all of its users until then
you can continue to add the s yourself
if you like you'll also see a privacy
feature that allows you to be notified
when a new device logs into your account
consider enabling this one too you never
know if an X or front of me is logging
into your account with your credentials
save your settings and you're ready to
go but be warned Facebook's features
always come with side effects some pages
will load slower and certain third-party
apps don't support the feature
but that's a small price to pay for the
added security for cnet.com I'm Sharon
Vaknin and I'll see you on the encrypted
interwebs hi I'm Molly Wood from
cnet.com and I'm here to show you how to
stop paying for a o L a recent New
Yorker article suggested that as much as
80% of AOL's revenue could come from
people who don't need to be paying for
the service C in the old days an AOL
account cost anywhere from 10 bucks a
month to $25 a month those accounts
still exist but if you already pay for a
separate internet connection to your
home and you only use AOL for email or
browsing you do not need to be paying
anything in fact you shouldn't be so
here's how to set your account free
literally you can make this change from
the web or from your AOL software here's
how to do it from the web on your AOL
comm home page sign in to your account
and then scroll all the way to the
bottom of the page and click the blue
help link on the bottom of that page
you'll see an orange link on the right
labeled go to account and settings now
click the big box labeled manage my
account you'll be asked to log in again
and either answer or create a security
question now way down on the bottom
right under price plans there's an
option to change my plan or cancel my
billing if your account says anything
but free click the cancel my billing
link now the next page will offer you a
buffet of paid options you want the pink
one for free a o L here you'll see a
page that tries to sell you the $4.99 a
month support plus option which includes
virus scanning and tech support now if
you're watching this video you don't
need tech support or you can probably
Google whatever your parents might need
and there are plenty of free security
options out there so click $0 finally
AOL will let you know that you will
suddenly see pop-ups in your AOL if you
had blocked them before and that if you
use your phone bill or your checking
account to auto pay for any AOL premium
services they're still gonna try to
charge you $7 a month so you probably
want to cancel that too now click Save
and you're all set you're living the
free AOL life and I
think you're gonna like it now if you'd
like to do the same thing through your
AOL desktop software sign-on and then go
to the keyword menu or press ctrl K type
in change plan on the screen that pops
up you should see your security question
again along with the same options that
you see on the web
follow the same steps as above and
you'll be all set all right so what are
you missing well if you're on dial-up
the $25 a month plan gives you a dial-up
number McAfee Security and some vague
insurance protection that's almost
certainly part of your homeowners or
renters insurance and like I said you
can get free security Suites everywhere
check download com but that's also the
plan they try to sign you up for when
you first install AOL 25 bucks a month
even if you're on broadband no the
cheaper plans for dial-up offer the
basic access and some tech support and
the broadband plans just try to charge
you for McAfee security backup dial-up
numbers and tech support once again
trust me for most of you these are
services that you just don't need I'm
sorry a o L everyone else you're welcome
pristine in how to I'm Molly wood
so now you're ready to be a good kid and
help get your grandparents to stop
paying for AOL
and if you're lucky maybe there will be
a little something extra on your
birthday check this year all right with
that it's time to check out this week's
bottom line
now the Verizon iPhone doesn't go on
sale until next week but existing
Verizon customers can start pre-ordering
it right now but if you're thinking of
buying one as soon as you can
this week's top five might make you
reconsider
it wasn't long after the iPhone arrived
on AT&amp;amp;T that the pining began when do we
get it on Verizon
I'm Brian Cooley with a top five that
won't even rehash the reasons folks
wanted it on any network other than AT&amp;amp;T
I mean that bitching is part of the
American technology fabric at this point
no this is top five reasons that you
should not buy the Verizon iPhone 4
number five it doesn't do voice and data
at the same time sad but true
AT&amp;amp;T GSM technology has it all over
Verizon CDMA network in this respect
AT&amp;amp;T iPhones can do data and voice at
once well that's if you can get a damn
signal at all said I wouldn't do that
anyway bear in mind the folks behind
CDMA technology promise a network
upgrade for Verizon and others to allow
dual mode operation sometime later this
year maybe it's still kind of iffy got
to be concerned about that number four
good luck overseas Verizon's CDMA
technology is a mixed bag for global use
you can roam mostly in Canada Mexico the
Caribbean Asia but not Europe Russia
and by the way that's roaming with all
those lovely fees that make your eyes
water there's no chip in a CDMA phone so
you can't just buy an el cheapo SIM when
you land in country and be up and
running
not a great travel phone number three
it's kind of a retool the iPhone 4 on
Verizon was a midseason refresh with
CDMA innards yes but not designed from
the ground up as far as we know to be a
CDMA phone I've just got this nagging
feeling there have to be some
shortcomings around there number two
it's not 4G and that is the biggest
thing going on in cell phone networks in
the next couple of years that you'll be
locked into a contract 4G networks and
there you'll be sitting on your 3G
iPhone 4 deciding between taking and
checking email watching all your fellow
Verizon customers with their hot seat
dual-core 8 megapixel HDMI in and out
Android 4G phones thinking damn it Apple
got me again before we get to number one
another reason you've got to rethink the
iPhone on Verizon is that you just have
to plain rethink the iPhone check out
the list of non Apple smartphones we
love on Verizon now and pending you can
find them all on CNET cell phone section
okay the number one reason yet gotta
think twice about getting the Verizon
iPhone 4 is will verizon be the next
AT&amp;amp;T this is the big question will
Verizon's network dragged to a crawl as
a flood of AT&amp;amp;T defectors and waiting
for Verizon side liners jump on board
and hammer their network AT&amp;amp;T 3G network
is technically faster maybe it just
needs to lose a few million customers to
show it and Verizon is going to offer
tube clogging unlimited data plans for
their new iPhone customers till further
notice something AT&amp;amp;T put the brakes on
some time ago so there you might be on a
Verizon for what two years with your
single tasking not really global sure as
hell not 4g iphone with a potentially
bonking network the smart money says
give it about six months before you make
the jump
our complete comparisons and coverage of
both flavors of iPhone are always up to
date over on CNET cell phone section i'm
brian coulis thanks for watching
the bottom line this week it's your call
I think we can all agree that the move
to Verizon hardly makes this the second
coming of the Jesus phone but if you're
still trying to make up your mind be
sure to check out our battle of the
networks video on CNET TV Jessica Dole
Court and Ken Sherman put both phones
through their paces in a variety of
tests some of the results may surprise
you alright that's it for this week
everyone join us next time for a brand
new scene at tech review see you then
and thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
