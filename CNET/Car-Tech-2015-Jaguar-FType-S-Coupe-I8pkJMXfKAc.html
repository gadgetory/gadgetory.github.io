there Steffes car ever their highest
performance production car ever a bunch
of superlatives the car makers are given
to I'll give you one more it's their
most fun car ever that's the highest
compliment let's drive this 2015 f-type
s coat check the tail now I never
thought I'd be able to save this but
here's a car that makes the Jag f-type
roadster look homely it's sinfully
gorgeous now all this rendered in very
light stiff aluminum for the most part
in fact jag says almost the entire side
of the car is one big stamping if I did
the math right it's like 25,000
pound-feet of torque to twist this guy
longitudinally this way one degree makes
for a great platform for a car that you
want to be precise and responsive now we
have an S that means we're nearly 78
base the vision package 2400 more for
smart front headlights sonar and camera
cross traffic and blind spot performance
package is 3400 more it's you a dynamic
mode you can tweak a sport exhaust
you'll need earplugs for red disks
calipers I can live without that sports
seats and wheel a new apps package we'll
look at in a moment is 400 and HD and
satellite radio come together at 450 all
in about 87 thousand dollars the way
we'd set it up not a cheap date let's
see what you get one of the first things
I'm taken by in an f-type coupe cabin is
the relative sense of fun and levity
going on here we look at the instrument
panel man ain't no German car it's full
of this garish color italicize numbers
when you move into a manual shift mode
you get this big superhero number for
your gear position this car is all about
fun it's also about some silly got the
grab handle over here for some reason
the upper register vents go up and down
via power I have no idea why or by what
logic performance controls have a
rubbery gold finish on them this
dynamics mode button the start/stop the
paddles on the wheel and the little
button looks like binoculars down here
actually opens up the exhaust so it
sounds like the how
of hell the head unit is a clean
interface I've seen it before on Jags
not my favorite by any stretch its
rectangular and boxy at the expense of
being terribly well thought out at least
to my eye it's all touch there's no
control knob to speak of you do have
some homerun buttons around the sides
here the problem with that is being deep
set and being touched only is kind of
like a mission from hell especially when
you want to get down to things on the
edges just kind of bunks into your
knuckles as you're trying to press
things not great ergo what's really not
great ergo is this car doesn't have any
voice command at all I was shocked by
that on the other hand the climate knobs
are sheer genius putting the number and
the state of seat heat in the middle of
the knob that controls it I can't every
control be like this this is new here in
control apps this brings you a flavor of
Android auto the first one I've seen in
a production car I'm running an app on
the phone that allows me to set up a
series of other apps that show up here
and when I do that blanks out the phone
screen so this becomes a feeder for the
head unit the good news is it's super
clear easy to navigate with nice big
indicators the bad news is I've never
heard of any of these things except for
stitcher it's all rather admirable as an
early effort at least but that's if you
can keep the phone in the car talking to
each other which was more than I could
do there's also an additional navigation
app you can put on here sitting for 120
bucks luckily we've got nav standard on
these cars and it's perfectly functional
ok driving the f-type you've got your
standard PRN D and sport gait shifter
right here here is your drive mode
controller back one for dynamic mode up
one for snow mode or the middle position
is normal you can decide what dynamic
mode does with this screen menu here
you've also got a track timer and a
g-force gauge and a couple other
doohickeys you'll use about once or
twice
under the neat-looking front hood is the
thinking drivers engine this is the
supercharged v6 3 litres of displacement
the supercharger is neatly buried down
inside the V of the heads makes for a
tidy low package the numbers are good
375 horsepower 339 pound-feet of torque
currently only rear-wheel drive and only
through an 8-speed sport automatic
gearbox weight a model year and the 2016
are going to offer all-wheel drive for
the first time and a 6-speed manual for
the first time Hey I may just talk to
you out of buying an f-type for now now
we have an S that means we have a
slightly hotter version of the three
litre v6 the base car has the same
architecture but they don't ring as much
out of it as a result this guy gets up
to 60 and 4.8 and you're going to get 19
27 mpg you know they talk about rigidity
in the shell I don't think I'm imagining
it you really do feel it it doesn't seem
to have any give anywhere which is
equally impressive that the ride is not
punishing going along with the engines
eagerness and there's no lag because
we've got a supercharger and it's the
happy breathing engine anyway is this
really quick ZF automatic gearbox shifts
are about as fast as I could want
especially if you get into your dynamics
mode or sport mode and yet you retain
the civility of an automatic that a lot
of dual clutch gearboxes don't have the
adaptive suspension samples the road a
hundred times per second the rear wing
goes up at 70 and then down again at 50
the exhaust is interesting I'm sure
you've heard it by now this car calls
too much attention to itself all the
time I'd like it to go from muted ly
sporty to obnoxious here in this car it
goes from obnoxious to incredible
obnoxious there's nothing below
obnoxious and that is ticket bait even
if you're not speeding
in some this is Jags most successful car
in agents it does what it sets out to do
when you know me I love cars that do
that whatever it is
