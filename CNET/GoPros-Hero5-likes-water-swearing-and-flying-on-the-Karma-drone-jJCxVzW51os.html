GoPro with your voice it's one of the
new features on the hero 5 but wait
there's more GoPro is stepping it up
with the long-awaited karma drone we'll
get to that one soon first though the
camera compared to the previous version
the hero 5 has had a bit of a facelift
inside and out the biggest news is it's
now waterproof without a case there's a
GPS and electronic image stabilization
inside and a touchscreen at the back
video resolution is the same as the hero
4 so that's 4k at 30 frames a second
battery life is about the same too good
for 2 hours of recording then there's
the hero 5 session which shares most of
the same specs as the hero 5 black
except for GPS and screen and it's
really really small both cameras
automatically upload to the new $5 a
month GoPro plus cloud service when you
plug into charge we're gonna be on hero
5 has new mics to help out with
so those are the specs how does it all
work our thick usually you're constantly
checking if your camera is recording
making sure you've pressed the right
button is it on I can't see the line
voice controls change that up so you
just shout at the camera in one of seven
languages and away you go
so there are ten trigger phrases that
you can use to get the camera to start
or stop recording you just say GoPro
start recording you can get it to take a
bunch of burst photos that's what it's
doing now or you can get it to add a
hilight tag by saying GoPro highlight
that was sick or my personal favorite Oh
once you have your favorite moments the
editing process should be a bit easier
with a quick app that stitches your best
clips together the recording resolution
maxes out at 4k at 30 frames per second
just like the last model so that isn't
the reason to get it it's definitely for
the body design and all of the extra
features like the touch screen and the
GPS and now for the ultimate new mount
for your GoPro the Karma drone it's
portable folding up to fit inside a
backpack the included remote almost
feels like a game controller complete
with touch screen compatible with a hero
4 5 and session this 3 axis stabilizer
can detach from the front of the drone
and sit in the handheld grip we put two
cameras on Josh one with a stabilizer
and one without here's what it looks
like
so my first impressions from one time
flight with the karma drone that it is
very simple to fly the controller is
very nicely laid out does everything
that you'd expect from a basic camera
drone on top of that it handled wind
very well but there are plenty of other
drones out there that use GoPros so why
do you need a GoPro branded drone the
best part about it really though is that
gimbal on front that you can remove and
use handheld or mounted on a car or bike
or on your chest that is the best part
of the carbon drug and it's reasonably
priced at $800 GoPro is synonymous with
action cameras and they practically made
this category that's what they want to
do again but with drones with aggressive
pricing GoPro is hoping for some good
karma GoPro stopped recording</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
