I am an actor and producer I wanted to
be a zoologist from I was a kid and I
wanted to be a veterinarian and then
someone said it required math and I said
I'll be an actor I'm kind of an analog
guy like if I'm writing I will still ask
my assistant to give me a script on
paper and I'll make the notes with a pen
my fiancee she's finally kind of got me
into like using an Apple pen and using a
program called good reader on my iPad so
that I can feel like I'm writing on a
piece of paper
I'm very tactile but I do drive a test
less like driving and I bet that's like
an iPad with wheels but and mostly
that's because of I wanted to try to
help the environment I wanted to be a
predator for two big reasons one is that
I'm making a change in my career right
now which is I've always been fascinated
by action movies thrillers martial arts
I loved the mythology of like you know
people who could like you know touch a
person and paralyze them there was
something about the excitement of it and
the danger of it and it was beautiful
and it was violent and scary and it just
hit me in all the right places
emotionally the second reason which
really sealed the deal was that the film
is co-written and directed by Shane
Black of Kiss Kiss Bang Bang Fame he
wrote Lethal Weapon he wrote The Last
Boy Scout there was just no way I didn't
want to be involved with that genius
I play a former soldier Boyd Holbrook is
in the movie
lovely Olivia Munn sterling K Brown
there's a team of ex soldiers they're a
little rough around the edges they've
all kind of seen better days they band
together under very strange
circumstances and but they've known each
other from from the past they're all
actually in therapy together it's not
about a bunch of you know heroes who are
at the top of their game for them to
kind of pick up the mantle again is part
of the excitement of the film what I
would love to see is what the next step
is in our VR experiences like if I was
gonna go to a hockey game I'd want to
sit right from the glass all I want is
to have the experience that the
spectators have so if they're beating on
the glass and going damn I want to feel
that in the mask but it wouldn't feel so
foreign to me and it would make me sick
I'm looking to see where that tech is
going like my favorite episode of Black
Mirror is the one from the first season
where they can touch the rule rice in
your neck and you gonna be wined your
life and see the moments that you're
living in your life which would be scary
but also you'd be seeing moments
accurately which I think would be
interesting here's what I don't like I
don't understand those those automatic
walkways
when I'm with my fiancee and she gets
other thing and I walk next to her I get
through the same thing and when the rap
ends you can your left you gotta jump
over the right like why do we have those
who is that helping if you're an old
person who's not ambulatory you're no
wheelchair anyway there's superfluous
they're not needed I'm starting a
movement unpro walk on anti walk where
you get be like human traffic jams
people are losing shoes in those things
I see somebody's walk words they're like
20 feet long it's ridiculous interviews
over stupid
all right hello I am keegan-michael key
and I'm about to do my first
CNET unboxing here we go alright very
hi-tech paper bag here we go oh okay and
is a Casio know what this come out come
on
okay imma rip the box um I do like I
have you old Christmas Oh Mike this is a
Casio water-resistant digital watch with
calculator just like my dad bought me
when I was a teenager you guys see net
about tall meant to make me cry this is
amazing look at this this okay let me
see I used to had one of these when I
was a teenager and was in my thermit of
years I only got beat up twice for it I
got it back both times when the kid
couldn't do math who stole it but anyway
listen look at that you've got division
and multiplication subtraction and
addition this is how I got through math
class the reason I'm an actor is because
I'm lousy at math because I had one of
these this is so good oh my god CNET you
guys this is and this is like a trip
down memory lane for me look at this
this is amazing see and just says right
there calculator it's real straight it's
the good thing about Tech in the 80s
very straightforward there's no it just
says Casio water-resistant
I'm sorry water resists it's asking me
it's asking me to resist water so it's
reminding me every day that I only need
like eight glasses after that you're
waterlogging yourself so that's that's
that's a feature I didn't remember and
then there's a niche assess calculator
what an amazing gift oh my god this is
great
thanks so much what I can't keep it okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
