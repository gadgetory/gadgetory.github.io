and today we're taking a first look at
the energizer dual zone inductive
charger this device has a list price of
$89 but I'm sure you can find online for
a little less so what does this gadget
do it's pretty simple really the
energizer dual zone inductive charger is
designed to provide an easy way to keep
your mobile phones and other portable
gadgets powered up and ready for action
the dual zone uses the Qi standard for
inductive or wireless charging in fact a
whole crop of new smart phones use this
protocol compatible phones include the
Nokia Lumia 920 Lumia 820 HTC Droid DNA
and LG Nexus 4 just to name a few
here's how it works plug the charger
into an AC outlet then place your phone
that supports Qi charging on one of its
charging areas one of the LED lights on
top of the unit will then glow
indicating power is now flowing to your
device
it's that easy the dual zone will also
stop charging once it detects a device's
battery is full the charger also has a
standard USB port to connect and charge
devices using regular cables now the
energizer dual zone isn't very travel
friendly since it's big and bulky other
solutions such as the Duracell Powermat
24-hour system is made for much greater
portability its tilted surface is
slippery too which may cause phones to
slide around good thing the pad here has
a raised edge to rest phones against I'm
