a review of the panasonic dt 50 LCD TV
panasonic is a company best known for
its plasmas but in the last few years it
has offered LCD screens as a way to
broaden its appeal to people sworn off
plasma artifacts such as burnin but
based on the performance of the dt 50
i'd suggest sticking with the company's
plasmas instead looks-wise it isn't too
bad but is a little faded it looks like
a Sony Vegas that hitched a ride on the
TARDIS in 2004 but it's got up-to-date
features with onboard wireless all of
the video services you'd want with
Netflix Hulu and Amazon and it's also
got four HDMI ports but the reason we'd
suggest a plasma over this plainly this
television is bad it's black levels are
very poor for the money and we've seen
better performance from the $500 TCL
le40fhde3010 they're slow a lack of
control means that it's not the most
naturalistic either with too much of a
red push at the higher end which means
rosy skin tones and blue instead of
black shadows while it's saving graces
are decent 3d and playback of blu-ray
movies without stuttering then not
enough to save this television if it
were 900 dollars instead of $2,500 for
this 55 inch it might be worthwhile as a
result the DT 50 is high-priced
cosmetically dated and performs worse
than a TV up to a fifth of the price if
you have your heart set on getting a
Panasonic TV we'd suggest overlooking
this frankly dreadful model and go for
it's amazing plasma equivalent the ST 50
and save yourself $1000 in the process
I'm ty Pendlebury and this has been a
review of the Panasonic DT 50 television
