avalanche I'm Bridget Carey and this is
your cnet update the iphone 5 may be a
popular device but there are so many
more smartphones to be unveiled in the
next few weeks ATT held an event in New
York the other night to showcase dozens
of new products that will be sold during
the holiday season there's the HTC One
x+ which has a quad-core processor and
that high-end hardware is also something
we're seeing in the samsung galaxy note
2 and the lg optimus G which were also
showcased I spend some time with Sony's
Xperia TL the phone that will make its
big screen debut in the James Bond film
Skyfall so I didn't detect any secret
compartment for poison darts or a
switchblade but secret agents might get
use of the 13 megapixel camera and
edible ities Sony will be pushing NFC
accessories with this such as wireless
headphones that when tapped
automatically tell the phone to turn on
Bluetooth and start playing music NFC
accessories are also big settler with
Nokia's Lumia 920 that's Microsoft's
flagship Windows Phone 8 this season
it's all about keeping you hooked on a
company's ecosystem of accessories it's
a bit disappointing that everyone was
top secret about prices and launch dates
but there will be lots of choices this
holiday even devices you didn't know you
wanted like this galaxy camera that's
half smartphone half awesome camera and
you can get it with an AT&amp;amp;T data plan at
the end of the month on October 29th
Microsoft will officially launch the
Windows Phone 8 operating system phones
that work with Windows Phone 8 can
support NFC multi-core processors
expandable memory slots mobile wallets
and it will obviously have heavy
integration with windows 8 computers and
tablets which go on sale friday october
26th on monday we're keeping our eye on
some new angry birds mash up with Star
Wars the Angry Birds tumblr blog just
has this mysterious teaser animation I
find their lack of information
disturbing and speaking of tumblr you
may feel withdrawal from some animated
gifs on Saturday when the site will be
down for maintenance and updates it's
been one year since apple founder Steve
Jobs passed away be sure to check out
seen its coverage that looks at the
company's record financial success in
the past year as well as its challenges
going forward I have here a pretty cool
guy
going through tests in the cnet labs
right now it's the first streaming media
projector by 3m and Roku it combines
this pico projector that just fits in
your hand with content that you can get
on roku streaming stick so as long as
you have a Wi-Fi signal you can take
this and project videos on any flat
surface pretty cool for travel it'll be
sold on amazon for three hundred dollars
in ships october twenty second but be
sure to check back on cnet for the full
review that your tech news update for
today but we have more details on all
these stories at the blog sina com /
update from our studios in New York I'm
