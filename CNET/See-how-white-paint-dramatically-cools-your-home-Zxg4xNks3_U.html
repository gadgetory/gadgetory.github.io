outside and it gets stifling inside your
house you turn on the air conditioning
of course now we're used to air
conditioning but it's really not a very
elegant solution it's expensive to
install it fails expensively
it's ugly in your yard it's noisy it
uses lots of expensive electricity what
if there was a way to get around that or
at least minimize it by using paint the
original heat control paint is of course
white paint we know that white paint
rejects heat better than darker colors
and you got to want to paint your house
white there are also these additives I
don't think most homeowners know about
this one you can add to any paint they
say it's NASA technology it always makes
me skeptical but let's find out this can
be added to any color paint and they say
it not only rejects heat but it also has
an insulation ability to keep things
warm and finally I've got a kind of a
semi-pro coating here that already has
the UV rejecting components blend it
into it this is an elastomeric coating
which means it's kind of a stretchy
rubbery paint all three of these attack
the idea of heat rejection differently
let's find out which if any of them work
I've got three identical samples of
house siding right here this is
pre-primed gator board and I'm gonna
paint each one of these with a different
one of these paint solutions let it dry
sit in the Sun for a couple hours then
we'll use the heat gun to figure out
which one is rejecting heat better on
the front and transmitting heat less on
the back it'll give us some kind of a
rule of thumb for how well these work we
mixed in the right proportion of the
additive for our two pint sample of
paint and thoroughly mixed the other two
two coats of each paint went on each
sample of siding was dried and then put
out in the full afternoon sun for two
hours and 75 degree web on a laser
temperature gun we found the surface
temp on the plain paint board was about
73 degrees the board painted with the
additive enhanced paint was only a
degree or two cooler and the board with
the pre-mixed UV coating was about the
same now all of these were much cooler
than our cutaway sample of medium brown
stucco by almost 30 degrees on the
backsides of our wood samples we
measured 65 64 and 64 degrees
respectively while the back of our
stucco cutaway was 86 finally we painted
out
half of a real stucco wall with the
high-end pre-mixed UV paint and left the
other half brown to control for
substrate and construction again a
dramatic difference but nothing in our
simple tests indicates that UV blocking
white paint does a better job than just
plain white paint paint of course can do
nothing about humidity which some will
point out is missing at least half the
picture certainly in some climates
then there's the color factor I'm going
to assume that either of those high-tech
coatings we used work better in a white
tint even though they don't have to be
but not everybody wants their house
white especially new clear white but
that's probably the most effective you
got to make a decision</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
