advertisements and sometimes to fight
crime I'm Bridget Carey and this is your
CNET update this tech roundup starts off
with a serious story you may have heard
about a man in Houston Texas
who was arrested for being in possession
of child pornography when Google found
images of child sexual abuse in his
gmail account
Google's tip to police is what led to
his arrest and it has some wondering how
ghoul can detect these images and what
else does Google's scan for in our email
well for starters when you use Gmail you
give Google permission to scan the
content of the messages Google scans to
send you advertising and block out spam
and malware but Google also works with
agencies around the world to put a stop
to child sexual abuse online as part of
that effort when someone or some group
notifies Google about illegal images the
photos are taken off search results and
the illegal photos are also given a
unique digital fingerprint Google's
system scan for that fingerprint it's
known as a hash so it knows when
someone's uploading that photo to Google
services like Gmail Google says it's
only scanning emails for these reported
photos and the system is not scanning
for words that could be associated with
other criminal activity so now you know
how it works switching gears there's a
new gadget for your car that's getting
quite a bit of buzz it's called the
navdy you put it on your dashboard and
it projects information from your
smartphone onto a transparent screen so
instead of looking at your smartphone
you're looking at the alerts straight
ahead of you in the example video the
creators show that you can use hand
gestures to control it along with voice
commands the startup is taking
pre-orders now for $300 during this
crowdfunding phase later the price will
go up to $500 speaking of crowdfunding
remember the great potato salad
Kickstarter project that took the
internet by storm last month
Zach brown asked the internet for a $10
donation to buy ingredients to make some
salad the ridiculous request gained fame
and nearly 7,000 people from 74
countries donated more than $55,000 it
was the fourth most viewed project in
kickstarter history potato salad
attracted more eyeballs than the oculus
rift and looking ahead the next iPhone
may only be a month away it seems Apple
will announce the iPhone 6 on September
9th that's according to a report from
recode and it also falls into place with
apples typical timeline of launching
iPhones in September
that's your tech news update from our
studios in New York I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
