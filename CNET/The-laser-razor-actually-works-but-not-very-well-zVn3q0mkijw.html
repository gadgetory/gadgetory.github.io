to be true it was billed as the first
laser powered razor to give you a close
shave without irritating your skin the
project raised four million dollars on
the crowdfunding site Kickstarter but
after the internet exploded with cries
of scam scarp never got a cent it was
just taken down gone and then we got an
email saying that we're taking it down
because our prototype didn't meet the
criteria that they have for the
prototype Kickstarter said the project
was in violation of our rule requiring
working prototypes of physical products
that are offered as rewards it had
become a trench war between some people
who really liked it and some people who
were determined that it is this is a
scam scarp tried to prove it had a
prototype in this video but critics
weren't convinced and nobody outside of
the company could vouch for it
so I went to see for myself but if the
laser razor was real can't cut through
this many at once right now not with
this fiber but I see them burning
individually err and they're at scarps
lab in southern california the
cofounders showed me how the laser cuts
hair without burning your skin it's an
effect called frustrated total internal
reflection where the laser beam travels
along the length of the fiber and only
escapes when it hits a hair any point
along that wall you touch light won't
leak out and then as soon as you take
away the hair light goes back forward
the co-founders say they also found a
wavelength to cut all hair colors
normally lasers can only cut dark hair
but to keep their findings secret they
ask that we use a camera filter to
disguise the color of their laser see a
few of these falling away as I brush
across the surface and I can smell a
little bit of smoke coming up my
nostrils - it's burning through them as
you can see the prototype cuts one hair
at a time not terribly effective if you
want to shave off a beard in the next
version the company aims to have the
razor shave five to ten hairs at once
and right now you can't run the razor
along your skin to get a close shave on
the prototype the fiber then acts as the
blade is fragile it's attached by hand
that's right and as it hangs here
between those two
points but it's very likely mounted then
it's enough you hit a little bump in the
skin you break it because it's very very
very brittle whoops and broke the fiber
that's why the company says it needs the
funding to get the right fiber and mount
it properly which requires machinery we
know how to mount it in a rigid support
so it doesn't break we spoke to an
optical fiber manufacturing expert who
told us that sounded feasible the
company did manage to raise $400,000 on
another crowdfunding site IndieGoGo so
what does Gustafson have to say to
Kickstarter now I would tell them thank
thanks for all the publicity and there
is always it tomorrow when will we know
for sure if the laser razor can really
shave scarp says it'll ship to backers
in March 2016 skeptics might say that's
cutting it close in Irvine California
