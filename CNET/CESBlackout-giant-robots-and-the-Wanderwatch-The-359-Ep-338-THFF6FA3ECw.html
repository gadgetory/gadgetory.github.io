2018 coming to you live from the scene
on stage at the South Hall of the Las
Vegas Convention Center this is the
final day of our live coverage of this
gadget bonanza and now that the end is
near I find it comforting to be huddled
next to my colleagues Roger Shane and
Ben Fox Ruben we're kicking things off
this Thursday with another super-sized
edition of our news wrap-up podcast the
359 so guys thank you for coming back
and how did everyone survived the
blackout yeah it was definitely one of
the more surreal moments to see yes any
CES is right we need all eyes what
happened was it what time was it Roger
that all the like lights in the central
hall like at 11:15 I run along 50th the
lights shut off an interesting way I had
just started taking a tour of folks
through central hall get kicked out and
basically I ended up standing outside
central hall and talking for an hour
about what it would have been like if
you'd walked into central hall
check out cool 5g no I can't show you 5g
it's all in there but just imagine it
was North Hall North Hall got power back
well they got power back but still there
were some issues I put North Hall and I
mean central hall for those who don't
know this is where all the big yep got
Intel Sony Samsung and as you go through
the booths all you can see is like the
glowing of their smartphone screens and
if you were you were in and so we had
some reporters who were in it and we had
Claire we had Brian Brian Brian Tong and
we were just kind of streaming to like
discuss what was going on inside I was
like right outside talking to folks
people were just waiting from my
perspective there just waiting outside
there's a massive amount of people
trying to go out you couldn't get back
in and their page
waiting outside for some people it was
their last day so they wanted to you
know see the big show they didn't mind
waiting in the temperature was it nice
it was like train it felt hot wort like
it could've been like a barbecue out
there it was like 70 degrees for once it
was you know the day before I wouldn't
be surprised if people started to think
the CES was cursed over the fact that it
was it was like a monsoon the day before
right so we were trying to get around
yeah yeah they closed down their entire
outdoor booth which yesterday was
absolutely mopped there were tons of
people there but the day before on
Tuesday they had to shut it down
completely so apparently hadn't rained
in Vegas in more than a hundred days and
we were lucky enough to fly in when it
did which they're saying cause yeah
definitely related the water buildup and
I think sparked a blowout yeah I don't
know I don't I don't know how
electricity works but the irony of it
this is the biggest texture of the world
in the world in the year and electricity
the basic technology fails on us shows
how easily our society can crumble and
is fragile so I feel like that's a great
opportunity to talk about the giant
robot overlords that are coming for us
oh good oh yeah okay unlike most years I
think there are more robots this year
not just smartphone assistance but like
large humanoid walking robots and I got
to play around with one there's one by
UB Tech the ub tech is a company that
makes a lot of robots but this is their
first walking bipedal robot that can
take on stairs a video of my time with
it with the demo now it's still in the
prototype phase they want to get this
out in 2019 but this is a companion for
the home it can avoid obstacles and go
down stairs they see the home companion
Rosie of the future as Nene legs because
you have to get around the house but it
doesn't have arms yeah that's the first
thing that's how does it grab or help
anything
they were like you know what the arms
they're gonna come in like two years but
they felt that they they felt that they
could sell this next year because of how
much you can do now for the scanning
side so kind like a walking security
guard or walking Alexa they want to have
it either have Alexa or their own
version of Alexa put it inside and and
all these sensors and of course voice
commands you know being able to talk to
you being able to what keep watch on
things like they were talking about
having to be a nanny I'm like huh that's
okay alright a nanny but it also can
play soccer
house yeah it could be a security guard
but like if I if I broke into something
I saw this robot okay if we can get back
to that yeah so it's speaking it fast
not so fast so it can follow an object
but I went too fast this is too fast for
the ball and watch so they can play
games with kids but you know we're still
kind of in that you know beginning stage
you take a dance I would venture that
this thing is what several thousand
dollars it leaves that's the problem is
really the price point is crazy for the
style these companies they're like we're
not going to tell you the price but you
can start to understand that this is
gonna be like a car this is a major
investment we also saw you know Sophia
the walking robot I wouldn't say this is
some that you put in your home it was
more like an example of how creepy
here's the videos first I've seen their
I know if that is an upgrade of my arm
has been out there this is like forever
they call it skin and they think it
could be working a working robot but
yeah another example of her first step
so I guess we're getting that walking
point but then if you want arms if arms
are more important we saw one called the
Aeolus and this one was kind of like a
Rosie the robot of sorts that can roll
them around pick up objects here and
roogie bark got to take a look at it
and it is what I like about it it's also
a vacuum oh so it's not just rolling
around it's cleaning your house and
picking up things and it does the same
stuff as that first one from the Walker
from UB Tech and that it kind of be that
that security guard for the house like
using its facial recognition using its
sensors to see when something's amiss
and report back to you or kind of be
that remote camera and they did put
Alexa in this one so the other one
wanted to this one already has it I
think Alexa's gonna have legs and arms
next yeah I have to say broadly speaking
I don't like any of these I think
they're like you know that LG robot we
had on yesterday
we're like a countertop robot that's
like a little more out of the way you
could put her in the corner whatever if
you if you need to it's but these are
like in your face robot so a lot of
these small ones are like companionship
that you can talk to and be your like
you know talking Alexa but now they're
like oh can we have helpers in the house
or someone who can roam the house for
security so yeah that I don't think it's
not for everyone I have to say I do like
the idea of the the vacuum robot that's
it I think that's how our world is gonna
collapse the robots gonna take over one
clean house at a time
there is another giant robot that I
think is more practical it kind of is
like the in-between and what you're
talking about on the counter and the you
know maybe not so creepy walking around
one it's called the keikar robot we have
video of this one - it's like a smart
home century but also has a projector
built into it so you could watch The
Simpsons and watch movies and tell it
with voice commands you know keikar play
netflix stranger things on the ceiling
or keep your plate in my bedroom and
it's mapping out your house with all
these sensors and a lot of them are
they're actually able to map out where
they are based on their you know torso
sensors or head sensors wherever you got
them and it's basically like a roaming
entertainment system I guess you can say
with a little bit of screener and the
price on this one is about the same as
that Sony AIBO dog it's 1790 so 1070
robot dog yeah yeah I bow is about
if it came to the official price yet
behind it's almost two thousand dollars
yes it is coming cheap if they want a
wiggle and have cuteness Roger I need a
race I'm sorry to tell you I need that
sorry I tell you that robots not in your
near future man all right well on that
note I'm sorry bad and we come back more
cool Texas State stay with us folks hey
folks welcome back to the 359 coming to
you live from CES 2018 in Las Vegas the
lights are on this time we've survived
what could be one of the strangest
moments in history for the show but it
being the final countdown it looks like
Ben that you have brought on the perfect
gadget for this occasion we're joined
with la casa mockers with the wander
watch so yeah tell us a little about
this yeah thank you for having me with
one watch we get kids off the couch and
back outdoors again you know when you
look at toys you see that all in their
toys nowadays are interactive with
lights and sounds for kids it's for kids
definitely yeah it's between 6 and 10 11
before they get a mobile phone so it's
younger and younger but they get it
because they need a communication
function for their parents with their
parents so we actually are kids which
can do everything that a normal kids
watch nowadays does but the best thing I
think is that it's really fun for kids
most kids watches are just a necessity
but not really fun for kids and we
believe that play is the best motivator
to be active and to go outdoors have fun
running around and just you know enjoy
your time out yeah so Ellie I met you at
Eureka Park yesterday and you were
showing me some of the things that this
watch does where it's basically just
these little tools that kids can use for
imaginative play however they want so
why don't we walk through some of the
like for instance there's like a sword
noise that you can yeah yeah yes what we
tried to do and in the meantime I start
the sunset
a game console on it yeah it's like a
game console exactly you know what we
thought is well we have to keep the good
stuff of out of play but we have to put
in the interactive fun of games so we
came out with some sounds up upside down
yeah so imagine you're a police officer
you're catching thieves and you put on
the sirens so those are like sound
effects and stuff yeah exactly but you
found a stick you pretend you're nice
and you hear the stored sense its motion
active it's hard to hear but it's
basically like a little ching ching
ching of like a sigh exactly exactly
it's noise in here but outdoors you
still will hear that tell us a bit about
this too this is this is part of it it
connects with it through bluetooth right
exactly it connects with Bluetooth toys
and for instance we have this magic
beacon and you can pretend it's a
treasure you know one hides it and the
other tries to find it like a hide and
seek game it's hot it's a hot or cold
game you know so and children desire
little games to find it is it is it just
a Bluetooth it's a Bluetooth connection
yeah yeah it's like you can play hot and
cold with it let's try to do do you want
to try to do this Bureau connection - I
thought this was kind of fun
yeah it can connect to bluetooth toys so
it it's just a while to connect so and
that's just an example how it works so
it connects if we just a little patience
it's a we just launched in October and
in the Netherlands where we're based we
are now in 250 shops so basically it
works just by moving your arm so we want
activity so you move your arm back in
the left
I was testing this out backstage and I
was just like Ellie you do it I'm gonna
have it fall completely back oh God nice
catch
thank you so well okay we're showing
some cool games with it but if I'm a
parent and I want to give it's my kid I
want to be able to have it be useful for
me to like so is it have a location and
safety features like that so yeah
definitely sure we have for you we have
a parent's app and you can see where
your child is on the map you can
communicate with your child and of
course we target young children so they
cannot all right and wait at that age so
we have three chat functionalities so
basically you can just very
old-fashioned type a text you can record
your voice message so that's really easy
for every child and parent and you can
make a doodle so for instance maybe I
can show it from my phone and send a
doodle to my kid or is it the kid gets
in a doodle mom both ways yes even to
each other so and what we found out is
kids are creative so they make their own
secret language to each other so we
think it's a functionality and necessity
but children see the fun part again so
is it like phone numbers or just like
user accounts like like how how would i
is it have like phone capabilities I
mean how is this data prepaid SIM card
included it's prepaid because parents
don't like subscriptions for assault
children yeah it's it's included so and
it works already in more than hundred
countries can you actually talk and do
it no you cannot unit you cannot call
with the watch and why is that it's
because we tested that a lot with
children and this generation children
just chance they don't like calling you
know that's our generation that's old
nobody I'm sorry we found out we were
surprised in the beginning and now it's
totally there and another important
reason is that security and safety is
really important with data and from kids
and what we see in Europe that in some
countries this this kind of voice
messaging is already forbidden yeah yeah
so kids watches were cut off the shelf
even so we don't have that problem so we
have a really secure connection you were
telling me also
what it like where this concept
originated from in the first place so
taking a step back here you have three
kids right and this is it this was a big
impetus for why you wanted to do this in
the first place
exactly yeah I see it from my own kids
and they're so glued to the screens and
it was somehow frustrating me and you
know I'm not against Queens you know
there is a lot of fun into it but the
excessive use of it it's it really
frustrated me so I thought well I have
to do something about it that's why we
invented one to watch it's a project I
started off together with my husband so
it's really a family project in the
beginning basically the guinea pigs for
this project yeah definitely you know
kids are really honest and giving you
feedback on what I think about it and I
can tell you your own kids are even more
critical in testing what worked what
didn't what were things did you find
that worked really well and really badly
like what were some of those in the
beginning we thought well we have to
come up with a nice game there is a
story in full if there's a princess or
whatever and then what I explained is no
you know once we started testing and it
just you know it's either watch and I
want to play with it immediately so they
only need to click twice a three time
and they can start playing and I don't
want to run through a whole story and we
only provide the building blocks and so
because out of play
you know it's unstructured play so you
have to use your own creativity and
fantasy to design your game together
with your friends that's important and
we want to keep that part you know you
learn so much of it it's your first
communication skills you learn to have
your risk assessing skills you know all
that kind of stuff that's what you learn
outdoors that's important I think you
hit on something here that a lot of
people are going to be talking about I
want to see more of I know we've been
seeing in the news people talking about
their worries about what's happening to
children and and their addiction to
screens I know I know it's doing
something on my brain always being tied
on so we're all kind of in talking about
this more even
and an Apple executive was talking about
the other day so so thank you for
bringing this by I'm interested to see
where this goes so thank you Ellie for
coming by with this is the wander watch
right okay no more fancy isn't a Dutch
pavilion incense oh very cool very cool
well that's gonna wrap it for us you can
