to the apple pie for all the good and
bad inside the world of Apple and hold
on one second before I starts wanna make
sure you guys can all read this very
clearly all right oh how quickly things
can change but according to the latest
New York Times report Apple will
postpone the launch of the new version
of the Apple TV and won't show off the
device at WWDC 2015 hmm yeah I know how
you feel Apple was still on board to
launch the device for WWDC even up to as
close as mid-may but it changed course
over the last couple of weeks because
the hardware just wasn't ready now this
is a fool kick in the stomach for
someone like me who was anxious to see
what the coop town kids were up to
especially after the recent news that
Apple's long rumored streaming TV
service was going to be a no-show
because the proper deal still aren't in
place an apple is also pursuing streams
of local TV stations to get on board as
well now the hope was we could have at
least seen some of the new things the
Apple TV can do a recent support
document even confirm the Apple TV will
be able to control home kid enabled
accessories when you're away from your
home using an iOS device but now we're
expecting to see none of that all right
new imacs and macbook pros were recently
upgraded so that pretty much leaves us
with the software heavy keynote with iOS
9 + OS 10 10 point 11 with their subtle
improvements we talked about last week
new Apple watch developments and Apple's
new music service the mac mini even if
it gets a speed bump will do anything
for the crowd really WWDC looks to be
good I think it'll be okay but it most
definitely will not be great now Intel
just announced its next-generation
quad-core broadwell processors that
would be a perfect fit for the macbook
pro 15-inch line up the timing of all
this would make them available for
notebooks and desktops in the July
August time frame but with Apple just
refreshing their entire line it looks
like they didn't want to wait so Apple
might just skip this generation and
target Intel's fine-tuned skylake
chipset that's expected to be available
late this year also the Wall Street
Journal confirm the one thing we will
see is Apple's beats bass music
streaming service on june the eighth
there will be no free listening plan
like Spotify but an unlimited on-demand
streaming plan for ten dollars a month
the free music will come through their
itunes radio service and then the
service will be gaining new channels
created and hosted by djs like Zane Lowe
from BBC radio and a New York Post
report says Apple is also in talks to
sign on Drake pharrell williams and
david guetta as guest djs as well Apple
hasn't closed all the deals with the
music labels just yet but we still
expect to see it debut at the keynote
alright a lot of you still keep
complaining when we don't throw a bad
apple in the show and guess what we
don't do it every week unless we really
have to and many times this you just
gets resolved but just to make you the
Apple biters happy we'll play catch-up
so first up the recent iCloud outage
this week yeah that gets a bad apple ah
then that message bug that can be texted
to your phone and chest down it that
gets a bad apple oh also Apple beats
pill XL speaker it's getting a recall
due to a possible fire hazard so that
means up to this point the beats music
acquisition is earned apple- dollars bad
apple and then the rumblings that Apple
is preventing the pebble time watch app
from being approved and they're holding
it off because their Apple watch it's a
bit of a stretch but sure if it's true
bad apple so there hopefully some of you
are all happy now and in the story of
the week this one comes to us from the
San Jose Mercury the clean Bay Area
recycling firm is looking for a woman
who dropped off boxes of electronics
that she had cleaned out of her house
after her husband died now the surprise
drop off included a vintage apple one
computer one of about only 200 first gen
desktop computers that Steve Jobs and
the woz put together now the recycling
center sold it to a private collection
for two hundred thousand dollars and
their policy is to split the proceeds
5050 with the donor they haven't found
her yet but they're still looking and if
I'm guessing they're probably not
looking too hard all right feedback of
the week goes to Emmanuel John Lazaro
who said please eat with manners and yes
you saw this shirt the NBA Finals start
tonight
my call warriors in six but for the sake
of competition and fun even though
Cleveland has no chance at all if the
Cavs somehow managed to best were the
top four greatest teams ever
statistically in the history of the
league let's see with only the 95-96
bulls the 96-97 Bulls better than them
at this moment and the 85 86 Celtics
just trailing them i will wear at
cleveland cavs jersey during the entire
apple byte show as the loser and claim
my dying adoration for the team that LBJ
built and trust me I'm a man of my word
all right that's going to do it for this
week's show you can email me at the
apple byte at cnet com or tweet me at
brian Tong thanks for watching we'll
catch you all next time for another bite
of the Apple Oh Steph Curry with the
shop boy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
