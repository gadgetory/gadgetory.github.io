experts at cnet have been taking stock
of 2012 to compile the definitive list
of technology news and information Cena
100 is a collection of the biggest
stories of the year in technology so
it's all of the trends news stories
technologies and people who mattered in
tech this year spanning those four
categories of trends news technology and
people the scene at 100 is decided upon
by cnet staff who cover analyze and use
tech I'm Scott Stein and this is the
iphone 5 there's a lot of discussion of
what really matters in technology what
the biggest story is both short-term and
long-term which technologies are going
to have the biggest impact on our lives
over the next year or maybe over the
next ten years from the tech curious to
the tech entrenched the cnet 100 is
intended for everyone but for
professionals in the tech sector the
list conserved as a handy roadmap for
the year ahead we hope that in the
future companies will have this in mind
when they're releasing products and
they'll be thinking about where their
products fall in this landscape of the
100 most interesting stories so what
made the cut the heavyweights in the
business left their mark all over the
list Google Apple Amazon and Facebook
their own face in the United States and
they're all doing different things as
far as you know someone's in search
someone's and hardware someone has
content and someone is social media but
how they are really like their emerging
and they are really battling each other
for control and invading each other
space as well every list needs a few
surprises like the product we didn't see
Apple TV but it really has the TV
industry in the tech industry just on
the edge of their seats about is this
coming and if it does come then what
kind of impact is it going to have
reaching well beyond smart phones and
social media technology made headlines
during one of the year's biggest
political stories nate silver and the
rise of just sort of the data in going
into elections and how important that
was this year you know that's not a
technology people holding their hands of
course it's not a consumer technology
but it's extreme
important to the 2012 election of it
leading up to it and there's no denying
that Twitter came into its own in 2012
changing the way we experience global
events like the Olympics and providing
an instant information pipeline its role
in the election of course this year that
people are live-tweeting these events
live tweeting sandy hurricane sandy so
you really saw you know the sort of
disaster in real time oh it's coming
