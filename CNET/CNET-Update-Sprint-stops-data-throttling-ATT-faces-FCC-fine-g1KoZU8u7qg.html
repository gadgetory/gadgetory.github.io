to be I'm Bridget Carey and this is your
CNET update data throttling it's
annoying it feels unfair and ATT is
facing a huge fine for doing it to
customers with old unlimited contracts
you may have been throttled and not even
know it put simply throttling is when a
mobile carrier slows down your
connection speed usually because you're
using more data than it wants you to use
on an unlimited plan now when you're
slowed down it lasts until the end of
the billing cycle and if you're in a
busy area you may be at such a crawl
that you can't even send a photo text
message unlimited doesn't mean unlimited
speed any more ATT stop selling
unlimited plans in 2011 but if you're
like me and you're holding on to your
old ATT unlimited plan from the days of
yore you may have noticed this little
text message pop-up recently your data
has reached 75% of the 5 gig management
threshold bla bla bla and we will slow
you down yada yada
in 2012 AT&amp;amp;T put a 5 gig cap on
unlimited customers but it only started
sending these text messages now we live
in a world where video apps like
periscope are gobbling up data so fast
and social networks are Auto playing
videos and music streaming is all the
rage that it's hard not to go past 7
gigs in a month with casual use which
leaves you always hunting for Wi-Fi
networks and you don't just want to hook
up to any Wi-Fi network because that can
be a security issue this week the
Federal Communications Commission hit
18t with a proposed 100 million dollar
fine for its lack of transparency on
throttling now ATT plans to fight that
feat and argues it did communicate this
to customers and sending text messages
as part of that communication the FCC's
new net neutrality rules went into
effect last week which requires all
Internet traffic be treated equally and
internet providers are prohibited from
blocking or slowing traffic down without
being clear about it up front so it may
not stop throttling it just means
carriers need to be very clear about it
but with these new FCC rules sprint just
stopped throttling for it's unlimited
and it confirmed the change to the Wall
Street Journal it makes you wonder if
other carriers are going to now do the
same let's end on more upbeat mobile
news there's a new type of attachment
for your phone that may have you
thinking differently about your future
camera this is the DxO one it's a small
rippable camera that plugs into an
iphone or ipad charging port giving your
phone DSLR powers 20 megapixels one inch
sensor and f-18 aperture and your phone
screen is showing you all the action
it's for advanced photographers who
value photo quality which is why it has
a 600 other price tag when it launches
in September that's it for this tech
news roundup and there's always more in
