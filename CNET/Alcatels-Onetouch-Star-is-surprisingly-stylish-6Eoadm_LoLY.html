here at mobile world congress 2013
taking a look at the Alcatel OneTouch
start alright so the Alcatel OneTouch
start is a very compact phone as you can
see it feels quite luxurious actually
especially for a phone that's going to
be reasonably cheap along the bottom
here there are these touch sensitive
keys most of the time they dimmed out so
you can't see them but when you need
them you just tap away on the bottom and
they pop up the screen is a 4 inch
AMOLED display it's got a 480 X 800
pixel resolution but that a mole a
technology means that this screen is
just so bright and actually nearly hurts
my eyes looking at it it's very very
rare to see a phone that is going to be
a bit cheaper a bit lower end with a
display that really is this blinding so
that's quite impressive it's got a 1
gigahertz dual-core processor that's not
the most powerful chip out there on
paper but it feels pretty slick to swipe
around you can see it's moving with a
real snap so I'm not too worried about
sluggish performance if I spin it around
on the back it's got a 5 megapixel
camera and if you want to know where the
design inspiration came from this phone
and then just put it next to the iPhone
because it's almost exactly the same
size and shape another piece of good
news is that this phone is going to come
with Android 4.2 jelly bean at launch
which is currently the latest version of
Google's mobile operating system again
with a phone that's a little bit lower
end that's an unusual luxury so I have
to say my first impressions of the One
Touch start are pretty positive this is
a compact phone it feels quite sturdy
build quality seems really high and that
really bright screen is a definite plus
point it's going to be coming out at the
end of februari starting in Western
Europe unfortunately though there's no
word on a US release date yet I'm the
West rages unit and this is the Alcatel
OneTouch star
