our athletes using it for you I mean are
you in like an iPhone guy or an Android
guy where do you say it I'm falling why
do you like it so many apps cameras
clear let's say if I ask Katie like what
are your maybe three apps that you
always use they're a game you can't go
out with what would you think it might
be one is post mates gotta get that food
which one's your kid which one's your
favorite show on Annie
oh nice nice that's good also you know
what I like about you you know although
you're like you know perceived like
superstar you even you really involve
yourself in social media even you'll
call out a reporter when they're
throwing stuff out there that you don't
like well how is being able to access
social media for you how do you use and
what why you like it or maybe why don't
you like it - it's that's on the down a
bit I've toned it down a bit I like to
keep my private place
my progress yeah you know I'd like to I
like to enjoy things without having to
worry about what someone has to say
about it we actually get from everybody
else so I just I've toned it down a bit
but I know the importance of it I know
that it's an easy way to connect I know
it's a great platform as well so I try
to use it you know but I also try to
understand
now we also saw you a lot of people were
excited when they saw you taking photos
on the sidelines of the Super Bowl you
have this like long-range DSLR camera is
that a hobby of yours or you gadget guy
even off the clerk yeah I am a gadget
guy I always tend you know I'm one of
those guys that I had a drone I was
flying drones off summer when I went to
did the bang at the Super Bowl nobody
knew that I did photos you just did that
on your own basically right Oh check
this out yeah I'm no pleasure of you
yeah yeah I'm working with doing G doing
those guys over there and they they gave
me an opportunity I asked if I wanted to
do it at first I was like oh no but then
I was like you know whoever get this
opportunity so why not take it you know
then maybe it was luck pay this last
game which it was and be able to
photograph that that's something I can
tell my grandkids and then last question
if you kind of thought about it if your
phone really could do any this is kind
of a thinker if your phone could do
anything to make your life easier one
thing like it could be something magical
or not what do you think like what would
you want your phone to do for you that I
couldn't do right now I wish I could
just press a button and I'll claim my
whole household I feel like your phone
really can do just about anything
already so it's perfect you know outside
of doing something off the wall and I
think it does everything already so
right now well thanks for time Katie and
yes people watching he has taller than
me sitting down well I'm standing up
this is this is this is legit all right
all right thanks a lot for your time
Ralph thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
