and if you're anything like me you
probably use your smartphone to take
tons of photos from hanging out with
your friends to your lunch to selfies
our handsets have become the main way to
take pictures so today I'm going to walk
you through some simple steps to get the
most out of your camera on the powerful
gs5 Samsung's current flagship device
first be sure to check that your default
settings are tailored to your exact
preferences to adjust them tap the
little gear icon in the corner and
scroll through each of these items
personally I always turn my
compositional gridlines on to help me
frame and straighten out my pictures I
also check to make sure my flash is set
off instead of auto so it doesn't
surprise me and i turn my shutter sound
off because it's just kind of annoying
for frequently change settings you can
have three shortcuts directly accessible
on the viewfinders dash just long tap
any of these settings and drag them over
some settings that samsung turns off by
default that you might want to know are
recording Ultra HD video and video
stabilization now there's one particular
setting here that brings me to my second
tip you've probably seen HDR or high
dynamic range imaging before but the gs5
now has the option to toggle real-time
feedback of what your HDR image would
look like before you take a picture make
this toggle your friend HDR combines
several shots taking at varying levels
of exposure and composites it into one
image this can result in really striking
almost surreal photos that have great
contrast sometimes though it can also
create unnatural images that you might
not like so be sure to check by tapping
on and off the HDR icon which is
represented by this little Venn diagram
looking icon here once you like what you
see click the shutter third familiarize
yourself with photo effects you can
access some of them directly on the
camera through the settings menu here
it's indicated by the magic wand icon
and displays the filters in real time if
you know you'll never use some of these
effects scroll all the way to the bottom
tap on manage effects and hide it by
unchecking it here other effects can be
applied after you take the picture these
are accessible through the photo manager
just go to your gallery tap on this
Polaroid with a pencil
icon and several options will appear if
you tap on the one icon that we saw
before you'll see even more like pop art
Impressionists and light flare which
turns your picture into a low-budget JJ
Abrams movie fourth get to know
selective focus this is a new gs5
feature that lets you change the focal
point of your picture by manipulating
the depth of field pictures can look
more professional and even dramatic you
have to turn this option on before
taking a photo so it's good to have an
idea about it while you're shooting to
turn it on tap the icon with the two
human heads in the camera dash the
device will tell you that for best
results stand at most a foot and a half
away from the closest object the object
itself should also be at least four and
a half feet away from the background tap
on the object you want in your
foreground and click the shutter it'll
take a few moments for your handset to
process but afterward go into your
gallery by tapping on the bottom right
square to initiate selective focus click
on the icon here with the two little
heads three options will emerge near far
and Pam focus near will bring your
closest object into focus and blur out
everything behind it far sharpens only
the background and pan gets everything
in focus when you're finished tap done
to save your changes and there you have
it four basic steps to get the most out
of your GS 5s camera remember there are
tons more editing features packed in
this little guy but this should get you
started on the right foot for more GS 5
tips and for the written tutorial head
on over to how to cnet com and if you
have any questions or comments hit me up
on Twitter I'm Lynn and happy shooting</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
