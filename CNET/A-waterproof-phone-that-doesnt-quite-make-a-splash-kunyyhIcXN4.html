we're checking out the Kyocera hydro
icon it's $150 smartphone available from
Boost Mobile and it's notable because
it's built to military grade
specifications so the icon doesn't
necessarily look like a foam but
especially rugged it isn't covered in a
giant plastic case and it isn't
incredibly thick or anything like that
but it's actually water resistant up to
1 meter about 3 feet and it's shockproof
and dustproof and it's actually a pretty
sturdy device under the hood is a 1.2
gigahertz quad-core processor
it's not the fastest CPU on the block by
any means but it's actually pretty
decent I tried a bunch of pretty
hardware intensive games and they all
ran fairly well which isn't bad for a
phone that's $150 without a contract
inside you'll find eight gigs total of
internal storage space but only about 4
gigs are actually accessible to the user
so you're going to want to get a micro
SD card the phone can support up to 32
gigs of expandable storage so the icon
is two cameras there's a two megapixel
shooter on the front and an eight
megapixel camera on the rear it's not a
great camera but it's not terrible if
you've got you know a steady object that
you want to shoot and you've got nice
lighting you can get some decent
pictures out of it where the phone does
fall flat however is on call quality and
data speed the icon runs on boost mobile
and Boost Mobile doesn't actually offer
its 4G LTE service in San Francisco
proper you're going to look further out
into the Bay Area that means here in San
Francisco you're going to be stuck on 3G
which is pretty slow for things like
downloading apps or uploading photos to
social networks the phone also struggles
with call quality now when I called
people I could generally hear them
rather fine we'll get to hearing them in
a moment
but when I spoke to people I would often
get complaints about echoing or sounding
like I was at the bottom of a wall which
is kind of unfortunate but as for
actually hearing people Kyocera has been
in baking something rather interesting
into their phones they're calling it the
smart sonic receiver if you look at the
top of the phone you'll notice there's
no traditional speaker for you to place
your arrogance and that's because built
into the phone
right at the top here is a transceiver
that actually pumps vibrations through
the hard cartilage in your ear and that
makes things sound incredibly clear
unfortunately that means that you're
here you're going to hear every crackle
hiss and pop of boots Mobile's Network
which isn't exactly an optimal
experience as with most smartphones
you're gonna want to check the coverage
area before you buy in so what about
that military grade rating well it works
and by that I mean you can dunk the
phone into a bucket of water and it'll
continue to function now there are
caveats of course if any water gets
under the back plate somehow then the
phone is going to be destroyed no matter
what but it forms a really nice tight
seal and it shouldn't be problematic if
you're careful with your phone so now we
get to the ultimate question who is this
phone for well at $150 it's not very
expensive at all and there's no contract
Boost Mobile plans start at $40 it ended
60 and that gets you unlimited data at
4g LTE speeds of course that LTE
coverage isn't going to mean much if you
live in an area that boost mobile
network simply doesn't reach I'm Nate
Ralph you can read the rest of the
