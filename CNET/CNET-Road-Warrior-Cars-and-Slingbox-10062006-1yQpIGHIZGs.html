com and welcome to road warrior where we
take a look at the hottest gadgets for
life on the go coming up we've got new
in-car navigation options from HP ipaq
and OnStar and a new Porsche but first
off new sling boxes the slingbox if you
don't know let you watch your home TV
anywhere you want John Falcone shows off
the three new models the entry-level
model is the slingbox tuner that takes
it works with any analog cable or
antenna source then we move on to the
slingbox AV that can control any set-top
box such as cable box satellite box or a
DVR top model the line is the slingbox
pro that's this big one down here that
can actually take up to four inputs and
it's the only one in the line that can
accept a component HD input so it
doesn't matter what kind of TV service
you have you can watch it from your
laptop and budget motels across the land
now let me ask you something do you
think GPS is too expensive and
complicated OnStar thinks they have the
answer Brian Cooley demonstrates there's
this little phone button here on the
mirror you go to that and you say i'm
already route preview turn right onto
powell street then turn left onto a
street so the appeal of this system is
twofold first of all a lot of folks
don't like to play with computers and
most in-dash navigation systems are
playing with a computer so this is much
more simple push the button tell the
nice friendly person where you want to
go and they send some simple directions
to your dashboard and the robot keeps
talking you through it the cost is only
ten dollars a month added to your OnStar
service and if you get tired of it just
cancel however if you want to hold it in
your hand you want more than just
directions Bonnie cha has the HP ipaq RX
5900 PDA and a gps device and it's got
this really great sleek design so it's
great to use in the car you can
transport it easily between cars you can
use it on foot as well it's running tom
toms navigation software so you get
voice guided directions and text-based
directions and 2d and 3d map view
and Bonnie says you can also surf the
web on it and listen to music finally
Brian Cooley caught up with the new
Porsche Targa fresh from the paris auto
show this new version of the target
which Porsches debuted at the 06 paris
auto show continues in that vein with a
panoramic glass roof which has come to
define the modern Targa's and further
back on the car the rear lift sup for
cargo access brian says you could call
it the first Porsche hatchback how
gauche Brian that's it for this edition
of road warrior I'm Tom Merritt check
back next time for more gadgets to keep
you armed and dangerously productive</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
