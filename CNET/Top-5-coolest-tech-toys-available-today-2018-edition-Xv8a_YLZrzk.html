of fire-breathing dragons and He Who
Shall Not Be Named coming in at number
four is the Spin Master hero droid bb-8
if you're going to have a droid of your
own why not go big the Star Wars hero
droid bb-8 stands at 16 inches tall 19
if you're counting the antenna it comes
with a controller lets you control it
like an RC vehicle another mode

activates Follow Me mode that's right if
you want to have bb-8 just hang around
you will actually the remote control you
could number three is the Jurassic world
alpha training blue if you've ever
wanted a pet dinosaur this is your
chance you can train blue to respond to
you via touch and in response to the
actions of the remote control the lead
designer even told Cena this is the most
complex toy Mattel has ever made it's
been 145 million years since anyone had
the opportunity to play with a dinosaur
this realistic don't risk waiting
another 145 million years number 2 is a
Lego a controlled Batmobile you've got
321 pieces to put together you'll wind
up with a Batmobile it looks a bit like
the tumbler from the Christopher Nolan
series popping batteries and you'll be
able to control your handmade Batmobile

up and drive like a bat out of now that
puns even too dumb from
