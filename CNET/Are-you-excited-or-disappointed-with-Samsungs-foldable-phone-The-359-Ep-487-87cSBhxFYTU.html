Ben Fox ribbon well samsung's foldable
smartphone is real the cup we showed off
the device I'll be in a very very short
cameo with less lights little light
darken the lights I was the cameo at the
end of its developer conference keynote
what do you think this now this exists
it's real we saw it then what were your
first impressions I think the whole idea
is very exciting to create an entirely
different concept for a phone / tablet
and that is you know in an innovation
that's been going on for for many years
we've been expecting this for a long
time
that being said people should kind of
have measured expectations for the first
go-around ultimately the it's going to
be expensive
I'm sure mhm and the apps probably
aren't really gonna be there and it's
probably kind of clunky it's interesting
right they've got they tad the multi
active app multi active window I don't
know what it's all basically the ability
to handle three apps at once Google's on
stage to talk about how Android will be
supporting foldable phones so I mean
there seems to be a lot of forces behind
it that that that's gonna make this you
know more than just a gaming device yeah
but let's let's admit the fact that it
could end up becoming a new gimmick
device and good good for Samsung and I
think LG is also another one of these
guys that's working on these types of
concepts they're always well up yeah
they're not gonna stop at foldable
phones they said that they're gonna be
working on rollable and stretchable
displays as well these are really
futuristic ideas but whether customers
are gonna go for this right the price is
gonna be right and also whether the
content is actually gonna be like why
would I need a rollable phone yeah those
are all important questions that asking
that first generation even second
generation of the foldable phone it's
gonna be pretty rough and remember the
first galaxy no it was not that
well-received was a little clunky the
first curved display the galaxy round
was a complete flop it did lead to sort
of the infinity display that we have now
so you know these are definitely
stepping stones to something greater we
just don't know one that's actually
gonna happen yeah I I would
angry and so let's let's be cautiously
optimistic that this might be a big
transition away from the rectangular
phones yeah we all know today so next up
CNN has its review of the Facebook
portal that is the smart speaker slash
video chat device
bottom line it's our our own Megan
Walton says it's an expensive device has
a slightly awkward design but really
overall casting shadow over all that are
these lingering privacy concerns
do you trust Facebook enough to have a
portal in your home no no I personally
don't and I've talked to enough
consumers that don't trust Amazon or
Google yep to have live mics and
potentially live cameras in their home
so that's a big ask from Facebook and I
think is it our own Ian sure wrote a
story about saying like hey guess what
the timing on this was really awful yeah
and he's right absolutely
how many Facebook is coming off probably
the worst year ever right between came
Gianluca between the breaches then then
they go hey guess what we've got a cool
product for you now we've got hardware
it's got a camera on everything in your
home so so facebook messenger
enthusiasts may buy this it may actually
find a market so calling it completely
dead on arrival I would hesitate to say
that there there might still be a market
for this thing but I think that it's an
enormous uphill battle for them agreed
lastly let's talk about the best
smartphone you you can't buy in the US
this is the huawei mate 20 pro it's got
a long list of features in display a
fingerprint reader it's got three rear
cameras one of which has a 40 megapixel
sensor it's got you know water-resistant
it's got the knotch
it basically hits every list every check
on that list of flagship phones but you
can buy in the US do you have a like a
dollar value on like what it would cost
if it was in the US it's somewhere I
mean it's like the same kind of like
thousand dollar plus okay flagship it's
absolutely like priced I get two
thousand dollars or anything notes
it's right now just to be exact Amazon
Lister teen hundred dollars okay so it's
yeah that's it's definitely a high-end
device it it throws in everything is
there any chance it could make it to the
US at this point no I mean you can buy
it unlocked
it's not gonna be optimized for any
carrier no carrier and no US retailer
right now is willing to sell Huawei
device mmm that is too bad they go for
more of those stories cuz I seen it
I'm Roger Chang I'm Ben Fox everybody
ace will sing you know sometimes I'm
convinced that you guys like a hurry in
to the end just to see if you can catch
me sleeping whoa what how we were
friends we're casually talking about
this topic in the lake if you wanna hear
more about these topics if that's the
point where I look at the timer go well
we're way let's wrap this up now so and
again like you said three years and you
still haven't gotten used to that no I
never gotten worse give this yeah give
us give us another few so we and we did
run out of time but I do want to provide
people with a little bit more context
about why US carriers wouldn't yeah yeah
well obviously the security concerns
there have been long-standing security
concerns with Huawei you know the fear
is that you know why waste God's
software or something in its devices
that allow it to spy there's been
associations between Huawei and the
Chinese government the founder of Huawei
is an ex Chinese military so you know
none of these links are are have ever
been publicly established you know the
the US government's never gone on record
just to really specify what the real
risks are it's always been rumors but
it's you know it's definitely has effect
I think 18 teen Verizon we're all set to
sell Huawei phones at the beginning this
year but you know something happened
calls are probably made and they turned
around they just are they are talking
about
more they probably thought it wasn't
worth it Best Buy was selling these
devices laptops phones they stopped
selling them at the beginning of the
year and so really the huawei has been
shut out here in the US and it's been
happening more or less quietly it's not
like a tariff or like a ban no like a
public ban there is no public ban it's
just serve you no calls roommates things
were happening in the background also in
of always just shut out you shame if
something were to happen to that
business of yours Best Buy to benefit
was called medium buy it's a free show
it's our Friday show we're gonna be lame
as opposed to what you're right
I mean thanks Bryan was always gonna be
lame like I'm here just laying truth
bombs okay on to questions yeah
questions first off a shout out to
Miguel who's joining it for his first
live show welcome
what do you think about a scrolling
phone that starts out wait for it as a
pen yes I like it yes let's go wild with
these ideas why not what happened well
yeah actually I could work I could see
it and then you flip it around and be
like here we go I've got my pen phone is
it work as like a real pen that would be
really fun well yeah it'd have to work
you know it would just look like a pen
stylus we're getting into some serious
James Bond inspector but yeah that's
what I like talking about foldable
phones is that yes you kind of your
imagination gets away with you and you
start thinking about it's the same
concept as like flying cars or delivery
drones right you know you start to think
about how technology could really change
in in really very different ways in the
not-too-distant future
yeah and that's but it is understandable
to see a lot of people already
describing this phone is like a
potential gimmick or a flop for sure for
sure and I think I mean it could very
well be a gimmick but that's generation
one I respect
generation two or three you know once
they start polishing the product up once
other companies start building foldable
phones if like Apple got into it all
sewn there be sort of an arrow
legitimacy to it so it's yeah it's still
early days it probably will be gimmicky
but it's a it's a first step we need to
have that first step yeah and I think
Samsung has obviously presented itself
as being very committed to this idea
that they don't intend like they've put
like years of R&amp;amp;D into this already so
my expectation would be that even if the
first generation didn't sell well
they're probably not gonna give up on it
that quickly no no I think well
ultimately I think once you start seeing
some of this technology get integrate it
into its flagship phones that's when it
starts to take off right that's sort of
what we saw with the the galaxy round
which was this curved display that like
curved inwards like this it was kind of
terrible but it was gave yeah it was
sort of the first example of like of
rounded corners which got moved into the
galaxy note and then into the Galaxy S
naught or the Galaxy S line then became
a mainstream thing right it's like the
one of the flagship features of its of
its marquee phones are these like
infinity displays they're curved a
little bit and so it took a while it
took several years but like that's
become a mainstream thing and you sort
of see that with foldable phones like
the idea that this starts out with
gimmicky gimmicky device and maybe a
flop it might be super expensive no one
really buys it but it translates down to
or get trickles down to more of its
mainstream devices right and they'll be
smart to name it something else
yeah not one of their flagship starting
off hello what do we got Brian more
questions with all the hype about the
foldable phone does this mean that the
flip phone is going to make a comeback
flip or sliders I want them back and
that's from our friend Timothy I don't
know the slider was that that would kind
of feed the purpose of having a mobile
phone but the sidekick
what we saw what we saw essentially was
I know you remember the Nokia
communicator it was like a it looked
like a candy bar foam but you can fold
down half and then there was like a
larger display and keys it's kind of a
mini laptop this is I felt like this is
like a reincarnation of that but like
what
touchscreen because it has this front
and it doesn't have any like there's no
there's no seam or anything there's no
seam in the middle which is which that's
the innovation that's the big thing
right that there's no hinge it is one
seamless screen I don't I don't know
about flip folks I guess you can call it
a flip phone cuz it does flip out a
little fold out right it's dessert those
are long gone this is we're moving into
yeah yeah like the actual like clamshell
flip phones I think that's we're done
with that but as far as that fold goes
Ryan's wondering if we're ever gonna
actually see a line like what the
durability rating on this is going to be
before that thing starts to crease oh
that's a yeah that's fantastic question
I think that's I mean we're gonna see
once this thing hits the market next
year you know they were very cagey about
letting people see I think after the
event you know we Jessica dole course
should our tip can they're on the ground
I think they both asked about seeing it
and they were completely denied so and
they address this on stage they said
that they created this type of screen
with the expectation that it would be
opened enclosed thousands and thousands
of times so they're obviously very aware
that if you're gonna plunk down serious
money on this kind of thing and this is
part of the design concept then you you
want to make sure that it works and it
works for years yeah so I'm gonna go
ahead and bring up this comment from
Dasher because I agree with it
wholeheartedly he says to me the
presentation on the phone was sketchy
with all the dark Oh totally yeah the
two screens showing up what what the
hell was it like okay we are all in the
ecosystem we understand what a prototype
is what are you hiding they dress this
also on stage they said that they
intentionally avoided showing off
certain design features I think they put
it they put it in an encasement as well
so it looks clunkier it looked clunky on
stage than it actually was they said
they read he said they intentionally hid
certain design elements now that was
either they put it in an encasement or
they dim the lights but they definitely
didn't the lights yeah huh yeah that's
for competitive reasons they know that
there are other like manufacturers out
there working on this guys a small
Chinese startup just launched a foldable
phone like two days earlier
so I mean we do have a hands-on on that
device as well so yeah it's true the
competitive threat is real there are
definitely other companies working at
Lenovo showed off foldable stuff Huawei
says it's working on something so yeah I
mean it's been the competitive reason I
think it's also they haven't finished
the design right there's still months
away from the final product and I don't
think they want to tip their hand that
that much months before they're actually
launched this thing like I'll give him
crap for like turning on the lights and
like making it dim but like I kind of
understand why they would do something
like that you know they're trying to
show off the core feature of the phone
without actually showing the phone off
right I will allow the and this probably
goes to dashers question is is that it
is possible they were trying to hide the
fact that this is a really clunky first
gen product that's entirely possible and
if and when that we we do see a fuller
version of this we'll find out and you
know they'll they'll have to explain why
it looks so ugly because just because
yeah yeah did you by the way what did
you think about front screen it felt
like kind of small yeah it was kind of
weird but then again I was operating
under the assumption that they they were
intentionally hiding certain parts of it
so is it possible that it's a little
sleeker when they actually come out with
it I'm not sure I mean beyond just
sleekness like I felt like the screen
was small I guess that's just sort of
the the consequence of having it being
like foldable like having like one half
of the screen but yeah so uh devil's
advocate Storm King wants to get us to
speculate on pricing oh I'm gonna go for
I mean for a cool mm yeah that's what I
was gonna say yeah yeah this is also
this is like super like bleeding edge
tech yeah I wouldn't be surprised if it
went above that but uh two grand is a
lot
it is a lot yeah and no five Jesus
tablet yes yeah but it's a tablet and a
phone so if you really calculate the two
together it's it's a steal yeah like the
it's going to take year
to develop the app store for foldables
oh yeah the that market like just the
content needs to catch out and that's
why you saw it being shown off at the
developer conference right they wanted
to get this in front of the developer
audience so they can start thinking
about apps to take advantage of this you
know their companies are tried like I
like to bring up the ZTE axon em that's
that with two screens that folds out
it's got that really ugly hinge in the
middle that that kind of breaks it from
being a seamless bigger phone you know
they've had they've tried to foster the
development community obviously with
with mixed results but they've showed
some interesting apps to me that take
advantage of that dual screen setup and
so like I can see like there are some
fairly easy or obvious apps that could
take advantage of this right market
already exists yeah you could see like
certain games at least that we're much
better on the tablet that would work for
this I mean I can see like running
fortnight in the top half having like
either control pad or like or a place to
like message or your teammates at the
bottom you know like really I can see a
lot of like legit multitasking you could
do on a mobile device
yeah but then no I'm thinking just put
in a physical keyboard that's really bad
idea I mean there are accessories that
do that if maybe maybe you would have it
fold out without any hinge or anything
and then you would sidekick the bottom
there would be like a sidekick keyboard
that would flip it folds out as well
yeah underneath I believe Larry you're
about half a step away from Soundwave
from Transformers yes oh and then yeah
one of the accessories comes out and
folds out into a robot or a bird yeah
eyes away there absolutely and a boom
box
we need the boom box what's there's a
tape recorder it was a boom box that so
yeah Soundwave was a boom box last
blaster blaster leads the boom box
Soundwave was the tape recorder
what is the difference it's a tape
recorder it records your they both play
tapes 1987 all right fine whatever okay
I'm glad you actually brought that up
with the the sidekick keyboard because
sir enjoy is wondering if blackberry can
get back in the game now that we're on
this whole like clunky squid phone train
again oh sorry
you know what's interesting is that when
they when they announced the was it
proved they the the BlackBerry proved
actually used a curved display they
actually like borrowed Samsung's
technology to create a curved display on
it
mmm-hmm I don't know why I brought that
up but no I I can't imagine blackberry
which the phones are made by a Chinese
company called TCL which I mean they've
done work on like foldable displays and
all that stuff I've talked I talked to
them about it beginning here they have
they had no plans at all to you know
introduce foldable phones in the near
future
they're pretty behind the curve at this
point so what are they they're focused
you see how it makes TVs though so they
do have like they are they do have
technology with that that could
manipulate glass but I don't think it's
a priority for them yeah yeah I'm still
waiting for stretchable I guess nobody's
asking questions about that because it's
so out into the future yeah like I don't
even know how that would work you've
stretched but that would you like would
you push it back into a smaller size in
like how would it maintain its
elasticity over time no idea my favorite
eye my favorite concept is is that it's
your everything device where it's your
phone during the day you come home
stretch it out to a 65 inch TV and slap
it on the wall I'm like what a cool idea
but that would be amazing
well I might not live long except I'm
late I like to multitask so I like to
have my phone as I watch my TV so that'd
be a little that's true yeah during
commercials yeah so I could text my wife
like yeah Shawn Vega is really running
with some creative ideas here in the
chat he's wondering if Microsoft and
Samsung could get in the bed together
and then you could get the Samsung
Microsoft Plus keyboard plus S Pen
foldable amalgamation monster win I
don't know how exactly that might pan
out but I just I'm enjoying watching his
thought process yeah well it would just
be like a sphere that you would push a
button on the top and turn into like a
fully operational desktop that's
possible sure
I mean Samsung already has the sfn so
it'd be interesting to see if they
include an S Pen in this down the line
because I think once you fold it out as
the giant screen like that stylus
actually would be great if you're
absolutely true or you sketched or even
just taking notes like that would be
great
although I don't notice when you fold
out the phone I mean because of the
design it's kind of clunky to hold it's
hard to say yeah you haven't really held
on to this yeah it looks like the big
innovation is that they got rid of the
hinge but yeah based on a hinge it
that's what it look like on stage it was
like this it's so when you open it
hopefully it locks in place in a certain
way that it's that's part of what I was
wondering is is it doesn't have a
locking position are there different
hinge points that it can lock to
different degrees
well we ordered this thing just like a
floppy napkin dollar floppy now I would
assume yeah I would think that from a
design perspective if you can't lock it
in place as a tablet how are you
supposed to like watch a movie on an
airplane or something right now you lock
it well then you in terms of a movie
watching experience I mean this the
display was kind of squarish so I don't
know what you know given the widescreen
format of video like how much larger
that video experience is gonna be on the
on that square screen yeah it's about
what was it a 7.3 inch screen so
obviously bigger than most phones yeah
but yeah square but square so that's not
exactly the format you you want for
video mmm it's worked pretty well for
this podcast yes hello I'm calling you a
bunch of squares alright that's enough
time speculating on this weird product
that they unveiled in the deepest
darkest shadows over well we'll have
plenty more on that and yes in months to
come but great questions so far let's
switch gears real quick and talk about
Facebook because they are the Giants
corrupt that any parent would be proud
to disown so if facebook leaves out the
camera
option or starts offering the camera as
an add-on and say like a Gen 2 would
this be a better product is it strictly
down to the fact that Facebook is under
fire for a lot of security concerns and
privacy concerns that their their timing
is so bad
could they salvage this in another form
well this is really marketed as a
messaging or video chat device so if you
take the camera out don't you sort of
take out the core element of what this
is exactly what I was gonna say yeah I
do
III appreciate where this question is
coming from in that it does rely k-- it
improves privacy yeah but it also
basically kills off the whole point of
the device to begin with Facebook isn't
really a big content player so having
the screen there I guess you would watch
like what do they have Facebook TV or
C's book watch Facebook why nobody
watches maybe you would use it for that
but anybody that wants to buy this thing
is buying it because it can do video
chat which most smart displays do video
chat the only one that doesn't at this
point is the Google home hub and we'll
see how well that sells we're still
although we've we've gotta find it I've
also heard comments from people that
because a Google home hub doesn't have a
camera it's really more you know the a
picture frame or a smart home hub people
are actually attracted to that because
of the fact that it doesn't have camera
right I am they feel comfortable like
putting in their bedroom right yes yeah
I wrote least sorry about more
comfortable it's it's very interesting
to me that Amazon created a product
that's a similar size with a camera that
they very explicitly mark it as a
nightstand like for us put it in your
bed and and they're not and they don't
put a shutter on it or anything they're
like look you either trust us or you
don't and if you trust us you trust us
enough that you're gonna put a camera
right by you in your bedroom yeah Google
took a completely different approach to
that but their executives did tell us
that they're not like philosophically
like they're not like 100% we're never
gonna do a camera they might bring a
camera in another generation so we'll
we'll see how well it sells right
all right we got time for just one more
let's take it from our old friend Sir
Andrew a facebook messenger messenger
light to be specific had the best video
quality on and a video calling quality
on Android last time I checked a few
months ago how is the software
implementation in the video chat in
facebook portal it's a good question
you have to watch in watching Meghan's
video yeah I'm gonna get it back running
again it looked pretty damn sharp I'll
give it that much I'm still not
interested in it specifically as a user
because I'm not ok I do not care about
video calling
but yeah the picture quality looked
clean granted they're calling probably
each other over the same Wi-Fi there in
the old smart home so as far as like a
long distance might go I can't really
vouch for it but it look the picture
looks good that's all I can really say
I'm also wondering if this is kind of a
new some more go system play for for
Facebook and they have plans on building
I mean like didn't they create a whole
like skunkworks or a hardware lab like
this is gonna be the first of many new
pieces of hardware that they might come
out with so it's kind of funny that this
would be the first one right but I'm
interested to see where they build off
from this is it building 8 is that the
skunkworks I think so maybe if it sounds
about right but yes there there is uh
there is a unit within Facebook that
does these kinds of experimental
projects so yeah maybe we'll see more
hardware although know if this thing you
know elicits the kind of backlash or has
a list of the back kind of backlash I
don't know if they're gonna be hitting
the gas or more products down the Lion
time John alright those are some really
fantastic questions everybody but we are
out of time it's been a really solid
week and we want to thank you again for
joining us and while I'm at it tomorrow
is national pie day apparently as it's
the 314th day of the year
celebrate that how you will also
tomorrow would have been Carl Sagan's
birthday very nice let's let's all raise
a toast to the late great mr. sagen I
just want to say that as a fan myself so
I mean I know Freddie died what is it I
think the book is called dragons
of Eden yes it was it won a Pulitzer and
it's a fantastic book definitely pick it
up from mr. sagen so and I believe there
is a Cosmo season two forthcoming with
uh Neil deGrasse Tyson so the legacy
lives on
yeah and by the way pi day is March 14th
so I don't know what you know it's it's
an alternate pi day because it's the 314
I know my year I celebrate pi day choice
why not it's it's a cool number
I'll eat pie I have some apple pie at
home I'll eat it there we go alright
it's been a great week but we'll see you
all next week 359 is available on iTunes
