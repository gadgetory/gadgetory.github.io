bluetooth headphone that's not only
sweat and rain resistant but also has an
integrated heart rate monitor it's one
of the better any ER wireless sports
headsets currently available but it's a
bit pricey at $200 hi I'm David Carr
noise and I like this sports pulse
headphone better than jobbers earlier
Bluetooth model the rocks which costs
around $100 now the biggest reason I
like it better is that it fit my ears a
lot better and I think there's a decent
shot that it will fit your ears securely
and comfortably it helps the Jabra
includes various wings and silicone tips
to customize the fit and the heart rate
sensor is designed to rest against the
bottom of your ear opening there's an
inline remote and microphone for making
cell phone calls and the headphone comes
with a nice little carrying case to use
the heart rate monitor you have to
download the free Jabra Sports life app
which is available for Android and iOS
users I thought the app was good you can
do timed runs in the app will track your
current heart rate as well as your
average heart rate over the course of a
workout it saves your history updates
your distance and pace with intermittent
voice prompts and includes some built-in
tests in a music player that allows you
to tap into your music library
alternatively you can use a music
service such as Spotify while the Jabra
app is running you can also use the
headphone with other fitness apps like
Nike Plus and RunKeeper if you can get a
tight seal the sound quality is pretty
decent though I wouldn't say these offer
fantastic sound they're a little bright
and you do lose quite a bit of bass if
you don't get a tight seal for casual
listening while you're working out they
do a good job but as I said I tight seal
is crucial to maximizing sound quality
and if you're working out hard that
tight seal will be hard to maintain
battery life is rated at around four and
a half hours that's not great but most
of these in-ear bluetooth headphones max
out at around 5 hours so it's within
expectations as I said I like these
jabbers and I was able to get a secure
comfortable fit which is critical when
you're dealing with a sports headphone
the heart rate sensor works well and
seems to be accurate but not everybody
needs that feature and
you don't you can save some money by
going with a headphone like Plantronics
backbeat fit but if you are looking for
a headphone with an integrated heart
rate monitor the pulse is certainly
worth considering
despite its higher price point I'm David
Carr noise thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
