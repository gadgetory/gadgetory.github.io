going to take a first look at the
samsung DV 457 electric dryer come on
let's check it out the dryer turns on in
just a few seconds the touch of a button
and right away we see this 8 inch LCD
touchscreen with this menu that gives us
all the functionality that you want
we've got the basic settings here in the
middle and then we can go through and we
can change the mode just by scrolling up
or down it's really easy to select the
different mode that you want it's really
easy to customize it and if you look
over here you've got other settings as
well like turning the light on inside or
the child lock or using your phone this
try our retails for 1499 it's definitely
a high-end machine if you want to get a
gas version it's going to retail for
1599 but from a high-end machine it
gives us a lot of the features that
you'd want to see you've got smart
control here at the top and that'll let
you start stop pause or even change the
cycle remotely from your phone it's got
this option here to save a custom cycle
that will let you wash specific things
with specific settings and remember them
to do at the same time next time you can
use the delay start to have a dry run
hours after you walk away from it
perhaps you want to have the dryer run
just before you wake up you can go to
work with nice warm toasty socks over
here on the Left you'll find all the
usual suspects of dryer settings don't
get delicates permanent brass heavy duty
but if you scroll down you'll see you
have steam settings you have refresh
mode which is great for cleaning things
you couldn't clean before you can throw
it throw pillow inside of it or maybe
set of old sneakers and you can use
steam to give it a quick clean or you
can go with wrinkle away which uses
steam to get wrinkles out of clothing
and that's something that i would love
to use every day because i hate to iron
if you open the dryer up will find the
seven and a half cubic foot stainless
steel drum it's got your link guard
right there it's got the light
comes on automatically and it also has
moisture sensors so it can detect
exactly how dry your clothing is and
know when to shut off automatically so
how well does the DV 457 work well you
can bet that we're going to find out
because we'll be putting it through our
test and we'll be sure to let you know
we've seen that I'm right Chris</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
