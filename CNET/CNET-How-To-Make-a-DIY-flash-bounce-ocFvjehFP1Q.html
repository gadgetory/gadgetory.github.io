quality photos and videos but carrying
one around can be a bulky hassle not to
mention if you're carrying around your
external flash as well if you want to
pack light
leaving this at home might be your best
option today I'm going to show you how
to get great results using your camera's
internal flash and a business card you
probably found that the internal flash
of your camera comes in handy when
shooting indoors or in low-light but can
sometimes be too harsh on your subjects
and result in red eyes using a flash
bounce allows you to deflect the light
of the flash upwards to spread it around
the room and fill things in better for
example when I take a photo using just
the flash by itself you can see how
Irene's face is nice and bright maybe a
little too bright but the background
falls off to darkness and looks pretty
murky now when I add the bounce card and
take a shot she still looks good but now
everything else in the shot is more
evenly lit and natural-looking and much
more appealing in my opinion there are
products that you can buy that will work
for your camera but why buy something
when you can make it for free this trick
works for most popular DSLR cameras like
the canon rebels and select Nikon models
as long as they have exposed hinges like
this to make your own any standard size
white business card will do to get
started pop up the internal flash of
your camera there's usually a button on
the side that'll do that for you then
take the business card and place the
shorter side against the Hindoos of the
flash you want to press hard enough so
you get indents on the bottom of the
card now take a pair of scissors and
make two cuts about an inch long where
the indents are then slide the card in
between the hinges of the camera
I recommend placing it at a 45 degree
angle but you can experiment with the
angle when you're taking photos that's
all there is to it you should start
noticing the difference in your photos
right away best of all is that this
takes up a lot less space than this
