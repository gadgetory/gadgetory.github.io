kinds of things I'm your host I as actor
for some tech companies getting you
interested in their products is really
easy Apple and Google enjoy lots of
attention but there are other companies
who desperately want you to notice them
sometimes they even turn to endorsements
by famous people today we're counting
down the top 5 strangest celebrity tech
parents at number 5 Ashton Kutcher and
Lenovo back in October of 2013 lenovo
chaps Ashton Kutcher as a product
engineer yeah really the first product
he helped produce was the yoga tablet to
pro a 13 inch android tablet Kutcher
said that he thought the yoga tablet to
fro would be best tablet in the world we
reviewed it here at cnet it was actually
pretty good with a unique design that
included a projector built in at number
4 is Lady Gaga and polaroid in 2010
Polaroid named a new creative director
and her name was Lady gaga released
that's her stage name at CES 2011
holroyd and Lady Gaga introduced a
number of new products under the grey
label brand including a pair of glasses
with a camera built-in and a mobile
printer the glasses never made it past
the CES demo but that mobile printer did
make it to market as you know the
partnership was super successful and we
all carry Polaroid products every day
okay so that didn't happen reports
surfaced in October 2014 then Lady Gaga
and polaroid were no longer working
together at number 3 Robert Downey jr.
and HTC 12 million dollars that's
reportedly the amount of money HTC paid
Robert Downey jr. to be the face of HTC
in 2013 down he was and is still red hot
in Hollywood thanks to his fantastic
performance as Tony Stark and Iron Man
in a number of movies the thing is
Robert Downey jr. is
to iron man in a cici's ads were
definitely interesting to use a word but
HTC is still having a hard time
competing with Samsung and Apple even
with the celebrity endorsement other
companies like Samsung and TCL both paid
to have their products place in Marvel
movies samsung even showed off in
Avengers watch and Tony Stark's gadgets
at CES 2015 maybe Potter placement would
have been a better bet for acc at number
two alicia keys and blackberry yeah so
this happened Alicia Keys was named the
global creative director for blackberry
in January 2013 at the announcement keys
talked about a scholarship program to
help women and technology this odd combo
seemed to start seriously Keys told
people she was a blackberry exclusive
then in February a tweet appeared on
Keys Twitter account that red started
from the bottom now we're here no big
deal right yeah except the tweet said it
was posted via twitter for iphone keys
claimed her account was hacked anyway
this stint lasted about a year and now
we're here what time is it I don't have
my watch but i think it's Twitter time i
asked you guys what do you think are the
strangest text celebrity endorsements
Alex reminded us that at one point they
were television ads with Jerry Seinfeld
and Bill Gates Isaac chose a recent but
amazing one Gary Busey for Amazon fire
TV thanks for your feedback and on to
number one and the number one weird
parent Oprah and Microsoft tour
Microsoft the company took a big risk
introducing its own computer with the
surface tablet it chose to partner with
the incredibly influential Oprah Winfrey
and Oprah named the surface one of her
favorite things she said the surface
Microsoft's first tablet feels like a
mercedes-benz to me people yeah then a
wonderful tweet goddess a love that
surface have bought 12 all ready for
Christmas gifts what's the problem it
was sent via Twitter for iPad
that does it for us remember if you'd
like to get an idea of upcoming top
fives or even have your tweets read on
air follow me on twitter i'm at ayahs
thanks for watching and we'll see you
