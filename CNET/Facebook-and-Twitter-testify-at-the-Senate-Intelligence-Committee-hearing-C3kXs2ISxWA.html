like to welcome our witnesses today Jack
Dorsey chief executive officer at
Twitter Jack welcome and Sheryl Sandberg
chief operating officer at Facebook I
thank both of you for being here with us
this morning before I make my remarks I
want to say a few words about our
colleague our friend and committee ex
officio member Senator John McCain John
could be blunt and he could be direct
but when it came to committing himself
to a cause that he believed in John
McCain was without equal this Senate
this deliberative body with its history
and its traditions will survive the
passing of John McCain but there can be
no denying that the place is a little
smaller without him we will continue to
do the important work we do here with
passion resolve and a sense of purpose
born from moral conviction John would
want that in fact he would insist on it
from each of us my friends if I can
borrow the phrase Arizona's Arizona's
losses our loss in our loss is America's
loss John McCain will be dearly missed
and as you can see we have set his spot
on the dice today jack Cheryl is the
committee we've learned more about
social media over the last 18 months and
I suspect most of us ever thought we
would in a lifetime we've learned about
social medias boundless potential for
good and its ability to enable
thoughtful and engaged interactions on a
global scale but we've also learned
about how vulnerable social media is to
corruption and misuse the very worst
examples of this are absolutely chilling
and a threat to our democracy
see the founding ideal of different
people from different beliefs and ideas
all living peacefully under a single
flag the committee takes this issue very
seriously and we appreciate the fact
that Facebook and Twitter are
represented here this morning with an
equivalent and appropriate measure of
seriousness the purpose of today's
hearing is to discuss the role that
social media plays in the execution of
foreign influence operations in the past
we've used terms like misinformation and
divisive content to describe this
activity now as we go into our fourth
and final hearing on the subject I think
it's important that we be precise and
candid with our language because that's
what the significance of this threat
demands we need to be precise about the
foreign actors we're talking about we
need to be precise about the
consequences of not acting and we need
to be candid about where responsibility
for solving this problem lies two weeks
ago your companies announced a series of
successful disruptions that resulted in
the removal of 652 Facebook pages groups
and accounts and 284 Twitter accounts
based on their violating your company's
standards of coordinated manipulation
and inauthentic behavior Google's own
internal security teams did commendable
work disrupting this influencer
operation and we would have valued the
opportunity to speak with them at the
appropriate level of corporate
representation nevertheless their
efforts should be acknowledged in a
departure from what we've all gotten a
little accustomed to this activity
didn't come from Russia came from Iran
my instinct is to applaud the diligence
and of your security teams and credit
you with taking the problem very
seriously but I'm not sure your success
is the big story here as I understand it
a third party security team was crucial
to identifying the scope of the Iranian
activity and even more concerning is
that more foreign countries are now
to use your products to shape and
manipulate American political sentiment
as an instrument of statecraft Jack I'm
pleased when informed about your efforts
to improve conversational health at
Twitter I think that kind of initiative
can do a lot to improve the transparency
of public discourse on your platform and
foreign influence operations thrive
without transparency Cheryl I fully
support Facebook's hiring of the right
security experts building the necessary
technologies and collaborating across
law enforcement commercial cybersecurity
and social media company lines
I think the observation that no one
company can fight this on their own is
spot-on
unfortunately what I described as a
national security vulnerability and an
unacceptable risk back in November
remains unaddressed that risk and
vulnerability was highlighted yet two
weeks ago without questions positive
things are happening the without
question positive things are happening
the collaboration dedication and
resources and demonstrate willingness to
work with us are critical and valued by
every member of this committee it takes
courage to call out a state actor and
your companies have done that but
clearly this problem is not going away
not even sure it's trending in the right
direction I'll go back to what I said up
front we need to be candid about
responsibility and by that I mean both
the responsibility we have to one
another from one side of this Dyess to
the other as participants in this public
policy discussion and more importantly
our shared responsibility to the
American people technology always moves
faster than regulation and to be frank
the products and services that enable
social media don't fit neatly into the
consumer safety or regulatory constructs
of the past the old definitions that
used to differentiate a content
publisher from a content facilitator are
just not helpful here I think that
ambiguity has given rise to something of
a convenient identity crisis we're about
judgments about
is and isn't allowable on social media
are to episodic to reactive and to
unrestricted people are affected by the
information your platforms channel to
them that channeling iddin passive or
random it's a function of brilliant how
algorithms and an incentive structure
that prizes engagement none of that is
under attack here what is under attacked
is the idea that business as usual is
good enough the information your
platform disseminates changes minds it
hardens opinions it helps people make
sense of the world when you control that
or you influence that a little a little
of it you're in a position to win wars
without firing a shot
that's how serious this is we've
identified the problem now it's time to
identify this solution Cheryl and Jack
I'm I'm glad you decided to appear and
your willingness to be part of the
solution from disappointed Google
decided against sending a the right
senior level executive to participate in
what I truly expect to be a productive
discussion if the answer is regulation
let's have an honest dialogue about what
that looks like if the key is more
resources or the legislation that
facilitates information sharing and
government cooperation let's get it out
there if it's national security policies
that punish the kind of information and
influence operations we're talking about
this morning to the point that they
aren't even considered in foreign
capitals than less acknowledge that but
whatever the answer is we've got to do
this collaboratively and we've got to do
it now that's our responsibility to the
American people I offer closing point
this is for the witnesses and the
members alike there are no unsolvable
problems there's only the will to do
what needs to be done or it's absence
with that I turn to the vice chairman
for any go Thank You mr. chairman and
let me first of all comment and echo
your comments about our colleague and
friend John McCain I hope we all take
his advice to continue to put country
first
welcome to the witnesses as the chairman
has pointed out today is an important
public discussion I'm pleased that both
Facebook and Twitter have sent their
company's top leadership to address some
of the critical public policies policy
challenges I look forward to a
constructive engagement and say though
I'm deeply disappointed that Google one
of the most influential digital
platforms in the world chose not to send
its own top corporate leadership to
engage this committee because I know our
members have a series of difficult
questions about structural
vulnerabilities on a number of Google's
platforms that we in lead answers for
from Google search which continues to
have problems surfacing absurd
conspiracies to YouTube we're
russian-backed disinformation agents
promoted hundreds of divisive videos de
Gmail were state-sponsored
operatives attempted countless hacking
attempts google has an immense
responsibility in this space given its
size and influence I would have thought
that leadership that Google would have
wanted to demonstrate how seriously it
takes these challenges and actually take
a leadership role in this important
discussion unfortunately didn't - choose
to make that decision but for the two
companies that have chosen to
constructively engage and to publicly
answer some difficult and challenging
questions again thank you that would be
an understatement to say that much has
changed in the aftermath of the 2016
campaign with the benefit of hindsight
it's obvious that serious one restate
mistakes were made by both Facebook and
Twitter you like the federal government
were caught flat-footed by the brazen
attacks on our election even after the
auction you were reluctant to admit
there was a problem I think in many ways
it was pressure that was brought to bear
by this committee that led Facebook
Twitter and yes Google to undercover to
uncover the malicious activities of the
russian-backed internet research
research agency activities on each of
your platforms now each of you have come
a long way with respect to recognizing
the threat we've seen important action
by your companies to make political
advertising more transparent and we
discussed this yesterday by complying
with the term senator Klobuchar and I
put forward in the honest ads act in
addition as the chairman mentioned since
last September you have identified and
removed some bad actors from your
platforms the bad news I'm afraid is
that there's a still a lot of work to do
and I'm skeptical that ultimately you'll
be able to truly address this challenge
on your own
I believe Congress is going to have to
act first on the disinformation front
Russia has not stopped Russian linked
information warfare exists today just
recently we saw the two of you take
action to take down suspected Russian
operations we also know Microsoft
uncovered Russian attempts to attack
political organizations and potentially
several political campaigns the Russians
also continued to infiltrate and
manipulate American social media to
hijack our national conversation again
you've gotten better and I've pleased to
see that you've begun to take action but
also the Russians are getting better as
well they have now become harder to trap
worse now that the Russian PlayBook is
out there other adversaries as we saw
recently like Iran have joined the fray
but foreign based disinformation
campaigns represent just a fraction of
the challenge before you in the same way
that BOTS trolls fake pages algorithmic
gaming can be used to spread fake news
these same tools can be used to assist
Financial stock pumping fraud to create
filter bubbles and alternative realities
to incite ethnic and racial violence and
countless other misuses imagine the
challenge and damage to the markets if
Ford communicate if forged
communications from the Fed Chairman
were leaked online or consider the price
of a fortune 500 company stock if a
dishonest shorts
or it was able to spread false
information about the company's CEO or
the effects of its products rapidly
online Russian disinformation has
revealed a dark underbelly of the entire
online ecosystem and this threatens to
cheapen American discourse weakened
privacy erode truth and undermine our
democracy on a previously unimaginable
as we move into artificial intelligence
use of deep fake technology during the
2016 election campaign the Russians
demonstrated how bad actors can
effectively marry offensive cyber
operations including hacking with
information operations I'm afraid that
we're on the cusp of a new generation of
exploitation Pinet potentially
harnessing hacked personal information
to enable tailored and targeted
disinformation in social engineering
efforts that future should concern us
all as someone who was involved in the
tech industry for more than 20 years
I respect what this industry represents
and I don't envy the significant
technical and policy challenges you face
but the size and reach of your platforms
demand that we as policymakers do our
job to ensure proper oversight
transparency and protection for American
users in our democratic institutions the
era of the Wild West in social media is
coming to an end where we go from here
though is an open question these are
complicated technological technological
challenges in Congress has at times
demonstrated that it still has some
homework to do I do think this committee
has done more to understand the threat
to our democracy posed by social media
than any others and I want to commend my
colleagues on this committee for
tackling this challenge in a bipartisan
way has been mentioned this is our
fourth public hearing on the subject and
we've met behind closed doors countless
times with third party researchers with
government officials and with each of
the platforms we've done the work and
we're positioned to continue to lead in
this space
again as the Chairman's already
indicated today's hearing is not about
gotcha questions or scoring political
points our goal today is to begin to
shape actual policy solutions which will
help us tackle this challenge now I've
put forth some ideas that I'd like to
get your constructive thoughts on for
instance don't your users have a right
to know when they're interacting with
bots on your platform isn't there a
public interest in ensuring more
anonymized data is available to help
researchers and academics identify
potential problems in misuse why are
your terms of service so difficult to
find and nearly impossible to read much
less understand why shouldn't we adopt
ideas like data portability datum
immunization or first party consent and
after witnessing numerous episodes of
misuse what further accountability
should there be with respect to the
flawed advertising model that you
utilize now these are just some of our
ideas we've received a lot of positive
feedback on some of these ideas from
both experts and users we've also been
accused of trying to bring about the
death of the Internet I'm anxious to
hear your views on our proposals and
suggestions your team's can bring to the
table on this front we have to be able
to find smart thoughtful policy
solutions that get us somewhere beyond
the status quo without applying ham Ann
to 20th century solutions to 21st
century problems at the same time we
should be mindful to adopt policies do
that not simply entrench the existing
dominant platforms these are not just
challenges for our politics or our
democracy these threats can affect our
economy our financial system in other
parts of our lives I'm hopeful that we
can get there I'm confident in American
ingenuity and I'm optimistic that
Congress led by this committee in a
bipartisan four fashion can move this
conversation forward I look forward to
the discussion and if we shade the
hearing to be called Thank You mr.
chairman I thank the vice chairman at
this time I'd like to swear on our
witnesses if I could ask both of you to
raise your right hand you solemnly swear
to give this committee the truth the
full truth and nothing but the truth so
help you God please be seated
Edie the Sandburg I'd like to recognize
you first and then mr. Dorsey for any
opening statement you'd like to make the
floor is yours
Thank You chairman burr vice chairman
Warner and members of the Select
Committee thank you for giving me the
opportunity to speak with you today my
written testimony goes into more detail
about the actions were taking to prevent
election interference on facebook but I
wanted to start by explaining how
seriously we take these issues and talk
about some of the steps we're taking
free and fair elections or the
foundation of any democracy as Americans
they are part of our national identity
and that's why it's incumbent upon all
of us to do all we can to protect our
democratic process that includes
facebook at its best Facebook plays a
positive role in our democracy enabling
representatives to connect with their
constituents reminding people to
register and to vote and giving people a
place to freely express express their
opinions about the issues that matter to
them however we've also seen what can
happen when our service is abused as a
bipartisan report from this committee
said Russia used social media as part of
and I quote a comprehensive and
multifaceted campaign to sow discord
undermine democratic institutions and
interfere in US elections and those of
our allies we were too slow to spot this
and too slow to act that is on us this
interference was completely unacceptable
it violated the values of our company
and of the country we love
actions taken show how determined we are
to do everything we can do to stop this
from happening the threat we face is not
new America has always confronted
attacks from determined well-funded
opponents who want to undermine our
democracy what is new is the tactics
they are using to stay ahead we all need
to work together as chairman burr said
government law enforcement industry and
experts from civil society and that is
why I'm grateful for the work this
committee is doing at Facebook we're
investing in security for the long-term
as our defense has improved bad actors
learn and improve - and that's why
security is never a finished job we have
more than doubled the number of people
we have working in safety and security
and we now have over 20,000 people and
we are able to review reports in 50
languages 24 hours a day better machine
learning and artificial intelligence
have enabled us to be more proactive in
finding abuse in the first three months
of 2018 alone over 85% - the violent
content we took down or added warning
labels - was identified by our
technology before it was reported these
are expensive investments but that will
not stop us because we know they're
critical our first line of defense is
finding and shutting down fake accounts
the source of much of the inauthentic
activity we see on Facebook authenticity
matters because people need to trust
that the content they're seeing is valid
and they need to trust the connections
they make we are now blocking millions
of attempts to register false accounts
each and every day we're making progress
on fake news we're getting rid of the
economic incentives to create it and
we're limiting the distribution it gets
on Facebook we demote articles rated by
third party track fact checkers as false
we warn people who have shared them or
who are about to share them and we show
them related articles to give them more
facts we've also taken strong
to prevent abuse and increased
transparency in advertising today on
Facebook you can go to any page and see
all the ads that page is running even if
they wouldn't be shown to you for
political and issue ads you can also say
who paid for the ads how much was spent
and the demographics of the people who
saw them we're also going to require
people running large pages with large
audiences in the United States to go
through an authorization process and
confirm their identity
these steps won't stop everyone who's
trying to game the system but they will
make it a lot harder as these past few
weeks and months have shown this work is
starting to pay off in July we removed
32 pages and accounts involved in
coordinated and authentic behavior in
August we removed 650 pages and accounts
that originated in Iran as well as
additional pages in account from
accounts from Russia and just last week
we took down 58 pages and accounts from
Myanmar many of which we're posing as
news organizations we are focused as I
know you are on the upcoming us midterms
and on elections around the world our
efforts in recent elections from Germany
to Italy to Mexico to the Alabama
special Senate election show us that the
investments we are making are yielding
results we also know as chairman Barr
said that we cannot stop interference by
ourselves we're working with outside
experts industry partners and
governments including law enforcement to
share information about threats and
prevent abuse we're getting better at
finding and stopping our opponents from
financially motivated troll farms to
sophisticated military intelligence
operations we don't have access to the
intelligence government have access to
so we don't always know exactly who is
behind these attacks or their motives
and that's why we will continue working
closely with law enforcement
chairman Berg I want to thank you for
your leadership
vice chairman Warner I want to thank you
for your white paper which has so many
ideas on how we can work together to
strengthen our defense
senators let me be clear we are more
determined than our opponents and we
will keep fighting when bad actors try
to use our site we will block them when
content violates our policies we will
take it down and when our opponents use
new techniques we will share them so we
can strengthen our collective efforts
everyone here today knows that this is
an arms race and that means we need to
be ever more vigilant as chairman burr
has noted nothing less than the
integrity of our democratic institutions
processes and ideals is at stake we
agree and we will work with all of you
to meet this challenge thank you thank
you Miss amber miss Dorsey the floor is
yours I have to turn the mic on Thank
You chairman bair vice chairman Warner
and the committee for the opportunity
for the opportunity to speak on behalf
of Twitter to the American people I look
forward to our conversation about the
work we're doing to help protect the
integrity of US elections and elections
around the world I'm someone of very few
words than typically pretty shy and I
realize how important it is to speak up
now if it's okay with all of you I'd
like to read you something I personally
wrote as I consider these issues I also
go and tweet this out now first I want
to step back and share our view of
Twitter's role in the world we believe
many people use Twitter as a digital
public square to gather from all around
the world to see what's happening and
have a conversation about what they see
in any public space you'll find inspired
ideas and you'll find lies and deception
people who want to help others in unify
and people who want to hurt others and
themselves and divide what
it's a physical and digital public space
is greater accessibility and velocity
we're extremely proud of helping to
increase the accessibility and velocity
of a simple free and open exchange we
believe people will learn faster by
being exposed to a wide range of
opinions and ideas and it helps them
make our nation and the world feel a
little bit smaller we are proud of how
that free and open exchange has been
weaponized and used to distract and
divide people and our nation we found
ourselves unprepared and ill-equipped
for the immensity of the problems that
we've acknowledged abuse harassment
trail armies propaganda through BOTS and
human coordination misinformation
campaigns and divisive filter bubbles
that's not a healthy public square'
worse a relatively small number of bad
faith actors were able to game twitter
to have an outsize impact our interests
are aligned with the American people and
this committee if we don't find scalable
solutions to the problems we're now
seeing we lose our business and we
continue to threaten the original
privilege and Liberty we were given to
create Twitter in the first place we
weren't expecting any of this when we
created Twitter over 12 years ago we
acknowledge the real-world negative
consequences of what happened and we
take the full responsibility to fix it
we can't do this alone and that's why
this conversation is important and why
I'm here
we've made significant progress recently
on tactical solutions like
identification of many forms of
manipulation intending to artificially
amplify information more transparency
around who buys ads and how they are
targeted and challenging suspicious
logins and account creation we've seen
positive results from our work we're now
removing over 200% more accounts for
violating our policies
we're identifying and challenging 8 to
10 million suspicious accounts every
week and we're throwing over a half
million accounts from logging into
Twitter every single day we've learned
from 2016 and more recently from other
nations elections how to protect the
integrity of Elections better tools
stronger policy and new partnerships are
already in place
we intend to understand the efficacy of
these measures to continue to get better
but we all have to think a lot bigger
and decades past today we must ask the
question what is Twitter incentivizing
people to do or not do and why the
answers will lead to tectonic shifts in
Twitter and our industry operates
required changes won't be fast or easy
today we're committing to the people and
this committee to do that work and do it
openly we're here to contribute to a
healthy public square' not compete to
have the only one we know that's the
only way our business thrives and helps
us all defend against these new threats
in closing when I think of my work I
think of my mom and dad in st. Louis a
Democrat and a Republican for them
Twitter has always been a source of joy
a source of learning and a source of
connection to something bigger than
themselves they're proud of me proud of
Twitter and proud of what made it all
possible
what made it possible was that was the
fact that I was born into a nation built
by the people for the benefit of the
people where I could work hard to make
something happen which was bigger than
me I treasure that and will do
everything in my power to protect it
from harm thank you
jack thank you very much for that
testimony and I might add that the vice
chairman and I commented as you grow
older you will find a need for a bigger
device to go to your no son then that
small one we have a hard time with
small pieces of four members we will do
seven minute question rounds today for
planning purposes we will break it
approximately 10:45 for five minutes
just to let our witnesses stretch and
take a breath and we will limit today's
hearing to one round will try to
accommodate any members that might be
called in the Judiciary Committee but
want to try to get back but I know that
they've got their own challenges with
that I would recognize myself for seven
minutes
this question is to both of you how
would you define social media for this
committee and more importantly for the
American people and I'll start with you
miss ember social media enables you to
share what you want to share when you
want to share it without asking
permission from anyone and that's how we
meet our mission which is giving people
a voice and I think what's more
important than just the content people
shares the connections they make social
media enables people to celebrate their
birthdays in the last year people have
raised 300 million dollars on Facebook
on birthday funders for nonprofits they
care about safety check millions of
people in the worst circumstances of
their lives have let their loved ones
know they're safe and small businesses
to grow all around the country I meet
with small businesses from a woman
making dresses in her living room and
selling them on Instagram to a local
plumber who are able to find their
customers on Facebook and then able to
grow and hire people and live their
American dream I believe it's really
important to to understand how the
people see it and we believe that the
people use Twitter as they would a
public square and they often have the
same expectations that they would have
of any public space for our part we see
our platform as hosting and serving
conversations those conversations are on
the public you think there's a lot of
benefit
to those conversations being in the
public but there's obviously a lot of
risk as well we see that news and
entertainment are actually byproducts of
public conversation and we see our role
as helping to not only serve that public
conversation so that everyone can
benefit even if they don't have a
Twitter account but also to increase the
health of that conversation as well and
nor do that in order to do that we need
to be able to measure it we need to
understand what healthy participation
looks like in a public square and we
need to amplify that and more
importantly we need to question a lot of
the fundamentals that we started with
twelve years ago in the form of
incentives when people use our product
every single day when they open our app
up what are we incentivizing them to do
not telling them what to do where are we
actually incentivizing them to do and
that certainly speaks to the buttons
that we have in our service all the way
to our business model Sandberg this
question is for you one root problem
that we see is that users don't truly
understand the types of data that are
being collected on and off your platform
how is that data shared with advertisers
or others to deliver targeted
advertising and what vetting is any do
you do on targeted advertising to
prevent hostile actors from targeting
your users for their products Center
it's a really important question because
it goes to the heart of our service we
sell ads and we use information that
people share with us or share with third
party sites to make those ads relevant
to them but privacy and advertising are
not at odds in fact they go together
when people share information with us we
do not give it to advertisers without
their permission we never sell data and
they have control over the information
we use
again for both of you and I'll start
with you mr. Dorsey what's your
company's ability to collaborate with
other social media companies in this
space we have a we have a real openness
to this and we have established a more
regular cadence with our industry peers
we do believe that we have an
opportunity to not only create more
transparency with an eye towards more
accountability but also a more open way
of working in a way of working that for
instance allows for a review period by
the public on how we think about our
policies but more so taking some of the
lessons that we have learned and
benefited from in the open source
software space to actually think about
developing our policies our enforcement
and also our products going forward
we've been experimenting a little bit
with us recently but we would like to be
a company that is not only hosting an
open conversation but is also
participating in that open conversation
so we're more than open to more
collaboration and not just with our
industry peers but with scholars
academics and also our government
partners thank you I think where
collaboration has greatly increased
we've always worked closely with law
enforcement and we continue to do that
and particularly the FBI's new task
force we've always shared information
with other companies but I think we are
doing better and we can continue to do
better mr. chairman you noted in your
opening remarks that some of the tips we
got from came from a private security
firm in our mind that's the system
working our opponents are very
well-funded
they are very organized and we are gonna
get those tips from law enforcement from
each other from private firms and the
faster we can collaborate the faster we
share those tips with each other the
more the stronger our collective
defenses will be a last question from
the chair again both of you and I'll go
in reverse
first miss amber if a foreign influence
campaign is detected on your platforms
is there a defined process by which
other platforms are alerted to the
campaign that you've discovered so our
security teams have been in close
contact and so right now when we find
something we are reaching out to our
companies other companies to do it and
working more closely together we've been
talking about how I think there's still
room for improvement there I think we
can do more to formalize the process
we've had a series of meetings and I
think we're gonna continue to work and
we can do better
mr. Dorsey this is not something we want
to compete on we hosted our peer
companies or our offices just in the
past two weeks on this very topic and
helping to increase our cadence of
meeting and also what we can share if
there were in the currents we would
immediately look to alert our peer
companies and this committee and our
government law enforcement partners
thank you for that let me just say in
closing that I hope both of you if you
see impediments that exist in your
ability to notify or to collaborate as
it relates to nefarious actors that
you'll certainly make this committee
aware in cases where we can help with
that vice chairman Thank You mr.
chairman
I'm indicated my opening statement I
hope we can move forward on the policy
discussion so I'd like to get your
thoughts on some of the ideas I and
others have suggested and I want to
start with you mr. Dorsey
I think after some initial false starts
it does really appear that you've
committed to a shift in your company's
culture with respect to the safety and
security on your platform and obviously
we've I've been impressed by some of the
increasing efforts you've taken a
question I have though is that obviously
on your platform there are a lot of
automated accounts or BOTS and there's
nothing inherently good or bad about an
automated account
in fact there are certain ways certain
very good things that come out of
certain of some of these automated
accounts but do you believe that an
individual Twitter user should have the
right to know when he or she is being
contacted whether that contact is
initiated by a human being or a bot I
believe that first and foremost anyone
using Twitter has the right to more
context around not only the accounts
that they're seeing but also the
information and would that go as far as
actually having a a policy on your
platform indicating I wouldn't ask you
to take down them but at least allowing
the user to know whether that contact
was initiated by a human being versus a
machine as far as we can detect them
we can certainly label and add context
to accounts that come through our API or
it becomes a lot trickier is where
automation is actually scripting our
website to look like a human actor so as
far as we can label and we can identify
these automations we can we can label
them and I think that is useful contact
sentence an idea that we have been
considering over the past few months
it's really a question of the
implementation but we are we are
interested in it and we are going to do
something along those lines it's not
going to solve the problem but I do
think giving that indication to users
would allow them to then perhaps make a
little more judgement because we had for
example back in early August we had a
panel of experts and they were saying
that that some of the content in terms
of plural content and I'm not talking
about total tweets but total political
content was 25 to 30 to one on the far
left and far right generated by either
foreign actors or automated accounts and
my question is doesn't that volume on
the extremes drown out real conversation
and political conversation amongst
Americans regardless of where they fall
in the political spectrum it does in the
shared areas of Twitter so that there's
two main categories of usage in Twitter
one is the people you follow and those
tweets end up in your timeline two are
the more common shared spaces like
trends and also replies that's where
anyone could interject themselves and
that's where we see the most gaming of
our systems and that's where we've also
made the most progress in terms of
identifying these patterns and shutting
them down before they spread too far so
we that is independent of our work on
automation because we're seeing the same
patterns through human coordination as
well well that's where I hope and I
appreciate your comments about the
willingness to notify a user whether
it's a human being or a machine
contacting you I also think that there's
room for improvement on that some of the
high volume Twitter accounts to really
do a little bit of extra examination
miss Sandberg let me move to you and
obviously in a digital economy I think
data increasingly represents a single
greatest asset you have obviously it's
part of the the advertising model that
you've created but I think most users
are actually pretty much in the dark
about how much data is actually being
collected on them what is actually worth
and I think as we've seen from other
fields like health care the fact that we
have such a lack of price transparency
really makes health care reform really
challenging I think some of that lack of
price transparency and value within
social media also exists so I'd like to
to personalize does a Facebook user have
a right to know what information you are
collecting about that user yes and we
really agree with you that people who
use facebook should understand what
information is being used how it's used
and the controls they have we've worked
hard to simplify this we've put out
things like privacy shortcuts which show
you all your settings in one place and
something called download your
information where you can download all
of your information in a portable way
and be able to take it with you and see
what it is
wouldn't that I understand that I think
you've making progress there but again
if a user has that information he or she
may not know the value
wouldn't it be actually helpful to your
user to actually be able to then put
some valuation on the data you're
collecting from the user and
was that in a way so that people
actually know what their information is
worth so mr. vice chairman I think this
is one of the proposals you laid out in
your white paper and like all of this
you know we don't think it's a question
of whether regulation we think it's a
question of the right regulation that
supports users is transparent and
doesn't squash innovation and we're
happy to work with you on the proposal I
just think it's it's more price
transparency is always better and I
think this would be something that would
help users sort through I mean there is
another question and we've talked about
is there is there anything even with a
willing user
are there any rights or or or details
about an individual user that they
should not be able to give up or consent
to being having used because I don't
understand the question is this is there
some at at some point
are there certain pieces of personalized
information that a user shouldn't be
able to voluntarily give to you in their
place like yours or Twitter I think
there are and I think there are many
ways users have control over what they
do I also think there are probably
corner cases of law enforcement holds or
security matters where information is
critically important I just wonder
whether just the question of whether you
can consent away all of your all of your
rights ought to be something we had a
discussion I only got a few more seconds
let me just Samberg you you made mention
in your opening testimony the fact that
sometimes political actors are using the
platforms really to incent violence I
mean I think you've made at least some
mention of miramar we've obviously seen
a great tragedy take place there were
hundreds of thousands of Rohingya
Muslims are fleeing and in many ways the
UN High Commissioner has said that faker
counsel on Facebook has incented that
violence I mean do you believe that
Facebook has both a moral obligation and
potentially even a legal obligation to
take down accounts that are actually
incentivizing violence I strongly
believe that in the case of what's
happened in Myanmar it's
stating and we're taking aggressive
steps and we know we need to do more
probably the most important thing we've
done is ramped up our ability to review
reports and Burmese I would just
appreciate your comment that it's but is
the Facebook would have both a moral and
legal obligations so sorting through
what that would look like so that if
there were other platforms that weren't
being is responsible there ought to be
some there ought to be some sanctions so
I look forward to working with you on
that issue as well
Thank You mr. chairman Underwood thank
you thank you both for being here today
this is I think the third hearing we've
held over the last year so forth
chairman says the fourth that we've had
on this issue and I think the problems
really well laid out we've spent hours
and hours and hours talking about this
and what the issues are and what the
problems I'm still not hearing what very
specifically how we're getting after
this I know there's some things being
done I tend to agree with you that no
matter what's done as long as this as
long as these platforms are there
there's going to be people finding their
way into it to do bad things and
obviously everybody wants to get that
reduced as much as possible and I'm glad
you hear that you you and the entire
industry are trying to do something
about this this the entity up here that
I serve in there are lots of people that
would love to help you run your
organization's through what we call the
regulatory process I hope that that
isn't all of them obviously and
hopefully it isn't even a majority of
them but they will that there will be
and you've already seen efforts in that
regard but you're gonna have to do
things yourselves to try to get around
this so that we don't have the horrible
things happen that spawn that type of
regulation so I'm gonna I want to drill
down a little bit who in each year
companies yeah that who sets the
standards or the description of what a
coordinated manipulation or inauthentic
behavior is who what what entity do you
have in each of your company
who make these determinations Miss Anne
Burke if we start with you our policy
team is setting those and our security
team is finding them and coordinated in
authentic behavior means behavior on our
site that's inauthentic so people are
not representing themselves to be who
they are to be and coordinated means
they are coordinating it and they can be
coordinating with authentic actors and
coordinating with inauthentic actors
both are unacceptable when the team is
sitting there meeting is there generally
unanimity amongst them on something that
a fact situation is comes in front of
them it is this something that is easy
to recognize people are unanimous about
it or do you wind up with debates as to
whether or not a certain platform should
be shut down I think on a lot of issues
we face like hate speech there's broad
debate when it comes to what is an
inauthentic actor which is a fake
account posing as someone they're hard
to find but once we find them we know
what they are and what about the
chairman referred to standards in his
opening statement what who sets the
standards they same committee the same
group of people and are they published
so that a user can look at that and see
what what well give me give me some
examples of standards that are
unacceptable in the coordinated and
authentic behavior or in general in
general yeah so we publish our community
standards comprehensively and what that
does is define what's permitted on
Facebook and what's not permitted on
Facebook so some examples are bullying
is not permitted hate is not permitted
language that leads to violence is not
permitted and this is published in
detail publicly mr. Dorsey where's your
company on these things so we have a
team called trusting safety who is
responsible for designing and writing
these policies that reports up to our
lead of legal and safety and and
compliance teams which reports directly
to me I'd like to ask both both of you
one of the things this committee
wrestles with frequently when it comes
to privacy issues and those kinds of
things is the difference between a US
citizen in a non-us citizen an under US
law they can be treated differently
under different circumstances
do your companies make any distinction
between a US citizen versus a non-us
citizen and and I'm I guess now I'm more
focusing in on the kind of behavior we
saw where elections are attempted to
manipulate it and and that sort of thing
is there miss embers start with you is
there does your company make a
distinction as they're weighing the
activity of certain actors so for
political and issue ads we are now going
through a verification process and in
order to run those in the United States
people have to verify that they are
legally able to do that so that's one
area where we would distinguish and what
does that mean legally able to do that
if a citizen of another country any
other country decides they want to say
something about a US election are they
disqualified from doing that on your
with your company in the free content so
what their posts are to their friends
and family or publicly people are
allowed to talk about any issues in any
country as long as they're not crossing
over into the areas we discussed that
aren't allowed like hate and bullying in
advertising in u.s. elections you have
to be a US citizen mr. Dorsey we have we
have very similar policies and we do
segment them by advertising and also the
more organic social creation of content
as well we we don't always have an
understanding of where an account is
located we have to infer this often
times and this is where we do get a lot
of help from our long for law
enforcement partners is not only to
understand where some of these threats
are coming from but also the intent
and the faster that we get that
information the faster that we can
reconnect one of the one of the concerns
that I have and I appreciate that
explanation but what we've seen on this
committee and actually seen in other
contexts is that in today's world it is
so easy to either employ or even
impersonate a US citizen to do something
in a given context do you have
difficulties in that regard well finding
inauthentic behavior is a challenge and
I think you're seeing us put real
resources to bear this is why we're
investing so heavily in people and
technology this is why we're investing
in programs like verification I think
the other step we're taking here is
around transparency so being able to see
if people bought political ads where
they're located
being able to see who's running a page
these are steps we think are really
important for helping us find what to
your point can be very difficult things
to find mr. Dorsey briefly we've we've
decided to focus a lot more on the
behavioral patterns that we're seeing
across the network while we can't always
recognize in real time where someone
might be coming from or if they were if
they are representing someone who does
not exist
we can see common patterns of behavior
and utilizing the network to spread
their information so we have been
building a lot of our machine learning
and deep learning technology to
recognize these patterns and shut them
down before they spread too quickly and
then also link them to other accounts
that demonstrate similar patterns and
we've got a lot more leverage out of
that in terms of scalability and working
on systems to identify whether it's a
fake profile or not interesting mr.
Wyden Thank You mr. chairman chairman I
want to thank you and Senator Warner for
your kind comments about John McCain and
what is not often remembered is John
McCain wrote some of the really
important rules of the road for the
internet when he was chairman in the
Commerce committees and it was always
bipartisan psyche very much appreciate
both of you mentioning
wonderful friend John McCain and the
Sandburg Dorsey welcome and I've enjoyed
visiting with you and let me go right to
the question that is foremost on my mind
and that is consumer privacy as a
national security issue technology
companies like yours hold vast amounts
of very private information about
millions of Americans the prospect of
that data being shared with shady
businesses hackers and foreign
governments is a massive privacy and
national security concern Russians keep
looking for more sophisticated ways of
attacking our democracy personal data
reveals not just your personal and
political leanings but what you buy even
who you date my view is personal data is
now the weapon of choice for political
influence campaigns and we must not make
it easier for our adversaries to seize
these weapons and use them against us so
I'd like to see if we could do a yes or
no on this and I wrote it because I
think we can my view is from this point
on beefing up protections and controls
on personal privacy must be a national
security priority like a yes or no miss
Sandberg
yes sir Dorsey yes okay let me turn now
to a question based on a lot of analysis
my office has done and you all have
talked to us about it we have reviewed
Facebook privacy audits required by the
2011 consent agreement after your
company was found to use unfair and
deceptive practices one section of the
audits deals with how Facebook shared
the personal information of Americans
with
smartphone manufacturers these include
the Chinese companies Huawei and ZTE I
found portions of this audit very
troubling and the findings could affect
many Americans I believe miss Sandberg
the American people deserve to see this
information will you commit this morning
to making public the portion of your
audits that relate to Facebook's
partnerships with smartphone
manufacturers senator I really
appreciate the question and the chance
to clarify this issue because it's
really important with regards to the
audits our third-party auditor PwC does
audits on a rolling basis every two
years but their continual they're given
to us we have shared them with the FTC
voluntarily and we will continue to do
that I can't commit right in this moment
to making that public because a lot of
that has sensitive information which
could help people game the system but we
will certainly work with you to see what
disclosures would be prudent but let's
do this because that's a constructive
answer and I've got other things I've
got to cover I'm just gonna assume you
will work with us we understand the
question of redaction on sensitive
national security matters can you get
back to me within a week with respect to
how Facebook will handle what I think is
troubling information um we're gonna get
back to you as quickly as possible
we can definitely prioritize this
request so we'll do it as fast as we 10
depending on the volume of requests
everyone has thank you and look so you
all know where I'm going with this to me
protecting data privacy has to be a
higher tier issue in terms of national
security it's going to be the foundation
of the legislation that I've talked to
both of you about it so that's why I
feel strongly and I think your answer is
constructive and hope we can get that
quickly what I also want to get to with
you miss Sandberg is the
issue of micro-targeting to discourage
voting this is one of the most powerful
tools in the propaganda arsenal going
after individual Americans that adds and
really lasering in on the ability to
affect political campaigns it's
certainly been used in the past with the
Russians to discourage minority
Americans from voting would Facebook's
current policies prohibit using micro
targeting to discourage voting senator
we feel very strongly about this there
is a long history in this country of
trying to suppress civil rights and
voting rights and that activity has no
place on facebook discriminatory
advertising has no place on facebook so
what are you doing to prohibit this
micro targeting I mean what about ads
that share false information about the
date of the election or the location of
a polling place or ads that tell people
they can vote with a text message from
their phone you have said that it's
unacceptable to target minorities and
others but I really need to drill down
more deeply in knowing because I think
this is a primary we can get bipartisan
agreement on what do you do to deal with
micro targeting so with everything when
we're looking for abuse of our systems
and things that are against our policies
we have a combination of people
reviewing ads and we have a combination
of automated systems and machine
learning that help us find things and
take them down quickly
I'll hold the record open for that could
I have say within a week a written
answer that would get into some of those
specifics we're gonna get you answers to
your questions as quickly and thoroughly
last question deals with foreign
governments aiding hoaxes and
misinformation and I'd like to get both
of the in fact once you start with this
mr. Dorsey do either of you or your
companies have any indication that Iran
Russia or their agents have supported
coordinated with or attempted to amplify
the reach of hoaxes
Dorothee of hoaxes yeah we certainly
have evidence to show that they have
utilized our systems and game bar
systems to amplify information I'm not
sure in terms of the definition of
hoaxes in this case but it is it is
likely okay um just two weeks ago we
took down 650 pages and accounts from
Iran some were tied to state-owned media
and some of them were pretending to be
Free Press that they weren't Free Press
and so depends how you define a hoax but
I think we're certainly seeing them use
misinformation campaign my time is up
the only other area I'm gonna want to
explore with you is we've got to deal
with this back and forth between the
private sector and the government very
often we ask you all about things you're
doing and you say we need the government
to also help us get to ABC and then the
government says the same thing about you
we'll want to explore that same is
chairman for the every time I want to
thank you both for being here first of
all there's an empty chair next to you
from Google they're not here today and
maybe it's because they're arrogant or
maybe it's because there's a report that
as of last night that's just posted at
336 yesterday this group went on
basically pretending to be Kremlin link
trolls they did everyday they used the
details of the internet research agency
which is a criminal criminal and link
troll farm and we're able to buy ads
online and place them on sites like CNN
CBS this morning HuffPost Daily Beast so
I'm sure they don't want to be here to
answer these questions but I thank you
both for being here I was happy to read
in your opening statements the Samberg
that you talk about our democracy our
democratic process you acknowledge
responsibility for protecting our
process and you talked about our
adversaries clearly linking the company
to the values and the importance of this
country and I think an acknowledgment
that your company would not exist were
it not for in the United States because
of the freedoms that we have
put it and go as far but you did
describing yourself as a global talents
core but you did say that you want to
support free and open democratic debate
you did refer to our democracy and you
did say that Twitter was built on the
core tenets of freedom of expression
which is a very important core tenant
here's why this is relevant because
we're here today because we learned and
we've learned the hard way that social
media that was largely seen as a tool
for incredible good also what makes it
good can be manipulated by bad actors to
do harm and that's what's happened we've
all learned that the hard way and so
what we're asking you to do and I think
what you've agreed to do is to use the
powers that you have within your
platforms to crack down on certain users
who are hostile actors who are using
disinformation or misinformation or hate
speech for the purposes of sowing
discord or interfering in our internal
affairs and that's a positive here's a
problem though and we have to start
thinking about what happens when an
authoritarian regime asks you to do that
because their definition of
disinformation or misinformation could
actually be the truth their discord or
what they define as discord would be
things like defending human rights
interfering in their internal affairs
they would define as advocating for
democracy and the reason why I think
that answering that question is so
important is because it's going to
define what your companies are or your
companies really built on these core
values or are they global companies like
all these other companies that come
around here who see their number-one
obligation to make money and therefore
market access irrespective of what the
price they have to pay to do so so for
example in 2016 the New York Times
reported that Facebook was working on a
program to restrict stories from showing
up in news feeds based on the user's
geography the story implies and I know
that hasn't been implemented but it
implies that that was being used in
order to potentially try to get back
into China but any authoritarian
government could try to use that tool
Vietnam by the way where you do operate
as a new law beginning on 2019 January
1st that will require you to store user
data inside the country and hand over
that data to the government
of users suspected of anti state
activity including spreading news that
may impede annoy or hurt the economy for
example democracy activists Twitter has
a policy of accommodating countries that
have different
is about the contours of freedom of
expression by selectively blocking
tweets and accounts for example one of
the countries you comply with is his
Pakistan has asked you to block sites
for blasphemy the blasphemy did 647
cases of blasphemy over ten year period
from eighty six to two thousand seven
fifty percent of those fifty percent of
the of those cases were on non-muslim of
Pakistanis three in a country three
percent non-muslim one high-profile
cases Asia Bibi who has been sentenced
to death after a personal dispute over
drinking water with a group of women
they accused her of insulting the
Prophet she's arrested imprisoned
sentenced to death not relevant to
Twitter but relevant to the blasphemy
laws that Pakistan has asked you to
comply with Turkey has requested that
you block over 12,000 accounts since
2014 you've blocked over 700 many of
them are journalists one of them is an
NBA player in his captor Russia blocked
almost 80 accounts as of last check you
complied with that one of them was a
pro-ukrainian account in 2014 and so
here's why all this is relevant in I
guess the first question for Facebook is
how would these principles of our
democracy do you support them only in
the United States are these principles
that you feel obligated to support
around the world we support these
principles around the world you
mentioned Vietnam we do not have servers
in Vietnam and with very minor
exceptions of imminent threats that were
happening we've never turned over
information to the Vietnamese government
including political and you never will
it not even we would not you would not
agree to do so in order to operate we
would only operate in a country when we
can do so in keeping with our values and
that would apply to China as well that
would apply to China as well thank you
and on Twitter how does blocking the
account of journalists or NBA and an
Emmy a player in keeping with a core
tenet of freedom of expression well we
we enacted a policy some time ago to
allow for per country content takedown
meaning that within those the boundaries
of that nation the content would not be
able to be seen but the rest of the
world can see it and that's important
because the world can still have a
conversation around what's happening in
a market like Turkey
and also we have evidence to show that a
lot of citizens within Turkey access
that content through proxies and whatnot
as as well so we we do believe and we
have fought the government the Turkish
government consistently around their
requests and oftentimes one not in every
case but often times have made some
moves so we would like to fight for
every single person being able to speak
freely and to see everything but we have
to realize that it's going to take some
bridges to get there well because
they're a Twitter spokesman and in
response to BuzzFeed article I think
about two years ago here's the quote
defending this policy so in many
countries including the United States
have laws that may apply to tweets
and/or Twitter account content and then
you went on to say what you've said in
our continuing efforts to make services
available to users everywhere etc you
you would agree that there's no moral
equivalency between what we're asking
you to do here and what turkey has asked
you to do or other countries have asked
you to do in that same realm we we we do
have to comply with the laws that govern
us within each one of these nations but
our ideals are similar and our desires
whose ideas are similar I'm sorry
the companies are similar - who -
similar to the to how we were founded
and where we were founded in this
country I guess my point is how you're
not arguing though that what we've out
what we're asking you to do here on
indigenous information against foreign
efforts to interfere in our elections is
the same as what turkey or other
authoritarian regimes have asked you to
do abroad against upon political
opponents of theirs they're not morally
equivalent these two things correct
thank you recognize senator Heinrich for
questions and then members should know
that we will take a short recess no more
than five minutes and then reconvene
senator angry Thank You mr. chair and
thank you both for being here
I think we've learned quite a bit over
the course of the last couple of years I
think it would be an understatement to
say that we were all caught
footed in 2016 social media platforms
the intelligence community this
committee government as a whole
obviously we want to learn from that and
what I'd like to start with is to ask
from each of you since 2016 your
platforms have been used throughout the
course of a number of subsequent
elections elections in France in Germany
and other Western allies across Europe
what what have you learned from those
consequential elections after 2016 and
how has that informed your current
posture in terms of how you're gaining
transparency into this activity senator
I think we've learned a lot and I think
we're gonna have to continue to learn
because as we learn our opponents learn
and we have to keep up we're working on
technology and investments in people
making sure fake news is disseminated
less on the platforms transparency
actions and taking down bad actors and
we've seen everywhere from Mexico to
Brazil to other places around the world
these same techniques deployed
differently and each time we see it I
think we get smarter I think we see the
new threat and I think we're able to
connect the dots and prevent those
threats going forward we've we've also
learned a lot from elections around the
world and most recently the the Mexican
election we have opened a new portal to
cover that election that allows any
journalist or government law enforcement
to actually report any suspicious
behavior very quickly to us so we can
take more actions otherwise we have been
investing in artificial intelligence and
machine learning models to again
recognize the patterns of behavior
because we believe this is where the
greatest leverage will come from
recognizing how people artificially
amplify information and shutting it down
before it spreads into the shared spaces
of Twitter and more broadly into some
replies to it to me so I want to get to
the basic issue of whether our
incentives in this case are aligned to
deal with these challenges if your users
were to lose conference confidence in
your platforms in the authenticity of
what you mr. Dorsey called
a public square I might call it a
digital public square I assumed there
would be very serious economic
implications for your companies do you
think the the incentives have aligned
for platform providers of all types in
the digital space to want to get at
these issues and have a plan and be able
to respond in real time miss amber and
then you mr. dorsen absolutely Trust is
the cornerstone of our business people
have to trust that what they see on
Facebook is authentic people have to
trust that this is a positive force for
democracy and the things they care about
and so this has been a huge issue for us
and that's why we're here today and
that's why we're gonna keep working to
get ahead of these threats and make sure
we can minimize all of this activity our
incentives are online but I do believe
it goes a lot deeper than just the
alignment of our company incentives with
this committee and the American people I
believe we need to question the
fundamental incentives that are in our
product today every time someone opens
up our service every time someone opens
up our app we are implicitly
incentivizing them to do something or
not to do something and that extends all
the way to our business and those
answers that we get from asking that
question are going to create massive
shifts in how Twitter operates and I
also believe how our industry operates
so what worked 12 years ago does not
work today it hasn't evolved fast enough
but I think it's a layer many many many
many layers deeper than these surface
symptoms that we often find ourselves
discussing
miss Sandberg you you mentioned a number
of things that if that would violate
your standards for example hate speech
advocacy of violence what about when
we're dealing with real people
authentic users intentionally spreading
false information and obviously there
are huge free speech implications there
but for example what if a real person a
US citizen says that victims of the mass
shootings were actually actors for
example would that violate your
standards and if the answer is no how
should we and I be my we I mean
government and industry deal with those
very real challenges well let me start
by saying I find claims like that
personally unbelievably upsetting if
you've been a victim or a parent of a
victim they deserve our full support and
finding the line between what is hate
speech and what is mins for information
is very very difficult especially if
you're dedicated to expressing free
expression and sometimes free expression
is expressing things you strongly
disagree with in the case of Mint's
misinformation what we do is we refer it
to third party fact checkers we don't
think we should be the arbiter of what's
true and what's false and we think
that's really important
third party fact checkers then market is
false if it's marked as false we
dramatically decreased a distribution on
our site we warn you if you're about to
share it we warn you if you have shared
it and importantly we show related
articles next to that so people can see
alternative facts the fundamental view
is that bad speech can often be
countered by good speech and if someone
says something's not true and they say
it incorrectly someone else has the
opportunity to say actually you're wrong
this is true and that's what we're
working on through our systems I think
one of the things we found in 2016 is
that we didn't have the transparency in
the literacy to do what you just pointed
out there to counter false speech with
with accurate speech to understand how
the speech was propagating in the
digital public space what more do you
think we should be do
to simply make the public more literate
about the fact that this information
warfare is very real it's going on all
the time it's not fake news it's not a
hoax it's something we're all gonna have
to deal with that our kids even plane
platforms like poki mango may have to
have to deal with as well do either of
you have a quick opinion on that and
then my time will be expired I apologize
mr. chair I believe we need to point to
where we see healthy participation and
clearly mark what is healthy and what is
unhealthy and also realize that not
everyone is going to choose healthy
participation in the short term but how
do we encourage healthy participation in
order to increase their reach and also
increase the value of what they're
giving to that digital public square'
this hearing stands in recess subject to
the call of the chair
and also to express my outrage that your
counterpart at Google is not at the
table as as well mr. Jersey as of
January of this year
Twitter's taken down more than 3,800
Russian IRA accounts that by Twitter's
own estimate reached approximately 1.4
million people one of those accounts
purported to be under the control of the
Tennessee GOP although it was not it was
a Russian IRA account it had more than
140,000 followers and would sometimes
spread conspiracy theories and false
claims of voter fraud my question to you
is once you have taken down accounts
that are linked to Russia
these imposter accounts what do you do
to notify the followers of those
accounts that they have been following
or engaged in accounts that originated
in Russia and are not what they appear
to be thank you for the question we we
simply haven't done enough so we don't
have in this particular case we don't
have enough communication going out in
terms of what was seen and what was
tweeted and what people are following
falling into we do believe transparency
is a big part of where we need the most
work and improvement and it's not just
with our external communications it's
actually within the product and the
service itself we need to be we need to
meet people where they are and if we
determined that people were subject to
any falsehoods or manipulation of any
sort we do need to provide them the
fawlcon
texts of that and this is an area of
improvement for us and something that
we're going to be diligent to fix I
think this is critically important if a
follower just gets the message that says
this Twitter account is no longer
available that does not alert the
individual that he or she has been
receiving messages tweets from a Russian
into entity whose goal is undermine
public confidence and elected officials
and our democratic institutions so I
really think we need something more than
even the tombstone or or something else
we need to tell people that they were
taken in or victims innocent victims of
a foreign influence campaign
mrs. Sandberg let me ask you the same
question what is Facebook doing we agree
with you that people need to know so
we've been discussing these publicly as
well as in specific cases notifying
people so we notified people directly if
they had liked or I'd like the original
IRA accounts most recently when there
was a event that was going to be
happening in Washington that in
authentic accounts we notified all the
people who either RSVP'd to that event
or who said they were interested in
possibly going to that event thank you
that was the unite to defeat the right
or something like that as I recall a mr.
Dorsey back to you Clemson University
researchers and others have shown that
these Russian IRA accounts target
specific leaders and social movements
across the political spectrum and again
the goal of the Russians the Iranians
anyone else who's involved in this
influence campaign is to undermine the
public's confidence in political leaders
and we can our democratic institutions
and turn us against one another well I
learned not from Twitter but from
Clemson University that I was one of
those targeted leaders and that there
were 279 and generated tweets that
targeted me that had gone to as many as
three hundred sixty-three thousand
followers so why doesn't Twitter notify
individuals like me that we have been
targeted by foreign adversaries
I shouldn't find out from looking at
Clemson University's database and
working with their researchers it seems
to me that once you determine that you
should notify the people who are the
targets
I agree it's unacceptable and we as I
said earlier we we want to find ways to
work more openly not just with our pure
companies but with researchers and
universities and also law enforcement
because they all bring a different
perspective to our work and can see our
work in a very different light and we
are going to do we're gonna do our best
to make sure that we catch everything
and we inform people when it affects
them but we are not going to catch
everything so it is useful to have
external partnership and work with them
to make sure that we're delivering a
message in a uniform matter where people
actually are without requiring them to
find a new channel to get that
information so this is where a lot of
our thinking is going in a lot of our
work is going but we we recognize we
need to communicate more directly where
people are on our service and we also
recognize that we're not going to be
able to catch everything alone so we
need to develop better partnerships in
order to do that I wouldn't close my
questioning by encouraging both of you
to work more closely with academia
with our government that Clemson
University researchers have done
extraordinary work but they have said
that they've been provided data that
it's only within the last three years
which does not allow them to do the kind
of analysis that they'd like to do and
that's probably because of the new
European Union privacy laws but the EU
has provided research exemptions so I
hope that you will commit to providing
data that goes beyond that 3-year window
to researchers who are looking into
Russian influence efforts on your
platforms thank you you know a good
morning and to the invisible witness
good morning to you so I have a few
questions for miss Sandburg
on November 2nd 2017 your company's
general counsel testified in front of
this Intelligence Committee on Russian
interference and I asked a few questions
I asked how much money did you make and
this is of the representative from both
Facebook and Twitter both of your
general councils were here and I asked
how much money did you make from
legitimate advertising that ran
alongside the Russian propaganda the
Twitter general counsel said quote we
haven't done the analysis but we'll
follow up with you and work on that and
the Facebook general counsel said the
same is true for Facebook again I asked
Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg on April
10th 2018 and he said the quote Internet
research agency the Russian firm ran
about $100,000 worth of ads following
the hearing
I asked Facebook the same question in
writing and on June 8th 2018 we received
a response that said quote we believe
the annual revenue that is attributable
to inauthentic or false accounts is
immaterial so my question is what did
you mean by immaterial
because I'm a bit confused about the use
of that term in this context so thank
you for the question
so again we believe the total of the ad
spending that we have found is about a
hundred thousand dollars and so the
question you're asking is with the
inorganic content I believe what is the
possible revenue we could have made so
here's the best way I can think of to
estimate that which is that we believe
between 2015 and 2017 up to 150 million
people may have seen the IRA ads ads or
organic content in our service and the
way our service works is ads don't run
attached to any specific piece of
content but they're scattered throughout
the content this is equivalent to 0.004
percent of content and newsfeed and that
was why they would say it was immaterial
to our earnings but I really want to say
that from our point of view senator
Harris any amount is too much so but if
I may just so I'm clear about your
response so are you saying that then the
the revenue generated was 0.004 percent
of your annual revenue so of course that
would not be a material so again the ads
are not attached to any piece of content
so it's a different metric then yes you
don't just help me with that what metric
should are you using to calculate the
revenue that was generated associated
with those ads and what is the dollar
amount that is associated then with that
metric right so the reason we can't
answer the question to your satisfaction
is that ads are not a organic content
ads don't run with inorganic content on
our service so there is actually no way
to firmly assessor tane how much ads are
attached to how much organic content
it's not how it works in trying to
answer what percentage of the organic
manage of the content on facebook is in
organic I don't have that specific
answer but we can come back to you at
that would you say it's the majority or
no no that insignificant amount what
percentage you must know if you ask what
are inauthentic accounts on Facebook we
believe at any point in time it's three
to four percent of accounts but that
not the same answer as inorganic content
because some of the counts generate more
content than others I agree so what
percentage of your content is inorganic
again we don't know I can follow up with
the answer to that ok please and then
your company's business model is
obviously it's complex but but benefits
from increased user engagement and that
results of course in an increased
revenue so simply put the more people
that use your platform the more they are
exposed to third-party ads the more
revenue you generate would you agree
with that can you repeat I just want to
make sure I got it exactly right so the
more user engagement will result and the
more then that they are exposed to
third-party ads the more that will
increase your revenue so the more users
that are on your plans yes but only I
think when they're when they see or
really authentic content because I think
in the short run and over the long run
it doesn't benefit us to have anything
inauthentic on our platform that makes
sense
in fact the first quarter of 2018 the
number of daily active users on Facebook
rose 13% I'm told and corresponding ad
revenue grew by half to 11 point seventy
nine billion dollars with does that
sound correct to you it sounds correct
and then would you agree that I think
it's an obvious point that the more
people that engage on the platform the
more potential there is for revenue
generation for Facebook yes senator but
again only when the content is authentic
I appreciate that point and so a concern
that many have is how you can reconcile
an incentive to create and increase your
YouTube user engagement when the content
that generates a lot of engagement is
often inflammatory and hateful so for
example lisa-marie nor debt a researcher
at Oxford internet Institute she says
quote the content that is the most
misleading or conspiratorial that's
what's generating the most discussion
and the most engagement and that's what
the algorithm is designed to respond to
so Michael
CERN is that according to Facebook's
community standards you do not allow
hate speech on Facebook however contrary
to what we have seen on June 28th 2017
ProPublica report found that Facebook's
training materials instructed reviewers
to delete hate speech targeting white
men but not against black children
because black children are not a
protected class do you know anything
about that and can you talk to me about
that I do and what that was was I think
a bad policy that's been changed but it
wasn't saying that black children it was
saying that children that it was saying
that different groups weren't weren't
looked out the same way and we fixed it
but isn't that one concern with hate
period that not everyone has looked at
the same way well hate speech is against
our policies and we take strong measures
to take it down we also publish publicly
what our hate speech standards are we
care tremendously about civil rights we
have worked very closely with civil
rights groups to find hate speech on our
platform and take it down so when did
you address that policy I'm glad to hear
you hat we're not that addressed when it
came out and again that policy was badly
written bad example and not a real
policy the report that I'm aware of was
from June of 2017 was the policy changed
as after that reporter before that
report from ProPublica I can get back to
you on the specifics of when that would
have happened you're not aware of when
it happened I don't remember the exact
date do you remember the year well you
just said it was 2017 that was of the so
do you believe it was 2017 that the
policy changed sounds like it was okay
and it's what is Facebook's official
stance on then hate speech regarding its
so-called and legally defined
unprotected classes such as children so
hate speech is not allowed on our
platform and hate speech is you know
important and in every in every way and
we care a lot that our platform is a
safe community when people come to
Facebook to share they're coming because
they want to connect on the issues that
matter them so have you removed the
requirement that you will
only protect with your hate speech
policy those classes of people that have
been designated as protected classes in
a legal context is that no longer the
policy of civil base book I know that
our hate speech policies go beyond the
legal classifications and they are all
public and we can get back to you on any
of that it's all publicly available ok
thank you so much
Thank You mr. chairman senator blunt
Thank You chairman mr. Dorsey in Wired
magazine last week at an article that
said that you'd admitted having to
rethink fundamental aspects of Twitter
would that be an accurate reflection of
where you've been the last year yes we
we are rethinking the incentives that
our service is giving to people and what
what would be the biggest area of where
you're trying to rethink how you thought
this was going to work out and the way
it's turned out to be well and and this
is pretty far-reaching so we're still in
the process of doing this work but when
we created the service 12 years ago we
had this concept of followers and we
made the number of followers big and
bold and a very simple but noticeable
font and just that decision alone has
incentivized people to want to grow that
number to increase that number and the
question we're now asking is that
necessarily the right incentive is the
number of followers you have really a
proxy for how much you contribute to
Twitter into this digital public square
and we don't believe it is but that's
just one question the way we lay out our
buttons on the bottom of every tweet in
a reply and a retweet in a like that
also implies an incentive and a point of
view that we're taking that we want to
encourage people to do so as we think
about serving the public conversation as
we think about our singular priority
of increasing the health of that public
conversation we we are not going to be
able to do long-term work unless we are
looking at the incentives that our
product is telling people to do every
single day
all right that's helpful thank you
senator Collins asked her last question
I didn't really quite get the answer to
that question but I think what she was
asking is a question I had also which
was in the interest of transparency and
public education and looking at things
available to researchers and policy
makers are you willing to archive
suspended accounts so that people can
look back at those and would that be a
period of I think three years was part
of the question she asked give me a
little better more specific answer you
didn't have time to answer that and I'd
like you to have time to answer that we
we are looking at things like a
transparency report we we put out a
transparency report around terrorism but
we're looking at expanding that
transparency report around suspensions
of any account we are still coming up
with the details of what this will look
like and what it will include as opposed
to just a transparency report are you
willing to archive some of this where
you may not be reporting on it at the
time but someone could look three years
down the road and try to do an analysis
of why that information was out there
the way it was and how it fit into your
overall policy of taking whatever action
you're taking I think it's a great idea
to show the historical public record I
just need to understand what the legal
implications are and we can get back to
you on that I may come back with a
question if I have time on legal
implications generally I think for both
of your companies who have been pretty
forward leaning in the last couple of
months as this conversation has moved
pretty dramatically the business
implications the liability implications
of what we're asking you to do are
pretty great but let me see if I can get
a couple of Facebook questions and
first miss Sandberg the space book
differentiate between foreign and
domestic influence operations when
deciding whether to take down a page or
remove an account from the platform our
focus is on you know in authenticity so
if something is inauthentic whether it's
trying to influence domestically or
trying to influence on a foreign basis
and actually a lot more of the activity
as domestic we take it down you take it
down indiscriminate whether it's a
foreign influencer or a domestic
employee and you saw that with the IRA
with the IRA accounts the original ones
for our election were targeted at the
United States but then there were
another 270 accounts that were almost
all targeted in Russia or at Russia it
were Russian speakers in nearby
languages so a lot of those were
domestic and those are down well has
been mentioned several times and I think
appropriate is so Google is not here
today but the two of you are and miss
Sandberg again just what seems like a
long time ago but only a few months
since mr. Zuckerberg was here testifying
before Congress seems like to me that
Facebook has been pretty active in
finding and taking down things that
should not have been out there the
recent Iranian takedown the Russian
things have been taken down you want to
talk a little bit what's what's the big
challenge about being at the forefront
of trying to figure this out from a
business perspective or a liability
perspective either one then I'm going to
come to mr. Darcy with the same dorset
with the same question well I really
appreciate what you said because we have
been investing very heavily in people in
our systems in decreasing the
dissemination of fake news in
transparency and I think that's what
you're seeing pay off I think we've all
said and in the private meetings we had
as well as this public discussion that
tighter coordination really helps us if
you look at our recent takedowns some of
it was information we found ourselves
some of it were hints we got from law
enforcement some of it or information we
can share with other companies and so
this is a big threat and our opponents
are gonna keep getting better and we
have to get better and we have to stay
ahead
and the more we can all work together
the better off we're going to be and
that's why I really appreciate the
spirit with which this hearing this
morning is taking place and how does the
how does the take down the practice work
where legitimate accounts are sold then
maybe and repurposed by others how do
you how do you keep what you're what are
you looking at there as a challenge so
our policy is in authenticity if you are
an inauthentic account if you are
pretending to be someone you're not you
come down if you have touched the count
of someone who is authentic then we
would leave the authentic account up but
in cases like I was answering answering
with Senator Collins if you are an
authentic person who RSVP'd to an event
that's not authentic we would let you
know okay thank you for that
okay mr. Darcy back to that other
question from a business and legal
liability standpoint what what is what's
the downside of being out there where
you are now trying to every day
implement policies that nobody's ever
implemented before so I I think there
are a number of short-term risks but you
know we believe that the only way that
we will grow and thrive as a company is
by increasing the health of this digital
public square that we're helping to
build we we also benefit as Cheryl
mentioned from tighter collaboration and
tighter partnership we've really
strengthened our partnership with our
government agencies since 2016 there are
a few areas that we would like to see
more strength we would like a more
regular cadence of meetings with our law
enforcement partnerships we would love
to understand the secular trends that
they are aware of and seeing in our pure
companies or other mediums or more
broadly that would inform us about how
to act much faster and we would
appreciate as much as we can
consolidating to a single point of
contact so that we are not bouncing
between multiple agencies to
to do our work so that is what we found
in attempting to do a lot of this new
policy and work in terms of partnership
but but ultimately it comes back to we
need to build our technologies to
recognize new patterns of behavior and
new patterns of attack and understand
what they actually mean and then ideally
get some help from our law enforcement
partners to understand the intent and to
understand the motivations behind it
thank you for story I'm sure my time is
up thank you German Center King Thank
You mr. chairman and I want to also
thank our witnesses and thank you to
your your companies and your
policymakers for making really great
strides in the last year as many of the
people have talked about we were all on
our heels a year ago on this subject and
this has emerged as one of the most
important parts of this committees
investigation it it seems to me that we
we're sort of I try to focus what we're
after here and we're after the heart of
democracy miss Ann Berg you said the
heart of democracy was free and fair
elections I would argue that the heart
of free and fair elections is
information and that's really what we're
talking about is is getting information
to people in a democratic setting and
and also on all kinds of other topics
birthdays and everything else but that's
what we're talking about here there are
three ways to defend ourselves it seems
to me one is better consumer
discrimination about what they're seeing
the second is deterrence which hasn't
been mentioned here that our adversaries
need to understand that there's a price
to be paid for trying to manipulate our
society and our democracy and the third
is technical and that's mostly what
we've been talking about I had an
experience ironically a couple of months
before the 2016 election meeting here in
this in this building with a group of
people from Lithuania Estonia and Latvia
who had been experiencing Russian
interference with their elections and
their propaganda their information for
years and I said how do you defend
yourself
you can't unplug the internet you can't
turn off the TV station the most
interesting thing they said was
universally the best defense is for the
people to know it's happening and I
would like from each of you a some
thoughts and hopefully a commitment to
educating your users about the potential
for abuse of the very medium that
they're putting their trust in miss
amber we really agree with you and we've
done this broadly and we're going to
continue to do more so we've worked on
media literacy programs we've worked on
programs and public service
announcements around the world that help
people discern this is real news this is
not and help people be educated I think
one of the most important things we're
doing is that once a piece of content
has been rated as false by our third
party fact checkers if you're about to
share it we warn you right there hey
this has been rated as false and so you
are educated as you are about to take
that critical step mr. Dorsey I hope
you're doing the same to educate your
your users as to the potential that that
they can be misled on your platform yeah
and to be to be frank we haven't done a
good job at this in the past and I think
the reason why is because we haven't met
our customers where they are in terms of
actually when they're using the product
and adding more context there we do
benefit on Twitter that we have this
amazing constituency of journalists
globally using our service every single
day and they often with a high degree of
velocity call out in factual information
we don't do a great job at giving them
the best tools in context to do that
work and we think there's a lot of
improvements we can make to amplify
their content and their messaging so
that people can see to see what is
happening with that content if that can
be amplified and underlined it can
become a self-healing process whereby
the response immediately responds to
false or misleading information
deterrence I'm not going to spend a lot
of time on except to say that many of us
believe that one of the great gaps and
our defenses against election
interference and interference and our
democracy is the fact that our
adversaries feel no pain if they do so
that we have to develop a doctrine of
cyber deterrence just as we have
doctrines of military deterrence and
that's that's a gap and and that's
something that we're working on both
here and armed services other places let
me talk about the technical for a minute
how about feedback from users and MS
Sandberg you testify that you have
third-party fact-checkers also would it
be useful to have more in the way of
ratings and you know the eBay sellers
you have rating process a number of
stars and those kinds of things is there
more you could do there to alert people
as to the validity and the
trustworthiness of what they're seeing
senator the most important determinant
of what anyone sees on Facebook are
decisions they make so I choose my
friends you choose yours I choose the
news publications I follow you choose
yours and that's why your news feed is
so different from mine and so yes if you
don't want to follow someone if you
don't want to like a page we encourage
you to do that we also make it very easy
to unfollow on our search so if I don't
believe what you're saying anymore I
don't have to receive it but I'm talking
about alerting a viewer to or a reader
to something that's come across on their
newsfeed that is has been found
manifestly false or misleading a banner
of a node a star we do that the related
articles we note that this has been
rated as false and here's a related
article which would give you other facts
that you could consider one of the
things that we've been talking about
here and senator Rubio has been a leader
in discussing this is what we call deep
fake as I'm sure you're aware the
ability to manipulate video to the point
where it basically conveys a reality
that isn't real is there a technological
way that you
and determine the that a video has been
manipulated in that way and tagged it so
that people on the Facebook if they see
a video that it'll be tagged warning
this has been manipulated in a way that
may be missed we may be misleading
that's a question you may want to take
under advisement but it seems to me
again this is an area this is a new area
that's going to get more and more
serious I'm afraid and again what I'm
trying to do is get to give the consumer
the maximum amount of information we
agree with you deep fakes is a new area
and we know people are gonna continue to
find new ones and as always we're gonna
do a combination of investing in
technology and investing in people so
that people can see authentic
information on our service as you're
thinking about these cures I hope you'll
continuously come back to the idea that
what we need to do is give people more
information I must say I'm a little
uncomfortable with where the line is
between taking down misleading or fake
information and taking down what someone
else may consider legitimate information
in the marketplace of ideas Jefferson
said we can tolerate error as long as
his truth is left free to combat it we
have to be sure that people that we're
not censoring but at the same time we're
providing our customers our users your
users with information that they can the
context I think is the word you use they
can have context for what it is that
they're seeing I I'd hate to see your
your platforms become a political in the
sense that you're censoring one side or
the other of any given debate mr. Dorsey
so yeah we we absolutely agree we we you
know as we are building a digital public
square we do believe expectations and
follow that and that is a default to
freedom of expression and opinion and we
need to understand when that default
interferes with other fundamental human
rights such as physical security or
privacy and what the adverse impact on
those fundamental human rights are and I
do believe that context does matter in
this case we had a case of voter
suppression around 2016 that was tweeted
out and we are happy to say that
organically the number of impressions
that were calling it out as fake we're
eight times that of the reach of the
original tweet that's not to say that we
can rely on that but asking the question
how we make that more possible and how
we do it at velocity is the right one to
ask that's that that's the self healing
aspect thank you both very much and if
you have further thoughts as you're
flying home about technical ways you can
increase the information available to
your users through tags rating stars
whatever a please share them with us and
we'll look forward to working with you
on this on this problem that is one
that's important to our country thank
you very much sir in Lankford Davis
chairman I want to follow up on a
statement that Senator King was
mentioning as well about deep fakes and
that's something I've spoken to both of
you about before in the past it is a
challenge for us and I would just
reiterate some of the things that he was
saying publicly when it's the
possibility and now the opportunity to
be able to create video that looks
strikingly real but none of it is
actually real all of its
computer-generated that is a very
different day for video sharing in the
days ahead and I know as you all have
attacked issues like child pornography
and other things on your platforms in
the past you all will aggressively go
after these things we're just telling
you we're counting on it and because
Americans typically can trust what they
see and suddenly in video they can no
longer trust what they see because the
opportunity to be able to create video
that's entirely different than anything
in reality has now actually come so
appreciate your engagement on that I
want to talk to a little bit at mr.
Dorsey about following up some things
that sin or Blount had mentioned as well
about suspended accounts when you
suspend an account obviously there's
information that's still there do you
archive all of that information to be
able to maintain for are suspended
accounts this is an account that we
determined is either from a foreign
actor hostile actor or is inappropriate
not
authorized user' is that something you
hold that information so you can
maintain it I need to follow up with you
on the exact details of our policies but
I believe we do especially in regards to
any law enforcement action terrific for
Facebook what is the practice when used
to spend an account and say this is not
an authorized user or we think this is a
foreign or hostile user if we have any
suspicion that's a foreigner hostile
user we would keep the information to be
able to do further investigation so then
the question is the investigation
internal free all or obviously if law
enforcement subpoenas that in comes to
you and says I have subpoena to come get
that information that's a whole
different issue but is this something
you do in your own investigation because
as I'm sure you've seen in the past some
users into will create a fake account or
some sort of hostile accounts that comes
down they'll create another one and then
there's some similarities and where they
go in directions and relationships do
you maintain that data to be able to
make sure that you're well prepared and
educated for when they may come back to
be aware of that again for Twitter what
is that mr. Storrs so we we do do our
own internal investigations and we are
benefited anytime our peers recognize
something and we do share that data so
that we can check our own systems for
similar vectors or similar accounts and
also work with law enforcement to
understand the the intent if there is a
request to allow an account to lay
dormant by law enforcement we will allow
that to happen
and work with them to make sure that we
are tracking and accordingly this is the
main thing I'm trying to identify though
is let's say it happened in 2017 you
identified an account that you suspended
and said this is a problem area or
unauthorized user or whatever it may be
you just you take that count off do you
maintain that information and so a year
later if somebody comes back with a
similar profile you can still track and
say this is the same as what we've seen
before and it's going to take additional
steps for you to get back on board or a
ways to be able to track their initial
connections I'm sorry yes we do maintain
that information and we have a ban of
Asian policy so if someone is trying to
evade a ban or system
no matter what the timeframe we can take
action on those accounts as well okay
December if we have any suspicions that
this would be engaged in foreign or
domestic inauthentic activity or we have
law-enforcement interaction on it we
would keep that information okay
mr. C you know I've spoken on this as
well about data and in the business
model for both of you is obviously it's
a free platform for everyone to use but
obviously data and advertising and all
those things are very helpful just in
keeping your business opening and
keeping employees paid that's a given
and everyone understands that when they
join that platform in that conversation
but for data in particular how do you
make sure that anyone who purchases into
data or gets access to that uses it for
its stated purpose rather than using it
either sell to a third party or to open
up as a shell company and say they're
using if one purpose but they actually
use it for a foreign purpose or
direction to be able to track real time
activity of Americans how do you assure
that companies that are purchasing into
that opportunity to have that data are
actually fulfilling and using as they
stated they would well there's a there's
a few things here first and foremost
we're a little bit different than our
peers in that all of our data is public
by default so when we sell data what
we're selling is speed and
comprehensiveness so you're actually
purchasing either insights or a real
real-time streaming product in order to
purchase that you have to go through a
very strict no your customer policy that
we enact and then we audit every single
year we do we if we have any indication
that there is suspicious activity
happening that is an opportunity for us
to reach out to law enforcement with the
sole purpose of trying to understand the
intent that is that is the thing that we
are not always going to be able to infer
from us looking at the relationship you
mentioned you know setting up companies
that potentially are in front of
governments that is not information that
we would necessarily have and that is
where we are dependent upon the
intelligence
to inform us so that we can take them
stronger action so how do you determine
or what relation is it an initial
relationship but there's not a follow-up
after that after after that rapid access
as you dictate on that after that is
determined is there any way to check in
on those companies to be able to make
sure they're actually fulfilling your
Terms of Service absolutely and we do it
we do it every year on a regular basis
but if we see anything suspicious at any
point in time we'll reach out directly
okay simmer tell me a little bit about
whatsapp whatsapp has been a feature of
Facebook for a while how's the
encryption going on that what's the
relationship now with what's happened
what do you anticipate in the days ahead
we are strong believers in encryption
encryption helps keep people safe it
secures our banking system it secures
the security of private messages and
consumers rely on it and depend on it
and so we're very committed to
encryption and whatsapp and continuing
to protect the data and information of
our users so that encryption is in to
end at this point still on the whatsapp
platform we'll get back to you on any
technical details but to my knowledge it
is okay thank you I go back Sarah
Manchin Thank You mr. chairman and miss
Ann Berg mr. Dores I want to thank both
of you for being here and I grew up in
an age without computers in social media
so I'm trying to get acclimated the best
I can I have seen how they've been used
by my children and grandchildren and how
much it helps connect people I see it
off a lot of good I also have concerns
with internet and social media have been
how it's been used against this and I
think you're hearing concerns from all
my fellow colleagues up here its attempt
to divide Americans change our way of
life change our democracy as we know it
and can be very devastating my little
state of West Virginia my beautiful
little state with all the wonderful
people has been hit extremely hard by
illicit drugs and pharmaceutical opiates
according to the recent wired article
Alain Kerry spent three years regular
reporting accounts illegally selling
opioids on Instagram and the practice
was widespread on Facebook and Twitter
as well in many ways that
tools used by opiate dealers are similar
those adopted by other bad actors
including Russia targets with Eve on
target the vulnerable with ads that are
easily circumventing the platform's
filters and oversights and using
hashtags to gain attention of those
interested last November Facebook CEO
Mark Zuckerberg said learning of the
depths of the crisis was the biggest
surprise and really saddening to see but
it still took months to take measures to
correct the problem while the people are
still dying according to the US code 230
formerly known as the Communications
Decency Act in 1996 online service
providers shall not be held civilly
liable for content that a third party
post on their platform and they shall
not be treated as a publisher or speaker
of the content if we look at the example
of drug overdose deaths many prosecutors
increasingly treating the death as a
homicide and looking to hold someone
criminally accountable there are now
laws devised to hold drug dealers
responsible for the death of victims
using drugs they provided and in some
cases they are charging friends partners
siblings of the deceased so my question
to both you would be I've heard of a
report that details the way drug dealers
continue to use your platforms for
illegal drug sales to what extent do you
bear responsibility for the death of a
drug user if they overdosed on drugs
recede through your platform either one
I'm happy to go this is really important
to us the opioid crisis has been
devastating and takes the lives of
people in our country and around the
world it's firmly against our policies
to buy or sell any pharmaceuticals on
Facebook and that includes opioid drugs
we rely on a combination of machines and
people reporting to take things down and
I think we've seen market improvements
we also took an additional step recently
which is very important which is we're
requiring treatment centers who want to
buy ads to be certified by a respected
third party because
another one of the problems has been
that some treatment centers are actually
doing harm and so we're requiring
certification before they can purchase
ads and they can try to reach people for
treatment this is also prohibited on our
service and we do have responsibility to
fix it anytime we see it and we are
looking deeply at how this information
spreads and how the activity spreads so
that we can shut it down before it
spreads too far I know I asked a tough
question was you'll fill any
responsibilities because there has been
a lot of people that have been affected
and a lot of people have died receiving
information on how to obtain drugs
through y'all's platforms so I would go
another step further
just like we pass FASTA and cesta foster
was the flight online sex trafficking
act and stop enabling and susta was to
stop enabling sex traffickers Act we
passed bills that held you liable and
responsible don't you think we should do
the same
with opiate drugs and and the way
they're being used in your platform
would you all support us doing that
we're we're certainly open to dialogue
around CDA and the evolutions of it we
we benefit from a lot of the protections
it gives an order or us for us in the
first place to take actions on the
content within our service the only
reason we're able to even speculate that
we can increase more health and a public
square is because of CDA 230 so we need
to finally balance what those changes
are and what that what that means would
it change y'all's approach of how you
use your platforms with the changing of
the two thirty two thirty we have to do
that independent of changes to two
thirty these things are against our
policies and we want them off and we
want to take all measures to get them
off the safe harbor of two thirty has
been very important in enabling
companies like ours to do proactive
enforcement look for things proactively
without increasing our liability and so
we'd want to work very closely on how
this would be enacted final question to
both of you why are you not doing
business in China
we are blocked in China we are as well
you're blocked for what reasons the
Chinese government has chosen not to
allow our service in China I think it
happened on the same day did you all not
accept basically the terms of how you do
business in China or you just block from
coming into it or did you not agree do
they give you a chance or I'm saying
other other social platforms that seem
to be adapting and going in there I know
a lot of our drugs come from the law the
fentanyl and all that is coming from
China and we're trying to shut that down
but I was interested in it was it was to
me that you all both have been blocked
and I would assume you didn't agree to
their terms you know I mean we I don't
know if there was any one particular
decision point around understanding what
the terms might be in our particular
case but when we when we were blocked we
decided that it wasn't a fight worth
fighting right now and we have other
priorities you know business sir there
was no particular time you know we've
been open about the fact that our
mission is to connect the world and that
means it's hard to do that without
connecting the world's largest
population but in order to go into China
we would have to be able to do so in
keeping with our values and those are
not that that's not possible right now
thank you thank you sure senator cotton
I want to commend both of you for your
appearance here today for what was no
doubt going to be some uncomfortable
questions and I want to commend your
companies for making you available I
wish I could say the same about Google I
think both of you should and your
company should wear it as a badge of
honor that the Chinese Communist Party
has blocked you from operating in their
country perhaps Google didn't send a
senior executive today because they've
recently taken actions such as
terminating cooperation they had with
the American military on programs like
artificial intelligence that are
designed not just to protect our troops
and help them fight and win our
country's Wars but to protect civilians
as well this is at the very same time
that they continue to cooperate with the
Chinese Communist Party on matters like
artificial intelligence or partner with
Huawei and
they're Chinese telecom companies are
effectively arms of the Chinese
Communist Party and credible report
suggests that they are working to
develop a new search engine that would
satisfy the Chinese Communist Party's
censorship standards after having
disclaimed any intent to do so eight
years ago perhaps they didn't send a
witness to answer these questions
because there is no answer to those
questions and the silence we would hear
right now from the Google chair would be
reminiscent of the silence but that
witness would provide so I just want to
ask both of you would your companies
ever consider taking these kinds of
actions that privilege a hostile foreign
power over the United States and
especially our men and women in uniform
Sandberg I'm not familiar with the
specifics of this at all but based on
how you're asking the question I don't
believe so also no so thank you for that
answer mr. Dorsey let's turn to data
miner which is one of the services that
provides basically all of Twitter's data
the last time we had an executive from
Twitter the front before this committee
in an open setting I asked about reports
that data miner had recently ceased its
cooperation with the Central
Intelligence Agency at the same time it
continued to cooperate with Russia today
and other proxies of Russian
intelligence services I have since seen
reports that data miner no longer
cooperates with Russia today or any
other proxy of Russian intelligence
services is that correct that is correct
did you make that decision personally no
we we have a long we have a long
standing term against utilizing public
Twitter data for ongoing 24/7
surveillance and that's why you decided
to cease cooperation with the Russian
government or proxies like Russia today
no there's a different matter this is
could you explain why you cease that
cooperation then or that relationship
with Russia today and other Russian
intelligence proxies when we learned of
the link of Russian today and Sputnik
we ceased to allow them to be an
advertiser on the platform we calculated
the amount of advertising needed on the
platform is 1.9 million dollars and we
donated that to civil liberties not
nonprofits would you now reconsider the
decision to cease your cooperation with
the Central Intelligence Agency or other
American intelligence agencies we're we
are always open to any legal process
that an agency would present us so we
don't believe it necessary this is a
global policy around surveillance in
general and real-time surveillance I
will state that all this information
because Twitter is public by default is
available to everyone by just going to
our service you see a difference between
cooperating with the United States
government and the Russian government or
the Chinese government do I see a
difference
no sure even I'm Twitter of American
company we are an American company you
prefer to see America remain the world's
dominant global superpower I prefer that
we continue to help everywhere we serve
and we are pushing towards that but we
need to be consistent about our Terms of
Service and the reason why and the
reason why is we also have a right and a
responsibility to protect the privacy of
the people on Twitter from constant 24/7
surveillance and we have other methods
to enable any issues that an
intelligence community might see to
subpoena and to give us a proper legal
order and we will work with them I have
to say I disagree with any imperative to
be consistent between the government of
China and Russia on the one hand the
government of the United States on the
other hand or what would you be
consistent or even-handed between the
government of China and the government
of Taiwan we what I meant was a
consistency of our Terms of Service and
of course there will always be a
but we wanted we want to have those
coats who do legal process
let me turn to the actions you've taken
about the 2016 election both of your
platforms and specifically one action
you haven't taken you you have removed
several accounts as a result of your own
investigations I think some of this
committees work and I commend your
companies for that one accounts that
room one set of accounts that remain on
your platforms or WikiLeaks and Julian
Assange Secretary of State Mike Pompeo
when he was the director of the CIA
characterized WikiLeaks as a non state
hostile intelligence service this
committee has agreed with that
assessment now for a couple years in a
row yet both WikiLeaks which propagated
some of the leaked emails in the 2016
election from the Democrats remain
active on both Facebook and Twitter as
does Julian Assange miss Sandberg could
you explain why Facebook continues to
allow their plot their accounts to be
active I'm not gonna defend WikiLeaks
and I'm not going to defend the actions
of any page or actor on our platform
WikiLeaks has been public information
it's available broadly on on other media
and as such it doesn't violate our Terms
of Service and it remains up on our site
and mr. Dorsey so we we also have not
found any violation of our Terms of
Service but you know we are open as
always to any law enforcement insight
that would indicate a violation of our
Terms thank you my time is nearly
expired again I want to commend your
companies for making you available in
both of you for appearing I would urge
both your companies or a neat company
like yours to consider whether or not
they want to be partners in the fight
against our adversaries in places like
Beijing in Moscow and cheongyang and
Tehran as opposed even-handed or neutral
arbiters thank you Senator Reid well
thank you mr. chairman let me begin by
thanking you and the vice chairman for
recognizing my ex officio colleague
Senator John McCain
we were both service Academy graduates
so we don't know any Latin so we had
various translations ex-officio the one
we liked best was real cool so we were
real cool mr. chairman thank you thank
you both for being here
you have been organizing based on your
comments today very diligently for the
2018 elections and trying to anticipate
malign activities that we saw in 2016
have you seen the same type of coherence
starting with miss Hamburg from the
Funland federal government in terms of
your ability to contact them to work
with them we've long had very good
relationships with law enforcement we've
worked closely with DHS and FBI for a
long time and the FBI's new task force
on this has been particularly helpful
mr. dorsen your comment we've also had
really strong relationships with the
government I you know we're always
looking for opportunities to improve our
partnership and I think you know if I
were to list them out it would be a more
regular cadence of meetings it would be
more proactive information about secular
trends that they're seeing not just on
our platform but other platforms and
also in other channels and communication
methods and finally a consolidation of
points of contact more of a single point
of contact and we do have that
consolidation for the 2018 elections
which we're really happy with very good
one of the rules is to follow the money
and you've talked about how you in terms
of political advertising have identified
the citizenship of their advertisers but
are you able to trace the monies it's
fairly easy to set up a corporation in
the United States and the money could
all be coming from overseas even from
some pernicious sauce so Steve do you go
that far mr. America then mr. Dawson
so you're right that there are a lot of
ways to try to game the system and so we
are going to keep investing and trying
to get ahead of any tactics our
opponents would use including that one
mr. dorsen so we do our best to
understand
and the intent and where people are
located and what's behind them but this
is where strong partnership with
government comes in because we will not
always be able to infer agendas or
intent or even location in some cases in
the dialogue that you've talked about
with law enforcement is this one of
those topics where you're asking them
for information or they're asking you
and they're trying to follow the money
or have you seen any of that or has it
been sort of one of those issues that's
just too hard to think about it's both
we have seen proactive outreach from
from other side but that would be I
think a critical issue in terms of
governing the behavior of campaigns I
would hope that you would continue to
work and we would urge our colleagues
and government to work with you in that
regard one of the issues and I think
Senator Warner is and several others
have brought it up is the prevalence of
bots I'm not a technologist but it seems
to me that you could identify a BOTS
presence that you could and notify at
your consumers that mmm
35% or 80% of these messages that were
generated electronically is that
feasible and is that something you're
doing it's a mixed answer right now we
we are able to identify automations and
activity coming through our API and to
send our Warner's comments we would be
able to label that with context but we
are not necessarily as easily able to
identify people who might be scripting
our website so making it look like it's
an actual human or even the app make it
look like an actual human performing
these actions that becomes much more
challenging and unclear so in
consideration of labeling and context we
need to make sure that when people see
that bot label that they're assuming
that everything it's not on is human we
need to make sure that there's a
precision and accuracy as we label those
things like I wouldn't there be a value
and beginning the labeling process even
with the heavy
disclaimer that this identifies only
only a fraction of potential fictitious
actors yeah I mean it's definitely an
idea that we've been considering
especially this past year it's it's
really up to the implementation at this
point miss amber Gill comments this is
one of the ideas I had an opportunity to
discuss with vice-chairman Warner
yesterday and his office and is in his
white paper and we're committed to
working with you on it thank you let me
just ask a question of going forward I
think we're gonna come to a major debate
within this country when the whole world
of who owns my data which rapidly is
becoming me is it a company like
Facebook is that a company like Twitter
which raises the question of do you
believe that your users should have the
right to control what you do with the
data either selectively an individual
occurrence or generically or at will
even simply purge it at some point do
you believe that very strongly
it's your information you share it with
us if you want to delete it we delete it
and if you want to take it with you we
enable you to download it and take it
with you what about for those people
where I think many people who in the
hustle and bustle of everyday that's a
very cumbersome process should they be
shouldn't they be allowed to sort of
have a check that says every two months
delete it or delete it as soon as I put
it in or yes and we're working on some
of those tools and we've improved we've
made it easier to understand what
information we have how we're getting it
and how we use it and we're gonna
continue to iterate here mr. Dorsey the
same question we we do believe people
should have complete control over their
other data I think again Senator Warner
brought up an interesting point earlier
which is I don't believe that there's a
real understanding of the exchange being
made in terms of people performing
activities on these services and
services like Twitter
and and how they can actually see that
as an exchange an exchange of value and
those are the things I would love to
think a lot more about how do we make
that more clear and I think that goes
back to the incentives conversation
thank you thank you mr. Sherman Thank
You senator Aidan I thank all the
members for their questions and our
panelists for their answers we will turn
to the vice chairman any last comments
he might have want I want to thank you
both thank you for the spirit you
brought to this some of the suggestions
your responses to some of the
suggestions I wish on our members were
we're still here because I think they
all performed extraordinarily well I
take away from this three or four quick
points one very much appreciate mr.
Dorsey acknowledgement that we ought to
move towards and get Smith Sam Bergman
echoed this as well some ability to
indicate users where they're being
contacted by a machine or human being
recognizing there's technical
difficulties and also acknowledging that
just because it's a bot that does not
inherently mean it's good or bad it just
must be a data point that an individual
ought to have as they make
determinations going forward I also
really appreciated
Sandberg your notion that not only
should users have access to all the
information that you or others are
collecting but as we work through to
this how you monetize that and let users
know the value of their data I think
that increased price transparency and I
was very grateful that your willingness
to at least consider that because I
think that would go a long way towards
making this exchange better understood
by individuals I also and I know I
didn't get a chance to really get into
this at length that you and I've had
this conversation in the past around
data portability the complete analogy is
an old telecom guy but when number
portability came around we've got a lot
more competition in the wireless
industry and elsewhere data portability
I know you make it available right now
but in a user easily user front format
that can move from platform to platform
I think would be extraordinarily
important
terms of making sure that we continue to
have competition in the space and then
finally I also appreciated your coming I
think we're gonna have more and more of
these effort areas where manipulation
may take place that actually incensed
violence we use we both cited the
horrible example of what's happened with
their o hanga in Miramar but I
appreciate your comment that you said
that both Facebook ought to have both a
moral and legal obligation if there are
sites that are in sensing violence to
take those down getting from that idea
into how we spell that all out will be a
challenge but I appreciate your
willingness to work with me on it so mr.
chairman thank you for the fourth
hearing on this I think it's very very
important all right I think our
committee will I hope will continue to
take the lead on these subjects I think
the Vice Chairman I would ask both of
you if there any rules such as antitrust
FTC regulations or guidelines that are
obstacles to collaboration between
companies I hope you'll submit for the
record where those obstacles are so that
we can look at the appropriate steps
that we could take as a committee to
open those avenues up I want to thank
both that before appearing today and for
your continued efforts to help find a
solution to the challenging problem
this hearing represents the capstone of
four of the fourth piece of the
committee's investigation into Russian
interference in the 2016 elections
so far we've completed our inquiry into
the attempt attempted hack of state
elections infrastructure the
intelligence community assessment on
Russian activities in recent US
elections the Obama administration's
policy response to those operations with
your testimony today at this the fourth
hearing we've held on social media we
here
we heard the top level perspective on
how to address foreign influence
operations on your platforms when this
committee began its investigation into
Russian interference in the 2016
elections neither marker I fully
appreciated how easily foreign actors
could use social media to manipulate how
Americans
their views like most technology nebulae
ssin and destruction given the amount of
information companies like Google
collect on each and every American it is
also too easy for bad app not against
the American government but against the
American people
Moscow saw the issues that Talking Heads
yell about on cable news race religion
immigration and sexual orientation and
they use those to sow discord and to
foment chaos they leveraged our social
media to undermine our political system
as well but make no mistake Russia
neither leans left nor right it simply
seeks terminal a weak America is good
for Russia I think it's also important
to highlight that there is a very human
component to all of this no single
algorithm can fix the problem social
media is part of our daily laps it
serves as the family newsletter a place
to share life's personal joys and
sorrows a way to communicate one's
status during a crisis and everything in
between
unfortunately other states are now using
the Russian playbook as evidenced by the
recently uncovered Iranian influence
operations we're at a critical
inflection point while using social
media to sort the sow discord become an
acceptable tool of statecraft
how many copycats will we see before we
take this seriously and find solutions
your companies must be at the forefront
and combating those issues you know your
algorithms your customers and your data
collection capabilities better than any
government entity does or should still
the burden is not entirely on your
shoulders government civil society and
the public will partner with you I'd
like to take just a moment to thank our
staff they have worked diligently to
uncover the scope of the problem their
research has been thorough their efforts
are seamlessly bipartisan and their
drive to defend the public against
foreign influence
should make Americans Americans watching
today proud there's no clear and easy
path forward we understand the problem
and it's a First Amendment issue we
cannot regulate around the First
Amendment but we also cannot ignore the
challenge I'm confident that working
together we can find a solution and a
path forward that will only make a
stronger more connected more prepared to
face down those who seek to weaken our
democracy for your participation in
being part of the solution we thank you
