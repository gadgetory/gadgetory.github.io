and welcome to rumor has it the show
where we round up the week's biggest
tech group and then we vote on which one
sound legit and what seems like it will
never ever happen and remember that you
can vote on all the rumors too so keep
your eyes out for the pull in the
interactive player if you're watching on
cnet first on december ninth the new
york times reported that media kingpin
in New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg
is considering buying the company that
owns British newspaper The Financial
Times but that's not what got the
internet interested buried in the report
is the assertion that Bloomberg's
advisors want him to buy linked in
instead isn't Bloomberg's empire focused
on financial news media LinkedIn is not
a news organization so what do they have
to do with each other right but the
assumption of analysts is that Bloomberg
really just wants to grow and if
Bloomberg wants to reach out to a broad
base of business people like me on the
internet well linkedin would pretty much
deliver that wrapped up in a bow we
could do an entire show on the
intricacies of this rumor but we won't
because it's the holidays and we don't
want to torture you thank God but if you
want to know more please click on the
link next up satellite TV company dish
and wireless carrier sprint may be
joining forces to offer customers
bundled TV and phone service if they go
through with a deal that would let
sprint use some of dishes unused
airwaves according to a report from
Bloomberg oh I see what you did there
with that fancy segue actually the thing
is sprint isn't the only company
interested in those airwaves as we've
seen reports from google and AT&amp;amp;T saying
that they're also throwing their hats
into the ring but whoever dish goes with
it's clear that dish wants to get into
the mobile phone game there are even
rumors that it plans to start selling
smartphones at its blockbuster stores
and finally rumors regarding Microsoft
bringing its office suite iOS have been
swirling for a long time but recently
seemed to point out that it'll happen in
2013 the French site mac forever spotted
references to a few key office for iOS
applications on an official microsoft
support site that site lists office
mobile for iphone excel for ipad and
powerpoint for ipad back in october a
microsoft subsidiary in the czech
republic said that and i quote in
addition to windows office will be also
available on other operating systems
Windows Phone Windows RT Mac OS Android
iOS and Symbian but then microsoft
released a statement saying that that
information was inaccurate either way it
makes sense for Microsoft to release an
iOS sweet when they want their product
on as many devices as possible for sure
I say yay to this I think it makes sense
but also because I selfishly want word
on my phone so badly I do almost all my
writing on public transit with a pen and
a notebook because I think best while in
motion but you know what really sucks
typing it up later this would solve my
whole life you know what else really
sucks that you work for Cena and you
still use a pen and paper you can't pin
me down I like to be unexpected what are
you going to think don't forget to vote
the cnet council is composed of five
editors who cast their votes anonymously
their opinions are not an endorsement by
cnet or CBS interactive obviously
because these are rumors folks and the
scene that verdict is Wow a unanimous
yes our cnet editors think it's about
time that we get a Microsoft Office
suite on iphone that's our show
everybody please share your rumors that
rumor has it at cnet com or call us at 1
800 750 cnet and tweet us and don't
forget to tune in next week for more
tech rumors
