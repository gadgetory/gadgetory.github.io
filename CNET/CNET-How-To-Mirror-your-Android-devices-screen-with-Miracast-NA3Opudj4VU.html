screen with an HDMI cable others use
proprietary solutions like Samsung's
AllShare cast and then you've got the
chromecast which kind of lets you mirror
but is really just designed to work with
select apps it's the same Android
fragmentation story you've always heard
so here's where a new standard called
miracast comes in it lets you mirror
your android 4.2 device or later to your
TV it's 1080p 5.1 surround sound and
it's wireless but if it was really that
simple you'd probably already be using
it so here's how it works to get your
screen mirroring you'll need a miracle
receiver which can either be your TV or
a dongle you connect to it
check out the Wi-Fi Alliance website for
the complete list of compatible devices
my TV isn't compatible so I'm using net
gears push - TV it's 60 bucks so it is a
little pricey for a device that does
only one thing but that's an option if
you want to get mirroring with that
connected mirroring is simple just head
to settings display then wireless
mirroring on your Android device and
switch it on when it scans you should
see your receiver pop-up now what's
great about miracast is that unlike
airplay it doesn't require your local
Wi-Fi connection instead the receiver
creates its own ad-hoc Network for your
Android device so tap the receiver name
wait for it to connect and there's a
device on the big screen that means
everything including videos photos
webpages and apps will show up on the TV
with audio now if you know you'll be
mirroring for a while you'll probably
want to hook up your device to its
charger because the screen has to stay
awake while it's mirroring if the tablet
gets locked the TV will blackout it's
not ideal for watching movies but if you
bring the brightness down it'll save you
battery and it won't dim the TV this
setup is just one way to take advantage
of me
our cast keep an eye out for more
miracast and evil TVs coming to the
market if you have any questions hit me
up on Twitter and check out how to see
Netcom for all the ins and outs of this
technology for cnet.com I'm Sharon
