home theater gear from Sony and
Panasonic use your ps3 to stream music
and videos from your computer to your TV
the Chevy Cruze may put the brakes on
your plans to buy a hybrid and printing
on the go courtesy of HP it's all coming
up right now
hi everyone I'm Molly wood and welcome
to the cnet tech review where we collect
our hottest videos of the week and tell
you what's good and what's bad in the
world of tech plus offer some unique
tech wisdom in the form of the bottom
line let's start with the good this week
the good is all about video shooting
video playing it back streaming videos
you get the idea first up a new blu-ray
player from Sony here's Matt Mackowiak
with a first look hey I'm Matthew
miskovic at cnet com and we're going to
take a look at the sony bdp s 580
blu-ray player which is currently
selling for about one hundred and
seventy dollars like most players it has
a glossy black finish and although you
can't see any buttons from afar there
are actually a few little nubs along the
bottom for basic functions like eject
and play there's also a handy USB port
on the front and there's even a second
USB port around the back the included
remote is a simple design that we liked
and you can also control the player with
Sony's remote app which is available for
both iOS and Android the coolest thing
about the app is that you can use the
keyboard to search and streaming
services like Netflix and Amazon Instant
which you can't do on any other player
we've seen the BD PS 580 has the
standard set of features we expect at
this price including built-in Wi-Fi and
3d blu-ray support it also has the most
extensive suite of streaming media
services of any blu-ray player we've
tested including netflix amazon instant
hulu plus voodoo pandora and slacker
while we love all the services we
weren't as thrilled with the way Sony's
user interface displays them instead of
the standard netflix interface we've
seen on all the other players sony has
its own interface and unfortunately the
cover art is small and sometimes it can
be hard to read the main user interface
isn't that great either especially when
you have to scroll past tons of less
popular services to get to something
like voodoo now realm back you'll see
the a/v inputs including the HDMI output
and the coaxial audio output we put the
player through our full series of image
quality tests and it was an excellent
performer however these days nearly
every blu-ray player
has basically the same image quality
especially on blu-ray movies so it
shouldn't be a big factor when you're
making a buying decision when we tested
the speed of the player we found the
Sony is faster than the average 2011
bluray player especially when it comes
to loading Netflix and navigating movies
however it's not quite as fast as
loading blu-ray discs so you'll want to
look at the speedy panasonic DMP BDT to
10 if you want fast load times so
overall the sony bdp s 580 is a solid
blu-ray player with built-in Wi-Fi and
more streaming services than all
competing blu-ray players that we've
tested but the trade-off is you'll have
to put up with its clunky interface I'm
Matthew miskovic and this is the sony
bdp s 580 of course to really enjoy the
picture quality of a good blu-ray player
you need to have it connected to a good
TV and that's where this new set from
Panasonic comes in very good here's
David Kazmaier with the details hi I'm
David Katz meijer with cnet and I'm
sitting next to the panasonic tc-p 55 VT
30 this TV is also available in a 65
inch series this is Panasonic's highest
end television for 2011 it's a lot of
anticipation leading up to the release
of this television it's the successor to
the editor's choice our favorite TV from
last year the VT 25 and in most ways
this TV is a worthy successor it's the
best performing television we touched it
so far this year in terms of design
Panasonic went back to its one sheet of
glass on this model the single sheet
covers both the frame and the screen
itself for a sleek integrated look that
we really do like on the downside it
does have a thicker bezel than a lot of
the other plasmas out there namely the
ones from Samsung so the TV itself is
less compact for the screen size but all
told we do appreciate the thin depths as
well it's a lot thinner than last year's
models feature wise the VT 30 comes with
all the bells and whistles that includes
one pair of 3d glasses these are
infrared glasses unlike the Bluetooth
used by Samsung it does have a news
power switch however so you can easily
tell where the glasses are turned on and
off and in generally felt they kept the
sink very well despite being infrared
the internet connectivity on this TV is
also fully loaded Panasonic includes a
Wi-Fi dongle there's no built-in Wi-Fi
but you can
plug in the dongle and get Wi-Fi
connectivity without having to pay extra
the viera connect suite is the same as
featured on lower-end televisions
panasonic includes netflix and amazon
video on demand although it doesn't have
youtube or hulu plus yet we do really
like the layout of panasonic service all
the things are easy to reach and you can
arrange the thumbnails as you like
there's also a VIERA Connect marketplace
that includes a few apps and a couple of
five dollar games from Gameloft as well
as some merchandise like 3d glasses and
USP keyboards and mice of course prices
on that marketplace are pretty high at
the moment picture adjustments on the VT
30 our extensive there's a couple of THX
modes one for 3d and one for 2d those
aren't very adjustable but the custom
mode is it offers more settings than any
TV we've tested so far unfortunately
despite all those settings and custom we
weren't able to achieve as accurate as a
calibration as we hoped but THX itself
is pretty darn accurate to begin with so
we didn't miss them too much as I
mentioned the top the VT 30 is the best
picture quality of any TV we tested this
year its strength is excellent deep
black levels which are better than any
of the other panasonic we've seen this
year and also although a little bit
brighter than previous years Panasonic's
we don't expect that the CDs black
levels will deteriorate although we'll
keep testing them and let you know if
they do color accuracy on the VT 30 and
THX mode is extremely good although not
quite as good as some of the best we've
seen TV also has the ability to handle
1080p 24 sources correctly and it also
has an improved anti-glare screen 3d
performance of the VT 30 was also very
good especially in THX mode which had
accurate colors in very good shadow
detail crosstalk on this TV was
relatively infrequent although we did
see a little bit more than we've seen on
some of the best models that's a quick
look at the panasonic VT 30 series and
i'm david katz meijer you know you could
actually just skip the blu-ray part and
still get most of the same services
directly on your TV but if you're going
to spend that much on a TV that's
another couple hundred bucks unless of
course you already have a PlayStation
ever since it came out the sony ps3 has
continued to be one of our top-rated
blu-ray players but did you know that
you can also use it to stream media from
any computer on your home network here's
the always helpful Sharon Vaknin to show
you how hey I'm Sharon Vaknin for
cnet.com here with a how-to that will
help you bring your tech full circle I'm
a tech junkie so as much as I appreciate
each one of my gadgets for what they are
I also like to see them working together
so today I'll show you how to stream
music photos and videos from your Mac or
PC to your Playstation and onto the big
screen it's nice having everything in
one place first make sure your ps3 is
connected to your home network either
wirelessly or hardwired with an ethernet
cable once you're connected go to the
settings menu network settings and then
head down to media server connections
and make sure it's enabled if you're on
a PC download and install the latest
version of Windows Media Player launch
the player and go to the library menu
and select add to library here you'll be
able to add folders you want your
windows media player and your ps3 to
access these settings will depend on
where you store your media then go back
to the library menu and select media
sharing check the box next to share
media wait a few seconds and your ps3
will show up click it then allow and
then ok we'll get to what to do next on
your ps3 in a moment but first here's
how to get things set up on a Mac Mac's
don't have onboard support for this
feature so you'll need to download an
application called ps3 media server
there are lots of programs like it but
this was the only free one I found that
does the same thing as the paid ones
once its installed we'll need to tweak
some of the settings go to navigation /
share settings and uncheck everything in
the thumbnail section this means that
thumbnails won't show up on your ps3 but
it'll mean faster loading time i also
got errors when these options were
enabled so let's keep it safe and keep
them unchecked in the bottom section
you'll need to add the folders you want
available on the ps3
I added my entire hard drive but I also
added shortcuts to my music folder
workout videos and photos now had to
transcoding settings and change the
maximum bandwidth to 14 or 15 0 means an
unlimited bitrate but that makes for a
lot of live during playback a lower
bitrate does lower the quality of your
playback but that's the trade-off also
if you don't have 5.1 surround sound
hooked up to your TV go up to number of
audio channels and change it to stereo
now make sure you're connected to Wi-Fi
on your Mac and then hit save then
restart HTTP server now that we've got
things set up on the back end your media
is ready to be streamed to your ps3 go
to your ps3 menu and head to photos
videos or music your computer should
show up as one of the servers but if it
doesn't hit search for media servers if
it's still not showing up double and
triple check that you followed all my
instructions to a tee and that your ps3
and computer are on the same network but
if it does show up then you're set
you'll need to be in the music menu to
play music in the video menu to play
your videos and in the photos menu to
see your photos for music you have
options for shuffling skipping repeating
and more when you press the triangle
button when a song is playing to keep
the music playing in the background hit
the home button on your controller
instead of 0 and when you're viewing a
photo hit the triangle button to see a
slideshow of your images use r1 and l1
to move forward or backwards you can
also copy your music videos and photos
onto your ps3's hard drive by pressing
the triangle when you're viewing a file
just be aware of how much space you have
left on your drive if you're still
getting stuttering while you're
listening to music or watching videos
lower the bitrate in the settings we
changed earlier again this will lower
the quality but it beats not being able
to watch at all as always if you have
any questions come talk to me on my
facebook page and if you have any ideas
or how-to questions email how to at cnet
com for cnet I'm Sharon Vaknin and I'll
so you on the interwebs all that and you
can still get services like Netflix and
Hulu on your ps3 no matter what TV it's
connected to and the best part it
actually plays games wrapping up our
video extravaganza this week is this
week's top five cameras not cameras for
shooting photos but still cameras that
shoot great video but still shoot photos
too nevermind Brian can explain
using a video camera to shoot video
sounds reasonable enough doesn't it
except that's so 2009 I'm Brian Cooley
with top 5 digital still cameras for
shooting high def video according to the
expertise of cnet's resident photo
experts Lori Gruden and Josh Goldman now
lots of cameras shoot HD video these
days for that matter lots of smartphones
do but this list of cameras is going to
make you put your camcorder on eBay
these are really good some are DSLRs
there's a hybrid in there an advanced
mega zoom but I'm also going to show you
some pocket camera favorites for HD
video as well so let's get started
number five is the nikon d50 100 know
one thing about this camera is best in
class it's kind of a B student overall
but overall it's real solid does nothing
real poorly and exhibits relatively low
autofocus noise when shooting video I
bet you didn't think about that until
you got into this whole idea also this
camera can grab a long 20 minutes of
hi-def video in a single gulp that's
pretty good number four is the canon eos
rebel t3i video and still image quality
stands out on this guy as much as does
the stupid rebel name but canon rebels
have been great values from the
beginning and this one's right in there
and like many cameras in this list it
can shoot all the way up to 1080p and 30
frames per second that's all you're ever
going to need number three is the value
King on the list this is the panasonic
lumix dmc FZ 100 it's not a DSLR that
lens doesn't come off bolt it on there
but it's also not priced like a DSLR
under 500 bucks and it's got a 24 x
fixed zoom lens that can go wide enough
for interiors or long enough for sports
now this camera also shoots 1080p but we
found its happier shooting slightly
lower 720p which still looks great in
the high def world and remember under
500 bucks oh and it's got a flip-out LCD
number 2 is also a panasonic lumix this
one is the DMC gh2 now we're back into
interchangeable lenses with this guy and
again excellent video quality at 10
ATP and 24 frames per second which is
very filmic by the way its sensor can
actually do 1080 and 60 frames per
second really high-end stuff but it
records video in the AVCHD format and
that limits it back down to 24 p we also
like the touchscreen interface on this
camera and you can shoot 30 minutes of
continuous video as long as you have
enough battery life and storage capacity
now before I bring you to our number one
I promised you these three of our
favorite point-and-shoot cameras for
shooting high def video little pocket
guys now these all max out at 720p but
they do a really good job within that
resolution which is no slouch they fit
in your pocket of course none of them
exceed 400 bucks and none of them scream
I'm shooting now when you hold them
which can really help you grab some of
the best impromptu movies okay our
number one best digital still camera for
shooting high def video is the canon eos
5d mark two yeah i know you're saying
yeah no kidding it's pushing
twenty-seven hundred dollars without a
lens but this camera is still a steal
for what it does that's not a lot of
money for something so good they
actually shoot parts of the new hawaii
five-o series with it this is what the
pros are using out there it's got a
full-frame sensor a stunning lens system
to choose from and it's built like a
rock you can actually call this an
investment and not be wishfully thinking
okay to see all the digital camera
reviews from today's list and many
others just go to cnet com click on
digital cameras thanks to Lori and Josh
and our digital imaging team and for
more videos like this go to top 5 cnet
com I'm Brian Cooley thanks for watching
so now you're ready to pick up your
camera start shooting videos put them on
your computer and stream them to your TV
when you're not busy watching blu-rays
or playing games of course whew I feel
like I accomplished something this week
yeah me but we're not done yet it's time
to take a break but we will be back for
more tech review right after this
welcome back to the cnet tech review our
weekly video digest of all things good
and bad we've seen here at cnet TV
continuing on in the good alright this
one has nothing to do with video it's
all about the written word or more
specifically the printed word if you
work with a lot of documents and often
find yourself out on the road with
nowhere to print them it might be time
to invest in one of these babies if
you're a traveling professional that
needs the convenience of a portable
printer that really won't take up much
room in your carry-on luggage well this
device is your answer I'm just a new
associate editor for cnet com this is
your first look at the HP officejet 100
mobile printer so the goal of any mobile
device is to pare down the machine to
its small as possible form and the
mobile 100 is just small enough to fit
into a briefcase or carry-on bag the
paper input tray at the bottom and the
cover for the dual ink cartridges both
fold neatly into the body of the printer
and it weighs about the same as a
15-inch apple macbook laptop and that's
with the lithium-ion rechargeable
battery installed so you can print on a
number of different kinds of paper types
and sizes thanks to the adjustable
slider here you can use the standard
eight and a half by eleven sheet piece
of paper or you can also go down to a
three by five inch index card HP makes
things even more convenient by adding
built-in wireless Bluetooth and they
encourage you to use it by not putting a
USB cord in the box so if you want a
wired connection you'll have to buy your
own you can also print using the pic
bridge USB port on the back but at HP
strangely removes the media card slot
that we saw on previous models which is
a little bit inconvenient but this to
ink cartridge printer is made for office
documents and not quite so much photos
anyway so we won't complain too much the
HP officejet 100 may cost more than your
average single-function printer but it
makes improvements over previous models
with a sleek design and improved output
quality also the rechargeable battery
and Bluetooth wireless give you the
freedom to leave those messy cords at
home and travel light so if your
business depends on outputting jobs on
the road the HP officejet 100 mobile
definitely deserves your attention you
can read more details like speed and
quality test results in our full review
on cnet com
them but that's going to do it for me
I'm Justin you you just took a first
look at the HP officejet 100 mobile
printer thanks for watching okay that's
what they're calling a mobile printer
these days I guess briefcases are a lot
bigger than I thought they were and with
that let's move on to the bed if you're
like me you cannot stand having half a
dozen keys sitting quietly in the bottom
of your purse all day oh wait that
doesn't bother me at all so I guess I
won't be needing the keyport slide then
if you're like me and you don't like
sharp metal objects jingling around in
your pocket scratching up your phone and
ripping holes in your pants you may be
looking for a way to manage your
keychain I'm antuan goodwin and i've got
a product here that can help you tame
your wild keychain and up to six keys
it's called the keyport slide now the
ordering process for the keyport slide
involves ordering the slide unit itself
which is made of anodized aluminum and
up to six key port blades these blankies
can then be taken to your local
locksmith to be cut to duplicate your
keys which means you won't have to send
your whole key chain off to keyport you
then load the six blades into the slide
and voila you've got your entire
keychain and one rather solid block if
you've got less than six keys to replace
you can also order accessory blades that
a day for gigabyte USB Drive a bottle
opener or an LED flashlight to the
keyport slides mix if you lose your
slide the unit is etched with a unique
identifier that can be registered at my
key port calm with a reward giving a
Good Samaritan both incentive and the
means to return the unit to you that's
pretty cool but at 50 bucks for the
slide unit five dollars for each blade
accessory blades starting at six bucks
plus the cost of having your keys
locally duplicated it's also a pretty
big investment check out our complete
evaluation of the key for slide over on
cnet com to see if we think it's worth
it until then I've been asked Juan
goodwood cnet giving you your first look
at the key port flies
so let me get this straight it's
expensive it's only good for a few items
it probably won't work with many modern
car keys and oh yeah it's expensive I'm
gonna go ahead and stick to one of these
totally fine let's wrap things up with
this week's bottom line Brian coolies
back with a look at the 2011 chevy cruze
eco edition which might make you rethink
whether it's time to get a hybrid
it's a Chevy that might make you forget
imports not to mention hybrids let's
drive to 2011 chevy cruze eco and check
the tech the 40-plus mpg club is
rarified air and this is one of its few
members 42 mpg on the highway that's
better than a smart fortwo yet in a car
that holds two times as many people but
the technology in this guy mostly lives
under the hood not in the dash now yes
we're driving a skinny lean green eco
car but the car makers all know you
don't want the car to feel that way when
you're in it so in here is a nice cabin
GM and Ford and Chrysler have all been
doing nice interior materials for a
while now pretty much without exception
and this guy shows that nice different
textures good surfaces whether you like
this sort of Darth Vader mask design as
a matter of taste but everything is done
well and feel solid with the one
exception of this very strange dash
panel seat insert and door insert
material which i think is just stock on
an eco and looks like a whore's drawers
got stretched all around yet not really
big on that here's your display it's the
only one you're ever going to see
there's no big color LCD nav available
on this car so you're going to have this
more basic sort of LCD monochrome deal
it shows your AM and FM radio your XM
radio no HD on this guy your other media
options include a CD player here and
then we've got an optional aux and USB
under a tiny little door right there in
the console and the sound comes out of
six speakers of indeterminate type and
wattage it's straightforward on that and
there's no upgrade on the factory build
sheet now without navigation yes but
with navigation yes what I mean is
you've got OnStar directions and
connections that means this comes stock
as just about every GM car does with the
ability for you to call OnStar here get
directions and they'll be downloaded to
the car and you'll see them right down
here on that helper screen basic
directions you can also make cell phone
calls here this is a calling service but
bring your phone we have Bluetooth
hands-free on this guy that is part of
an option package not standard and that
same package rolls in cruise control you
see here and also audio controls in the
steering wheel once
the stuff yet probably wants so check
that one off now note the shifter yes
the 6-speed manual that's kind of your
preferred default gearbox on this guide
they've got a big green dot around the
six the overdraw that's always overdrive
on every manual gearbox I know but they
call it eco gear which i guess is just a
taller over drive on the freeway at 60
is turning about 1800 rpm ok now cruze
eco has got a very special motor it's a
little thing it's turbocharged 1.4 litre
sidesaddle in line for it delivers 138
horsepower 148 diminutive foot-pounds of
torque although being a turbo motor that
torques kind of an elevated number so
that really helps 0 to 60 is like a 10.2
second affairs car is not about being
fast MPG is what it is all about 28
city42 highway with the six-speed manual
with the Eco gear unless you get the
automatic then you get a hell of a
haircut on the highway MPG it comes down
to 37 let's look at some of the
technologies they're using here if you
look in the very back you can see the
electric power steering rack that takes
drag off the engine here's the turbo
down here notice it's integral in the
exhaust manifold lighter smaller cheaper
now down here in the lower grille you've
got some louvers that shut I think
during highway speeds or when you're at
cruising because that cuts down some of
the air disturbance flowing through the
car and over here in the wheel wells
we're taking a look at ultra low rolling
resistance tires all of this adds up to
the package that puts the eco ahead of a
standard cruise oh yeah and don't forget
the weight they shave 200 pounds off
this guy over a similarly engine bay
screws okay what's it like driving a 1.4
liter turbo in a decent sized car it's
actually pretty good uh you never get
this feeling of brawn it needs to be
stroked and spun up all the time but
that's just turbo motors for you
especially small displacement ones the
power comes on very smoothly feels
pretty linear turbo lag is less of an
issue here than in some bigger and
the turbos I've driven the car feels it
gets hewn from an ingot of aluminum I'm
very impressed by the build quality and
the overall balance you know for a
taildragger it's got really nice road
manners it's not a performance car but
I'm on a twisty canyon road here some
off camber sort of turn some of them are
decreasing radius and only when you push
it pretty hard do you feel those
low-rolling-resistance tires kind of
ballet around a little bit but not badly
not for the kind of car it is I really
enjoyed driving it I found it was just
kind of fun and energizing is the right
word the electric power steering is
really nicely calibrated it doesn't have
any sort of any sort of what switch in
that some electric systems seem to have
where you feel it kind of get lumpy or
weirded places this one's always kind of
linear and smooth the only thing I don't
like is this shift light it's quite
bright and it gets your attention and
it's stupid I don't like its advice if
you follow that light's advice you're
driving around at thirteen hundred rpm
all the time even when you're going up a
grade I mean it's it's just stupid it
loves the engine all the time so wish I
could turn that stupid thing off but if
you gotta live with it you gotta live
with it and of course the great option
on this car is that if you happen to be
driving along and you meet a prostitute
on the side of the road is missing her
underwear you can fashion her a new pair
from the dashboard no other car I know
does that okay pricing now unlike a lot
of hybrids the cruze eco starts cheap
and eats cheap 19 22 by the car and of
course the MPG is great a couple of
packages you want to throw on it to get
it seen that style well sort of one's
called the convenience package it's
going to give you back up sensors remote
start and power driver's seat
adjustments a few of them anyway the
other one is a connectivity package it's
only like five and a quarter and for
that you get a whole lot of features the
USB in the console steering wheel audio
controls that's where you get bluetooth
hands-free also is that package and it
also rolls in cruise control that's
about it for checking this guy up but
you can do a lot in the aftermarket with
the money you're going to save on gas
the bottom line this week why can't echo
be cooler I mean the cruise isn't going
to win any prizes for design and you'd
better know how to drive a stick if you
really want to save every last drop of
