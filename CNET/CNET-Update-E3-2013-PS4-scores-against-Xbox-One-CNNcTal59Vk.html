Bridget Carey and this is your CNET
update the PlayStation 4 won the battle
for e3 against Xbox one at the e3 video
game conference in Los Angeles
Sony finally revealed the design for the
ps4 that's coming out this holiday
season and the audience roared with
cheers when Sony announced that the ps4
will have no restrictions for use games
and no requirement to have an internet
connection both of which are
controversial features of Microsoft's
Xbox one Microsoft will restrict Xbox
one games to be lent to only one of your
friends and there could be a fee for use
games and you can't play games if your
internet goes down for more than a day
the whole mess is just so confusing sony
won over hearts by just keeping things
the same go thing not only that but sony
announced the ps4 will be $100 cheaper
than the xbox one it's likely the Xbox
one costs that extra hundred dollars
because it includes a new Kinect sensor
basically Microsoft was already down and
then Sony walked out and just kicked it
in the spleen Sony used to be the more
expensive console but the tables have
turned Microsoft still has some time to
talk up the value of the Xbox one before
the holidays and games will be a big
part of that argument at its e3
presentation Microsoft showed off 13
exclusive games for the Xbox one
like Ryse son of Rome the graphics were
just flawless when it live demo the
gameplay of this first-person
hand-to-hand combat game based in
ancient Rome and your character is
commanding an entire army in battle we
also saw a trailer for Metal Gear Solid
5 the phantom pain featuring Kiefer
Sutherland as the voice of snake there
was also a tease of a new Halo game
coming in 2014 where Master Chief is in
a desert environment and this Halo will
run at 60 frames a second Xbox games
stood up more than PlayStation which had
less exclusive titles but it will have
some exclusive in-game content a few
noteworthy ps4 titles will be infamous
second son
it's the third installment in the
infamous series where your character has
the power of smoke
there's the dark sorcerer which showed
off details facial expressions for
characters when it comes to memberships
the PlayStation Plus service costs fifty
dollars a year and it will be needed if
you want to play online against others
but it also throws in a free downloaded
independent game every month Microsoft
is doing something similar Xbox Live
Gold members will also be offered free
game downloads this is just the
beginning of the console wars this
holiday there's still much to learn
about these systems for more coverage on
e3 including news on Wii U games visit
