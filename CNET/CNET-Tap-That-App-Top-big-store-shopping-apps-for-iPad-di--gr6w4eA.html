and this is the show where we cover the
hottest apps in the mobile space the
gift-giving season is here and if you're
like me and want to avoid the shopping
rush the traffic and the crowds i have
the perfect trifecta of big store
shopping apps for you to find the cream
of the crop i looked at a bunch of
shopping apps for major stores like
Nordstrom target Zappos and Walmart and
then narrowed it down to my three
favorites these apps are the easiest to
use and make it a snap to comparison
shop and get exactly what you're looking
for to get started the Sears app for
iPad lays out shopping categories on a
continuous scrolling page everything
from appliances and clothing to beauty
products and toys can be found by
browsing the main page but if you want
to search for something hit the products
button in the upper left here you'll
find a list of categories and a search
box to enter exactly what you want we'll
search for Craftsman tools the sears app
gives you a big list of search results
and by touching an item you get a bigger
image of the product the list price a
description of the item and options for
adding it to your shopping list or even
sharing it on social sites what makes
this app great is how quickly you can
navigate through the catalog and the
well design layout makes it easy to shop
on your iPad like all the apps I'm
talking about today the Sears app is
free next step no shopping app list
would be complete without the Amazon
mobile app rather than setting up its
catalog and categories like sears the
amazon app gives you featured or sale
items on the home page but relies on the
search box for getting around its
inventory we'll try searching for
blu-ray player as that is a popular item
this season as you can see the amazon
app lists all the blu-ray players on the
left with the lowest prices listed and
shows the star reviews for each product
tapping a product brings it up in the
right side window the product page
indicates if it's currently available
and lets you perform tasks like adding
it to your wish list buying it
immediately or sifting through prices at
various locations on the bottom the
apple a's out detailed specs customer
reviews and similar items that are easy
to navigate with
of your finger if you have an amazon
account you can sign in and view current
deals recommended items your wish list
and more just like the website amazon is
also a free app and is a fantastic
resource for holiday shopping and
comparing prices between stores my third
apps today doesn't have the variety of
the first two but offers a layout that
might be the best of the bunch Zappos
was initially known for shoes and that
hasn't changed but they have a few
categories to look through that will be
useful this holiday season to show how
smartly the app is designed we'll try
searching for men's clothing the app
displays categories with big pictures so
they're easy to see on the iPad going to
the jackets and coats section you'll
notice that they're listed with big
pictures so it's easy to browse through
different styles can swipe to look
through all the selections or tap a coat
to go to the product page not only does
it display a giant picture of the
product you can swipe to see more views
or change the color and app responds
instantaneously the right side shows
pricing and size selections and you can
quickly look at product details browse
through reviews or read about the brand
in more detail you also can sign in to
your account and add items to favorites
or share items on Twitter via SMS to a
friend or through email as you can see
even though the free Zappos app doesn't
have the variety of products the other
two have the shopping experience might
be the best of the group on the iPad
that's all we have time for today but if
you want a much more relaxing shopping
experience this holiday season i
recommend you tap any of these big
storage shopping apps that's it for this
week's show if you have any suggestions
send them to tap that app at cnet com
i'm jason parker and we'll see you next
time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
