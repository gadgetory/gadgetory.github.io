to buy yourself another purple drive I
have a good one for you I'm don't go and
this is the toshiba can vio connect
purple drive now note I say another
because by now you haven't had a proper
Drive like this one what is wrong with
you these drive right here they are
pretty easy to use pretty affordable and
can quickly expand your computer store
space most importantly you can use them
to backup your data which is very
important
so if you have had yourself one this is
your chance to fix that now there are a
few things that makes it try different
from the rest of the drives here well
first is wrapped which is very cool a
heart for that mara color and secondly
is very compact support USB 3.0 and is
bus power meaning you only need one
cable this one right here included to
make it work
and finally what really makes this one
special is in his name why can video
doesn't mean anything connect mean that
it can offer a lot more than just stop
space and it turned out this is the
first ride on the market that come
included with the Pogoplug pc software
this software turn the drives host
computer into a personal cloud server as
long as the computer is turned on and
connected to the internet then you can
remotely access data store on the drive
as well as the drive of the computer via
the internet no matter where you are in
my testing the dry offer very good
performance both with USB 2.0 and USB
3.0 unfortunately it didn't work with
all of the USB 2.0 port that I try it
with but that is not a big deal because
by now you should have a computer that
support USB 3.0 if not what is wrong
with you
I'm just kidding I think varo USB 2.0 is
still good in most cases the can vo
connect Drive come in a wide range of
capacity from 500 goodbye to 2 terabyte
and cost somewhere between $90 and $190
it actually pretty expensive compared
with its peers but that exactly why you
need an excuse to have it and even then
you cannot get it right away because the
dry starts shipping
in mid-may which is about two weeks from
now in the meantime you can learn more
about this drive by checking out the
food with us calm and when you're there
make sure you check me out via Facebook
Twitter or Google+
be warned no matter how much time you
spend on me you'll find nothing wrong at
all
alright for that matter I just am and
that's because I'm dumb no and this has
been the first look at the can vo
connect drive from Toshiba</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
