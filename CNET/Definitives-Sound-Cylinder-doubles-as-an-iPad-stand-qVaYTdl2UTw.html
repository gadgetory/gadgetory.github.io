cnet.com and I'm here with the
definitive technology sound cylinder
this is a portable Bluetooth speaker
with a little bit of a twist it also
converts into a stand for your tablet
definitive is known for its great
sounding high-end speakers so it is a
little bit of a surprise that it would
do a small Bluetooth speaker like this
but it does sound decent and it is well
built as you can see it has a little bit
of metal wrapped around it as this metal
alloy exterior and it has a sleek design
but it does have those extra parts it
does have a retractable kickstand then
you can flip the speaker over and lay it
down on these rubber clamps that are
supposed to clamp down on any tablet it
won't necessarily work with all tablets
however for instance with the iPad Mini
which has a narrower bezel it'll cover
up a little bit of the screen on the
bottom in horizontal mode so it doesn't
work with all devices this is really
designed more for the iPad 2 3 and 4
that bigger tablet all-in-all this
certainly has an interesting design did
have a couple of little problems with it
this does prop up your iPad of however
because of the way it's balanced it's a
little precarious if you happen to knock
into it from behind you can't end up
tipping over your device my other
problem with is it's $200 list price
this is a little bit expensive for what
it is you can now get other speakers
like the JBL flip which retail for
around $100 that sound as good or better
than this and also have speakerphone
capabilities this doesn't have a
speakerphone it does come with a 3.5
millimeter cable for connecting non
Bluetooth devices as well as a very
simple cloth carrying case in the end I
did like the speaker but I do have a
hard time enthusiastically endorsing it
because of its high price and because
other competing products sound as good
or better I'm David Carr noise and
that's the definitive technology sound
cylinder thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
