360 it's a $59 rig that assembles
together six cameras to take immersive
video and if you don't have the cameras
it costs $5,000 to get it all in one
package what did you think of this
gigantic gopro omni mr. Goldman uh it's
it's not gigantic okay it's no that's
right it's actually like yeah it's
manageable you can see it it's like the
Sun it's like what would you describe
the size that it slightly cantaloupe
can't Oh perfect I can totally relate my
channel oh okay yeah I'm it's important
anyway uh yeah I didn't review it we got
a demo of it okay which was great
because we got to see it but you know
can demo oh my god look at the thing
that's giving you this yeah so it is
pretty incredible because it's got six
cameras and certain it's getting all
that and it gives you a resolution up to
8k Wow
not that you need that for most things
anything 4k is nice so it does that it's
just it's it's really streamlined I'd
say that instead of like stitching all
that stuff together yeah so I mean it's
a complete product unlike where they've
had mounts that you can slap the go
right cameras that you're sort of on
your own
exactly once you get through that this
keeps all the cameras synchronized so
you're not going in and like clapping
before you start rolling or you know so
you know where you start editing right
or anything how does it do that it's all
they all plug into the inside of the
mount and GoPro allows for like a sort
of Universal tethering thing to head
well let's go pros rig got it so it's
they came up with them yes they designed
it it's all really cool all the stuff
sync together
you press do you have one master camera
right and you turn that one on all the
other ones come on you press record all
the all of them start recording at the
same time right pretty cool yeah no it's
great now how much is this it's $1,500
oh right have you read that part
and five grand if you don't have the
GoPros well I mean that five grand
all-in package comes with software the
color software that is used for merging
everything together and editing it so
you get the color auto panel software
you get the rig you get the cameras you
get micro SD cards right card readers
they said sure yeah you get an external
battery get this whole case that it
comes in right it's I added it up and
it's over five thousand dollars okay so
but hopefully someone brings it to space
or right or water and it could have like
an immersive underwater I wouldn't have
that in space yet they have an
underwater raid because there is there
are water shots of it being used gotcha
I don't can't do anything 15 things you
figure out the space thing 1505 a lot of
money is there a cheaper more affordable
way to get 360 video yes oh it will not
be as good as what comes out of those go
well it's made for professionals sure
it's a lesson nobody should confuse that
as a as a you know consumer or even a
prosumer rig yeah this is its Ferber
super high-end yeah it's first it's for
somebody who really wants to produce 360
video right if you want to just mess
around with it yeah there are options
that are ready there for you oh you have
some of them here to just show us real
quick like a cheaper 360 video thing
what's that that iPhone editions where
what happened yeah I stole it all right
so yeah so this is the insta 360 nano
it's unfortunately only really good for
iPhone users so I'm out of luck with a
galaxy but we've got the Galaxy 360 are
the gear 360 anyway but what this is
it's got the little lightning adapter in
the bottom and then you just pop it in
and hopefully it'll come to life takes a
second pop that in and then the photo
launches 360
really right now even though none of the
lenses are directly facing me
technically what are you doing nice okay
oh right yes okay I'm gonna put on the
front of my skateboard or that or the
dress that upsets me all these where you
can't I mean you can use it handheld
yeah it's really cool though it's like
look without the iPhone you have to turn
the iPhone upside down so the lock word
for what it's worth man that's
impressive like it's it is and it's only
200 bucks so yeah if you just want to
mess around and and share some cool 360
stuff with your friends right
this is totally a good way to go if
you're looking for something really you
want to get in 360 editing and stuff
like shut you're not gonna mess around
with this so what do you think man is
360 here to stay do people really want
that I think so actually I had this
conversation earlier today even the
thing of it is is that compared to a lot
of people compared to 3d like when I
like oh everybody was like it's shoving
3-d down our throats yeah so that didn't
really pan out
the big difference is you don't need
glasses to enjoy this right there's no
yes you can throw it in your VR goggles
and enjoy it that way
but you and me are just sitting here
watching 360 on the phone and you can do
it on any phone or tablet and YouTube
has like a recent play too and Facebook
so yeah they it's just it's there it's
it's it's wonderfully sharing yeah yeah
so and yeah still when I hand over my
phone to people and I show them a 360
video they're super impressed they don't
care about the image quality right the
image quality for the consumer ones it's
pretty bad at this point I mean some are
better than others but yeah
it'll get better alright right now it's
pretty much a play with it donar don't
don't expect great things from it good
play with it very good very informative</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
