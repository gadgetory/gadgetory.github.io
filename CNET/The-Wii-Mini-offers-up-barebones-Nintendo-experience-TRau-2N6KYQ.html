this year is the Wii mini not the Wii U
if you're shopping this holiday season
and you see a little box like this and
it says it's a me.we mini now you're
going to know what it entails because
while it seems like a potentially great
holiday buy it's hundred dollars and it
comes with Mario Kart Wii comes with a
Wii Remote Plus comes with the nunchuck
and the system well you add that up the
Mario Cart and the remote and the
nunchuck actually sell for nearly $90
now and a lot of sites I've looked at so
maybe that means that this is basically
free or ten dollars so that may sound
like a great deal but consider this the
Wii mini doesn't go online I'm going to
let that sink in for a moment it doesn't
go online no there's no Wi-Fi
connectivity no Ethernet here maybe
that's a parent's dream but I'll tell
you two reasons it's a big problem one
you can't go online and play with
friends now
maybe the Wii wasn't a great online
experience but Mario Kart certainly is
in fact it's the best online playable
racing game that's out there and you
can't do that with the Wii mini the
second thing and this is a really
disappointing one is that there are a
lot of great online downloadable games
on the Wii Shop
there are Virtual Console games all your
cool NES Super NES all those little
retro five-dollar games that you want to
play a lot of indie games guess what you
can't download and play them on this
system what you can play are all the Wii
disc games now there are a really good
selection of wee disc games out there
there are a lot that you may not even
realize we're there and you can get them
for a song and use game shops and you
know you get all the Mario games in the
Zelda games and and Wii Sports sure but
consider the fact that there are Wiis
that are still out there that cost about
as much as this and there are bundles
that are just a few dollars more that
include the online connectivity and
still have games plus if you want to
think about the fact that you're there's
a new Wii U that's out there that's as
better graphics and can play Wii games
and uses the Wii remotes so it's
backwards compatible system yes that
costs a lot more and the Wii U is not
really a perfect console yet but it's a
tempting
and maybe take that money and put it
towards one of those that has video
services like Amazon and Netflix because
again also you can't use Netflix with
this so that's a third thing you can't
use any video streaming services that's
a lot of stuff that you're not getting
in the package now a family that might
consider this the OTT lack of online a
plus well then have at it if you're we
you know died in a fire and you've got a
lot of games and you want to find a way
to get play all those games you don't
want to spend a lot and you don't have
Mario Kart you want an extra controller
well then okay but I've considered that
online a huge downside and there's one
other thing this connects with a
built-in RCA cable RCA that technology I
have not seen in a long time and it
produces video quality like this really
really fuzzy not the ideal way to play
games so you have to buy one of those
cables too which takes away from the
value proposition in the wii mini now
Nintendo did budget right with the
Nintendo 2ds that thing packs all the
features of the 3ds and cost less the
Wii mini is the same size pretty much as
a Wii and has fewer features that's not
the way I go with a budget gaming
console
I'm Scott Stein and that's a look the
disappointing Wiener</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
