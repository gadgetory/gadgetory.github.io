cnet and this is the samsung UN es 8000
series this is a 55 inch version this
review will also apply to the 46 the 60
and the 65 inch version of this series
this is Samsung's highest end TV for
2012 this TV has all the bells and
whistles it's also Samsung sleekest
design yet we'll start with the design
because it really is the high point of
this TV around the edge you can see it's
got this silver strip it's got a really
thin strip of black right next to the
screen and the whole thing measures
about a half an inch from the screen to
the very edge and that's among the
thinnest bezels we've seen of course is
the result this TV is pretty much all
picture above and below that picture
you'll actually see two little bulges
one has the samsung logo the one on the
top is the most interesting though it
actually contains a little camera and a
little microphone so the idea is you can
wave at the TV to turn it on and to do a
couple of the rudimentary features using
the camera and you can also speak to it
using the microphone so you can do basic
commands again like turn off volume up
even change the channel things like that
now this TV function is called smart
interaction when I gave it a test drive
it wasn't really as good as using the
remote control actually tended to
misinterpret a lot of things that I said
the control is very limited as i said
but again this is a very unique feature
on a high-end TV so you know can't
really get it on any other television we
expect it to be a little bit refined
through firmware updates but all told I
prefer to stick to a standard remote
control speaking remotes this TV
actually includes two different models
as a standard infrared multi button
model and this touchpad version here
that uses a thumb pad just like a
standard laptop it's really great for
browsing the internet although it wasn't
quite as responsive as I expected on a
set like this one bonus for this
touchpad remote is the fact that it
doesn't require line-of-sight he uses
bluetooth to communicate with the TV
there's only a couple buttons on here so
actually doing anything beyond again
volume and channel up-down is a little
bit taxing because you got to go into a
menu to do that samsung also throws in
another accessory this little bluetooth
ir dongle that allows that bluetooth
remote to control other infrared devices
in your system including a cable box and
a blu-ray player again it doesn't work
quite as well as a universal remote but
it's neat to be able to use the included
remote to do all that kind of stuff
as a high on TV of course the set
includes Smart TV samsung as the most
content of any Smart TV provider out
there except for Google TV you can go
out and find a bunch of different apps
there's also the standard suite of audio
video Samsung does have HBO GO its
unique this year although it's not quite
yet included on this 2012 model we
expect that to happen soon there is also
no Amazon Instant on this set unlike a
lot of the other TVs out there all told
however it's smart TV suite is superb we
actually expect it to include a cloud
gaming service again later this year
speeding up the response time of that
smart TV is Samsung's dual-core
processor new to this set you can
actually upgrade that processor at some
point later samsung says as early as
2013 you can swap out the processor and
the memory for a better version so
that's called smart evolution and again
a unique feature round back stamps
includes three HDMI that's one fewer
than a lot of the other high-end TVs out
there there's also three USB ports a
component video input but there's no vga
style input for analog computers since
the air around the bezel so thin samsung
also allows control of the TV via this
little knob instead so you can see it
calls up an on-screen menu that is
actually pretty slick with all the
features and slick design and high price
of this TV I did expect the picture
quality be a little bit better than we
found this TVs weakness is it's
relatively light black levels it doesn't
reach that nice deep black that can
infuse the picture with better color and
of course a better picture with the
lights off and when viewing dark
material on the flip side the Samsung
does a very good job with color and
video processing the screen is glossy so
it will reflect more ambient light than
matte screens out there but on the flip
side it does help preserve black levels
a little bit better in high overhead
lighting unlike last year the uniformity
is a little bit better so there aren't
as many bright spots on the screen
although again that's a little bit of a
problem compared to some of the other
LED TVs out there 3d performance is a
high point the set has less crosstalk
than most of the other active TVs I've
seen out there but all told us to do
performance a little bit disappointing
for such a high-end model that's a quick
look at samsung's un es 8000 series on
