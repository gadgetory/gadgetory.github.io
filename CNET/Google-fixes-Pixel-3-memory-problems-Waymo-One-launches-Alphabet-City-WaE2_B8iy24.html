pixel park a while ago reports surfaced
that the newest pixels were having
issues with multitasking in particular
apps would be reloaded or crash
regularly the founder of Android police
comm put up a video comparing the pixel
3xl versus a one plus six where do you
see how the pixel reloads apps that are
already running it's quite sad really
a new update to the pixels include
improvements in memory performance which
it hopefully fixed the weird
multitasking issues also included in the
update our camera improvements and some
adjustments related to the pixel stand
also call screening what transcripts are
rolling out now - pixel users to access
it head over to recent calls call

some who participated in the early rider
program with coverage to expand later
way mo says way mo one will be available
24 hours a day 7 days a week around the
metro Phoenix area the way mo one app
can be used to get you a car and we'll
give you price estimates at first you
can expect safety drivers behind the
wheel but the plan is to transition to
fully driverless rides one day prior to
the launch of way mo 1 the company
picked up a couple of new executives
unintentional pun notwithstanding way mo

created position of chief Safety Officer

alphabets sidewalk shared plans for
development it's working on in Toronto
called quayside now what is sidewalk
it's an alphabet company that wants to
create a new type of place to accelerate
urban innovation what does that even
mean essentially sidewalk is working on
redesigning the city for the modern
world
it wants cities to be people centered
have housing be affordable and reduce
carbon emissions piece of cake right for
quayside sidewalk says housing will be
40% below market prices nearly 4,000
jobs will be located in quayside after
the development would be finished
sidewalk also says that quayside would
have a 75 to 85 percent reduction in
greenhouse gas emissions
thanks to clean energy sources like
photovoltaic panels and geothermal wells
and a blog post the company said
sidewalks approach is fundamentally
rooted in creating inclusive
neighborhoods that improve quality of
life for all none of this is tech for
tech sake
the plan is subject to a number of
roundtable discussions including one on
December 8th and another in early 2019
let's go to Uptown updates ok there's so
much news I'm gonna try to pack in as
much as I can right here let's go Google
CEO sundar pichai will testify before
Congress on December 11th about
censorship on conservative speech
originally he was to testify on the 5th
but that was delayed due to the passing
of President George HW Bush alphabets
deepmind entered a protein folding
competition for the first time and won
long story short deepmind used AI
techniques to predict the structures of
proteins understanding how proteins are
folded can allow for medical advances as
some diseases are believed to be caused
by misfolded proteins the intercept
published even more information on
dragonfly Google sent to search engines
for China this time its sources say the
project was essentially hidden from
privacy and security teams as it was
being developed within Google a report
from 9 to 5 Google said hangouts was
going to be shut down in 2020 the head
of hangout said something like no that's
not entirely right the takeaway is that
hangouts will likely be replaced by a
future messaging service but
timetable is not official yet and
finally YouTube music for Android got an
update and equalizer just fire up
YouTube music hit settings and take a
look at the new equalizer function that
was a lot on to comment code this is the

spotlight at the most amazing audience
in the world you James says if the pixel
3 light is legit and the price is
reasonable I would get it without a
doubt I'd also be interested in a budget
pixel there is nothing like getting an
Android update on day one christian asks
when will Google come out with their own
SmartWatch you know I thought about this
one for a while I think that Google is
currently focusing its main Hardware
efforts on Google Home Products Plus
Google is the home of nest again so what
am I saying I think a Google SmartWatch
could actually end up being something
more like a home / assistant product so
I'd say we'd see a watch next October
designer grant asks do you think Samsung
should ditch the curved screen as
someone who sells phones for a living
they break the most on the curve that's
a tough question but I'll say Samsung
should keep the curve it's a visual
indicator to the consumer that they've
got a Samsung phone practically speaking
though I don't think the curved edges
give any real advantages thanks to
everyone for writing in if you've
enjoyed your stay in Alphabet City

Maps app assistant is a little sleeker
