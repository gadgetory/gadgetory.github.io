convenience and safety to your life the
August smartlock takes care of both of
these that's why this year this is our
top pick for a gift in the smart home
and appliances category any tech
enthusiast that wants to make their home
more connected will be thrilled with
this gift it works with your existing
dead booth so you can still enter with
your key if you'd like and turn it to
lock from the inside as usual with no
power required and no one on the outside
will be able to even tell you have it
installed we've seen lots of smart home
products disrupt the basic functionality
of their newly connected item August
avoids that trap it adds Bluetooth and
app enabled functionality without taking
any of the old fashioned options away
via bluetooth you can lock and unlock
the door remotely with the app for iOS
or Android if you generally forget to
lock your door you can automate that
process and have August lock up behind
you after a set amount of time and in
terms of convenience if you get home and
you have an arm full of groceries you
can use the geofencing feature for the
iOS version of the app to unlock the
door for you once you get within a
hundred yards you can also hand out and
take away digital keys to guests at will
with no extra cost and hey if you're
giving this as a gift you want it to
look August was designed by award winner
yves behar it seems a little bulky at
first
but it grows on you you also don't want
to give somebody a tech gift that will
be obsolete in a few months good news
August is limited to bluetooth but it's
already compatible with the smart things
and harmony hubs for wider connectivity
and August is on the list of products
ready for apples up coming home kit so
this lock connect is an important piece
of a larger connected home for a long
time to come making it the perfect smart
home gift for any tech enthusiast for
cnet appliances I'm Andrew gebhardt</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
