the best sounding active
noise-cancelling headphones we've tested
it's an on-ear model and very
comfortable for an on-ear headphone with
nicely padded ear cuffs and a sleek
sturdy design the question is why would
you get this over Bose is quiet comfort
25 headphone well for starters it takes
up a little less room in your bag this
is a smaller headphone and folds up to
fit and included neoprene carrying case
also at 250 dollars it's a little less
expensive but really the main reason is
that it sounds better than the Bose it's
a cleaner sounding headphone with more
detail and tighter bass and decent
openness for an on-ear headphone battery
life is good at 30 hours of active
noise-cancelling and if the battery runs
out you can listen in passive mode
without the headphone being powered the
noise canceling isn't quite as effective
as boses and there's a very faint hiss
when it's engaged that said I thought it
was quite good overall and worked well
muffling sound in our office on a plane
the subway and walking the streets of
New York to be clear this is a wired
headphone there is no Bluetooth and it
does have a few small downsides instead
of the standard micro USB charger you'd
use to charge your phone you have to
charge the battery via the headphone
jack with a 2.5 millimeter sub mini plug
to USB cable lose that charging cord and
you can't charge the headphone anymore
and will have to seek a replacement
it's also worth pointing out that there
are no volume controls on the headphone
cord which has a fabric cover to reduce
coronoid it's a one button universal
remote that allows you to pause and play
tracks answer an end calls and to skip
tracks forward and back those minor
gripes aside this is a well-designed
headphone that's worth considering over
the Bose if sound quality is your
highest priority in an active
noise-cancelling headphone I'm David
