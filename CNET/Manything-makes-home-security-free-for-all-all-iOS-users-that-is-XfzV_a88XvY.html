is a review of the many thing iOS app so
many thing is an iOS app that will
convert your iPod touch your iPad or
your iPhone into a security camera in
just a few minutes it's really a great
convenient way for people interested in
home security to experiment with it
without having to spend anything and
while it doesn't quite offer the video
quality of what we experienced with say
a Dropcam pro it has a ton of features
and it's really really easy to set up
and use I had a camera set up and
running in probably less than 60 seconds
that's pretty amazing because the
Dropcam pro the samsung smart cam HD Pro
and the Belkin NetCam HD plus all took a
little bit longer not much longer but
enough to notice a difference anything
doesn't have two-way talk it doesn't
have an official night vision mode but
it does have a low light mode and it
will still send you motion alerts when
someone walks by you can customise them
in much the same way as you can with
drop cam or any other IP camera we've
tested and it was very responsive and
worked very well the one problem I ran
into was video quality it's basically
limited to the specs of your iOS device
so it's not going to be perfect but it's
free
that makes it a fantastic way for iOS
users to experiment with entry-level
home security say you're thinking about
getting a Dropcam pro but you're not
sure that you want to spend 199 bucks
just yet pull out that dusty old iPad
and you can test the functionality to
see if it's something you'd really want
to use so while it has some limitations
as far as features and performance it
actually offers if compatibility which
is something that none of the other IP
cameras have so that makes it unique it
also lets you customize motion zones the
Belkin NetCam HD plus doesn't have that
functionality so considering that this
is a free DIY security camera that's
pretty incredible so there's really
nothing bad to say about this it's
simple it's fast it's free and I have no
problem recommending this iOS app thanks
for watching I'm Megan bulletin for CNET
and this has been a review of the many
thing I OSF
