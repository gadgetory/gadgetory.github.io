Note 8 have some of the best cameras on
phones right now but how does the video
compare we're going to test them out in
a range of situations to see how they go
we tested them out on some kids farm
animals and scenic views at slide ranch
in California
everything was shot at default settings
at 1080p 30 frames a second unless
otherwise stated let's start with
portraits in this scenario the lighting
is varied and the exposure on both
phones changes throughout the shot on
the note skin tones start off quite
washed out but they even out to a more
natural look the iPhone image has more
contrast and the skin tones are warmer
but the background does slow out when
the lighting changes the autofocus on
the note adjusts quickly but it looks a
little jerky the iPhone is slower to
shift focus but it's much smoother
moving to the front camera the image is
pretty washed out on the note and the
iPhone has more contrast and color
accuracy the field of view on the note
is also more narrow which is a little
too close for comfort video 8 video
without sound so testing out the
microphones is important
listening on the same pair of headphones
to my ears the notes audio is much more
immersive and sounds like a true stereo
experience the iPhone sounds flat both
the phones shoot in 4k at 30 frames per
second but the iPhone can also shoot 60
frames per second in this resolution
while I film this in 4k unfortunately
the video you're watching isn't exported
in 4k so you can't view it at its actual
resolution both phones produce
impressive footage but again you'll only
be able to get the real benefits if you
watch it on a 4k screen you can also
switch between the wide and the
telephoto lenses during filming and the
results appear sharp in both fields of
periods moving to slo-mo the note does
240 frames per second but only at 720p
so if you want full HD at 240 you'll
want the iPhone
so here's a tracking shot to see who
there's a sheep in the background
there's a tracking shot to see how the
image stabilization works on both of
these phones so I do have them on a rig
but there's still a lot of hand movement
so see how it compensates for it in both
shots both phones have optical image
stabilization for still images but the
note uses a combination of optical and
digital stabilization for video each
phone compensates for handshake pretty
well but the note is particularly smooth
but here's where I noticed the biggest
difference in white balance at color
temperature on the iPhone the image is
warmer which is much more pleasing for
outdoor in portrait videos but
landscapes look great on the note the
phones show big differences in low-light
the iPhone produces a cleaner image with
less noise there's also a lot less light
bleeding from that bar sign on the
iPhone image while I was recording it
looks like the note had the better shot
because of that AMOLED screen but
outside the phone the image is not as
vibrant or as clean both the iPhone and
the note have impressive cameras for
video if you like to use footage
straight out of the camera and like a
warmer look you may prefer the iPhone
the note has excellent audio which makes
it better for filming music or voices
and the video image itself is really
sharp</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
