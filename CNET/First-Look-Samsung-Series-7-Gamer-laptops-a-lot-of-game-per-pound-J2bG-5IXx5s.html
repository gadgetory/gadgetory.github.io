dwarfed by the Samsung series seven
gamer laptop now gaming laptops are in
fact alive and well at least in the
minds of laptop manufacturers because
between Ivy Bridge quad core processor
updates and new Nvidia graphics that
have been showing up lately there are a
lot of new specs to pump into laptops
now whether you're ready to spend the up
to two thousand dollars for a giant
hulking chassis to play your PC games
when you can buy a console for $200 or
$300 well that's up to you but these are
better than they've ever been and
Samsung has never made a gaming laptop
before so how does this fare pretty well
for $18.99 you get a fixed configuration
that's a pretty stack there's a 17 inch
screen here that's fantastic it also has
a quad core Ivy Bridge it's third gen
Intel Core i7 processor and NVIDIA
GeForce GTX 675 m graphics which are
really really good plus you've got 16
gigs of RAM if that wasn't enough for
you there's a 1.5 terabyte hard drive at
7200 rpm there's also blu-ray and what
more can you add you know really all
this thing is missing is a second
monitor to pop out the side or a
built-in control pad and unfortunately
this thing's not beating any stereotypes
is it it is a big black bulky laptop
with a kind of throwback keyboard here
tapered keys that look like they came up
with some ThinkPad from four years ago
actually it's really comfortable and the
backlighting even includes a friendly
little orange light for the W a s and D
keys there's even a funky knob on the
side that activates various energy
settings including gamer mode and when
you turn that knob and activate it
thanks to some big flashy lights and
animations you know you're in gamer
and that basically creates an optimized
screen setting for this 70 inch screen
and activates intel turbo boost you know
it makes you feel like you're a gamer I
played a bunch of games on this
arrangement from battlefield 3 to Diablo
3 to Batman Arkham Asylum whatever I
threw at it handled really nicely even
pumped up to high graphics settings in
1920 by 1080 it's really the best Nvidia
gaming graphics right now that are
available out there and in this package
it's not cheap but you are getting a lot
of muscle under the hood what I've liked
this to be a little lighter sure and
would have liked this to be a little
less gaming stereotypical absolutely but
when you factor in what it's got under
the hood and when you factor in this
again I can't say enough about the
screen it is a pretty fantastic screen
with some really nice viewing angles and
super sharp contrast this may be one you
want to consider alongside your alien
wares and your origins I'm shopping for
a gaming laptop
I'm Scott Stein and that's a quick look
at the samsung series 7</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
