normally covers everything related to
alphabet Inc that company owns way mo
loon and others today we're focusing on
Google and what we expect in 2019 let's
go to the garden of Google shall we
let's start with some fun of course
we're expecting Google to continue with
its Google pixel phoneline likely we're
going to see a pixel four and a four
excel in October the pixel 3 was a new
step for Google the phones were built
using Google's designs and made by
Foxconn you might have heard of Foxconn
since it makes iPhones Xbox one consoles
and others the older pixels were made by
HTC and LG in theory since Google had a
lot more control maybe the pixel three
would be the best of the pixels Google's
biggest hooks for the pixel three was
the software call screening seemed
awesome then there's what Google can do
with its AI plus the camera Hardware
nitesite looks incredible Google
assistant keeps getting smarter and
smarter
maybe 2019 if the Year Google tries to
stand out in the design field the
company has messed with color in the
past but as always kept its devices
understated either way I expect Ngoc
Zilla to not be a feature in the newest
pixels the software will probably remain
the star of the pixel show what else can
we expect from Google in 2019 extreme
boredom in 2018 the company was mired in
controversy
there were a number of congressional
hearings involving the company Google
didn't show up to some and there was one
where CEO sundar pichai was questioned
for over three hours there was also the
revelation of dragonfly the sensor
search engine for China oh and then
there was those Google+ bugs that would
lead to the eventual shutdown of the
social network did I forget to mention
the walkouts yeah that was all 2018-2019
expect Google to do a lot to stay out of
the spotlight in those areas the company
may have to make sure its corporate
culture promotes a happy workforce the
projects Google will attempt will likely
stay away from controversy where
possible let's talk about the future of
Android 2019 should see the debut of
Android cue Google has already now
support for foldables in and
but here's where it gets weird when
these larger devices are unfolded they
are essentially Android tablets we
already saw Android on tablets and it
was far from great we've seen a preview
of how multiple apps would be able to
occupy the screen on foldables here's
hoping Google and app developers figure
out the right way to get the most out of
those big screens no one wants to see
The Revenge of honeycomb and lastly a
couple of odds and ends
maybe we'll get a sleigh - that's
Google's Chrome OS based tablet since it
realized Android on tablets wasn't the
best idea except the slate also runs
Android apps the whole thing is kind of
a mess maybe they'll get ironed out with
the two operating systems working closer
together also nest is back under Google
expect even tighter integration between
nest and home products then there's
Twitter Google social network dreams
have failed frequently remember work
Hut's Jai - wave buzz or Plus you might
be faking or what Jai who exactly the
company has given no indication it will
try social again but maybe it's willing
to pick up a ready-made network by
buying Twitter that does it for this
special episode of Alphabet City Amaya's
actor I'll see you online
this is Google okay oh there's a giant
Android over there I didn't notice that
