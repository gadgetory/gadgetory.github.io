and 24 to 100 millimeter f-18 2 to 8
lens as its sibling the g7x the canon g5
x targets basically the same enthusiast
photographers but it's got a somewhat
photo nerdier design that includes a
very nice high resolution built-in LED
electronic viewfinder a hot shoe and a
more useful flip and twist articulated
touch screen instead of the selfie
friendly flip up screen of the g7x
important design differences between the
two include a front adjustment dial
a new lift up flash and yay a good size
built-in grip while the movie record
button looks like one of those flat hard
to press models it's an easy to reach
spot on the thumb grip as with other
cameras that have one I like the control
ring which you can program to operate
for a variety of different mode specific
functions
you can't tilt the flash though and it
doesn't pop up automatically if you're
an auto only photographer photo shot and
good light look very good you can safely
shoot JPEGs up to about ISO 1600 ISO
6400 if you're not real picky or shoot
raw it's got a decent tonal range and
color rendering with slightly better
highlight in shadow detail than
comparable rx100 models the video is
good with few artifacts but it's really
not terribly sharp compared to
competitors that have 4k it does perform
a bit better than the g7x
with solid continuous shooting speed at
about 4.6 frames per second with
autofocus and it has relatively fast
single-shot focus and snapping photos
unlike the g7 X the battery life is
short while its physical features are
nice for the money
it lacks 4k video interval time-lapse
shooting and advanced ways to use its
relatively limited set of effects for
example the G 5x is a fine camera but
unless the flippin twist display and the
above-average viewfinder matter most to
you then it doesn't really stand out
from the pack
