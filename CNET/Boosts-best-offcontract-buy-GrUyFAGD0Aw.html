it and right now we're taking a first
look at the ZTE warp 4g for boostmobile
available now for a very affordable off
contract price of 199 the warp 4g is a
very good deal in fact i think it's the
best mid-range bargain on boost right
now better than the 299 LG optimus f7
and certainly a more shrewd by than the
ridiculously high priced 349 samsung
galaxy s3 let me be clear though the ZTE
warp 4g is not the fastest smartphone on
the block or even in the neighborhood
despite its speedy sci fi name the warp
runs a slow one point two gigahertz
dual-core Snapdragon 400 processor
backed up with just one gigabyte of RAM
respectable flagship handsets these days
pack at least two gigabytes of RAM and
quad core computing power even so the
warp 4g does feature android 4.1 jelly
bean software i know it's not the most
recent version but honestly android 4.3
is hard to find anywhere and at the
moment it's nowhere in boost mobile's
phone line up i also like how ZTE chose
not to mess with android too much by
slathering its own custom skin all over
it outside a few carrier branded apps
and a slightly different lockscreen you
essentially get stock Android plus
access to Google services and digital
storefronts as its name implies the warp
4g also connects to boost LTE network
for fast 4g wireless data so far i can
say that in new york with the warp link
to boost 4g really Sprint's unofficial
LTE signal downloads have been very fast
you will find a big 4.5 inch 720p HD LCD
screen on the warp 4g to sure it could
be brighter sharper and have higher
contrast compared to premium phones with
superior screens still it's a lot of
display for the warp 4 g's price above
the screen is a VGA front-facing camera
and notification light below are three
backlit capacitive buttons for basic
android control the left edge whole
volume up and down keys as well as a
micro USB port on the right is a
dedicated camera button but it does not
wake up the phone from sleep to take
pictures up top is a 3.5 millimeter
stereo headphone jack and power key
around back is the ZTE warp 4 g's main 8
megapixel camera and LED flash the
camera takes pictures quickly provided
you have enough light its camera app has
plenty of features too there are
advanced shooting modes such as burst
panorama and HDR there's also manual
options for just about every setting the
textured back of the warp 4g provides a
good grip as well and resists
fingerprints under the back cover is the
phone's removable battery plus slots for
micro SD and SIM cards I'm Brian Bennett
for seen it and you've just taken a
first look at the ZTE warp 4g for
boostmobile be sure to check out our
