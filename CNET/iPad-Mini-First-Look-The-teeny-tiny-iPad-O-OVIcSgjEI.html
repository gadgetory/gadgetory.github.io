as some of the ultra cheap tablets out
there and it may not be as full-fledged
and powerful as the fourth-generation
iPad but if you want the most portable
iPad that's compatible with a full gamut
of apps
well this one's pretty hard to resist
and it's got a form that's pretty easy
to take with you
I'm Scott Stein and this is the very
cute and pretty addictive iPad Mini when
the iPad Mini was announced the whole
idea was to take the iPad experience and
make it smaller making a selling more
like a Kindle make it something that
competes with the 7-inch tablet market
and lo and behold this is a really small
device and it kind of takes holding one
to know how small it is and how light it
is 0.68 pounds and it's about over half
the weight of the third-generation
fourth-generation iPad and it feels in
the hand a lot like a book or a Kindle
even more so than other 7-inch tablets
out there they notice the design is
different and it's really taking a page
more from the iPod Touch it's a curved
anodized aluminum shell that goes all
the way around the sides and it's flat
on the back and it curved on the edges
and the taper over here is sort of an
aluminum bezel is a lot like the iPhone
5s the iPad Mini comes like the larger
iPad in white or black although in the
black model this is all slate-colored
aluminum and there are a bunch of smart
covers now they're different than the
others these are all fabric material
there's no aluminum connector whatsoever
and they're a little more discreet in
the sense that you can fold them over
with one fewer panels tuck them in but
they work just as well for putting them
up as a stand or folding it down into
virtual keyboard mode in fact this thing
in the stand mode is actually a
fantastic little picture frame it's a
lot cuter than the larger iPad there's a
five megapixel iSight camera on the back
there's an HD FaceTime camera on the
front that's similar to the
fifth-generation iPod Touch and similar
to what's on the new fourth gen iPad
there's no flash on the back but you can
shoot 1080p video and you can take
FaceTime calls in HD and you can run all
the features in iOS 6 that you'd expect
including Siri and the new apps
whether you like it or not is built-in
and all the other features in iOS 6 that
we know about are built-in now Apple has
internals in this that are very similar
to other products that are out there
this is an a5 processor which puts it
relatively in the same territory as the
iPad 2 and the fifth-generation iPod
Touch so what makes this different it's
kind of a tweener device with a 7.9 inch
screen and who would be interested in
this well I'd say anyone who's doing a
lot of reading and like say do you have
a super portable iPad now with the
fourth-generation iPad that came out the
same time all of a sudden this is the
next generation of iPads much faster
than anyone had been expecting myself
included you have a much faster
processor at that top-end level and an
a6 X and this is an a5 so you have a
performance gap and you also have a
Retina display on that end you also a
price difference the fourth-generation
iPad starts at $4.99 for 16 gigabytes
this is 330 for starting with 16
gigabytes and the first thing that comes
to mind when I look at this is probably
kids because of the fact that you can
take this around with you sort of like
the iPod Touch for a lot of people but
it's something that's much more total
much more easily holdable of small hands
and can go on trips even easier and
there's also LTE that's available you
can pay $130 more for that configuration
and LTE in the new iPad Mini and the
fortune iPad has been improved because
now it works internationally much better
that might be very peeling the people
who want to use this as their all-in-one
device now apples making claims that you
know anything that you'd use an iPad for
you can use this for the first thing
that will come to many people's minds is
how are you gonna type on a screen that
small and I found that it actually works
pretty well it's not going to be like a
laptop or even like an iPad with that
virtual screen but the difference with
this is not only can you type on it in
landscape mode but you can really hold
it in your hands and type on it in
portrait mode and really not feel much
of a problem there and games and apps
that I've downloaded ranging from
GarageBand iMovie to virtual board game
apps like ticket to ride or Carcassonne
many of them having little icons all
seem really usable on this screen so
that's a big win and the other big
factor in this magazines digital
publications a lot of times on 7-inch
tab
get shrunken down and here in a four by
three aspect ratio you look at issues of
magazines out there like maybe the New
York or wired or New York Times and they
feel readable in that format now if you
used Retina display and you're an iOS
user you probably are living in retinol
and all the time there is a difference
here this is a thousand 24 by 768 and
even though it looks better and crisper
than on the iPad 2 which had the same
pixel resolution it is not retinal and
and you can notice that it may seem a
little fuzzier
if you've used anything like in any of
the current iPhones the fifth-generation
iPod Touch or the 3rd gen iPad or even
the 4th gen iPad you'll notice the
difference in crispness but if you
haven't used those devices if you're
coming to an iPad for the first time
text is readable you can read everything
even down to small emails perfectly well
and that's not a surprise because you
could read emails on an iPad to
perfectly well and really you're dealing
with that in a slightly shrunken form
here now which iPad do you pick that's
really up to you I think it's really
hard to turn away a form that is this
small but on the other hand the Fortune
iPad is really an improvement on what
already been there in the third
generation and really takes the speed up
to a different level and I think fixes
some of that element in terms of
compatibility with graphics that have
been there before although it may be
very frustrating for people that the
fourth trend iPad is out there this
might be a great second iPad for people
this may be an iPad for people looking
couldn't afford the other one and for
people who do really pick it for reading
and pick it for media consumption but
you're there are a lot of other devices
like this out there certainly you know
we've got the Amazon Kindle Fire you get
the Kindle Fire HD we've got the Nook
plus you've got the Google Nexus 7 and a
lot of these have prices that are really
low as low as $1.99 and this at $330 is
a premium but on the other hand the
screen on this is a lot wider and the
compatibility with the existing number
of apps on the App Store which is really
sizable is a difference maker when will
you see a Retina Display on this who
knows but right now it's a fantastic
form factor and an interesting addition
to the library
maybe not essential to a lot of people
but when you pick it up it's gonna be
hard to put back
I'm Scott Stein and that's a look at the
new iPad Mini available in November 2nd</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
