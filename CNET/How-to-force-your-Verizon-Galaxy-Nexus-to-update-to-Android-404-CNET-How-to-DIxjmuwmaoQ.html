to contributor and if you're like me
you've been checking your Galaxy Nexus
for the latest software update since
last week and you've had no luck getting
it well thanks to a post on Android
Central there might just be a way of
forcing your Galaxy Nexus to update
according to the procedure what you do
is you go into settings then you go to
apps all and then you pick the Google
services framework
let's click that
clear data for stop and then back out
once you're back into the settings menu
go back to about phone system updates
it's gonna show you a random date
because the phone thinks it's never
checked for the update and then hit
check now and it has pulled down the
software update automatically so as you
can see the trick is clearing the system
cache of whether or not it's looked for
the update and on the initial time it
looks for the update or what it thinks
is the initial time it'll find it now
you may not have success the first time
you attempt to update your phone you may
have to clear that and force stop the
Google services framework a few times
its people within the the forum post
claim to work on the first try and some
tried as many as 50 times before it
worked as you can see here this was the
first time I tried it and it worked on
the first try once again this is Jason
Cipriani has seen it how to contribute
and that was how to force your Galaxy
Nexus to pull down Android 4.0 point 4</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
