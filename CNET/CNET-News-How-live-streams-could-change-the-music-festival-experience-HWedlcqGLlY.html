the three day outside lands music
festival in san francisco paying upwards
of five hundred dollars to see acts like
Paul McCartney nine inch nails and the
red hot chili peppers but music fans who
didn't want to fight the crowds pay for
tickets or visit San Francisco could
still rock out from anywhere for free
you basically have the best seat in the
house you can watch as if you were in
front row you would back up to the top
and let's play one more time live video
streaming platform Ustream and
springboard productions provided a live
multistage webcast that could be viewed
online and on mobile devices a similar
webcast of the Bonnaroo Music Festival
racked up 11 million views worldwide
festival organizers plan to do more of
these free concert webcasts as a way to
hook future paying customers people can
wash at home get a taste of the amazing
stuff that's happening out here then
they'll be even more apt to come to this
festival
and with five cameras each at three
stages feeding three video production
trucks festival-goers didn't have to
miss a beat either let's say you're
watching nine inch nails you want to see
somebody on another stage that you know
at the same time but don't want to lose
your seat pull out your mobile phone
your tablet and watch that experience
with the live stream I can be watching
the show on this dais and keeping an eye
on a different stage right on my phone
but the ability to watch live webcasts
on mobile requires a strong cell signal
and that's something that's usually
spotty at big events that's because fans
use their mobile devices at festivals
much more than their regular daily usage
about eighty-five percent more because
they're streaming video they're shooting
pictures a lot of its data and a little
bit of its voice AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon
erected additional cell phone towers
called cows or cell on wheels all
throughout the park they more than
doubled what they provided last year
with a special focus on LTE for data
essentially we added another
superhighway to our network particularly
the the five beam technology each beam
you think of is a highway so you have
five beams what's great about coming to
a live concert is sharing the experience
with people around you outside lambs
organizers hope the live stream will be
the same for a worldwide audience these
people at the event become more
connected to people in the outside world
who are at home you're going to see a
lot of intermixing of conversation and
opportunities you know custom would be
extended beyond just the people that are
at the actual ground
something that should be music to fans
ears I'm Mollywood in San Francisco cnet
