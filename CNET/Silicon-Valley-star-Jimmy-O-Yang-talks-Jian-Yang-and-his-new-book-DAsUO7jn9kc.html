comedian best known for jinyang on
Silicon Valley Jimmy o yang Wow look at
this the whole office is here nice
awesome awesome hello hello how you
doing man good how are you I'm good I
heard you had some mediocre ramen in San
Francisco splurt Brahman not to talk bad
about them but it was like passable at
best like what is what is passable ramen
it's kind of bland and you know when you
eat something so heavy it's like I'm not
eating healthy anyways like it's like
when your cheat meal sucks it's a
horrible feeling well I know I'm not
that I ever go on a diet anyway so you
know think you could maybe I see some
cheat meals here yeah um so okay first
hit Silicon Valley first to think that's
where most of us had come attention to
you with playing jinny yeah yeah the
season 5 premiere done Sunday yes and I
think Vanity Fair had the headline that
you are ready to be the next main
asshole on Silicon Valley that is true
no possible no more supporting asshole
no more supporting that's it just main
asshole yeah I think what TJ leaving I
was like she was sad and kind of you
know worried like where the character is
gonna go but it turned out to be like a
blessing in disguise I think and it kind
of allowed my character to kind of mess
with other people now which is great
well the other thing you guys had like a
really kind of like fun comedy duo like
like Laurel Hardy or like Chris Farley
and like they've Spade but I also wonder
like how that would how that will exist
with you having more time to be more of
an asshole yeah but at the same time are
we going to see more things like like
the seafood app and stuff like that -
we'll see I I think there's some good
interactions and hopefully we'll find
some new dynamics coming up I'm not
promising anything but there's going to
be a lovemaking scene between me and
Gavin Belson we'll see we'll see how
where that takes how long did it take -
a few days we rehearsed beforehand you
guys had a lot of like wide-angle lenses
a lot
yeah so I saw your Twitter feed so on
Sunday's show they had a company called
slice line
yes delivers pizza I saw that you
actually had a pizza delivered by a
drone on select row flew into my not
house but like my apartment and and
deliver a pizza right right to the
doorstep what it was it was pretty good
but sadly since I'm in Hollywood now
I've allergies so I'm actually allergic
to a citric acid and like I'm kind of
lactose intolerant like most Asian
people but like citric acids that make
everything yeah tomatoes yeah can't eat
it I mean I'm not gonna die it's just I
get like a mucus see and gross I see I
rub myself with like citrus axes drizzle
yourself with wine so you know just like
a lotion so if you get a little like
swollen there let me know but so going
back to my juggle of it
so Mike judge Mike judge excuse me um
I'm a little nurse I'll be honest so
might judge okay he created Silicon
Valley beavis and butthead
office space thank you a theocracy which
is very relevant sadly well like so I
know he was at your graduation when you
went to college but then how did you
guys come back around for Silicon Valley
so he was my commencement speaker just
add a dumb luck right and he was talking
about how he was a physics major working
in Silicon Valley back in the 80s and he
how he hated the corporate culture right
so he muttered around as like a
traveling musician and eventually he
found his passion and comedy and
animation and I was just sitting in the
audience probably hungover and listening
to this cuz I was an economics major and
I didn't know what I wanted to do and I
just knew I didn't want to have anything
to do with economics you know I I think
that speech kind of really spoke to me
man it kind of you know gave me I was
like dude I should go try to find what
I'm really into and I tried a bunch
different things I tried like jujitsu
boxing classes like I don't know why but
I did you know and eventually I found
stand-up comedy and I kind of felt that
passion that he was talking about and
then you know just out of luck five
years later our audition for Silicon
Valley he didn't know I was sitting in
the audience you know but I knew who he
was and I got the job in the first day
at table read I came to my hey Mike man
there was
awesome you were my commencement speaker
hey and and my account of you guys ever
hear him speak he's very like kind of
quite as oh oh yeah really yeah that's
cool that's cool and I'm like yeah man
and so you went to UC idea though okay
yeah that's nice
how um how's UCSD now you know did you
like it I was like no I fucking hated it
like I just I just told I kinda I was
sold everything I just fucking hated it
but he was like oh oh yeah yeah that's
good me too I was kind of boring when I
went there and you know I've been
working with him since for five years
he's like one of my best friends on the
show now it's it's pretty awesome
that's amazing I mean what does he think
of like because you've had a lot of
things change over the course of time
we've got no Silicon Valley and your
personal life and professionally I mean
is he a supporter of that or is he just
your well-deserved yeah man I mean he's
always I think so season one I started
literally just like two lines right like
when I open the door like this Pied
Piper and then they wrote me another
episode and like I eat the fish so ended
up like I was in three episodes in the
first season as a guest star basically
and I'd like maybe five five words total
you know and then in between season 1
season 2 like Mike was the first to tell
me he's like you know we're gonna be
excited to have you back but I still
don't know where the show is gonna go
and stuff like that but yeah he was like
the first to reach out and then
eventually you know I became a series
regular on it because out of
circumstance that talk about the book
like I was offered like another job at
Yahoo but in TV world it's like
exclusive you know you can only either
work with Yahoo or HBO and then HBO was
kind enough where they support him
enough to match the offer and you know
the rest is history I guess yeah cuz you
at the time you in the first season you
were living week with two other guys in
like no introduction of who I was I just
kind of showed up in the house people on
reddit was like oh who's that intern guy
or whatever I was never really I was
never really an intern you know I was
just like a dweller in this place and
yeah but I kind of liked that and then
eventually they kind of explained it but
it's still it's still kind of like
mysterious how he ended up there well
let me ask you this like okay but as an
actor playing him with the reaction I
mean like who is this guy like why do
you think there's been such an
attraction from the audience to this
character wanting to see more of him
more of him
whether he's an asshole or more I'm like
being a foil to TJ Miller it's character
i I think TJ it's character really
brought this character out because he
was always bullying and everyone being
obnoxious and this little guy this
foreign weird little guy it's the only
guy that has his number that can throw
him under the bus and you know like be a
pain and ask for him so I think people
wanted to see that it's like a David
versus Goliath like but at the end of
the day like there's you can see it's
like Lauren Hardy there's some kind of
love between the two you know and and
yeah I think me and him just in person
like our sense of humor like very close
to each other so it kind of just worked
it just clicked like immediately do you
guys I mean I'm not looking for a
specific thing but since you guys have
such a chemistry it do you ever think
there might be cancer I can movie or a
series with the two of you after so
maybe I would love to which we talked
about writing together like a Chinese
action comedy or something like that
when that wouldn't that be awesome you
know I've been throwing that around so I
talk to him every now and then and he
called me like the night he was like man
it was a midnight as I got a first
person I called but I'm not coming back
next season on my god dude that's super
sad and I try to talk him out of it but
obviously you know his mind's made of
it's TJ and he was like yeah but you
know what don't be sad dude like this is
maybe the end of you know Erlich in like
jingyang but maybe not the end of you
know TJ and Jimmy so I think there we
could definitely explore more TV shows
films and stuff like that with us too
okay so something I I did not know and I
watched it last night was you in the
movie Patriots Day oh yeah and you guys
seen it nobody's seen it anyone know
okay
first of all you guys can see this movie
I don't know why I had not seen this
week before it isn't actually an
excellent movie but it's about the the
bombings and the Boston Marathon it yeah
thousand thirteen two thousand thirteen
yeah and you play the character of Danny
so these are all based off real people
so again knowing that you're have a
stand-up background and you're in
Silicon Valley
yeah done some other shows like Always
Sunny how do you end up in hey Mark
Wahlberg movie about the bus and about
the Boston bombings yeah it was just it
was just auditioning you know I I think
is one of those roles the guy's a
Chinese immigrant himself so it
literally brought every
Chinese person in Hollywood to audition
for this role and you know I'm pretty
good at being a Chinese immigrant I
guess and I was one so I think I can
relate to it right like I came here when
I was 13 so I understand the mannerism
the accent the thought process and all
that and it was great I was
nerve-wracking for sure at Pete Berg
who's a pretty cool director and then
you got like Mark Wahlberg John Goodman
JK Simmons like Michelle Monaghan like
everybody looked up to in this movie and
Here I am you know across Mark Wahlberg
trying through this scene but everybody
was like really cool and then I think
when a camera starts rolling especially
the way that Pete directs but you just
kind of you're acting you're at this
character now and the real guy Danny who
eventually basically became a hero in
this Boston Marathon bombing thing I get
to talk to him and like be friends with
him like I bugged him every other day in
Boston and it was a tough role to take
on I think especially for somebody come
from a comedy background but it I think
it turned out to be one of the most
rewarding experiences that nobody
watched we're gonna get them to watch it
watch it people it's like 399 on iTunes
it's not though it's not it's not it's
on Showtime it's on Showtime no time
who's got show this guy you use their
password people you know share your
password yeah so we share your password
but there's actually once once you know
I wanted to bring up that was the scene
of the car with a guy's car jacket and
that's I mean I'm not even thinking like
oh this guy's an actor at this point or
the other act
I just totally under the story but how
was it to film that scene so intense
because you're getting your car jacked
and then yeah kind of being held captive
so the real story is Danny got held at
gunpoint and carjacked by the two
terrorists the tsarnaev brothers in the
Boston Marathon bombing and they drove
him out for an hour and a half with
pressure cooker bombs in the back and
the GPS they was trying to go to
Manhattan to Times Square and bomb Times
Square like this is the part of story a
lot of people don't know and then Danny
when they pulled about a gas station he
like ran off at gunpoint and called the
cops at the other gas station and that
led to their eventual shootout and
arrest of those two guys in Watertown so
Danny was like a real hero it was
amazing like I didn't really know about
the story not a research there's like
real footage surveillance footage of him
running across the gas station out of
car it's it's like chilling and like him
making and I want one call inside the
other gas station
so those footage definitely helped me
you know like mold and see the scene and
yeah we play everything really real good
this Pete Berg you know just like
handheld cameras and and and it was uh
it was kind of surreal like I I was I
was like honestly like scared there was
like dudes with guns like in my head
right and and I think like I had a like
some PTSD like some nightmare for a
couple nights so I can only imagine what
like Danny went through but you know
throughout the movie you know Marc and
Pete was like you know this is not about
us as actors it's it's about you know
the victims and the heroes so with that
in mind I think it became like a
slightly more fulfilling and easier
process for us to go through yeah and
now you're talking about auditioning
that you brought basically brought every
like Chinese and we're gonna actor in
that happens a lot and that's a good
segue to the book here which Oh book how
to American an immigrants guide to
disappointing your parents it's a great
great tougher book this book is
hysterical I was laughing my ass off
reading it yeah but you look probably
crazy in like coffee shop wise like I
like laughing at himself
um but then on top of it like the story
behind here like there's also all these
poignant moments so thanks right right
now um but specific good job living your
life yeah I live my life hysterically
yeah at least fruit good ramen right but
specifically your dad and mom are dest
such great characters and your mom
reminds me of my mom but your dad is so
loving but also so critical about
everything I do absolutely um that being
said have they read the book my dad has
read the book he doesn't so he said he's
like oh wow this is actually a really
good book
did you actually write it I'm like yeah
man I wrote it so he's still kind of not
giving it up like all throughout the
book they'll be like he takes his
parents to like very cool like stand up
he's doing in Vegas no you're not funny
you know your dad your dad your dad was
in patriots days I play my dad in
patriots day and that's why he thinks
that's a good movie he's a comedian also
you know any jokes and he's a ballbuster
so he did read the book and you know he
wasn't upset about the parts that
thought he bub said it like you know
that he'd never supported my comedy
career and things like that he was upset
about the fact that he was like how can
you let people know that me and your
mom's always argue at the house and I
and don't you can't let people know that
I credit card debt okay so one of
there's so many things in this book you
cannot wait to talk about okay first
let's the name because ya know yang yeah
I did not realize that it's kind of a
custom that in Hong Kong or China
English surname yeah Jimmy
or English you mean a first name first
name yeah yeah so Jimmy was just a given
name is Hong Kong was like British
colony so you're born with a Chinese
name my Chinese name was man ching which
means 10,000 success it's a name to sure
to set me off a failure so my English
given name was Jimmy right there's not
really an explanation for as my parents
gave it to me because apparently just
sounded good to them but your dad like
my dad's name is Richard and I have like
that why is your name Richards I know
cuz I want to be rich
it's very very simple straightforward
Asian man thinking like my mom's name is
like Amy because like that's her Chinese
name her Chinese nickname is like on me
you know in Shanghai nice and my
brothers they name my brother Roger
after Roger Moore their favorite James
how Asian is that like a James Bond is
so Asian for some reason especially
Roger Moore
that's very specific James Bond I think
he only did one and and my brother hated
that name it's like an old white guy
name so eventually when he turned like a
teeny changed its name to uh Froy which
is very ironic because that's the old
black guy name now in the book you talk
about as a child you beast to play
ping-pong and you were really good at it
was pretty good yeah in fact your first
time on TV was endorsing like a
ping-pong table or something yeah man
like it can't be can't get any more
stereotypically Asian I was a pink Paul
a competitive ping-pong player I mean
come on yeah I play like in those like
you tournaments like under age 13 and
like I was like really small cute little
kid and yeah there was a TV interview in
the local news like they brought it in
like these adjustable height tables that
the ping-pong company was testing out
and I was like one of the testers so I
was like on TV playing it and yeah they
love me and they brought me in studio
interview like the next day and like
everybody than my family and because
Hong Kong's such a small place it's like
you know Manhattan by itself and and
yeah people thought I was like a
superstar celebrity but actually I
wasn't that good in ping pong you know I
just look better than I actually was so
I like when I lost in a school
tournament it was really sad everybody
just thought I was a fraud Kent are you
uh you weren't at all any good now I'm
decent
I actually went over to play my buddy's
house was a ping pong table and I lost
pretty handily so I still look like I
can still toss the ball really high and
like served whatever serves with some
spin but I'm not good at consistently
hitting the ball anymore
a lot of practice you know we can play
after play a program you beat me and
you'll feel better okay but going back
to growing up to now as far as like
where you ended up being a stand-up
that's not necessarily maybe you had an
early idea of that when you were a young
kid right so what does that really come
into your your being that like hey this
is comedy yeah and what I want to do in
when I grow up in Hong Kong I never seen
any stand-up and like even even now
there's maybe one comedy club it's not
really a thing
like historically in an art form in
China Hong Kong and when I first came
here my first stand-up that I watched
was BET's comicview I don't have you
guys to remember that like it's really
awesome I was like watching bTW not just
to learn like the language but to also
like learn um the cadence and also the
culture you know and the one good thing
about stand-up comedy it's not just
jokes it's really people telling us
about culture and like what the
stereotypes and and in a funny way what
America is kind of about so I really
thought that was interesting like I
didn't know that was like why people did
that and black people did that I didn't
know people did different things right
like in Hong Kong it's all just Chinese
people anyways so it was like really
interesting to me to see like all the
different you know stereotypes and
cultures and and beliefs here so that's
I guess how I got into stand-up or I got
you know interested in stand-up but then
also I think like we think of there are
lots of comedians who do go into acting
but it kind of felt like as you were
getting into stand-up prepare more
successful that's when you also started
going after acting jobs right yeah I
think that's a pretty natural
progression yeah in like LA I just
wanted to kind of get like a couple
commercials who's my buddy told me he
was like almost like a security guard
like almost basically an extra and
there's like vodka commercial and he
made like 60 grand off like residuals so
like these commercial games could be
like a lottery ticket you know and
that's all I wanted to do I just want to
do stand-up and then a commercial to
every year so I can sustain you know
living in LA but then you know one thing
led to another like I went through like
really crappy auditions I think one of
my favorite parts in the book is like
the hundred and one auditions that I
logged before I went on to the 102nd
auditions which was Silicon Valley oh
right here you bookmarked it my guy
we've noticed this before we've never we
never have before I know is that a Jack
of Hearts right there that's Wow and
magician we can add that too so yeah I
think a one is I used to be an actor all
right I think it's funny that you kept
track of all your auditions and it's
like all these roles are really like
Taiwanese 20 looks like 12 computer geek
Wow Japanese host Chinese restaurant
owner you know while Mart employees
speaks Mandarin young Asian guy friend
off hey Lee like all these like you know
it's very typical roles and like you
know they all like to line parts and
then eventually I booked a couple of
these the first one my book was that two
Broke Girls thing it was just like
Carson in line it's like two lines and
then eventually we let like I think
always sunny is in here somewhere but
out of like the hundred and one
auditions I booked like maybe like four
things and whatever commercials that I
did book like I think I did like a
Verizon one and even like an Apple one
they never aired so I never got any
money for it you know so that's sixty
thousand dollars is not as easy as it
seemed right and then yeah the hundred
second one was a Silicon Valley
yeah that's so cool to see that on the
list a couple that popped up for me to
where Samsung journalist DJ Samsung a
different Samsung hip casual like what
is hip casual I know I guess it's like a
clothing t-mobile band guy yeah Verizon
proud son proud son I got that job
you gotta get that somebody got okay
isn't that ironic proud son wait you had
another yet Verizon hipster intern oh
yeah uh-huh uh-huh I I did Verizon
commercial years ago I was a like a male
cheerleader that was advice Midwest only
and they should okay here's one that
pops up for me to Apple voice of Siri
yes I addition for the voice of Syria in
like Taiwan Mandarin or something that
job paid like 200 grand or something a
lot but you have to send a boo for like
months and I didn't get it because I
don't think I have a very I don't know
it's like my mandarins not like perfect
you know like I don't think I would have
gotten the English serious job to like
I've you know it's none of my language
is actually like standardly perfect so
then going back to your dad a little bit
you got him into acting a little bit
yeah
but why why did you get your dad who was
always focused on like I could never
tell us he had economist what was his he
was so he was a businessman back in Hong
Kong
and when he got here he became a
financial adviser so that's why he
wanted me to do Finance and econ and
stuff like that so when he saw that I
was finally getting some rolls like you
know it was like oh it's so easy he can
do it I can probably do this so I
thought I would teach him a lesson you
know so I signed him up with my agent
and she started like sending him out on
some auditions and you know like how
hard the audition process is like out of
a hundred I booked like maybe four right
and for him out of his first six he
booked for so completely backfired on me
oh my god this is easy and like my aunt
would call the house from like
shanghaied me like a Richard you're such
a good actor like your son must have
taken after you oh my oh my god this is
not going well for me and but that's
that was like one of my favorite parts
of the book actually was the story about
your Always Sunny audition how your dad
initially was invited for the audition
Brian right and then it was something
about english-speaking as well they were
looking for like an older scientist I
can speak Mandarin and English right and
so we have the same agent now me and my
dad and and they said so she was gonna
send my dad into it but it's like a very
Americanized improvised show so my dad
might not understand that type of humor
you know so my agent kind of made last
when it cause like you think that's
ready for them I kind of lied I'm like
yeah you know he's ready he's my dad
and but I knew he's it's not he wouldn't
get that sense of humor I don't think so
my agent made the call and was like let
Jimmy come in instead and that was like
one of the first more bigger parts that
I got on TVs I took the job for my dad
but the thing that I think the thing
that like struck me was your dad's
reaction that because throughout the
book were reading like oh he's just so
critical of everything you're doing yeah
but in that moment there was like this
little nice moment oh yeah he was kind
of humble he was like you know what yeah
maybe she made the right call I don't
think I would have been very good at
this you know so
maybe it's like I feel like he's like
the American dad that's not trying to
live vicariously through his son do like
high school football you know and yell
and I mean you know and and and you know
cuz he wish he could have play football
it's kind of like that but it's like
cupry comes from a little insecurity
that's why you're so critical so it's
nice to see that moment of vulnerability
you know you know your parents here in
LA or they are here in the States or
they stare and now I live in Monrovia
okay I was wondering like what happily
what happened to your family after
reading this book can you project and I
also wonder like how long is it gonna
take for this book to be like a Netflix
show like I feel like this yeah that's
I'm working on it I'm working on it this
would be life after Silicon Valley I
think or I hope so
we're in the early phases of like
picking the right place to land it in
and then developing it but I'm pretty
excited about it I think it'll be a fun
show like kind of like Atlanta or like
ya know master of none but the Asian
version of that know that I think
naturally it has to be I can't just make
into like a Nigerian version even well
you could but I shouldn't so as someone
who's definitely gone through being a
comic and an actor things that are
mostly very lucrative jobs not really
but you also have to have other jobs
support yourself while you're trying to
get all these oh yeah so what are some
of the more strange jobs or interesting
jobs you've had when I graduated and
that didn't go into econ I had three
jobs in San Diego I was I was a used car
salesman during the day and it was like
the crappiest car lot you can think of
to like we sell cars to people for like
24% interest like it's like their last
resort like we sell to people back
credit so like our slogan was either you
buy our Dodge Neon are you go take a bus
pretty easy sales job you know and then
in the evening I work at the comedy club
at this place called a comedy palace
that's like a Greek restaurant in a day
in a comedy club at night and did that
like work the door collect the tickets
folded envelopes and I would do like a
set if I was lucky if they gave me a
stage time
and then at the end at night I'll put
another shift I'll go to a strip club
and I worked as a strip club DJ yeah and
that's a whole chapter that's a whole
chapter it's me being a strip club DJ
that is a whole chapter and honestly you
just got to read it it's just it's
because that's another one where it's
funny but I think what's interesting is
you're you're in constantly the
situation of trying to feel like you
belong someplace whether it's school
whether it's doing comedy whether it's
on a TV show audition whether it's at a
strip club but then at the same time
you're so genuine at least you come off
very genuine and poignant and sweet in
the book and that also kind of maybe
disappoints you as you're maybe going
through puberty you're trying to lemon
or maybe trying to get a job or
something like that I think everything
like stand-up strip club DJ and all that
stuff or even acting it's like what a
foreign person's view is of America in a
way like this is like a very American
cool thing that you want to do like if
you watch too much like music videos
growing up you think strip club DJ's I
want to coolest jobs ever but it's not
like nobody in there wanted to work
there they all been in a prison multiple
times that's why they're there and I'm
like the only idiot that actually wanted
to work there so I think for the longest
time I tried very hard to be American
because I've always felt like the
foreigner the outsider and eventually
it's DOS lessons that I learned okay
this is not actually a great job work in
a strip club while selling used cars
that kind of landed me into trying
different things you know like stand-up
that that got me who I bow to where I am
now very cool and then also wonder about
the timing of the book coming out now
especially in the like atmosphere in our
country and I'm not asked you'd like to
get overly political but I'm just
curious like how do you think this can
help that conversation that us as
Americans are having about immigration
immigration reform how we treat
immigrants yeah I think I didn't take or
try to argue a certain viewpoint in this
book and I don't really do that in real
life I think immigration itself has
become a problem because it became
politicized
it's either one side things down the
other side it becomes an argument and I
hope that this book of humanized that
experienced a little more when people
see it from a genuine honest point of
view and a kind of light-hearted way
from my story so they can understand
what it's like or see what it's like to
be an immigrant firsthand and have a
more informed opinion of that and maybe
you know it'll humanize it more and and
and make them come up with a more
informed decision on whatever their
viewpoint is instead of trying to you
know jam it down his throat
watching you do this amazing stand it
back I'm like I've never heard of this
comic before but then I read the book
that's like the last Arsenio Hall Show
or something like that you were on it
was one of the last episodes he was
promised a second season and then I got
a call and I did the show on a Friday
and our saying I was like man you did it
man you did it you know and I was super
happy he's like one of my heroes growing
up right and he's like come back anytime
dude would love to have you any time and
he got canceled the next Monday I don't
know what happened it's not you probably
probably okay so I have a thing called
pick one this is like this like a list
full of things I give you three things

of Xbox or Playstation but all my
friends were on the PlayStation so I
ended up getting the PlayStation but I
