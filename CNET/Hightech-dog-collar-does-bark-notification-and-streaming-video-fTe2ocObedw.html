at Mobile World Congress 2015 we're
taking a look at a device that tracks
your pooch it's called the Motorola
Scout 5000 let's take a look so let's
talk a bit about the features you get
with this hefty dog collar first off
it's got bark notification that's the
courtesy of an inbuilt microphone so you
can actually see on an app when your
dog's been barking it makes a recording
as well so you can find out what kind of
bark it was was it a happy bark or a sad
bark you've probably noticed this thing
has a big camera on the front and that
lets you stream video live over Wi-Fi so
you can see what your dog is getting up
to a home another cool thing about this
is that you can pre record messages that
actually play out of the collar to
soothe your dog from afar it also has
activity monitoring so you can find out
exactly how much exercise little Fido is
getting so as well as a scale 5000
there's also the 2500 which is a smaller
collar and it does have fewer features
so basically all it can do is the
activity monitoring and the GPS tracking
now there are SIM cards embedded in
these collars and all of that tracking
technology is provided by a company
called Hubbell when you buy the collars
you get 12 months worth of free service
and then at the end of that first year
from inside the app you can buy an extra
year on top of that Hubbell says that's
going to cost roughly 20 to 30 dollars
so the Scout 5000 is going on sale in
April main it's going to cost one
hundred and ninety nine dollars while
the 2500 is going to cost just ninety
nine dollars and it's going on sale a
bit later in may/june so do you love the
sound of this technology or do you think
it's a little unnecessary let me know
what you think can check out see Netcom
