this is a first take of the new YouTube
Music app so if you're like me you
probably use the YouTube desktop site in
the past to listen to your favorite
songs but one problem is that the
official YouTube app just isn't really
that great for listening to music on the
go but today Google hopes to solve that
problem with a new app just for music
lovers called YouTube music I was
invited to check out a preview of the
app before launch day and it's
definitely a much cleaner experience for
checking out music related content it
organizes all the different versions of
the music you love which even includes
stuff you're probably not even aware
exists into a central hub there's guided
paths for artists discovery and song
curation and it works best with
YouTube's new red subscription service
for $10 a month red takes away all the
ads that run before your videos and it
also adds in app benefits like offline
listening and background play of course
you can use it without signing up for
read but it feels a lot slower if you
have to wait for commercials to load up
so the app starts with a search bar and
all the results you'll see our music
related so you don't have to worry about
other videos popping up if you type in
something like Usher the app actually
works in the background to make a custom
radio station out of every song you
listen to and that consists of music
from related artists not to mention
different versions of those tracks
there's even a slider available inside
the app settings to control how much
variety you'll hear for any given
station if you've used YouTube on a
traditional browser you'll have no
problem using the app you'll recognize
things like the thumbs-up and
thumbs-down icons that you can click to
tell the algorithm how you feel about a
certain song the app takes that into
consideration and will either serve you
more or less of that kind of song in the
future another awesome feature is the
ability to toggle this red audio only
button that shows up at the top of every
video if you hit that the app will pause
the video while continuing to play the
audio and if you're a red subscriber you
can even turn off your phone and
continue listening YouTube Music app is
all about discovery which also happens
to be a great way to keep bringing users
back to the app there's a separate
section called YouTube music today that
organizes music into playlists according
to genre popularity internationally
trending songs and albums and more and
there's also good news for commuters
that travel in network
deadzones if you subscribe to red the
app will show an offline mixtape section
that automatically saves discovery items
based on your taste profile if you
already have a Google Play account
you'll be automatically grandfathered
into the benefits of red and will never
see an ad play before a video as long as
you continue paying ten bucks a month
but for everyone else you'll get a free
two week trial of YouTube red when you
download the YouTube Music app after two
weeks is up customers can get an
additional month of free access when
they sign up using a credit card</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
