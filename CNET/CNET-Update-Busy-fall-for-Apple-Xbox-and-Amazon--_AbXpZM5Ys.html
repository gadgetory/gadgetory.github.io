home theater I'm Bridget Carey and this
is your cnet update when you cover tech
news like I do there's one question that
everyone gets really worked up about and
that's when the next Apple iPhone iPad
iPod coming will take a breather folks
because Apple CEO Tim Cook has just
announced that new Apple products are
coming in the fall so enjoy the spring
weather go on a summer vacation the fun
stuff is coming in the fall and that
could even mean something like an iWatch
or a new take on Apple TV cook said that
Apple is looking to grow into new
product categories but that's all he
would say in the meantime Samsung's big
iphone rival is about to hit us stores
the galaxy s4 review is live on cnet
this is a top-of-the-line phone packed
to the brim with features there are so
many features that you probably won't
even use them all like how about using
your phone as a TV remote or pausing a
video by looking away from the screen
basically there are many things you can
do to show off to your friends the phone
is scheduled to arrive at eighteen t
stores and at radio shack on Saturday
now sprint will take more online orders
on Saturday and t-mobile is going to
take online orders on monday and verizon
will fill cat the phone sometime in May
and if you go to bestbuy you'll start to
see these Samsung mini shops by June
about 1400 best buy stores will have
these little hubs called the samsung
experience shop stuff by Samsung
employees some best buys also have these
apple mini stores but these samsung ones
will have a larger presence the worst
kept secret at Microsoft is finally
confirmed a new Xbox is coming and it
will be revealed at a press event on May
21st so mark your calendars to follow
seen it for the unveiling of the new
game system and as we look into the
future this could be an interesting year
for amazon bloomberg reported that
amazon plans to release a television
set-top box this fall and it will stream
video this is a bit strange since you
can already get Amazon content on other
devices it's as if Netflix made its own
streaming box but we'll keep you posted
as more details emerge twitter is said
to be working on a way to make its login
system
more secure from hackers by using a
two-step authentication process it's
kind of like how facebook or gmail will
send a code to your smartphone to
double-check your identity this news
comes from wired after a group hacked
the Twitter accounts for the Associated
Press and CBS by sending out password
phishing emails you see employees were
fooled into clicking a link in an email
that said it was from a co-worker and
from there the hackers were able to
steal Twitter logins that your tech news
update you'll find more details on these
stories as cnet com / update from our
studios in New York I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
