say it but I refuse to say it because
come on is a little played out oh no my
phone just fell what's up everybody
welcome to the show it's Apple white
extra crunchy we like to go extra munch

of complements our video podcast our

conversation it's also a live stream for
those who are listening after the fact
so you know we kind of have the audience
participate that can sometimes chime in
and help us with the show as well but
again episode 83 this show is all about
you all so we want you to call us we got
how many calls do we get this week a lot
we always get a lot okay like 17 and we
Whittle it down to like four was it one
guy called like 10 times though there
was one dude that was being a total D a
big so call us at 1-866-376-8255
cook had some fun things to say and he
went asked like ah there's kinda like a
slowdown in China with iPhone sales
what's going on Tim Cook responded with
saying that Apple was seen a pause in
purchase of the iPhone and he attributed
it to earlier and much more frequent
frequent reports about future iPhones I
don't know a show that does that Beach
do you people hear everyone's what every
Apple fan is watching this show right
now and saying I'm gonna wait I'm gonna
wait
so separately they're waiting no I think
typically there's like a stupid iPhone
rumor like a week after the actual phone
comes out oh yeah yeah the seven came
out and like literally within a month
there was some rumor about the iPhone
eight we're like what and it's so
embarrassing guess what we're talking
about it so he's just basically saying
look all this hype all these news and
rumors sites I for the record the Apple
byte has been around for I don't know
how long I think we're out we're up to
the actual video show is around four
hundred and thirty some episodes already
dude are you that are you at ten years
or when did you start here like 2011 I
don't wanna I don't wanna I don't know
but if you sit in close because if 52
weeks in a year right yeah so we're
almost at nine years for that show oh
that's awesome man nine years of rumors
that's pot have people pause their
purchasing decisions so anyways that was
one of the kind of nuggets Tim comes
like come on come on like dude you guys
are killing us but also Tim Cook said
that demand now they kind of broke down
the iPhone sales we'll talk about the
numbers in a second
but another thing that Tim Cook wanted
to address in relationship the iPhone
was that demand was stronger towards the
iPhone 7 plus then Apple expected most
analysts kind of pointed it out because
they were more backordered right this is
the phone that has the portrait mode
slash bouquet super stylish DSLR effect
and I'm telling you as long as they put
that effect in the iPhone 8 or the
iPhone X
or the iPhone future because that's what
we call it here I know I've been
religiously against a big screen phone
that doesn't fit in my pants but damn
and it's not because I were children
size pants just you know but the thing
like beach like have you seen that
portrait effect it is so good it works
like 90 percent of the time
yeah the cameras are awesome and the
video camera is awesome too and Vanessa
hand or Rihanna did a really cool video
you know showcasing the camera that like
really shows off the iPhone the iPhone 7
plus is camera abilities I recommend
checking that out but um but yeah I mean
everyone wants a really great camera and
if you can get into the phone then why
not yeah one of a one of the people in
the periscope
their names kind of disappeared because
it moves so fast the same or more people
are keeping their current iPhone because
of the minimal improvements and I would
agree to a certain extent but I think
everyone is just waiting for a phone
more more often than not they're waiting
for a new form factor that's even if it
did one more thing when the iPhone 7
came out it was basically the same as
the 6s design people were like ah I'm
good I'll wait you have a lot of people
to have an iPhone 6 that are on a
two-year upgrade cycle if it was hot
enough they would have upgraded but they
didn't so this iPhone 8 is is the one
this is their 10th anniversary phone
we've heard so much about it people keep
on asking us like Oh what will it be
like we know about the design it's gonna
really try and be a fool just single
piece of glass curved on the edges very
similar to the Samsung Galaxy s8 which
is beautiful all these kind of diagrams
and kind of early schematics are showing
the camera now resting like still on the
side on the back but vertically there'll
be a flash on the bottom and then
there's rumors of whether there'll be
the touch ID on the back of the panel or
not but you know speed design I think
the biggest thing that might feel like
it's holding it back and I really hope
we see some major improvements and I'm
kind of glad that Apple is very
hush-hush we haven't seen any leases
will iOS 11 be that much different you
know like what what what can they do to
me
that compelling as well in addition to a
whole new form factor yeah how could
they make it how can they improve it
make it different I mean we're all used
to what it looks like we've had it all
for so many years now like I don't know
what they would do like I can't like
really conceive it but um there
definitely needs to be some sort of
change and I know when that change comes
everyone's going to freak out because
change freaks people out what happens I
also think you know in addition to just
changing it or not you've got to you
know do just just bring new features
that actually stand out because I was
always a fan I didn't actually there's
some years where I don't really care
about the iPhone Hardware more than I
cared about the actual operating system
right yeah yeah sure so so that's so
those are going to be key now let's
let's kind of go back a little bit and
get into get into some of this
nitty-gritty of how Apple's earnings
performed and as some of these numbers
there'll be a lot of numbers that I
throw out to you but we'll kind of break
it down of what's important so for the
quarter Apple compares their earnings
from a year ago for those people who are
like well what does this mean so for the
this is the second fiscal quarter of
2017 which really represents the first
calendar year quarter of 2017 but when
you're talking fiscally it's the second
one so for the quarter Apple posted a
revenue of 52 point nine billion dollars
a net quarterly profit of eleven billion
dollars now that was the overall revenue
what's higher as well as the overall
profit was higher so that's good
slightly so Apple is actually
outperformed from a revenue standpoint
from money making compared to last year
at the same quarter now here's where
things kind of get a little different
the iPhone specifically Apple sold 50
point eight million iPhones during the
quarter that's down from 51 point 1
million a year earlier but then the
other on the flip side of this Apple's
actual profit iPhone profits were higher
they generated more revenue for iPhones
and what was really behind that is that
the overall average selling price across
all models of the iPhone went up from
640
two dollars a year ago - six hundred and
fifty five dollars so what is that
offensive yes
the phone is bumped up in price and what
can that be directly attributed to that
is really more directly attributed to
the fact that the iPhone 7 plus which
had such high demand is also the most
expensive phone it's well more than six
hundred fifty five dollars you can even
if you really maxed out it to a 256 gigs
of storage the iPhone 7 plus would be
nine hundred and sixty nine US dollars
damn so when they talk about a 1,000
dollar phone Apple's not afraid of a
1,000 dollar phone coming up and I don't
have Lena and everything I've heard from
users they're not afraid of the 1,000
dollar phone either they're like
whatever I'll put it on a 16 month plan
or however it breaks down month by month
payments they don't care so my there
goes your thousand dollar phone I'm just
kidding that's that's crazy I mean Apple
loyalists are loyal and they're gonna
pay top dollar for the best phone that
they can get so yeah not in that kind of
wild that is wild yeah so you have so
you have this decline in Apple unit sold
but an increase in revenue from that
category now if we talk about some of
the other results from the quarterly
earnings Mac unit sales rose slightly
from four going to 4.2 million units
sold this quarter compared to 4.0 three
million a year ago and then the iPads my
iPads dog continued to decline they
dropped to eight point nine two million
units compared to ten point two five a
year ago that's a lot data so that's
like another another 10% drop roughly
but what does that mean this would mark
this would mark the thirteenth quarter
in a row where iPad sales have declined
meaning iPad sales have declined for
over three straight years
hmm that's that's interesting I wonder
what how could they what could they do
to to fix that to get to get it going
back up again like I don't understand
what they could do really because I feel
like everyone already has
I pad you know well that's the one thing
they'll do the one thing that they they
won't do the one thing that they should
do they should change the OS so it's a
more multifunctional device right that
would make it compelling but it's like
we're still getting iOS that just
happens to be able to use a pencil with
with drawing apps I know there's there's
people that use that pencil I don't I
don't see it in the wild quite honestly
we talked about an amazing artist Rob's
illah
a few weeks ago who uses the iPad for
some killer NBA art and he's any doesn't
professionally but I don't even see
people using it casually we talked about
like this Marvel app yesterday where you
can you know do adult coloring books
which is just means grown-ups coloring
not naughty cut naughty naughty coloring
books but they if they're just if
they're just sitting on their butts and
say oh we're gonna put a true tone
display on the 12.9 inch we have a new
form factor but it's still basically
running the same OS that that's still
not compelling yeah I mean I've said
this a hundred times on this show but my
three my third generation is still fine
I don't have any reason to upgrade it
still runs down so you're one of those
well and they did they make them too
good so um overall earnings I mean
apples in a great position again they're
still sitting on over 250 billion
dollars in cash though you know you
would you think maybe they'd do
something about that uh one recently I
think was just yesterday actually Tim
Cook was was interviewed on MSNBC he did
the sit-down with the Jim Cramer right
the Moneyball guy Mad Money sorry what I
say Moneyball I meant Mad Money you know
what I'm talking about I mean I don't
she's loading behind the scenes to get
stock prices to rise up and down that
guy Oh him yeah yeah yeah one yeah that
night so during his interview on CNBC's
Mad Money I'm like all mixed up my
signals are all mixed up Tim Cook
announced a new one billion dollar fund
to invest in united states manufacturing
jobs now Tim Cook announced that this he
announced this during the show he teased
that we're gonna hear more about it
later this month it's it will be kind of
in partnership with the company but the
whole premise is that they want
promote advanced manufacturing jobs in
the United States they've already chosen
the company which they will invest in to
do this they won't announce it until
later date this month according to cook
but cook said by investing 1 billion
dollars in this advanced manufacturing
apple can create a ripple in the pond
and promote job creation advanced
manufacturing jobs are in high demand in
the US so Apple hopes to be a part of
that
that'll make apple honestly look really
good too you know just through a medical
tree yeah creating jobs so America have
they have they said exactly what they
will be manufacturing or is it just I
mean it doesn't even necessarily it
couldn't be an iPhone it could be
something else you know it could be it
could be parts or components for even a
different um you know something that may
not be let's say based on costs right
this is all going to be dictated by
costs we know that they at least
assemble the imax in the US right so and
and Mac Pro's I believe like they say
like not only designed in California
they say like made in California for a
few of their products so it it'll be
interesting to see what pieces of the
puzzle are actually going to be like a
manufactured here yeah you know what
look how happy Tim Cook looks to spend a
billion dollars he's like yeah we're
gonna spend a million dollars yeah and
that's what just one billion off the 250
there sitting on right yeah they have
more money than I think more money than
is generated by several fortune 500
companies that they're just that there's
just like in a bank overseas just
hanging out there and when if they're
going to implement the renewable
initiative that they have in this
factory where you know they're going to
be taking apart iPhones and using those
parts to build new iPhones and new
products and stuff eventually they're
going for a completely you know no waste
all renewable a production scheme you
know production plan I'm wondering it
yeah this is going to be part of that
because that would be amazing
yeah it would be amazing I mean they've
tried to really be a super green company
as well with solar power that you know
pumped into I think someone's even used
basically for
our stores right they have like a solar
farm so there they're doing good things
in that space and they like to promote I
think on their YouTube page they have
like a bunch of you know how they're
being environmentally conscious so I am
I'm a hundred percent all for that um so
we have imagined their profit margins
once that is a hundred percent renewable
imagine their profit margins will be 100
percent basically right even even
there's a even a policy where they want
to melt like a lot of the parts and
components of returned products from
Apple they don't want them to be kind of
like reused and resold on the market
they want to smelt them down
yeah just melt them so use them exactly
so you know they can do that as well um
I thought this was kind of funny in
addition to talking about a billion
dollars being invested for American jobs
specifically for advanced manufacturing
Tim Cook also talked about the Apple
watch and in the interview he said that
the Apple watch helped him lose thirty
pounds
oh wow but here's the thing okay I'll
let me let me let me like kind of turn
around is not that's a lot of that's a
lot that's okay that's pretty good but
I'm looking at every keynote that Tim
Cook has been he hasn't lost thirty
pounds from the first keynote like I'm
sorry unless you unless like he got junk
in the trunk that we don't know about
like he looks pretty similar in fact
there was like a Kino like I even
remembered you some of our staff at C
net you know notice that they thought he
had like a little tummy like they
actually were like oh it looks like he's
been putting on some weight or something
and I'm like okay but now it makes me
laugh because he he talks about this in
the interview he said he's lost thirty
pounds
partly to my watch so let's ignore the
diet change and maybe the professional
trainer that he had to go to every day
let's let's pretend that didn't happen
right yeah but you know he was time out
the fitness highlights and the features
of the Apple watch and how it helped him
and how he's getting he also said and
this is a quote from him this makes a
difference over time I'm getting calls
and letters from so many people where
the watch has made a difference in their
life
and this is why we are in business I'm
just saying um 30 pounds I don't I
haven't I don't see that you would
notice if you wouldn't you have don't
you think you would have said to
yourself when you saw Aquino like wow
Tim Cook looks like he's lost a lot of
weight yeah definitely definitely you
would definitely notice but they'd in
their defense they do where the Apple
uniform which is all black and that kind
of hides things you know when they're on
stage so maybe he had some junk in the
trunk and it's gone now but it's hard to
say it would be a great video though if
we did that if we like did a comparison
video of his life his weight loss or
something I mean maybe he like lost five
and then put five back on and then like
lost two and put three limy maybe say
like over time I don't know I'm 30 30
pounds of significant man you would
generally see it maybe that is like
never drop little maybe he was like um
like all muscular underneath and then he
lost all the muscle I don't know this is
again again I I don't I have a hard time
believing that but I'm gonna believe it
because it's a direct quote now during
this also on the earnings when we talk
about specifically the Apple watch they
say that Apple watch sales nearly
doubled on a year-over-year basis Apple
is yet to actually again officially give
us the sales data for the Apple watch
but it does say it's wearables business
which they bundle this together
the Apple watch air pods and Beats
headphones um you combine those three
groups was the size of a fortune 500
company damn just those three products
that's crazy yeah and if you look at a
even kind of took a peek if you look at
um kind of some of the fortune 500
companies on the lower end like let's
say around $4.99 or you know 500 501 or
so they're generating about 55 point 1
billion dollars so um you know that's
it's impressive those 3 product
categories alone that's kind of crazy
when you think about it but shows the
power of the Apple marketing machine
right yeah definitely that's very
impressive
a lot you know they bundled in the air
pods in that which again for the record
I know I pooped on them because of how
they look before I even try them I still
poop on them of how they look when I try
them but I think they're really
really really good um they're really
good ear but just the way that you use
them I just it's just really weird every
time I see someone with them on the
street which I'm starting to see a
little more here there it just looks bad
yeah like heavy it just still looks bad
I have seen it is definitely six out
you're like oh that guy's got some on
but um maybe that's part of it right
maybe it's just kind of like a you know
like a I guess not a shock factor but
just like you notice you know you you
know it's like when the iPhone first
came out and everyone had the white
earbuds like yeah yeah you saw someone
walking down the street with white you
immediately knew like oh that that
person has an iPhone you immediately
knew it is like kind of an iconic thing
and now the air pods are kind of doing
the same thing so you know it's
interesting yeah it's true I mean look
Diego Diego says super ugly and dorky
and he might be right Diego Diego you
might be right
double Diego says it man it's gotta be
trouble double D so Apple's air pods
check this out this is a survey
conducted by Experian and creative
strategies they've done kind of customer
customer satisfaction surveys when new
products from Apple launched Apple
launches creative strategies say the air
pods set the record for the highest
level of customer satisfaction for a new
product from Apple ever okay way so this
is not this is another company doing
this because I remember Apple said the I
haven't had a hundred percent customer
satisfaction do you remember that Brian
yes I do hundred percent
what's it wait what's it or was it was
they said Apple watched it I think
there's something ridiculous yeah I
forget was the Apple either the Apple
watch er the iPhone 6 or something like
that but it's kind of like a reach or
like come on man yeah and you read made
a cool video are you when to asked 100
people oh sure yeah if you know what it
was it was a hundred people love their
iPhone but it was I think we had
something like high 80s yeah yeah it was
like something like it 80 out of 100
people so yeah I love my iPhone it's
like fine
so 98% is that satisfies doable yeah
that seems pause that slowly and I like
I said I think the air pods are really
really good product
I think Gentoo is gonna be amazing if
they do what I told them with some of my
suggestions about putting you know
multi-touch controls on it and blah blah
blah I don't have to go through that all
over again but anyways um the so here's
the survey itself ninety was it where's
the worst the breakdowns is okay here we
go so in the breakdown they pulled 942
owners of air pods 82% said they were
very satisfied while 16% said they were
just satisfied for an overall customer
satisfaction score of 98 percent wow
that's pretty good man I'm looking at
the breakdown here this the different
satisfaction
you know portions of that so time it
takes to charge the iPods was the
highest so people are stoked that it's
that you can charge them really fast
design was at 97% bluetooth pairing
process see bluetooth pairing process
should be 100% that is that's awesome
battery life is 95% comfort comfort it
come on 95%
I think everyone's already used to him
because we've already had the air pod so
secure fit in ears I don't know about
this 93 percent
I have yet to test that but we will see
I'll use my nap des has all that your
wax in it man I'll let you try it out
cool
so anyways we got that I I did want to
follow up with an email of the week this
comes to this they emailed us directly
at the Apple buy to cnet.com but this
here's it here it goes from Curt ear
neon hey Brian today I witnessed the
baddest of bad apples in a mall two
friends sharing one instead of air pods
shopping around with one ear bud each
stop almost as bad as an iPad and a
camera that's great so that that's going
to be like the future like you know kids
who are in love like the the boy the boy
who has a crush on the girl gives her
one of his air pods and then they're
sharing the music together that's going
to be the future of relationships I feel
is that what they're calling it these
days I just when you were talking about
that I just started thinking about that
like that that could be a cute thing
that kids do at school now oh you wanna
make them make the next vomit-inducing
yeah I'll just look it up the past when
we see that commercial brand we're gonna
have to sue Apple and say hey we had
that idea you crazy just just play it
with like Louis Armstrong's like what a
wonderful world like that teens gazing
at each other butterflies in the air
like Solar lens raffle you know lens
reflections and all that crap so uh
that's beautiful

okay go ahead we're done all right so
this is this is probably my favorite
story of the week kind of the goofy
story the weak merriam-webster uses
Apple fans to define a new word that was
added to their dictionary that word my
friends is a sheeple beautiful that's
horrible
sheeple is now in the dictionary so um
Beechum if you go to the link people can
also see this definition here is the
definition according to merriam-webster
it's people who are docile compliant or
easily influenced people likened to
sheep now they also use sentences as
examples but oh my gosh they just they
updated the site did they bro I'm trying
to open it I eat it the site
not opening for me so maybe they're
updating it right now no no I'm telling
you right now they but I could lucky for
me I actually saved what they actually
said in the site okay all right so this
they used some kind of like sentences to
use as context and this is what they
used as one of them apples debuted a
battery case for the juice sucking
iPhone an ungainly lumpy case the
sheeple will happily shell out $99 for
Wow
they used that was in there below that
other sentence or maybe they maybe they
change him over time but that was
officially in there for at least the
past a week that's funny man they're
going in you know merriam-webster
dictionary has been trolling pretty big
time on Twitter
seriously couple years yeah they're
trolling like you know many times some
government official says something weird
they'll like put the actual definition
of the word out you know so maybe
they're still trolling they're trolling
Apple fans now it's funny okay well it
clearly got through to us I mean it's in
our show so they did their thing they
did their job it a good job great job
merriam-webster alright great job Miriam
alright should we get to the calls let's
do the calls okay we got a bunch of good
calls from you guys this week thank you
very much and here's the first one
oh wait let me stop the music here we go
hey guys this is Brent in Bethlehem PA
love the show um wanted to talk a little
bit about iOS 11 coming out I feel like
we've had the same kind of design for
eight years
I'm now seeing my boy Johnny
merriam-webster website really start up
our phone call yeah they're autoplay
everybody it's a thing hey guys uh Brent
in Bethel on PA love the show um wanted
to talk a little bit about iOS 11 coming
out I feel like we've had the same kind
of design for a very long time
part of me loves the way it's been
forever and another part of me kind of
wants a whole redesign just want to know
what your thoughts are on that
love the show right iOS 11 you know I
think look I think sometimes there's
maybe a little bit of desire to want
something new but the fact is that most
people like I like when people say I
want something new I like to hear
suggestions right because I think that
means you're more proactive out you're
trying to say like you know what I don't
like this but here's an idea instead of
just saying give me something new so I
don't I don't know if they have to
really do much like I said earlier with
iOS I think it's more about adding more
features that we actually care about and
can use maybe surprising us with a
couple features and then really to me
the best place iOS can grow is on the
iPad platform to really make it
different
we'll see what type of features are
gonna be added specifically to this 10th
anniversary iPhone but they don't have
to like completely you know revamp it or
overhaul it I really don't think they
need to I think what the latest look and
feel of iOS has been out for a year and
a half or two maybe I could be wrong I
mean it all goes by in a blur now so I'm
not I'm not too worried about them
having to change it they kind of went
for the the flat look but it's flattish
with gradients and kind of different
tones I do in a weird way although it
may not feel as warm
I do like pure Google Android's like
really clean flatness but it just
wouldn't match on an Apple device so you
know we want the rounded corners you're
gonna get the rounded corners you want
the rounded like corner app tiles you're
gonna get that type of stuff I think
it's fine it's they don't really need to
do too much for it for me
I'm just give me more features yeah yeah
I'm a big fan of drop shadows maybe some
drop shadows I'm just kidding well a
little drop a drop okay next call Brian
my name is Adam love your show wanted to
see if you could do some kind of review
if you haven't already on the Apple TV
for don't like that when I'm watching TV
on the couch and watching your videos or
some of the others on the Apple TV
version for I cannot a like or subscribe
to anything I have to use my iPad or
iPhone to do so and I don't always so if
you could ask Apple to an aversion 5
allow us to do that again as we used to
with version 3 thanks a bunch love your
show thanks man oh I said you know if
he's if he's doing what I think I'm
doing and watching us through YouTube it
must through the Apple TV that sounds
more like a youtube app issue more than
anything else but if I'm mistaken I'm
still happy that he just wants to watch
our videos to like them and subscribe to
him yeah please do yeah you know YouTube
is very when they do redesigns they kind
of go break a lot of stuff you know
about that more than anyone else yeah I
help manage the scene at YouTube channel
and it's a nightmare because they change
stuff and then it breaks a lot of stuff
in the background and a lot of times
when they do an update it'll break
things like that that go other places
like Apple TV and Roku whatever and also
YouTube like if someone shares a video
on YouTube there still isn't a button
that says watching the YouTube app like
every other app that we have like they
just don't they don't care you know what
I mean so you know I'm sorry that you're
having that issue but you're probably
just gonna have to wait till someone at
YouTube figures that out and then fixes
it I feel it's weird because the way
that YouTube approaches it
is they know they have this massive
audience but I feel like they act like
they're always in beta like the way that
they handle features rolling out let's
try this oh wait we're actually not
going to do this what we told you we're
gonna do whatever you know like playlist
channels blah blah blah like it
constantly changes and their algorithm
changes as well and now for people that
don't know I mean they've talked a lot
about how the way that advertisers and
how YouTube content creators are getting
paid is also changed as well so it it's
constantly in flux D monetization is a
big issue right now for everybody on
YouTube who does gaming like if you have
a video game if you put a video game a
video up on YouTube where someone's like
cutting someone's head off or shooting
someone they're going to demonetized
that video now like seeing that actually
had a video demonetized because we did a
video about the iPad bomb plot that
happened recently you know how there was
like the people taking it on flights
yeah yeah they barred people from taking
iPads on flights because they were
afraid that you could put a bomb in it
well YouTube D monetize that video
because they felt that it was met that
you know as part of that group of things
that was promoting violence or not not
promoting violence but just was talking
about violent you know or bombs on
airplanes they do monetize that and you
know they're kind of doing that with a
lot of stuff so yeah I mean they're
constantly changing and it's hard to
keep up even they're going to change the
whole look of YouTube right now like
everything's going to change in the next
couple weeks so just going to give
everyone a warning about that okay but
yeah so that's that's that's my take on
that
okay next call hey what's up this is
Andrew in DC I'm currently using a 2011
MacBook Pro and really excited that
Apple's making all those productivity
apps like pages and pages and number
three but Apple is making it so you have
to upgrade to your latest software you
all think I should upgrade or do you
think the newest Mac oh Sierra would
crash my computer let me know if you'll
think and love the podcast guys thanks
Steve
thanks Brian thanks for callin man so we
did it you know we did still a little
homework it's just to see because I know
it's not going to crash a computer um
but you can actually go to Apple's
website or even just type in like Mac Oh
Sierra hardware requirements there's
this crazy tool I found on the internet
called Google help me help me do that so
I'm just messing with you so the the Mac
hardware requirements hardware
requirements um it does support your
MacBook Pro any MacBook Pro that's a mid
2010 or newer can run Mac OS Sierra but
there's also some people write how Mac
OS Sierra or Mac OCR see we we all start
talking like they even talked to like
Mac o Sierra Michaels Michaels Michaels
it some people complain maybe it might
it might be a little laggy not buggy per
se but just might be a little slower not
as snappy but again I'm not in your
exact situation I don't think there's a
problem where it's not compatible it's
gonna completely destroy your machine
and you know quite honestly with the
apps that you're trying to run if you're
running pages or keynote keynote is
honestly more intensive than pages but
they're not the most you know graphics
intensive apps you know are you're not
talking about Photoshop or dear Lord if
you use Final Cut Pro or anything like
that so I think that you'd be alright
honestly but again I can't 100% say
because I don't have it you know I think
my parents have a 2011 one actually
quite honestly yeah I would be careful
though because I should say that um
third-party apps might not work in the
new version like I updated my work
computer to MCOs Sierra recently and
then like this facility for that we that
we all use to like share files stopped
working and I had to we had to go do a
bunch of work to get it to work so there
might be some third-party stuff that
doesn't work for you after that but
overall it's pretty cool but it will
like default to put all this stuff and
you're in the dock below so then you
have to like go and remove a bunch of
crap which is annoying but that's my
only gripe really the other thing is
also the size of the actual operating
system has been compressed down and
optimized so much over time so it's
actually gonna open up it's gonna free
up storage space on your hard drive
which i think is always a good thing oh
yeah
that's always been kind of one of the
pluses of upgrading your operating
system so yeah there you go it takes
like 30 minutes or so it's kind of a
more longer depending on the speed of
your machine yeah yeah but uh you know
whatever cool I think that's it BT is
that is that it
I think we've handled everything we
needed to handle all right we're gonna
roll out so thanks again to jam comm
again that's Jam comm slash crunchy to
set up your three devices if you're a
company that's growing to keep track
your computer and phone we're gonna be
out of here we will be back next week
