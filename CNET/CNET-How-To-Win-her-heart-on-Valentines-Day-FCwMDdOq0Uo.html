chocolates and flowers it's a time when
boys have the opportunity to become men
and ladies reap the benefits of that and
if you think Valentine's Day is
important multiply that thought by a
thousand and that's how much it matters
to your girl well Don is a guy who gets
this and he has a very special day plan
for his Valentine Amy she's coming over
later and he wants to give her a day
he'll never forget before he even gets
out of bed
Don let's Amy know he's thinking about
her with couple an Android and iOS app
that gives him and his girl a super
private messaging experience take
advantage of it by giving her a virtual
kiss called a thumb kiss and send her a
message that tells her she's special
if Cupid's arrow hits its mark your
Valentine will return the favor
Don smart so he plans ahead for dinner
and maybe you're not the best cook but
you will try because this special dinner
will set the tone for the rest of the
night since Don knows how much Amy likes
Pinterest
he starts by creeping on her page to see
if she saved any recipes Pinterest is
where your girl probably spends a good
chunk of her day and if so I'll bet she
has a recipe board but if those look a
little out of your league
follow Don's lead and use the all
recipes app to find the perfect dish
using the dinner spinner you can narrow
it down by course ingredient time spent
and the spinner will come up with all
kinds of suggestions you're bound to
find something that fits her tastes and
your skill level once we pick a recipe
you can add the ingredients to your
shopping list please make a list so you
don't forget anything while you're at
the store and while you're there don't
forget to pick up a little something
extra get everything prepped early and
before you start cooking read that
recipe five times to ensure you do it
right all right Amy is due any minute so
it's time to make sure the table is set
the candles are lit and you are dressed
to impress
before he opens the door Don takes a
moment to silence his phone your
Valentine needs your full attention to
know that only she matters and since you
went through all of this trouble to cook
an amazing meal you don't need any
distractions after you finish your
romantic dinner it's time to surprise
her with a gift a bedazzled USB Drive so
cleverly placed on a silver chain we'll
have her beaming fill it with photos of
you two together and let her know that
no matter where you are you will always
be close to her heart
as the Sun sets its Dawn's cue to adjust
the ambience lighting is everything and
with the philips hue bulbs you can fine
tune your room to set the tone for a
romantic night the bulbs are Wi-Fi
enabled and let you control the hue and
the brightness right from your phone
yellows blues and even greens but for
this romantic night I didn't read hue
should do the trick at this point all of
them get creative with what comes next
maybe it's a massage app to bring them
closer together or a romantic movie on
Netflix if you made it this far there's
no doubt she'll look back on the state
as the best Valentine's Day she's ever
had just look at that happy couple looks
like they don't need any more help from
me remember guys to you Valentine's Day
is just another day in February but with
a little effort in these tips it could
be the best day of her life</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
