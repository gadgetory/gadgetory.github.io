final rumor has it the show where we
rounded up the week's hottest rumors and
then bet on them and i'll declare an
ultimate winner of the universe of the
internet so we are tied at 10 million
points turns out it was a tie I know
after all this this is like the
cliffhangers because there is no next
season we just ended with my god my
favorite show that ever was on TV scream
queens oh I know when I shall win
heavily when Emily first started working
here and we became fast friends and and
she admitted to me that that was her
favorite show and it was on vh1 for a
really short mid season and it was the
best season of my life because it was
girls auditioning to be the star in a
horror movie and they all suck they were
horrible at the worst actresses in the
world yeah anyways that's not that's not
what we were we're fabulous no we're
great but we only lasted one season yeah
Barry yeah the 26 yet is this are 26 is
our 27 episode so that's exactly a
season yes so we made it to twenty seven
episodes thank you to everybody for
being here with us along the way and
we've got a quite a show yeah for today
um it's gonna be a little bit not like
her other shows because we're not gonna
talk about rumors today because what
what is the point just kidding no but I
mean we are hoping to bring you a show
that will cover the week's hottest tech
rumors it will be in a new format but
since this is the final episode of our
podcast gambling show there's no point
in bedding so we're just going to have
some fan love and some fan appreciation
and like a big hippie dippie techy geeky
kumbaya moment we're a couple of that
we're gonna have a couple of kumbaya
hippy dippy moment yeah and we're just
gonna express our love for you and each
other maybe we'll drink water I know
that's you know what Berkman was like
did you bring a lot of alcohol to the
studio today I was like you
we brought everything but the alcohol
which is why I'm going to bring us some
champagne but then I decided that I
don't want to celebrate with champagne
something that actually is sad sorry
yeah it is I mean this is sad no yeah i
mean we're putting on a brave face for
the internet you know I know every day
we're crying um but it is we do have
faced it in the long run this we're
going to come back here to you guys and
decide yet somewhere yeah there yeah for
sure cuz i think that this show has
potential to be a great on you want to
abandon you guys so but of course you
know you can still contact us i don't
think the rumor has it email address is
going anywhere national email addresses
aren't going anywhere twitter is not
definitely not going anywhere you're
still gonna be engaged in a
behind-the-scenes Twitter war you know
exactly so we're still I mean that I'm
still my my butt is being kicked I'm not
going to get rid of the rumor has it
seen it a rumor has it sorry at Twitter
account show because every yeah at rumor
show because I think that it's still
part I think it's gonna live I think the
show is gonna live on yeah I think this
show will live on in infamy this is a
day that should be long remembered the
day that rumor has it continued on so I
rose from the cave every day sorry I
don't know why I had to make a Jesus
joke because it's easter yeah all right
on Sunday yeah and pass over on saturday
oh my goodness so um on that note you
should we get to our most important sure
well the most important thing was to
continue following us as green leafy at
Emily Dreyfus at even even Beecham
creamy me at Emily Dreyfus SS is Tom
Julia Louise yeah I mean I my own this
is the first time I even Beecham yeah I
produced things yeah you do sir and then
he couldn't have done this show without
you I know Stephen was like the most
important part of this a pleasure like
these girls came to me in like October
or something yeah and you're like we're
interested in doing a show and I was
like yeah let's let's shoot a pilot we
shot a pilot I went pitched it to Bonnie
my boss and bonnie was like yeah sure
sounds fun let's do it
great and then it was actually kind of
crazy because I had been pitching the
show to Bonnie as a stand-up show and
she was like we don't have room for that
we can only do a podcast finally after
months of me pitching it to her she goes
finally sure okay do you have anyone who
can do it with you and I want I want you
to go and meet with Stephen and do a
pilot today yeah Kareem was home sick as
a dog and I called her and said do you
want to do a show with me and if so can
you come into the office right now and
we'll plan it and I was like be there in
half an hour yeah she literally like
came in we plan to show we did a pilot
and then it was greatest energy yeah I
thought it was really fun totally and
like we based how it red or how it
sounded her based on Stephens laughs
yeah we're like I see cuz I was like
basically the first time we'd ever met
steven regal he liked it so maybe we got
somethin here in here so it was pretty
funny so that was a it was a good I
always said man I always look forward to
Tuesday's cuz i know i'm just gonna come
in and laugh my ass off for two hours
straight with this show and then crave
totally june after the end of Tuesday's
after like noon i was like exhausted
your stomach is all he has good exercise
class laughing all right so oh maybe
we'll release the pilot one time yea
though before I would have done the blog
yeah I'll put the pilot in the blog I'm
sure I still have I still have it I have
it on my desk yeah and I'll put posted
on my youtube cool that'll be like
another humiliation day because we
really didn't know what we were doing I
mean it was and it was like I iphone and
jelly bean yeah it was actually we had
really good rumors on that show oh yeah
and then we like we're like oh we wasted
these on yeah he's ever gonna say
they're like wait we're allowed to talk
about them again cuz no one's gonna see
this yeah and then we did yeah spoiler
alert alright so should we um so we
couldn't we so since its last show part
of our show is about is being humiliated
on the last day of the month or whoever
loses loses the betting war the first
day of the following month or the last
day of the month whatever has to do a
humiliation and so since we're all
winners at the game of life with 10
million points each
include thatting doesn't include Twitter
clout no no clout died and grout we just
stopped yeah because everyone else
couldn't understand clout and we decided
we could go screw it yeah i know we then
we realized that we don't understand it
either and we didn't like it and we
didn't want even though I was winning I
was the one thing I was winning it so we
decided that we would all partake in
today's a humiliation day it's not
really humiliating but it is for you
guys it is for me I mean you guys I have
to say this is the humiliation I've been
the most nervous about of the entire
show like every other one I was like oh
this is kind of funny but really I can
handle it this one I might really really
really we came in rehearse this before
the show today cuz we were all so
nervous yeah yeah yeah we ran it a
couple times did it all over the weekend
so um should we do and the thing is if
we mess up this is our show we could do
it over I mean we'll do it twice I'm
gonna be like cut cut Oh start over then
you'll see diva Emily emerge as you
thought all I had living inside me was a
Russian woman and a tenant old lady who
lived down by the creek right i also
have living inside me i feel you deep fe
from dreamgirls row i'll be like Oh
propria yeah i need another zero size
zero' in my contract and eminem's in my
dressing room yeah so alright so this is
actually kind of like a request that you
guys have made it's not multiple times
multiple times you guys have really
really pitched this one and um here we
go I think we should start okay here we
go
we must go I'm sad to say that this will
be our final show we had a great run the
bedding board and Twitter Wars and all
that was so fun one last time I'll say
that coal cows went and stole our gaze

record hiding felt I felt I had to go to
pre-recorded yeah I mean he like

my boyfriend was like being supportive
and then I sang it probably like 17

anything so i used it'd be when I would
do theater I would like be so confident
and like rehearsals would go so well and
then right before going on a stage no
matter what like even if I knew it was
so gonna be great I would just be like a
puddle of nervousness like I should I

smooth but I'm gonna tell you real quick
he said I made a video for you guys but
the production got away from me and I

random selection because there were too
many and but this one is from tom l Tom
I won't give his full email address
actually um Tom wrote I was saddened to
hear about rumor has it being cancelled
hearing the rumors covered with the
interactions between Emily crane and
Stephen makes whatever they're covering
more interesting i hope there will be a
way to preserve the chemistry of the
show with one of the new on demand shows
at seen it we do too we hope so too
please do you want me just read all
through all mine sure and then yeah then
i'll read through this one is from
chandler Skinner who actually came to
the scene at offices in san francisco
and we met he and his mom and his sister
yeah and that was super tour because he
had emailed us and told us that he was
going to be in town and we were like oh
okay and then he was like could we be on
the show and i was like i don't know
because we've already planned that show
like and so but then it worked out
anyway he came we gave him a little tour
he gave him one of our ratona displease
yes and some and some sticker see ya so
he said I'm very sad to see the show go
away I've watched since the very
beginning and you all have made me laugh
every Tuesday it was very nice of you to
take time away from your work to show me
around the cnet offices after episode 24
when I was in San Francisco thanks for
the laughs and the rumors what a nice
guy is a nice kid and he's
me in like seventh grade I know you Sean
little yeah we thought we thought we
were gonna meet a 42 year old man ya
know he was a little little kid um now
this one isn't uh roughly a little bit
of a different vein here folks ah it's
not exactly the polite email but it's
pretty funny there's a quote at the top
as it rose from this is from Doyle Doyle
wrote in to say no one ever went broke
under estimating the intelligence of the
American people HL Mencken and then
below that he wrote WTF is CBS
collectively on meth but the cancelling
all my favorite shows I guess they just
want to increase twin tekzilla
viewership but on Dr Dee seen it fan
since before World War two I love that
he said things usually say are they on
crack you just like took it a step oh
yeah today are you a day on
methamphetamines yeah that's one which I
hear is the way to ruin your life um
okay Kendall stark sent us a bunch of
stuff but I'm just going to read a short
bit of his email Kendall thank you so
much for being one of our like most
vocal fans ladies I'm heartsick over the
news of the untimely death of rumor has
it I know I can live without love I've
been married for 37 years but I can't
live without you he loves us say we can
see you sometimes somewhere and then he
attached a joke to to us that was pretty
funny yeah um but long so it's not going
to be read here in its entirety but we
appreciate it so much Kendall start and
I'm gonna frame it um then this one
comes from Kevin hissel he wrote the
combination of Kareem and emily is Magic
their personalities are so entertaining
that I am dreading the show going away
please bring these two back in some
vehicle that spotlights their
personalities combined with tech news
and rumors here here here here to the
powers that be and then
then trap Travis is the most recent
email we have received hello rumor has
it crew we read the subject line the
subject line is maybe minus don't leave
excavation actually there's a fixation
and then Travis is a really cute little
picture of himself so he looks adorable
and he says hello rumor has it crew I
want to know why you were leaving and
the rest of my favorite shows on cnet
these shows are what inspire me I would
like to know why all of these shows are
leaving I would rather have 30 minutes
or one hour show than a three-minute one
I hope maybe later on in cnet history
these type of shows will come back oh
and by the way my name is travis from
pound virginia clothe him house love you
Travis that was yeah yeah okay it was
nice so i have i have a few that of my
favorite said i wanted to read this one
is from austin norton he says rumor has
it has changed my life the best show on
the internet by far I mean obviously
this is why I'm reading this on because
he's so nice um but the best show on the
internet by far I love the show I love
the jokes I love the rumors I love you
too soon now it's never to take this
show is the highlight of my week and I
hope I can continue to watch it in an
on-demand format Cena has made a huge
mistake and the internet will grieve
your loss and you will not be soon
forgotten also cinnamon challenge
perhaps no way never I think so it would
be so funny no it's horrible have a good
week and this may be the last time we
get to talk so know that you have one
moil Wisconsin fan that will miss your
guys's show greatly loved Austin Norton
and then he says PS the typos will
probably drive Kareem crazy they did
next time send me a proof and I will
read it and then you can then you can
send it so that was from austin next we
have from eric zinc oh love the show
rumor has it is awesome
then we have one from Marion whistle oh
this is my favorite this one is amazing
I am very disappointed too oh it says oh
no don't go I'm very disappointed to
learn that the rumor has it show has
been canceled the show had become my
first watch on Wednesdays beating the
rachel maddow show the show the show the
show is my way of keeping up with a bit
of the electronic world without really
trying thank you all for the show Korean
Emily and Steven here's where it gets
real Emily and Kareem it is not that I
don't have a sense of humor but I must
admit that as an old lady humiliation
was my least favorite part of the show a
generation thing I know but please don't
spend the whole last show and
humiliations I hope that rumor has it
did not make her uncomfortable our song
um it's too uncomfortable for women in
their 50 60 s to see anyone humiliate
themselves but particularly to smart
funny sensitive women how far have we
come ladies being willing to laugh at
yourself is important but respecting
yourselves is more important as I said a
generational thing ask some older women
friends I look forward to watching rumor
has it in its next incarnation or at
least hearing more from Emmaline Crean I
appreciate it Steven to and all the best
in wherever this show this all takes you
I love that email I mean I feel like for
some reason I knew she lived in
Connecticut why do i why did I think
that I don't know I don't know I just
feel like I knew this I know this person
like I actually feel like that about all
of our fans like whenever you guys write
us or send us voice mails or send us
anything I feel like you're our buddies
that I actually really we've bonded with
and gotten to know a lot of you and I
feel like you guys are sad to see esco
but we're also really sad to lose you
and yes that interaction absolute um and
you know I it's like in this case I
don't even know this woman was watching
our show and then she wrote a such a
thoughtful piece and it really means a
lot yeah absolutely exactly that's
exactly right I know every time we would
get a voicemail or an email or something
and they'd be like I'm in Canada and one
guy was in the Bahamas and we're like
god oh my god we're reaching all over
the world I mean it was amazing and I
used to whenever we get voicemails you
can
them like just right out on the phone
but the way that it comes through the
system it actually immediately plays on
speakerphone on my phone there's no way
to just listen through the outer piece
and so like whenever I would get one
wherever I was no matter what I would
play it for everyone like my friends
have made fun of me because like will be
a lad at a bar and I'll be like stop
everything i have received voice it'll
be like Kareem levy has amazing calf
muscles and then and then ran in that's
like Riley Davis stay golden Riley we
will you too buddy so um alright here's
one from Nikki Francis hi i am a big fan
of your show and i am really sad it as

huh she has so much shame because I call
her ex KGB oh my god that is is Sara Lee
it's really a lie when you say you can't
