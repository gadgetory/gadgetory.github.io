horror games where people might like
shed it to your can a survival horror
game tug at your heartstrings and scare
the hell out of you the developers
behind evil within to think the answer
to that question is yes and they're
offering up a sort of hybrid horror
experience as a foundation for
manipulating all your feels so even
within picks up three years after the
events of the first game his daughter
who he had believed it died many years
ago in a house fire is actually still
alive and you're gonna have to go back
in to to get her my preview time took me
through two very different boss fights
with some exploration and puzzle solving
in between the first fight was pretty
status quo conserve ammo use the
environment bring down scary monster you
know the drill
the second fight against a grotesque
creature named obscura with ballet
slippers on her feet and an old camera
for ahead required a little more
creativity on my part there's an effort
here to balance these sort of classic
and modern elements of horror gaming and
it worked really well in the demo the
fight itself should have originated from
the design and the design originated
from the character of Stefano once that
design came out and we saw the camera
apparatus how can we use this in in
battle or use this as an effective
medium so not to see visually intriguing
or or scary but actually involve it in
the gameplay somewhat between these old
and new school boss battles I guided
Sebastian through a decrepit city hall
with some scary secrets the puzzles
weren't terribly difficult but there was
absolutely a silent hill's PT vibe
happening in the repeating corridors
which johannes admits was an influence I
think any survival horror fan was a fan
of that game so I think it's hard to
Nazi influence of that in anything that
will probably come out an exit it looks
like the game will offer some linear
gameplay to ratchet up specific moments
and jump scares but also has sections
with more open-world options where
player choice factors into your
experience overall we're looking forward
to shedding some tears regardless of the
emotions attached evil within two hits
PC PlayStation 4 and Xbox one on October
