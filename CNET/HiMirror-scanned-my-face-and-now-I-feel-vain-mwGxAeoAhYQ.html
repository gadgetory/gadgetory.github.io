really vain it's called the high mirror
plus and what it does is it analyzes
wrinkles lines the complexion of your
skin dark circles pores and red spots
using this camera up here once you've
taken the scan what it does is it sends
all this data to the cloud and then it
compares your skin with that information
from dermatologists to give you that
reading and then you get an analysis of
what's wrong and what's right about your
skin
now I had a full face of makeup on and
you're supposed to pull your hair back
so you have a clear view of your face so
my readings weren't totally accurate I
have to say but it did tell me that my
makeup was working because I said it had
zero dark circles but it told me I had a
few wrinkles which wasn't what I wanted
to hear once you have this information
you can work out if your skincare
routine is working or not and then it
also gives you tutorials as well if you
want to watch that and bring your makeup
game up to scratch these LED lights here
also changed and you can adjust them
depending on a setting like grocery
store or department store or outdoors to
see if lighting is right for your makeup
it's gonna be two hundred and fifty nine
dollars it's called the high mirror plus
and there's also gesture control so you
don't actually have to touch the mirror
while you're doing your makeup</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
