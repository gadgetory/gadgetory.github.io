I'm cnet's Kara Tsuboi joined by staff
writer Donna Tam and today we're talking
about Facebook supposedly in talks to
buy ways first of all tell us what ways
is it's a mapping app that is built on
like a social layer so everyone that
uses the app helps contribute to the
data on the app so it does things like
track traffic track if there's an
accident people also put in like where
the police cars are which I've people
seem to like a lot and so that's what it
does and it's really about like having
mobile data and using mobile data to
create this network so why is it company
like ways of interest to a company like
Facebook well facebook wants to be big
on mobile that's really important to
them and this would be an easy way for
them to acquire Matt whole mapping
system that's built on big data and
people contributing data to it
absolutely to find out more about their
users right how far along are we in
these talks and is there a dollar amount
put on the company so they've been in
talks allegedly for at least like six
months and I've heard as high as a
billion dollars in terms of price tag
for ways which is pretty big and it
could rival you know Instagram which was
initially and talks for a billion as
well that's right that was last fall at
some point so this would be like the
next big acquisition for facebook and
ways is an Israeli company not that that
matters much I know there are people
here in the US but and ways and Facebook
have also teamed up in the past isn't
that right where if your ways user you
can share that data on your Facebook
page right entryways is one of the
companies that Facebook spotlights
sometimes they pick out certain apps
that have doing particularly well on
their network and they'll say hey here's
an example of how well a mobile product
can be on using Facebook music Felix
platform and so ways is one of those
companies that they've spotlighted
interesting obviously having mapping for
facebook is huge but how do you think it
positions them with other big tech
giants right now in the valley yeah well
they certainly want to catch to Google
and everyone thinks maps they think
Google right and so this would be a
great way for them to get a leg of them
that also in terms of like mobile
advertising you know Google beats
Facebook and Matt but this could
certainly help them catch up if they can
beef up their mobile components so would
you say that a year ago ways would have
even been on
facebook's radar yeah I mean I it's hard
to say because like if it wasn't for
apples Maps being such a like horrendous
disaster disaster then maybe Facebook
wouldn't even notice that there was this
mapping app because Google was so
dominant in that in that field but Apple
decided to go for it and and you know it
really brought the really brought the
rise of ways and that was about what six
months ago last fall at some point well
we'll see what happens Thank You Donna
