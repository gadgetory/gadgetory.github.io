when you're on the road as you can check
in with family and friends and even
download maps you do have to be careful
though when you're connecting to an
unsecured Wi-Fi hotspot as your data can
be intercepted in this how-to I'm going
to show you how to minimize the risk
whether you're using a laptop smartphone
or a tablet some general pointers to be
aware of
first up avoid doing any credit card or
personal information transactions when
you're on public Wi-Fi you also should
check for a secure connection either by
looking for HTTPS or checking for a lock
in the corner of your browser screen
keep your browser and operating system
up to date but make sure you do this
when you're not on public Wi-Fi do this
on a secure connection like at home or
at work when scanning for Wi-Fi you need
to make sure that you're connecting to a
legitimate public Wi-Fi network
don't just connect to the first open one
that's available check with the cafe or
the hotel or the airport that you're at
because it's really easy for someone who
wants to intercept your data to set up a
fake network just called free Wi-Fi and
it looks pretty tempting if you decide
to connect to that open Wi-Fi network
turn off file-sharing on your PC or Mac
on windows it's really simple go to
control panel and then find the Advanced
Settings within the network connections
option and then turn off file-sharing
under public networks on Mac the process
is really similar open system
preferences then find the sharing icon
and then untick file sharing one of the
best ways to stay safe on a public
connection is to use a VPN this will
encrypt the traffic between your device
and the server there are plenty of VPN
options out there if you want a free
version then security kiss offers you
300 megabytes of data per day which is
more than enough for casual web browsing
tasks finally when you're all done
mooching that sweet sweet public Wi-Fi
make sure to log off all your open
services and then forget the network in
Android you can do this by going into
your Wi-Fi connections finding the name
of the net
long-pressing and then selecting forget
network in iOS head to settings find the
network name again select it and then
forget the network a big thanks to auto

use their cafe and Wi-Fi for more tips
