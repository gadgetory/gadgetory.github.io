tablet this is Google's answer to the
kindle fire and the barnes &amp;amp; noble nook
it is a 7-inch full-fledged Android
tablets made for Google Play which could
present some problems that we'll get to
later but first let's get this sucker
out of the box which is no small feat
because if they have the thing ductive
they're all right we already opened it a
little bit we'll talk about that later
too don't you work out of the thing I
need a knife I don't really need a nice
almost you guys wanted a true unboxing
ok so the tablet coming out it's
actually quite a bit smaller than the
barnes &amp;amp; noble nook it feels a lot
lighter they say it's about 12 ounces
that's roughly the weight of a can of
soda now the back of our tablet is white
unfortunately that is just the developer
version that was given out at Google i/o
so when you get it it's going to be
black the power there we go Google it's
the first tablet to run jelly bean
Android 4.1 it has a nice high
resolution 1280 by 800 HD screen a
quad-core Tegra 3 processor which is
great for gaming there's one gigabyte of
RAM compared to the kindle fires 512
megabytes you can get either eight
gigabytes or 16 gigs of storage you get
micro USB for charging and hookups and
it comes with NFC or near field
communication which means it can tap
other NFC devices to share information
wirelessly there's also a 1.2 megapixel
camera on the front for video
conferencing I think the only thing
holding it back probably is that Google
Play library it is nothing compared to
Amazon's and then of course the Nook
just has kind of its own cult thing
going on but when it comes to 7-inch
tablets I got to say I think this guy is
the new frontrunner all that said we
hear rumors that Amazon might introduce
a new kindle fire sometime this summer
if they do I'm sure that they will bring
the big guns but until then give this
guy a try
