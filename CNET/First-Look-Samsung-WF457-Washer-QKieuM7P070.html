is the Samsung WF 457 washing machine
let's take a look so at first glance
this is a very sleek machine it's got
this kind of pearly white finish and
it's got the nice 8 inch LCD touchscreen
you can turn it on by pressing the power
button here and that'll bring up this
really nice looking back lift menu now
this menus got a lot of utility too if
you look at it it's got all your cycles
over here you've got normal heavy-duty
permanent press delicates we've also got
some new ones you've got deep steam
you've got a sanitized mode or you'll
even find that this entire category of
specialty cycles and this is a list of
cycles that are made for specific types
of stains cooking and dining if you've
got an apron of a lot of spaghetti sauce
on it gardening in yard work for grass
stains and mud just a lot of cool
categories you can play with and get a
very exact cycle going get close you
want as clean as they can be another
thing that I like as someone who's
always been a little bit of an idiot
when it comes to laundry is that each
one of these cycles has a little
description here that tells you exactly
what it's good for and exactly how you
should use it so it's kind of idiot
proof in the middle you've got settings
that are specific to the cycle you've
selected and over here you've got some
general settings that are good for all
cycles you can turn the light on inside
you can activate smart control mode or
she tells the washer to connect with
your phone and let you control it
remotely we've had a little bit of mixed
results getting that to work it works
most the time but sometimes not as well
as we'd like so stay tuned for some more
in-depth analysis about that one other
big problem that we have with the app is
that it is available on iOS devices and
it's available on Samsung Galaxy devices
but it's not available on other Android
devices we have a nexus tab here at the
cnet offices and we can't find the app
anywhere so we're a little bit miffed by
that the washer also has this drawer
here if you open it up you'll find a
place to put the detergent the fabric
softener everything you need and it's
real nice if you want to pull that out
and push it back in out of the way makes
for a much more simple design on the
outside you like that quite a bit now
let's take a look inside we've got about
4.5 cubic feet of space inside of here
and that's a great number that's a lot
of laundry
do in one load and that stacks up really
well against other smart washers in this
field you look inside you've also got
these sort of diamond patterned events
and that's supposed to be more efficient
about the way it drains water and soaks
your clothing and they call it a diamond
drum personally I think that's just a
way to use the word diamond and make it
sound fancier than it is it's just
stainless steel but it still looks kind
of nice i'll give credit for that if you
want more information about this washing
machine or any others check out all of
our coverage here on sina including our
washer buying guide and a specific
review of this the WF 457 prasina i'm
right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
