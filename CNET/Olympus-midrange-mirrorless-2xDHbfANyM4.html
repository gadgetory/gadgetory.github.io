thirds camera that sits at the bottom of
the higher end omd line those are
cameras which include more advanced
features than the pen line like an
electronic viewfinder in a tilting
display at about eight hundred dollars
for the kit with the new power zoom 14
to 42 millimeter lens the cameras both
designed and priced more for enthusiasts
than the always auto crowd I'm Lori
groanin and while the mirrorless iam
tens performance in photo quality don't
quite match those of an entry-level DSLR
the trade-off is a much smaller body and
perhaps more important access to much
smaller lenses the result is a much more
portable system the e/m 10 has a
touchscreen but it doesn't skimp on the
manual controls it includes two
adjustment dials which is nice since a
lot of cameras in this class only supply
one my only real peeve with the design
is the shallow grip though it does have
a large thumb rest which compensate
somewhat especially when you're shooting
single-handedly otherwise it has
Olympus's typical menu structure and
interface both the EBF and the tilting
touchscreen LCD are bright and
contrasting very good though the display
does get quite reflective in direct
sunlight the camera has tons of useful
features including Wi-Fi time lapse and
auto HDR along with Olympus's nice set
of in camera effects the image quality
is very good but not quite as good as
what you could get from a DSLR with an
aps-c sized sensor you can get usable
shots in relatively dim conditions
though the photo start to get noticeably
mushy when you hit ISO 1600 performance
is very good to the autofocus system
operates quickly and generally pretty
decisively the biggest drawback is the
new slowish power zoom kit lens which
exchanges convenience for speed the lens
is also a little noisy and quiet
environments the a.m 10 is a nice
alternative to a DSLR if you want
something significantly more compact it
just can't really match a camera like
the less expensive nikon d 3333
continuous shooting speed on the other
hand it does have a broader feature set
than most entry-level dslrs and for
people upgrading from a point-and-shoot
the electronic viewfinder and fast
shooting with the back display will
probably feel more natural I'm Laurie
grinning and this is the Olympus om-d
