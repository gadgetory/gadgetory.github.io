the uma platform to communicate Genest
devices and one of the examples is that
if your smoke alarm goes off there's a
fire in your house you're away from home
we can call you on your cell phone and
then we can let you know that there's a
smoke alarm going off and give you the
option to call 911
so like within the call it says press 1
for 9-1-1 or something like that okay
exactly and the key is that the 9-1-1
call is made using your home phone
number and address and therefore the
public safe to the answering point who
answers the call will know where to send
the emergency response personnel when
they need to respond ok so how how does
my phone tie into a thermostat though
great question so the thermostat on on
with nest actually collects data about
whether or not you're at home or not and
they use that to conserve energy to
reduce you know bandwidth use energy
usage and we tie into that same
intelligence and use that data for other
things so for example one thing that we
do is if you're away from home we can
forward your calls to your cell phone
automatically and then once you return
home we can turn off call forwarding and
your home phone will ring just like it
does usually on and off just because you
walk in the door and walk past the nest
it just knows if you're home or not and
it changed the 40 okay you mentioned
something else about getting alerts when
people come home that's right
we have something called check in
monitoring and this is perfect if you
have someone in your home who keeps a
set schedule so for example my son who
was supposed to come home between 2:30
and 3:30 everyday I can set up my uma
system to call me whenever he deviates
from that schedule so let's say he
doesn't come home one day at 3:30 I can
get a call alert from my Ummah saying
the person that you expected didn't
check in do you want to call him and
therefore I can check out that now where
it's all about proximity in some way or
another so you're working with nest
among other companies but where else do
you want to have a connect with because
I think nest is one of the major smart
hubs you could say I mean Google wants
to be one of the main hubs so does
Apple's Siri we do we're seeing a lot of
things on the
floor with Apple Siri homekit where but
are you trying to work with Siri - or
what's what what's it look like in the
future for sure
well we think that the umma makes for a
great platform for home automation and
we think that communication will add
another layer of convenience safety and
security to users so I think it makes a
lot of sense for the two to Co together
and we're looking to partner with other
companies in the Internet of Things in
home automation realm to make for for
new experiences Belkin may be next or
able to say a little insight into like
where the hop at least the hot couple
you're looking at yeah well we focused
on the consumer market so we're looking
for the winners and the comes to
consumer space ness is obviously a
leader and there are others in the space
that we hope to partner with very soon
okay well this is clearly a look at what
the smart home really is getting at it's
more than just the one device in your
home but it's having the multiple things
all talk to each other all work together
yeah thanks for joining us I really
appreciate it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
