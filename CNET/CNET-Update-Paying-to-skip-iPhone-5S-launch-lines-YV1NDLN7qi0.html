camp out for an iphone I'm Bridget Carey
and this is your cnet update
the iphone is dominating the news this
week as it does always during a new
launch as people continue to wait in
line to be the first with a new model
but some folks waiting in line are being
paid to stand there on behalf of someone
else the website taskrabbit is a popular
resource to find someone to wait in line
for you a spokesman said that right now
going rate to hire someone is averaging
fourteen dollars an hour last year more
than 300 people used TaskRabbit to skip
the lines for iphone 5 launch day
another hot item this week is the game
Grand Theft Auto 5 it shattered previous
video games sales records by making
eight hundred million dollars in one day
beating the previous record of five
hundred million dollars set by call of
duty black ops 2 analysts estimate that
more than 13 million copies of the game
were bought in one day a PlayStation app
is coming to iOS and Android devices in
November it's meant to be used with the
new PlayStation 4 console the app can
turn your iOS or Android device into a
game controller or it can serve as a
second screen for certain games to
provide extra content it's also a portal
into Sony's PlayStation Network to watch
what other people are playing or buy
games that are downloaded into the ps4
it's an easy way to also chat with other
users and connect with facebook and
twitter the ps4 system is set to arrive
in the US on November 15th in other app
news google wallet is now available on
iOS devices you can't use it to pay it
registers that involves NFC technology
among other things but the app can be
used to send money to others with an
email address and it's another option

cards as well as loyalty and rewards
cards for those of you with friends

right now hewlett-packard is the first
computer maker to build leap motion hand
gesture technology into their laptops
leap is sort of like Microsoft's Kinect
it can
measure your hand movements so that you
can control the computer with gestures
instead of using a mouse you can buy a
leap to plug into any computer but there
will be a special edition of the HP envy
17 that has a leap sensor built in leap
only works with software that was
programmed for it so it's a bit limited
in these early days but there are some
games you can play with it that's your
