bulky paper flashcards and atlases to
learn the complex names and locations of
the structures of the human body but
this is about to change we've started
with the gold standard and medical
illustrations the beautiful neta
collection and using the iphone sdk
we've created an app that is not only
more portable but also far more powerful
than paper flashcards so let's have a
look a student can easily find a region
of the body and their view hundreds of
anatomical images once they select one
of those images then they can easily
zoom and pan across these beautiful and
highly detailed images imagine doing
this on any other mobile device simply
select
thank you simply selecting a pin shows
the anatomical structure and it makes it
very easy for a student to jump out to
the web and find additional information
on that particular part of the body the
app has a simple quiz mode that prompts
the user to find a structure within an
image and provides feedback about
whether they're right or whether wrong
and we really believe that applications
like this will provide unique and new
opportunities for effective learning
outside of the classroom and I witnessed
this firsthand am i teaching a brain
anatomy when a student after using a
prototype of this application said dr.
Williams I learned five new brain terms
this morning while I was waiting in line
for my latte so the iphone sdk has
enabled modality to provide learners
instant access to the content that they
trust on the device that they really
want to carry and it's been so easy to
use and coupled with our business and
development model we've been able to
produce numerous applications very
quickly not only medical applications
that we're talking about here today
we're also bringing some of the biggest
brands and k-12 education and Consumer
reference content and we're excited to
announce that within weeks of the App
Store launching we'll have a dozen
applications available and many more
about the end of the year thank you very
much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
