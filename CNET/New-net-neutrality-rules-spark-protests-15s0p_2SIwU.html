Thursday December 7th protesters came
together in front of Verizon stores
around the United States the protesters
are trying to send a message and raise
awareness about net neutrality on
December 14th the FCC will vote on a new
proposal that would get rid of net
neutrality regulations that have been in
place since 2015
the proposal is expected to pass since
three of the five seats on the
Commission are controlled by the
Republican Party outside of Verizon
stores protesters held up signs saying
net neutrality is freedom of speech
another said don't throttle me with a
sign similar to the don't tread on me
Gadsden flag currently all data is
treated equally by your internet service
provider if you're visiting Facebook or
streaming movies or listening to music
every bit is treated the same in
priority the new plan entitled restoring
Internet freedom order by FCC chairman
object Pi which simply require internet
service providers to be transparent
about their practices theoretically this
could allow ISPs to slow down access to
certain sites give priority to their own
services and charge all kinds of fees to
access different parts of the Internet
the proposal also would give the Federal
Trade Commission authority to police the
internet instead of the FCC the protests
were held at Verizon stores because FCC
Chairman PI worked as a lawyer for
Verizon before he was appointed to the
FCC Verizon says it has no plans to
block or slow access to the Internet
where you stand on net neutrality let us
and the FCC know for more coverage to
