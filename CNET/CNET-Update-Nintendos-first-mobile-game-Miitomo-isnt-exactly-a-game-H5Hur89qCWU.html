your C net update Nintendo finally
revealed its very first game for
smartphones and it's not really a game
at all the first smartphone app from
Nintendo is called me Tomoe Tomoe
meaning friend and although the company
calls it a free-to-play game it's more
like a social network messaging tool
with me avatar characters that you
create to look like you and then you
answer a bunch of questions about
yourself such as details on your
interests and family life and here's
where this takes on sort of a Sims vibe
your Mii can talk to other Me's for you
with what Nintendo calls pretend
communication this is for people who are
too shy to socialize themselves so you
can discover things you have in common
with others Nintendo first started
teasing us back in March that it was
working on a pings for smartphones for
the first time we would get a Nintendo
game that did not require Nintendo
hardware to play but I don't think a
social network me game is what people
had in mind not to mention there will be
in app purchases so I guess you can
upgrade your Mii with accessories or
something I know we all wanted a Mario
game but come on what did we expect
Nintendo has always been protective
about putting Mario or Zelda franchises
on outside products but we won't be able
to really judge miitomo until next year
because it's not coming out until March
of 2016 which is later than expected
that's not all that's going on in the
gaming world the video site twitch is
known for live streaming video people
playing video games but it also has been
home to a growing creative arts
community in fact there are a hundred
thousand broadcaster streaming creative
creations and so twitch just created a
landing page just for this category
where you can watch artists creating art
live and interacting with viewers in
chat rooms and as part of this launch
twitch is streaming a marathon of Bob
Ross's show the joy of painting so you
too can learn to paint happy little
trees also there are a number of new
product reviews on CNET you should check
out including the Apple TV review which
is a bit pricier than other streaming
boxes the new
150 dollars but it has potential to
stand out when more apps and games
become available we also have a review
of the Microsoft band - it's the
company's second take at a fitness
tracker it's also more expensive than
the first version at two hundred and
fifty dollars and then there is the 1
plus X Android smartphone made by a
Chinese company it's actually the same
price as that Microsoft band two hundred
and fifty dollars that's cheap for a
phone but it's a mess to get one they
make you request an invite to sound all
exclusive but it's what they do to stand
out from the larger companies it comes
out in November that's it for this tech
news update and there's more at cnet.com
from our studios in New York I'm Bridget
