welcome to the Apple buy for everything
good and bad inside the world of Apple
it's a short week for the Thanksgiving
holiday in the US and guess where I'm
going yeah it starts with an H and ends
with an I and I'll read your comments
and the guest is below now let's get to
the show in the biggest story in the
Apple world is all about the antennas in
the iPhone 7 and don't start screaming
and tenha gate right now now we've been
talking all about on the Apple white
extra crunchy audio podcast so check it
out if you want to dig even deeper
inside the world with Apple but here's
the breakdown of what we know so far
Apple is using two different LTE
antennas inside the iPhone 7 an Intel
modem is inside AT&amp;amp;T and t-mobile phones
while a Qualcomm modem is inside the
Verizon and Sprint iPhones now
independent testing by cellular insights
found that the Qualcomm base phones like
the Verizon iPhone 7 outperformed an
AT&amp;amp;T iPhone 7 by 75% when it came down
to data speeds with a low signal think
about something like one dot on your
phone and I knew something was different
especially on my daily commute even
before this was revealed that hasn't
been disputed now a recent report from
Bloomberg claimed Apple might be
throttling Bryson's LTE performance with
a Qualcomm modem in order to make it
perform similarly to the Intel chip
that's in other phones the qualcomm
hardware is theoretically capable of a
maximum 600 megabits per second for
download speeds compared to the Intel
modem that tops out at 450 megabits per
second recode has now confirmed this to
be true but really there's nothing we
can do about Apple holding back the
Qualcomm modem chip because it's in
their best interests to have all phones
performed similarly even with LTE
connectivity you know you have location
signal strength number of users on the
network the demand for data depending on
your task it's going to change
so here's Apple's official statement in
all of our rigorous lab tests based on
wireless industry standards in thousands
of hours of real-world testing and an
extensive carrier partner testing the
data shows there is no discernible
difference in the wireless performance
of any of the models now I'm more
curious how much better would i phone
7sv across the board if all of them
been equipped with the qualcomm modem
and the answer is we'll never know but
again this is not another antenna gate I
know you might be kind of frustrated but
you're gonna have to get over it it's
more like a what could have been but
it's not so you know what let's just
move right along
all right a bloomberg report also says
Apple has completely disbanded its
wireless router division in order to
sharpen its focus on products that can
make them more revenue according to
their sources the decision hasn't been
publicly announced we haven't seen an
airport refresh since 2013 you know what
I'm just gonna throw a bad apple on that
one yeah and it's likely we'll never see
a new airport Express Airport extreme or
airport time capsule so don't buy one
right now and let's be honest they may
look pretty ish but companies like
d-link or Netgear our head in the game
now Apple also recently stopped making
its own external monitors and instead
announced new displays in a partnership
with LG but come on they're really LG
displays we won't give airports the
Apple bites send-off until they are
officially announced as gone so we'll
just have to wait for that and apples
now stepping up the handle iPhone issues
that we've criticized them for ignoring
Apple has launched an iPhone 6 plus
Touch disease repair program they call
it the multi-touch repair program where
you can get your 6 plus repaired for 149
dollars but you know what it's a little
too late for me especially for an issue
that's started popping up a year later
and guess what we're now at year 2 now
most people have already taken the most
popular Apple iPhone repair out it's
called buying a new iPhone and the big a
has also opened up another repair
program for iPhone 6s users whose
devices may be unexpectedly shutting
down
it only affects certain devices
manufactured between September and
October of 2015
you'll need to contact Apple to see if
your phone serial number is within this
range but Apple will replace the battery
of your device free of charge and just a
fun video we're checking out we've
already ripped on the Apple book enough
and yes I know it is still pretty but
512 pixels bloggers Steven Hackett
created this fun video with some of the
actual products side by side with the
book and I liked it so I'm telling you
about it so you can watch it all right
that's going to do it for this week's
show you can email us at the Apple bye
to see Netcom or tweet me
Brian Tong they so much for watching
we'll catch you all next time for
another bite of the Apple Wow oh yeah
watch out for that cliff
hope and water nice peaceful dududu not
the branch
oh okay oh hey there yeah so are we
doing this I guess we are
