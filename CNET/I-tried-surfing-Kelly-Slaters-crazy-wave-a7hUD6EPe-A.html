probably the best office in the world
come with me
this you've Kelly Slater sir French
when you think of wave falls you
probably picture something pretty small
at a waterpark
but this place it is next level it's
where world champion surfer Kelly Slater
has built the perfect wave this ranch is
nowhere near the ocean it's actually a
hundred miles from the Pacific in a
small town called Lemar in California
this wave pool is 700 yards or 640
meters in length
in fact it's so long they even have to
have golf carts to get from one end to
the other
okay so here's kind of a cheat sheet on
how this all works so there's a control
tower behind me that's where all of the
magic happens and they are radioing back
and forth between the person on the
jetski
carrying the surfers and they can
determine exactly kind of how they want
the wave to behave if they want it to be
an intermediate level if they wanted to
be beginners for someone like me and
then the magic happens they press all
the buttons and then that blue machine
is the hydrofoil that's dragged along
and it creates the wave
the pool is pretty shallow when there's
no wave so you can stand up it's a
concrete base with different contours so
the waves change shape as they travel
down the lake surfers can ride the wave
for around 45 seconds and you only have
to wait another 4 to 5 minutes before a
new wave comes through
so Kelly I am so pumped to be at the
surf ranch today thanks for having me
me too thank you so how does the wave
actually get generated like what's the
technology the technology is a foil
shape that goes through the water and
for people don't know what a foil is
it's basically a really inefficient boat
hull so the idea between behind most
boats is make that thing plane as quick
as possible and not push any water or is
the opposite it's like we don't want it
to be planing or lifting we want it to
just be pushing water so it's all that
force getting pushed directly into the
wave I think something like 90 plus
percent of the energy that's pulling the
mechanism goes directly into the swell
that's created so it's it's a you know
it's just a more and more energy you put
it in the bigger stronger wave you get
so what's the characteristic of this
wave the idea was to make what's called
a solitary wave or a salt on the that's
where you get into a kind of scientific
terms and what differentiates different
waves in different technologies so ours
is based essentially as well and the
ocean surfers we call it ground swell
and so if a storm makes a swell here and
it sends it 5,000 miles
it doesn't really lose any energy so
that's what a Salton is so Kelly I am a
really bad Australian and I've never
surfed before I know how to look in your
face it's it's a shock I know I might
leave right now but someone that's never
surfed like how easy or how hot is this
we can tone the wave right down we can
we cover a small little wave and we you
know we have people who know which board
you should be on and how to kind of ride
with you and help you ultimately like
the best the top pros and stuff they're
all riding it basically as little amount
of foam as they can for the most part
before my group of rookies tries to
serve Kelly shows us how it's done
already
suited off those two but my foot okay
now I'm gonna learn how to serve get a
lesson before I go in
some of the beginners got it pretty
quickly I on the other hand yeah okay I
need some help
Wow okay that was that was insane so I
guess like cool it away I couldn't
really stand up but it was it was really
intense I could feel the force of the
wave behind me I feel like it's so much
easier on land and you're like yeah I
got it I got it and then you get on the
wave and it just all goes out the window
but that was unreal I'll sue surveys
with moments I don't think I'm gonna be
the next Kelly Slater but even though I
only got to try and ride full waves it
was still an awesome experience and I
definitely feel more confident in taking
on some real waves in the ocean thanks
so much for watching make sure you give
it a thumbs
subscribe and wait for this way it's
pretty open
