the LG vote too now this is available on
boost mobile for 150 bucks without a
contract it's not very exciting but
pretty good performance and that
compelling price could make it a good
option if you're looking for a budget
smartphone LG has been on a bit of a
curve device kick lately and that
doesn't change with the vote too I'm not
convinced that the gentle curve as much
in the way of added comfort and you'll
barely notice it when it's in your
pocket or your hands the voltou has a
5-inch screen with a 1280 by 720 pixel
resolution that's not full HD which is
disappointing but the displays otherwise
fine text on web site looks clear and
crisp and colors and photos remain true
when I turn the phone on its side the
1.2 gigahertz quad-core processor is
paired with one gig of ram that's not an
especially impressive showing but
performing two newer android games like
modern combat 5 isn't bad best of all
the phone runs for latest version of
Android lollipop 5.1 you learn to farm
more trouble with the meager eight gigs
of storage space most of that is taken
up by the operating system you're
definitely gonna want to pick up a micro
SD storage card the phone can support up
to 32 gigabyte card and it also is 2540
milliamp battery sitting underneath the
back cover the battery is removable so
you can grab a spare if you need more
choose so the vote to isn't going to
blow you away but if you want a speedy
modern smartphone that is going to cost
nearly as much as the high-end flagships
that are out there this could be a good
place to start your search I'm ma√Ætre
be sure to read my full review to see
how the vote to stack stepping into
other budget smartphones thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
