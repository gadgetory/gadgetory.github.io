cnet com I'm here a tech shop in San
Francisco to answer one of text most
burning questions that's been lighting
up the internet for weeks it's if the
white iphone is thicker than the black
iphone i know you're in the edge of your
seats to find out now we've heard that
the white iphone could be just even a
millimeter thinner than the black iphone
so we didn't have the stuff around the
office to measure that and you probably
even noticed a difference it came down
here because they've got all these
amazing machines everything from a
high-powered water jet to lasers that
can do pretty much anything and probably
make pretty much anything as well zach
is a dream coach here at TechShop and
he's actually going to do the dirty work
and measure these phones so Zack what
are actually going to use to do that
I've got two tools i'm going to use the
first is going to be a digital set of
calipers second it's going to be a
micrometer which works under the same
principle so these are going to be more
accurate than anything you'll buy in a
hardware store right this is actually
commercially available in a hardware
store this is a little more specialized
this will be much more accurate probably
will be able to pick up on tolerances
that a manufacturer can't even so the
black one I've got nine point four
millimeters 9.4 okay and we'll have you
look at the white I've got 9.45 so it
was 9.45 so that actually is the tiniest
bit thicker and that was on the digital
calipers correct that's great okay now
we'll move on to the micrometer let's do
it so the micrometer which has a higher
degree of accuracy says 9.30 eight
millimeters 9.30 right great and we'll
have you look at the white 9.4 00 so
there you have it in both of those tests
we did find that the white iphone was
slightly thicker and there's a couple of
important things to keep in mind one is
it does your measurements are going to
depend on the accuracy of the tool there
could have been a dust maybe a grain of
sand or something that was throwing off
the measurements just a bit and also
it's very possible that you could have
the same product measure just slightly
differently and more importantly it's
not going to make any difference to you
it we tried a couple cases we try to
bumper and they fit on the white iphone
just fine so really in the real world
sense it makes no difference but as we
found just the slightest bit thicker i'm
