maverick Pro drone but it's it's size
that sells it it's certainly more travel
friendly than other drones including DJ
eyes phantoms
but even unfolded it's just less
obtrusive and easier to fly in tight
spaces
DJI shrank the controller to giving it
the look and feel of a gaming controller
though the phone mount is a bit of a
pain and you'll have to remove any case
to use it regardless of their size
though performance is great the quad
held steady in high winds and was able
to get twenty five minutes in the air
and it has an unobstructed range of up
to four point three miles or seven
kilometres like the Phantom 4 this has a
sport mode that will take it up to 40
miles per hour but you also get a tripod
mode to slow you down for perfect
positioning it's 4k cameras mounted on
DJI smallest 3-axis gimbal ever but it
kept the camera just as steady as the
company's larger cables its lens is not
as wide as the Phantom's so you might
find yourself flying higher than normal
to get more of a scene in and although
some have reported image quality issues
I didn't experience them if you want to
let the Mavic handle the shooting there
are plenty of automated moves available
and with its new guidance system of
sensors and cameras it can fly indoors
and out while avoiding obstacles in
front of it it can track subjects too
and while it isn't perfect it's better
than others out there and DJI uses the
drones vision smarts so you can use
gestures to focus the Maverick on
yourself without the controller the
camera even rotates 90 degrees for
vertical images it's a fantastic machine
and it's priced accordingly add $1000 in
the u.s. 1700 in Australia and 1100
pounds in the UK but you are getting a
lot of flying camera for the money</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
