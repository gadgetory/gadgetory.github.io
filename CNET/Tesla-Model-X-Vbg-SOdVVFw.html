rolled out a beta version of its third
car the Model X let's see if it will fly
and check the tech
of course the first two things you
notice about the Model X are oh it's an
SUV and oh my god it's gonna fly away
well here it is the third Tesla the
Tesla Model X and you would think being
a Tesla it's all gonna be about
electrification how the car moves under
battery power only and how fast it is
but surprisingly the Tesla message here
is as much about practicality and
usability as it is about what drives
this vehicle in fact founder Elon Musk
goes so far as to say this car will be
minivans SUVs and even the current 911
all at their own games I think it just
provides a whole new level of
functionality that no minivan and no SUV
have the most distinctive thing you'll
see on the Model X are doors that do
something you've never seen before they
lift like a Gullwing door but those have
never been practical these also
articulate right about the belt line
here and become what they call a falcon
wing door that gives you according to
Tesla much more useful access to the
second row with a child seat while also
being able to use the third row at the
same time how many parents know what I'm
talking about there and of course you
can tell by the altitude of getting in
here this is a car that allows you to
stand up on ingress now Tesla says these
doors will open up in any parking spot
that has enough room for you to fit
between the cars well maybe if you're a
big fat guy to my eye they seem to need
somewhat generous space but let's see
what the production geometry turns out
to be however you get inside its LCD
city the instrument panel is all LCD the
center stack is one huge 17 inch
touchscreen LCD and there are even
little iPod Nano looking LCDs on the
steering wheel to create dynamic control
functions as needed now this is
interesting it may or may not make it to
production because of various technical
as well as legal reasons but it's a
mirrorless car that has a rear-facing
camera this does the job of looking back
but instead of a mirror you look out at
it puts that image on a screen in the
vehicle we see this on a lot of concept
cars Tesla says it could be legally
tough with certain vehicle regulations
but the reason they want to do it is not
just tech gee whiz but to save some 5%
of energy consumption during highway
cruising
the Model X is built on the platform of
the Model S but with a bigger frontal
area to move through the air the range
will be down about 10 or 12 percent on a
charge that means anywhere from 140 to
260 some odd miles depending on the
model you buy zero to sixty is expected
to be 4.4 seconds and that is indeed
quicker than a current 911 now it's
funny Tesla talks about this car having
the handling of a Porsche and also the
performance of one but also the front
luggage capacity is rather similar up
here there's no motor because the motors
on this car are very compact and the
batteries are down in the belly of the
vehicle so you'll end up with not just
that very spacious rear trunk but also a
very spacious front trunk but it goes
beyond practicality Tesla points out
this is sort of the ultimate crumple
zone when you hit something hard in this
car there's a lot of space for things to
collapse without shoving an engine
through the console where you are the
Model X is coming to market in limited
production end of 2013 full volume top
of 2014 - big question marks
what will the appetite for EVs be by
then and will those doors really make it
to production</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
