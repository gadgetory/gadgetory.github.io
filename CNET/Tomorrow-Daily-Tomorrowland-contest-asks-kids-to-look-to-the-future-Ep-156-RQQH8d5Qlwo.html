Antarctica might turn into a nice robot
on the surface of Europa I can't wait to
show you this full-size Titan from
attack on Titan that's you know just
like your nightmares just like my
nightmares and also a really cool
contest that is Disney joining up with x
prize for a glimpse into the future
samar daily
greetings citizens of the internet
welcome to tomorrow daily the best ski
talk shows new universe I'm your co-host
Ashley scale attorneys always kill
anonymous sake from Titans safer well
for now for now for the time yeah it
could just walk right across the ocean
and come right to California you know
completely naked I'm ready to go I got
some pretty good news stories for you
today yeah we do alright i I'm I'm
pretty jazz so let's not waste any time
let's say the headlines okay this is
pretty cool it launched a few months ago
actually technically so launched late
last year but I'm going to tell you a
little bit about and explain why it
could be really important to kind of
know that it exists so this is called
the ice Finn robot and it's from the
georgia institute of technology they
deployed it back in let's see he was
december of last year maybe november and
cnet was covering this and I thought
this was so cool they dropped this robot
you can see what it looks like right
here they dropped this robot through a
foot wide hole so not very big hole at
all in the ice and they had to go
through 65 feet of ice cuz they're in
Antarctica and down then they went down
sixteen hundred and forty feet to the
seafloor so it's it's way down there oh
boy way way down to the bottom of the
sea floor name are they doing down there
so they were checking out like what life
was like down there and they were they
were actually expecting I think some
people are expecting to see like very
sparse life because it's very very cold
obviously and they said it was filled
with life they said there were see stars
anemones sponges they're all kinds of
stuff down there and this robot in
particular is very special because it
weighs under 300 pounds which is very
lightweight considering the you know
that a little submarine that James
Cameron I think he might own it yeah he
like goes down as a deep diving to go
check out things like the Titanic
wreckage Cameron does what James Cameron
he really just does whatever he wants i
think it's called like the auto sub
there's one like it and those wait tons
I mean they're really really heavy
thousands of pounds this one is under
300 pounds but has a rain
and comparable instruments to larger
vehicles like that err sub so most
underwater kind of robots like this have
one camera and maybe one other
instrument maybe and this one has 80 so
there's quite a few instruments on board
study and it's super portable now here's
why it's important so they're saying
that this research and this development
of this technology may someday come in
handy for NASA if they want to check out
and explore what's under Europa's
surface like because they're saying you
know a lot of water there it's an ice
they could go and drill in and then drop
something very not very similar but
similar to this Burleson base it's
possible that the research and
development of the ice fin robot may
someday lend a hand in exploring the
ICC's of Europa which is pretty amazing
I think this is so cool and I really
love that there they have a lot of video
for this which is fantastic like you can
really watch and see kind of what they
what they were able to see and their
explorations up in Antarctica which is
how thick was the ice again they said
they had to go through 65 feet of ice
and and down through the water 1640 feet
so it's quite a bit that's a lot all
right well cool pretty awesome so
Georgia Tech a great great job well done
pretty neat um you may all right you
want your titans of mine switching gears
switching care years to pop culture and
AR which I love is one of my favorite
things so there is a very popular anime
called attack on Titan it's it was very
popular in Japan I was very popular over
here I love it it's great it's about
these gigantic Titans that come and kill
people that you don't know very scary
very hey game away also um but basically
one guy decided he wanted to make a
full-size Titan in augmented reality no
and I and here is here it is check it
out full-size augmented reality I
tighten a now this guy's name is camo
see and basically what he did was he
used you know that AR technology
where you create a shape and you're able
to project based on that shape and he
did it with Hatsune Miku Miku sorry
hatsune miku who's a very successful
yeah very popular fake digital musician
it'll pop lover love you Japan love you
so much youtube and so basically he made
it so that the computer would recognize
that that particular shape then he made
a gigantic version of that shape got his
got his drone flew up really high and
then simulated a giant a giant giant
Titan so this is it was a big no 50
meters tall is how big this Titan is
really different size titans honestly ok
so is about 150 feet high we're stories
tall yeah for sort cheese and so okay so
they're making right now in the video
they're like making the AR marker right
yeah they're making the shape that the
computer recognizes that would reject me
to show the image yes so there he goes
and then he laid it out enough giant
filled with his friend this is
ridiculous I love this so much oh is
that I don't like a DJ yeah he got it
you got a drone up there now what's
crazy is you know obviously he didn't
just make the drone he also like made it
so I can dance I think we have the
footage of Italians answers yeah the
Titan does a terrifying I think it does
it I think it does a hatsune miku i
should say is it an original yeah good
yeah she has their little dances there
it is hatsune miku tightened terrifying
Wow but anyway there you go I really
love ya look it even has a shadow on it
that is indeed the stuff of nightmares
so it's uh yeah it's really cool to see
somebody using using that sort of AR
technology in such a large space he
could recreate a scene from attack on
Titan that's pretty scary but very cool
and I just I'm always by don't know if
he has AI don't know if he's made this
available but that would be pretty cool
if anybody could could like make that
that shape if he could release the
program so that I can like put it
tighten behind us or whatever we should
do that right in the middle of the show
just have a giant title game gets is
scared of titans we don't know will you
do a giant Genghis i went to get sued
only we own the rights to get like rice
buzz
anyway so that is pretty they go that is
your pop culture AR he didn't really
have any goals he just wanted to make a
full size now the goal was a target is
so fun Titan we got a contest that's uh
that's happening it's not ours but it's
a pretty cool contest it's really cool
uh so I heard I heard about this contest
I wanted to talk about it a little bit
cuz I think it really fits in with sort
of ours the spirit of our show uh this
is called the taupe Disney's create
Tomorrowland XPrize challenge so we're
look we're gonna watch some footage from
the train Tomorrowland's coming out i'm
really excited about it it looks cool
like I'm really interesting tomorrow
looks cool one of my flute amazing one
of my favorite locations in disneyland
tomorrow land um so this disc ondas is
pretty fun so what they're doing is
they're it's for kids so if you're oh
you or someone you know is between the
age of 8 to 17 you can enter this
contest I know you're so close you're
just okay so just turn eight so kids so
very smart kids very smart or very just
very creative kids because here's here's
what the contest is all about so d your
if you are entering you have to imagine
an innovation or an invention from the
future and you have to report on that
thing to us here in the presence you
have to imagine that you're in the
future you have to think of some amazing
innovation or invention and you have to
tell us in 2015 about it as if you were
in the whoa that's really cool so you
could be like hey I'm here doing the
traffic report the flying cars are
backed up all the way to here here's the
reason like the technical thing if you
buy this new card this innocent so it's
got to be some sort of so like flying
cars you could take it a step further
and be like that's sorting on this
amazing GPS that you we just never have
to worry about flying cars like being in
traffic again like they all are gonna
blow each other whatever which is so
cool and they are allowing people to do
it in one of three ways like if because
a lot of kids maybe your camera shy or
maybe they are better artist than they
are you know speakers and so they're
doing three different types of entries
you can either make a video you can do
artwork you can make a drawing or take a
photo and you can also do you can also
do a short story so they're giving you
three different options and they're
gonna pick a winner in each category in
two age groups so
if you're like eight or nine years old
and you're thinking oh I don't want to
enter because some 15 year old kids
gonna beat me like all the older kids
are gonna be better than me no not the
case because they're gonna split it
eight to 12 year old age bracket and
then 13 to 17 well what do they win
sounds cool the prizes are pretty good
especially if you're a kid $3,000 your
they're gonna pick one winner in each
age bracket for each category so six
winners total you're gonna get three
grand a 3d printer from 3d systems
you're and you're also going to get an
invitation to participate in the Disney
creativity summer mentorship program
which is going to be operated by X PRIZE
Foundation which the Disney is doing
this contest in conjunction with x prize
which is a foundation kind of dedicated
to futurism and helping humanity through
futuristic sort of inventions and things
like that um really funny dozen a 3d
printer and you get to intern when you
get a mentor with mentors and x prize is
like we're the mentors they said we
can't tell you we can't announce it yet
but they're amazing so we thought that
would be a good opportunity to let you
guys take the hashtag of the day which
is TD prize and tell us who you think
the mentors should be fictional or
non-fictional you can say a real person
or a fake person I would like to suggest
zyburg from futurama why not I think why
not zoidberg and also I think of
learning learning some science from
Zoidberg good pretty amazing or
completely wrong or awful yeah I could
go Terry with humans I don't understand
dude I'm terrible i can't do I think JK
Simmons would be pretty good i like yeah
that's a good one too are you Russian
yelling your dragon track you just
actually how about Tony Stark Tony Stark
when you're just Robert Downey jr. cuz
Robert just Tony Stark just have to show
up that would be amazing so I guess
that's our hashtag of the day yeah TD
prize so titty prize tell us who you
would you'd want to be in this mentor
like who'd you would want to be mentored
by fictional or real actually real dead
or alive at our lives ok I have anything
anything you want to I really would say
well Disney I know this sounds so like
that sounds corny I don't know I but I'm
on evolve Walt Disney I love his like
anytime he would like it when he was
Disneyland he would sit down with the
people they're doing construction any
but like stop doing construction let's
go to sit down and have an orange juice
and he'd find out all the information
about what they were doing and then make
suggestions even if they were wrong and
they and then like he would I love it
it's such a great way to mentors to like
learn yourself but also yeah I know it's
very true and so I think this is such a
cool contest I really wanted to talk
about it today you can go over to X
PRIZE challenge org that has all the
details or contest rules all that stuff
contest is happening right now but you
have plenty of time to enter the contest
ends May seventeenth so you have time a
lot of our viewers some of our viewers
have kids yeah what are you like perfect
get your kids involved get your kids
involved just hope that like it inspire
they get to do whatever they want you
predict the future yeah they can predict
the future it's it sounds really fun
it's something I would have entered when
I if I was that age like my kid won't
win super into that Mike it would win
totally start Mary kids and stop your
kids your kids wouldn't have a chance
yeah but I don't have a kid so your
kiddo now you have a chance you're
welcome you're welcome everybody drunk a
little Timmy all right on that no we're
gonna take a quick break we'll be right
back with a really weird back at her
hackett that might help you wake up in
the morning a little bit better and it's
a new take on alarm clock and of course
your user feedback and our phone talk
for the day so don't click away it's
tomorrow daily
one of the maxim to show everybody we've
returned uh I got a gripe and I I mean
this not with you let our style but I
have a gripe with my husband so that's
our style yes sir I'm gonna complain a
little bit about my home life so in the
mornings my husband usually wakes up
about an hour before i do his alarm goes
off he hits the snooze button and then
lets it go off again and then he hits
the snooze button again and then he gets
up but i get woken up because this
stupid phone is like going but it didn't
really do like it's ridiculous and it
makes me very annoyed and this morning
he left his phone liked and didn't like
shut off the alarm yeah so i had to
listen to it go off for about 10 minutes
before i had to search the house and
hunt it down and shut it this is a true
story i had to hunt down that phone and
shut off the alarm which made me very
mad cuz i was asleep okay so that's
probs a home so that brings us to back
at her happy I promise this is all
relevant so uh this is called wakey its
wake with a long e so wakey is this
really weird but kind of awesome looking
alarm clock it's not really an alarm
clock scaring me can I just serve an
alarm system yeah I heard Ezra hair
lucero labs makes this uh this is the
thing that you mount on your ceiling
that's what I look like every morning oh
my god that's me we just slam the pill
on my face like I hate everything that's
wakey it's a little box you mount it on
your ceiling right there and what it
does is it silently rotates towards your
face and when your alarm is supposed to
go off it shines warm LED light on you
as if a sunrise is happening in your
face but but not too intense and then
also sends a very specific sound wave
directly at you it's directed at you so
the person next to you cannot hear it so
it heats you up to it looks like now it
tracks you your body positioning based
on your body heat it's an IR sensor
there's an IR sensor on the inside and
it tracks exactly where you are and it
shines a little light in your face it's
like look at sunrise get up your body is
supposed to like wake up better
with sunrise rightfully exactly it till
it helps your circadian rhythms and all
that other stuff um okay so all right
don't wage no age alarm clock no camera
in there so you don't have to worry
about some weirdo hacking into your
Wi-Fi or whatever and like watching you
like those weird baby monitor hackers
like you've seen those stories so yeah
that's really creepy but um so and yeah
you and getting out of bed just shut it
off so the second you get up and it
notices you're not there it's it shuts
off that's done okay so that's how it
works directed sound gotcha targeted
audio right simulated sunrise right in
your face okay what are we what are we
looking at here ok it's $249 it's a
little pricey yeah however you only need
to charge it a few times a year so it
you don't have to like plugging in every
night it would be ridiculous because
you're mounting it on your ceiling be
insane um they want a hundred thousand
dollars they're about halfway there a
little under half way marseille they're
like between 45 and 50 thousand right
now and they have 53 days to go um but
this is kind of the cool thing about
wakey is that they're hoping that in the
future wakie would be expanded in the
sense that they could use this as sort
of a hub of home automation so when you
get up in the morning waking recognizes
you've gotten out of bed and it sends a
message to your smart coffee maker and
it says hey somebody's out bed they're
gonna need caffeine soon in your then
your machine starts making coffee or
maybe the temperature goes up in your
house because you're just describing the
internet you're getting in a bed yeah
it's like the inner thing so they want
to be a part of they want to be kind of
a hub of the internet of things in your
house I wish they'd just started with
that that would be really cool so that
was they don't have that as a
functionality yet but they're saying
that's where they would like to go with
wakey if they can get this funding and
continue developing it they're raised
here in LA we should ask him for a demo
I like that I like the Internet of
Things it's like I will I like the the
alarm thing like I do enjoy that but
even more so i think i'm with you like
I'm more excited about the Internet of
Things part but I also Mike will do I
want to back it now in the hopes that
that will happen cuz it's not a
guarantee I feel like I've seen this
technology before the like light up
thing a friend of mine told me about it
when I was in high school there was an
alarm clock type of thing I think
there's
I think there's even one kind of on
thinkgeek but not to the not to the
degree of it turning and not to bring it
right now you sound like none of that
stuff um I like the internet of things
like I wish you all right now tell me
about that cuz now I want that and
there's like an app that basically like
so you can you know you'll be able to
sort of you can snooze it if you need a
snooze button you just see you back it
for how much 250 250 and then you get it
September of this year that's their
target delivery day to September of this
year so this one is at I'm not I'm not
someone who has a problem getting up so
this is gonna be like on shark tank if
you've ever watched charging all right
they go look it's nothing against your
product this is just the way I do my
business and I don't know enough about
your business to back you up so I'm
gonna say no all right kills kills a
morning person you can get up in the
morning I just need to put on a song and
it goes off and I go I gotta get my
stupid bump a butt up so I gotta get up
perhaps so i would say that for my own
personal use i would not need this
because i tend to be a morning person
and can get up immediately when my alarm
goes off but being that this is the day
in the morning where i was very annoyed
by my husband's alarm this morning i was
very into this and was like I will pay
any price did never have to hear that
stupid alarm again yeah I think word of
mouth would really do this some good
like if I had a friend that was like
yeah you gotta check this thing yeah you
gotta try you got shine some light on
your face we wake up so yeah it's like a
beautiful sunrise alright well ya know I
think I see this if they start
connecting it to start it'd be pretty
good like if you had it to like your
nest thermostat where its senses hey
like somebody's getting out of bed like
please turn the temperature up in the
house like 78 or whatever you've seen
have you seen the episode of black
mirror for the holiday the Christmas
episode this is very similar to that too
okay I gotta watch that but yeah that's
uh that's it really wakey so its wake
it's the word wake but with a long e if
has a line over the day yeah let us know
what you think on it too I'm really
curious so that being said people
letting us know what they think it's
time for your feedback
last week we asked you guys to tell us
what you thought about ya are you what's
going on your husband's on the phone
he's very upset she's very mad and tired
is he crying yeah he's crying alright
I'll have to call you back okay all
right i'll see you on star citizen by
I'll overtax universe soon um oh yeah we
did we asked about the dash button okay
first of all we mentioned pizza a
one-button Pete's ordering I can't tell
you how many of you guys sent us a link
to this website which is like one button
pizza ordering you just click it's thank
you I really appreciate that but I was
talking about button you take with you
all the time looking you don't have need
a computer oh it just shows up Scott GPS
tracker in it pizza just shows up where
you are I don't want that um so I'm
taking it a step further yeah uh we
asked you guys about TD dad amazon dash
buttons how would you use them how would
you use them a lot of you guys said
pretty much the exact same thing it was
kind of amazing tons of responses all
pretty much said the same thing except
for except for two people what they say
Neil said what is the point of these
buttons if we're all gonna be too fat to
get up and use them I hate this hashtag
extremely lazy okay now we get into the
people who all said the same thing and
I'm not joking there were more of you
but I just picked like 30 should
Nicholas says toilet paper it would be
perfect with an Amazon drone delivery
when you're sitting there noticing the
obvious plus a GPS they'll be cool guys
right in your window Justin wrote in
said I honestly need a toilet paper
button because my evil cat Snooki and
Gaga love destroying my toilet paper
okay good North it because this is a cat
problems is not a bathroom issue rather
have problems uh and then Shannon wrote
in said TP cuz no one wants to run out
LOL we have an epidemic here people
California is running out of water and
everyone's running out of toilet paper
Syrian need to go to Mars right now and
solve this is office so there you go
toilet paper was like the nut literally
if it was family feud 98 people what is
that toilet paper out of a hundred it
was incredible I'm glad it was unanimous
though pretty I didn't see that I didn't
see that on the on there amazon list of
things so no that wasn't one of the
buttons which I was kind of shocked by
bounty the paper towels not toilet paper
we're Charmin where's quilted northern
continent use bounty to
no se very coarse um Chris wrote in to
us lastly and said hey gang the Amazon
dash button seemed mildly convenient if
at all I feel it that if these buttons
are a poor use of plastic wireless
radios and batteries if my smartphone or
computer is easily capable of ordering
on amazon than the dash buttons just add
another layer of complexity amazon dash
the Rube Goldberg machine of easy on
light order so he had a he had some
other stuff to you about status Sega CD
and all that stuff but that was the that
was the gist it's a branding thing it's
really what it is it's not it's not an
evolution it's a branding thing they're
like hey tide you can people just order
time in order no I you know I'm I wasn't
excited about it was looking seem like
an April Fool's joke because it's kind
of stupid cuz it's a little weird and
well I mean I get the one where it's
like we're not usually negative but
we're analytical weird uh but I mean I
get it where it's like okay coffee in an
office environment but even then it's
like you have one person that usually
does that ordering the secretary usually
does it so somebody does ordering jaw
the secretary yeah we're out of coffee
does seem a little off or is it that's
her job that they hire us to do like
that sort of like Nene office work I
agree i think i think if you could tell
him sorry maybe take it with you and you
click on something like i said
customizable buttons would be good or
like you know i like GN gps tracking so
basically it's like it knows where you
are without having to like and it could
just a drone this finds you I think that
drone is the missing piece of that
equation yeah like if you click on it
you're like oh my god I need a lightning
cable for my iphone i forgot it and you
click on it and you like tell what
Amazon echo you talking to as a little
microphone you I need a lightning cable
and then it just charges your Amazon
account it like reads your voice
algorithm knows it's you charges your
account and the little drone comes like
10 minutes later brings you your cable
and flies away that's that's the future
that's what i want to see that's the
future for me that's lazy supervising
whatever that guy said look what if I'm
traveling and I don't know where what is
the best buy's nearest best buy's like
20 miles away like what if I don't know
where to I had that problem at pax self
I had to go like I had to take a sixty
dollar cab ride to buy a ten-dollar
square card reader cuz i forgot it at
home see that's that would have been
really useful amazon i knew that i'd
want some like I like there's a dot
there's a dog in Fallout and you just
tell it hey I need some more bullets and
it runs away
a and it comes back I just want to draw
and following me around oh I thought you
were gonna say I just want a dog that
can oh that's me i want a drone I'll be
like hey man I'm real hungry I need a
roast beef sandwich I'll even let you
know what no roast beef grilled cheese
then it flies away and it just brings
back the grilled cheese I like it that's
the future that's the pinnacle that's
that's the thing I think we need um are
you ready for our phone tired for the
day oh alright let's do it gotta gotta
phone tog refer from China come on hear
about it this is from weiwei says hello
