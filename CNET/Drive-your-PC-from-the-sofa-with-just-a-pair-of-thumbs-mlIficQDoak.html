their main living room home theater
setup but maybe they should it's a great
way to get high-end PC gaming on a big
screen it makes it easy to stream a lot
of content and of course it's the best
way to set up virtual reality in a big
living room space
but the problem has always been how do
you drive that computer whether it's a
mini desktop or big gaming Tower you can
get a standard wireless keyboard and put
it on your lap or I've tried a
gyroscopic mice nothing really works
that seamlessly that's why I really like
the idea of the Lenovo 500 it's a
multimedia control that looks like a
combination of a tiny PC keyboard and an
oversized old-fashioned blackberry
keyboard the big difference between this
and other wireless keyboards is that
it's the standard QWERTY keyboard but
the entire surface doubles as a touchpad
there's no separate touchpad how does it
work but you click down on the keys to
type as you normally would but then you
just swipe your finger over the actual
keys without pressing down of them to
use the touchpad you know it's small
enough you can hold it in both hands and
your thumb should be able to reach all
the keys while you're typing and then
you can use one finger for a standard
Mouse input use 2 fingers as a tap for a
right-click as opposed to a left-click
and then you can even do 2 and 3 finger
gestures like scrolling it feels it
works very much like a traditional
touchpad you just have to get used to
the feeling of the raised keys under
your finger there's a little curve on
the back to make it easier to pick up
from a flat surface like a coffee table
and they say it should work from about
65 feet away it's a clever idea that
addresses a problem that today does not
have a definitive solution touch
painting by swiping over the keyboard
it's a little hard to get used to but I
got better at it the more I tried so I'm
looking forward to testing this out some
more
the Lenovo 500 it's expected in March
for $54 in the US
