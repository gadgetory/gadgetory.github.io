Bakalar filling in for Bridget Carey
this is your cnet active so what did
facebook by this week you're not going
to believe it when I tell you but the
company acquired oculus makers of the
virtual reality prototype the oculus
rift that's right Facebook just spent
two billion dollars on an 18 month old
company that sells absolutely nothing
and has never made a dime so why do they
buy it are they just trying to make
those Instagram guys feel even worse all
right as much fun as it is to laugh at
the situation it actually opens up a
huge discussion just what exactly
Facebook is going to do with the VR
company after the news went public Mark
Zuckerberg said that Facebook plans to
extend the rifts applications beyond
just gaming which in my opinion is
probably the best use for the rift out
of the gate I've actually tried out a
few times and while it's very cool in a
gaming environment I'd much rather use
it to do things i'll never do like visit
the top of Mount Everest or fly over the
Grand Canyon Zuckerberg also said that
while mobile is the platform of today
this acquisition prepares them for
platforms of the future Wow well all I
can say is if you haven't already read
ready player one now is the time xbox
one owners will be excited to hear that
a few new streaming apps are making
their way to the platform just in time
for opening day MLB TV will offer live
HD out-of-market games delivered right
to your xbox one though of course you'll
need an xbox live gold account and an
MLB TV subscription also on the list of
apps is epics which is a cable TV
premium network which mostly offers
on-demand movies just over a year after
they announced 100 million users
photo-sharing service Instagram says 200
million people now use the app to post
photos of their food make friends
jealous of their vacations and through
the use of filters ensure will be
confusing future generations as to just
when in time all of these photos were
actually taken sure the HTC One m8 made
big headlines yesterday
but one of the coolest features of the
new phone mostly went under the radar
available exclusively for the m8 is what
HTC is calling a dot view protective
case which actually sits on top of the
phone screen and allows light to pass
through a perforated front in action it
gives off a very cool sort of retro
dot-matrix effect and displays
information like the volume time weather
and even caller ID that case is going to
set you back fifty dollars and that's
