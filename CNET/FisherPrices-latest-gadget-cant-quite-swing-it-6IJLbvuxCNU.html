be a new parent who's kind of just at
the whims of a teething child so I'm a
strong believer that every parent should
get some kind of seat or rocker or
sleeper or something that helps relieve
them when they really need it the
question is which one should you buy
fisher-price answers that question with
a product that can pretty much be all of
them the fisher-price smart Connect four
and one cradle and swing the problem is
this thing costs 200 bucks and it's a
monster of a device I mean I live in a
pretty small apartment and this thing
takes up practically half my living room
the coolest feature of the cradle and
swing is that it can function both as a
cradle and as a swing you've also got
this really cool mobile here that moves
as it swings and also lights up it's got
music ambient noise and app control but
despite this thing's four in one nature
I actually still want it to do more I
mean I've worked with fisher-price
products in the past that cost half what
this thing does and feel like they're as
feature-rich or maybe even more so now
this thing swings but if I take the
rocker off and just rock it on its own I
have to do the rocking and I know what
you're saying why are you complaining
about rocking your son to sleep but the
thing is if I'm gonna dish out 200 bucks
for this device I want the rocker to be
able to rock itself so I can go and do
some dishes the fisher-price cradle and
swing is a really good product and it
could relieve a lot of parents but it's
definitely not for everyone especially
not for those who have tighter budgets
or smaller living spaces</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
