bowing inspiration from other companies
and this year was more clear than ever
at the latest Developers Conference
first we have apples photo app which
will now organize all your photos into
albums based on date location sub J
sound familiar that's because everything
from the facial recognition features to
the cheesy theme songs on the movie
montages were basically a repeat of last
year's Google photo presentation but
there is one key difference that may
actually give Apple the upper hand and
in this case it's privacy who will
resorts to the cloud to help you
organize photos whereas Apple does it
locally next we have apple maps trying
to take on google maps yet again face it
guys it's never gonna happen in another
case of ketchup Apple maps finally gets
live traffic information and nearby
stops like gas stations on your route
necessary updates but definitely not
enough to pry users away from using
google maps or ways the silver lining
Apple did open up its maps to developers
meaning we could order an uber or book a
restaurant reservation without leaving
the app but again it's ketchup Siri on
max seems like a no-brainer but for some
reason we've had to wait years for this
one to happen an apple finally delivered
on a personal assistant for your
computer in Sierra its latest version of
Mac OS where a list of things Siri will
be able to do on your computer just take
a look at what Cortana does on Windows
10 because it's basically the same
launch programs conduct searches on your
computer or online set up appointments
and play some tunes
and last but not least we have I message
where do I even start after a 30-minute
presentation I'm now convinced that I
message is going through somewhat of an
identity crisis it went from being clean
and simple peer-to-peer communication
app to a bad blend of facebook Messenger
we chat and a low bigger chat bubbles
and emojis like the whisper shout
function we make fun of on a low
scribbles to text doodles can't
contextual responses and stickers galore
like well every other chat app out there
the standouts here were peer-to-peer
payments and inline videos but they
weren't exactly novel either but wait
you can now send your heart beat like on
the Apple watch that's one for the
history books</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
