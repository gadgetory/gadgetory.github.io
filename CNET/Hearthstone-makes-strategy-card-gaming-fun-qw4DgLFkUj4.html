fun and a little bit nerdy Carstone from
Blizzard is not a new game but with
continuous major updates it's still
fresh her stone is a strategy card game
where you build custom car decks full of
minions spells and skill cards to help
you whittle your opponent's hit points
down to zero you can play as several
different classes and all are based on
characters from blizzards MMO world of
warcraft here on the game board your
Delta card at the beginning of each term
then you use your available mana
crystals to play them on the table each
card has a mana cost in the upper left
attack power in the lower left and
health points in the lower right so
here's how it works when I use my card
that has 6 attack power and 7 health
points and I tech his card that has four
attack power and to health points his
card is destroyed however I still take
damage because his for attack power
subtracts for my 7 health points leaving
me with only three with each turn you
get an extra mana crystal so later in
the game you'll have a lot more cards on
the board and you'll be able to lay down
some really powerful ones for example
when i use flame strike which is one of
my favorite cards it takes four hit
points off of all of his minions even
when you're down there's always the
possibility to get the perfect card for
a big comeback for example with this
poly Marse card I can attack his
powerful troll only to turn him into a
weak one attack our one hit point sheep
finally when you're able to break
through your opponent's defenses and
bring his hit points to zero you win the
game hearthstone is one of the deepest
casual games that I've played on the
iPad it has daily quests that help you
earn coins it has ranked and casual
multiplayer and it even has two
expansion packs so far with probably
more to come and each expansion pack has
a ton of cards which gives you more ways
to play more ways to have fun with the
game even if you don't spend any real
money there's still a ton of content in
this game and you're definitely going to
have fun
