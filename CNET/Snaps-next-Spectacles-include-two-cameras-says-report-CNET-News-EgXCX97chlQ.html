spectacles maybe coming later this year
according to a report from cheddar
that's right we're talking about these
spectacles the sunglasses with the
camera inside that left the company with
a 40 million dollar loss because there
were hundreds of thousands of glasses
that the company could not sell because
it overestimated demand it seems the
company has not given up the dream of
putting cameras on your face the cheddar
streaming network broke the news with
sources saying that this second version
would be shipped in the fall it is said
to be water-resistant and available in
new colors and have general improved
performance but that's not the best part
cheddar also reports that there are
plans to make a third version of
spectacles for 2019 and this could have
two cameras one on each side and GPS
there's a prototype design that has a
more circular lens frame and the dual
camera could allow for 3d depth effects
and videos now spectacles right now cost
$130 but the double camera model may
more than double the price possibly
costing $300 now there has been no
official comment from snap about this
but right now Apple Facebook and
practically every major tech company has
been looking into testing augmented
reality and how it can be incorporated
into eyewear the current model of
spectacles records short video clips and
sends it to the snapchat app that's all
you can do with the glasses released in
2016 these glasses were a surprise hit
when they came out you could only get
them at select pop-up vending machines
that would only be in one location for a
limited time people would wait hours in
line just to get one but that hype and
scarcity did not last long turns out
people stopped to using the glasses
after a few weeks the charm were off and
snap how to find a way to unload all
these extra glasses just this past year

could a new pair of spectacles get
people excited about the technology
again or have we moved on from wearing
cameras on our face let us know in the
comments I'm Bridget Carey and you can
