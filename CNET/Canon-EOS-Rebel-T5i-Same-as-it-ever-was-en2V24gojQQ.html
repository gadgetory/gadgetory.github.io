identical to its predecessor the t4i
Canon updated the camera pretty much to
be able to ship with the newer 18 to 55
millimeter STM lens that's optimized for
video and autofocus and is lots cheaper
than the 18 to 135 millimeter version
that debuted with the system there's
some small enhancements it's got a new
finish and grip the mode dial now
rotates 360 degrees and there's an
additional scene mode and now you can do
real-time shooting with creative filters
and preview them in live view oddly I
also found the buffer handling much
better during continuous shooting for
improved burst performance
so really the t5 is an upgrade over the
t4i it's just a replacement in the
product line well very lightweight I
still find the rebel body a little
plastic you feeling but can it's slowly
working out the design kinks the 360
degree mode dial rotation is nice
although with the movie mode on the
power switch it's not as critical as it
used to be and more I use the touch
screen than where I like it it's very
responsive and the interface is well
designed especially for shooting video
on the other hand I still really hate
the tiny autofocus points in the
viewfinder you can't see them until you
pre focus at which point realized that
you're looking too high or too low Nikon
switched to AF areas for the d50 200 now
it's your turn Canon also I'm still not
crazy about the flat buttons the camera
tends to disappoint on the features
front as well it's got the basics you'd
expect from a $700 body blacks a lot of
modern options like GPS or Wireless it's
also missing interesting traditional
features like time-lapse multiple
exposure and intervalometer the
performance is about the same as the t4i
but I found it could maintain a fast
clip at bursts shooting this go-round
compared to the t4 eyes slowdown after
just a few shots contrast autofocus with
the 18 to 55 millimeter STM lens seems
only to be marginally faster than the
standard 18 to 55 millimeter lens
and with improvements in competitors
contrast AF systems cannons special lens
requirements starting to look even less
appealing a lot of people are happy with
the t4i
this is pretty much the same camera I'll
be it with the cheaper kit entry price
point it's a good option but so is the
d50 200 and I actually think that the
g52 hundreds video is a little better on
the other hand I think the t5i has a
better shooting interface for video I'm
Laurie grinning and this is the Canon
EOS Rebel t5i</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
