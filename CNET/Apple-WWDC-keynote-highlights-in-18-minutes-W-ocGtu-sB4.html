called measure makes it really easy to
measure objects detect rectangles and
get their dimensions measure lines along
surfaces and I'd like to show it to you
now
now I'm actually in the the measure app
you see I can easily measure along this
suitcase by just tapping and dragging
out a line like that and check that out
it's a measurement now what's really
cool is I can extend these measurements
so I can just tap drag along another
edge just like that and even take it
into full 3d by dragging down to the
bottom like that so have a photo here
actually it's one my mom always wanted
me to travel with of me as a baby and so
you see what I can do with measure is it
automatically detects the dimensions of
that photo I can just tap and get a cute
little baby was I and you can get
measurements just like that it's really
fantastic with 3d object detection we
get to recognize our models and bring
them to life
and just look at all of those rich
details we can now bring into our sense
because when we combine physical and
digital together like this it really
opens up those creative play
possibilities and there's so much to do
here if you see these icons above people
and objects while they represent
missions and stories that we can explore
and with the world as rich and is
immersive as this who wouldn't want to
play so let's add a character how about
this little guy here welcome back let's
go on an adventure because now with a
our kid too we get to see inside our
physical creations and check out all the
details that were hidden before that a
ballerina little music session going on
and it looks like a bathroom sorry
moving on oh another play trigger in the
bakery let's see what happens when I
click on this oh that doesn't look too
good search has powerful object and
scene recognition lets you search for
photos based on things like searching
for cars or dogs or flowers and that's a
great way to explore your library but in
iOS 12 search now starts working for you
even before you start typing with search
suggestions it'll highlight things for
you like key moments and people that are
important to you places where you've
taken some great photos and even
categories of photos like hiking and
water sports and now in iOS 12 we have
an all new tab it's called for you and
with for you you have all of your
memories those great memory movies but
more like featured photos highlighting a
photo that you took on this day in past
years well afterwards and for you you'll
see a suggestion like this to share
those photos you tap in you'll see that
photos is even recommending a set of
photos that from that set that you might
want to share and suggest who you might
want to share them with based in part by
the people that appeared in the photos
when your friend receives them something
really magical happens there phone
searches their libraries for other
photos they took at that event and
suggests that they share them back to
you so you both can end up with the full
set I am so stoked to show you Siri
shortcuts to do that I'm gonna walk you
through my day so imagine it's the
morning I'm headed to work and I pick up
my phone and I see this suggestion from
Phil's coffee theory has learned that I
do this most mornings so now I can just
tap on the suggestion and I see all the
details I need to confirm my perfect
mint mojito right here on the lock
screen without even going into the app
so let's get caffeinated and I'm done I
also want to show you how you can add a
shortcut to Siri so let's take a look at
kayak I keep all of my travel details in
kayak most important is my post-up WC
relaxation trip to Los Angeles you can
see I have got my flight my hotel all
the details everything I need but what I
really want is to be able to use this
and get to this information with my
voice while I'm on the go so let's head
back and I can just tap add to Siri
record my custom phrase travel plans and
I am done so now when I land at the
airport and I'm about to get in the cab
and I could really use that hotel
address I can just say travel plans
kayak says your hotel is at 929 South
Broadway you can check in after 3 p.m.
is that cool
there are times of the day or times when
you just don't want to be disturbed and
one of those of course is it night
sometimes you wake up in the middle of
the night and you look at your phone
maybe just to check the time and you're
confronted with something like this
barrage of notifications that spin you
up and keep you from falling back asleep
and so we're introducing do not disturb
during bedtime where all you'll see is
this nothing to get you spun up and in
the morning yeah
in the morning when you wake up you're
gently eased into your day you can tap
when you want to start confronting those
notifications now we've all found
ourselves in situations like this
now rest assured he stuck the landing on
this one but now do not disturb can help
and we made it easier than ever to use
do not disturb because now we have a
great new mode where when you press into
do not disturb in control center you can
set an ending time for do not disturb
for when you leave a particular location
or when an event ends on your calendar
so I think we're all gonna be using do
not disturb a bunch more notifications
our group not just by app but also by
topic and thread gives you a great
overview of the notifications you've
received you can tap in and look at a
particular group of course just as
important with a single swipe you can
triage a whole group of notifications
away
so that's notifications
in addition to these great features for
helping you limit distractions we wanted
to go further and it's with a feature we
call screen time screen time empowers
you with both insight and control over
how you spend your time and it starts
with reports every week you get a weekly
activity summary the details how you
used your iPhone or iPad you tap in and
you get to view your full activity
report it's really detailed you get deep
insight on how much time you're spending
where you're spending it and even how
your use breaks down during the day or
the night you get a summary of the time
you're spending in apps how much time
you're spending how often per hour
you're picking up your phone and what's
drawing you in and what apps are sending
you the most notifications now equipped
with this insight you can make decisions
about how much time you want to spend
with your device each day we want them
to take an emoji even further by making
them even more personal so I'm thrilled
today to announce the arrival of the era
of me emoji these an emoji can look like
you or the real you
and we've worked hard to build a deep
set of customization options to let our
customers create an incredibly diverse
set of momochi let me show you just how
easy it is
I recently chopped my hair so I want one
that matches the new meme so I've
selected a skin color and now I'm trying
to figure out just the right amount of
freckles so real Goldilocks scenario
okay on to the main event there are so
many hairstyles to choose from
first I'm gonna grab my color and then
like I said I need to go a little bit
shorter and what's really amazing is as
I'm making changes the character up
above is coming to life I think for our
first live demo of group face time I'm
going to contact the folks back in
Cupertino now I can just dive in to this
conversation I have going with the
members of the FaceTime team and it
looks like actually they're already on a
group FaceTime call so I'm just gonna
join right in hey everybody let's check
it out so it's this beautiful FaceTime
UI we have these big gorgeous tiles
right up front where you see some of the
leaders of the FaceTime team and down at
the bottom there's an area we call the
roster that contains everybody else and
of course I'm right there in the lower
right hand corner yes Lauren this is not
a test now what you probably noticed is
when Lauren spoke her tile automatically
got larger to reflect her prominence in
the conversation this is totally
automatic hey Roberto how's it going
back there in Cupertino it's going
pretty well
and Lauren sorry for stealing your
spotlight so this works of course for
people in the roster as well when they
speak they come forward hey Christopher
you ready to make your big entrance
hello world
now we have not only all of this what
we've also brought the fun effects to
the FaceTime camera I can just tap in
and I have access to an emoji filters
and all of my sticker packs and everyone
else on the call can apply them to hey
Tim is that you yeah it's me I signed up
to help test FaceTime well thank you Tim
every little bit counts happy to help
and thanks to everyone on the FaceTime
team for making it a reality I can't
wait to start using it every Sunday
night to call the leadership team did
you steal my chips baby I can not wait
until you go to college introducing
walkie talkie
this is a new app on Apple watch it's a
fun easy way to talk with friends and
family let's take a look at how it works
first you choose you'd like to enable
walkie talkie with and it suggests some
people that you often communicate with
so get easily add them now the first
time that you do this your friend will
receive a one-time request to allow a
walkie talkie connection with you if the
if they accept then you can speak to
each other with walkie talkie whenever
you like
and to do this you just press to talk
and then your friend can hear your voice
just like a walkie talkie and they're
gonna feel a haptic hear a beep beep
sound right before your voice comes out
and this new watch to watch a connection
works over cellular or Wi-Fi it has
really high audio quality and it's a lot
of fun we can't wait for you to try this
out that's walkie talkie and you heard
Kevin say hat walkie talkie is so great
for staying in touch with close friends
and family
so I set my daughter up with walkie
talkie so that she can help demo what
it's like to receive one and maybe give
me a little bit of love up here oh there
she is
isn't that fun how am i doing so good I
know you'll beat uncle Jay hashtag mommy
for the win big speech I love you we're
making some great enhancements to the
Siri watch face now first we're adding
new content so now you can get live
sports scores you can get commute time
home or to work or you can see your
heart rate for example after a workout
or your resting heart rate and we're
also adding series shortcuts those
shortcuts you saw coming to iOS 12 are
also going to be available in watch OS
so in addition to getting relevant
information you'll also receive
predicted shortcuts right on the Siri
watch face and when you think about this
it's quite a strong signal when you
raise your wrist and talk to your watch
it's kind of like when someone's
standing right in front of you you don't
need to say hey because you have their
attention already so we're bringing this
same social cue to Siri on the watch so
you no longer need to say hey Siri you
just raise your wrist and talk to Siri
TV 4k is bringing you the latest in
audio technology
with Atmos you get room filling sound
the perfect complement to the stunning
visuals of Apple TV 4k now it makes
Atmos so special is that unlike a
traditional surround sound set up where
sound is assigned to channels like the
left or the right Dolby Atmos has the
ability to completely immerse you at
most moves sound in three-dimensional
space creating an experience with
powerful audio that flows all around you
and just like with 4k HDR your iTunes
libraries will be upgraded to include
dolby atmos on all supported titles for
free our next release of Mac OS is mac
OS mojave so here we are live in Mac OS
Mojave and I'd like to show you a new
side of Mojave we call it dark mode dark
mode is not just about the dock or the
menu bar it extends to your windows
chrome your sidebar and even the content
of the windows and it's so great for
prose it makes photographic content
absolutely pop off the screen and this
is great not just for photography but
when working on presentations or
documents it's also great doing ordinary
things if maybe you're working in a dark
environment you just look at calendar
even mail in dark mode so great and I
think some of us are gonna want them on
dark mode just cuz it's so cool I mean
your emoji look great your photos look
great I mean check out your album art
and music but I think one audience
that's going to especially appreciate
dark mode or some of you here in this
room are developers because Xcode that's
fantastic that's a quick look at dark
mode all of the contents of your desktop
are automatically arranged into these
stacks and it can be arranged by kind by
date or even by tag and they're really
easy to use you just click on them you
can see all the contents in the stack
can double-click to open a document
and put it away and they stay organized
so for instance if I bring forward mail
maybe I drag an image out I want you to
watch what happens because the image
flies right into the right stack now you
can also scrub your stacks so for
instance I'll just scrub across this
stack you see I can select between
different photos pick one up actually
let me just hide mail here mid drag got
a little excited with my with all of my
stack action so I can just drag this out
and drop it in just like that and that's
a quick look at stacks so we've
redesigned an all-new Mac App Store from
the ground up and we're thrilled to show
it to you now it's got a beautiful UI
that should feel familiar but new and
designed first and foremost to be a
great Mac app starting with the new
discover tab where each week you can
find in-depth editorial about the best
Mac apps here's the create tab where you
can find apps that bring your artistic
ideas to life these tabs will also help
you make the most of apps you might
already have with tips and tutorials
even the most expert users will find
useful the work play and develop tabs
share the same beautiful design and you
can still browse by category on the
categories tab we've redesigned product
pages to bring many features over from
iOS based on our learnings there it has
more useful information like video
previews available on the Mac App Store
for the first time an apps rank if it's
charting and if it's been named editor's
choice ratings and reviews are now front
and center and these are so important
for app discovery so we're introducing a
ratings and review API for Mac apps now
it'll be easier than ever for people to
leave feedback</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
