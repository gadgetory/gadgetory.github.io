m3 but it's not just a bmw m3 this is
probably the world's most expensive
GoPro remote control now as you've
probably seen some other manufacturers
have started integrating cameras into
their cars so if you're the sort who
goes on the tractor you can some
high-definition footage of your on track
antics rather than doing that BMW
decided they partner up with one of the
leading action camera manufacturers out
there GoPro and integrate the
functionality of the GoPro into the car
so that you can control the camera that
you might already have now if you're
familiar with the GoPro app it allows
you to make some changes to the camera
you can make sure it's point in their
direction most importantly but you can
also change exposure settings and things
like that when you connect the phone to
your car it disables the screen like
other BMW connected apps so that you can
basically just put it in the glove box
and control your camera through the
dashboard of the car now I'm gonna go
into the connected drive section here
and in here down in the BMW apps section
we have a GoPro option select that we
get a live view of the camera which
right now is mounted on the back of the
car pointing backwards I can go down
here to the settings and while I can't
get into the details sort of setting
that you can get through the app I can't
change the exposure I can't change the
white balance it's easier actually to
change through some presets here so we
can get leisure Drive facing out night
driving sport drive facing out even
Drive camera facing in if you're looking
to make an automotive selfie of sorts
when you're ready to go you go up here
and you select the record button and it
starts recording now the camera cannot
send a live feed while it's recording so
at that point the camera gets disabled
but you can review your footage
afterward on here which is pretty sweet
now of course the best place to capture
some footage from a GoPro on a car is on
a racetrack and wouldn't you know what
we happen to be at a racetrack today
the hill
20
very
1:47
are down into the first quarter here
a little tighter I gotta get out of here
was going to be too
all right come on straight
I am suddenly creating scenes on 30
140
now we've been distracted to see if the
curving so I'm doing exactly that
somebody earlier stuff to cover the wall
on this corner is somebody take a little
easy doing they're here
alright time for the carousel which is a
long neck stretcher about 75 80 miles an
hour fine
all right in the king
a lot of time backs the wall here and I
don't want to make another one so also
gonna take anything through there but
here we go foot the floor again once it
again 120 30
around

there we go different straight again
it's a lamp
my greatest tracts
