everything Google we can pack inside of
a show now we've heard about Google's
prototype smart contact lens that can
measure glucose levels for people with
diabetes it still hasn't hit the market
but Google is not stopping there a new
patent filing by the big G reveals
they're working on a vision correcting
electronic device that needs to be
injected directly into your eye that's
right your eyeball now the device would
be injected in fluid and then solidifies
once it's in the eye the goal is to cure
shortsightedness by removing someone's
inferior biological lens and replacing
it with a motorized one the new
electronic lens would help in the
process of focusing light on the eyes
retina now the device will have storage
sensors a radio battery and electronic
lens and it gets power wirelessly from
an energy harvesting antenna crazy now
it's all fascinating stuff and we'll be
following this to see if this pan ever
really becomes a reality it's not nearly
as impressive but still impressive new
tech from LG is bringing a display panel
with an integrated fingerprint reader
that means no more physical buttons for
a fingerprint scanner LG subsidiary
Innotech has developed the under glass
fingerprint module and claims the
scanner only adds 0.3 millimeters to the
panel's overall thickness the new panel
is reportedly ready to start production
as early as this year and LG is already
in talks with handset manufacturers to
have them commercially ready within the
year all right Google keyboard 5.0 for
Android gets a major upgrade with design
tweaks and new customizations a new
emoji and numbers button on the bottom
left will bring up the keyboards for
them quickly and a bar on the top of the
keyboard will now even suggest emojis
for you there's a new one-handed
keyboard option in the settings now for
either right or left hand operation and
you can even select between five
different keyboard Heights depending on
what you prefer and the update is
rolling out now to the Play Store also
YouTube is getting an all new material
design look and feel Android police
reports that the facelift is an a/b
testing but a new toolbar featuring the
search box is present across all YouTube
pages there's a hamburger menu on the
left side that slides out to view things
like your home
trending in history and the share button
is a pop-up box everything looks really
cleaned up here and it's a fresh and
modern look for YouTube and finally
ladies all five of you watching this
hopefully more if the SmartWatch designs
out there have done really nothing for
you because they aren't even trying to
appeal to you
Huawei is giving it a try with two new
variants of the Huawei watch called the
jewel and the elegant both models are
available now and bring you know a
little bling-bling style the elegant
starts at $4.99 and the jewel starts at
$5.99
