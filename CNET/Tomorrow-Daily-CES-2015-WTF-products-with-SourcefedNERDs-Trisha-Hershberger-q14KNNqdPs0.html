yesterdays I thank you guys are you guys
long I know and fortunately Jeff no Jeff
Bakalar were harmed in the making of
that last segment we don't know that yet
well I'm not sure where I haven't seen
him back in the booth yet but
fortunately I'm I've got my fingers
crossed as you can see we have a guest
yeah she just appeared we also 3d
printed but you might know her from
SourceFed nerd this is the one and only
trisha hershberger such a delight this
girl she's delightful and one of the
things that I always like that we talk
about every single year at CES
regardless of whether it's on this stage
or not it's all the WTF of CES and there
is a lot of it at the show so we picked
three of our favorites and were going to
talk about them Tricia give us a give us
a little tour a little taste of what
it's like to see the weirdest like most
I just don't understand but that okay
alright cool i love so much it's my
favorite thing about ces every year
because i feel like it's those WTF
products and those ideas that lead to
the next generation of major consumer
products like I mean there was someone
back in the day who was like a carriage
that doesn't need horses to like you
know it's the first car and they're like
bad we don't need horses for that that's
pointless nobody needs that my horse is
just fine like there was that person
gonna do ya do ya that's poppycock
that's probably different for every
product there's gonna be the people that
say you don't need that or that's too
expensive or whatever so I think that
the weird stuff is the future of
technology i mean everyone at CES always
talks about you know the big stuff the
tvs the wearables the auto tech but the
little startups are where it's at yeah
the sea is this is a foundation so yeah
and you found no shortage of them this
year right there's never a shortage of
WTF products here I mean when you walk
around especially like if you're at
eureka park when you walk around you
look at stuff and you're like that's a
little strange I don't know what that is
and I even saw some of it in central
hall this year too okay yeah well the
spider dress is over there we had it
here on skating
yesterday amazing we had it here on
stage and it almost poked out kills I
several times several sizes I told him
over and over again not to touch the
model and he wanted to just get a little
close don't touch the yeah yeah sure
dress sure the dress yeah you got a
little invasive that can happen I was
approxn to that yeah doesn't like that
but very cool 3d printed and it reacts
to the user so very cool yeah I was
looking in the future like you said it's
yeah that could be the future I mean it
reminds me of in school we used to get
these like I went to an all-girls
schools we used to got leaves like self
protection and date rape assemblies and
stuff and I'm like who needs that
information now you could just wear
spider dress to point out your dress
pretty good um so the other so one of
the other things that you mentioned was
that you saw that you thought was super
weird was the 10s fork and knife oh yeah
previously known as the happy for okay
for ya now it's got a little matching
knife friend so tell okay so you have to
explain this a little bit to me because
I know before it was like when you it
would it wants you i believe it's like
it wants you to lift your food and eat
it every 10 seconds yeah well it wants
you to be at least 10 seconds or slower
okay so the idea is that you're not
shoveling lettuce in your face like we
were talking about during the break fun
conversations that happen when the
cameras are off no it wants you to wait
10 seconds between every bite but the
first generation of it would actually
register as a bite when you stabbed food
too if you're like a violent you don't
really get I was doing it I was doing it
one alligator two I like that yeah we
have to mouse the number it's really
it's rough that's a long time advised RV
again it vibrates and lights up and the
idea is that before you eat every meal
you press the button to activate it and
and then you do your 10 second bites and
now it's paired with the fork so now you
can get the 10s for or I'm sorry the
knife so now you can get the 10s fork
and knife set does it make what why is
it nice though because you're not
raising that to your mouth so is it like
you saw your food in half for 10 seconds
looks like this way if you stab and the
knife is down there it doesn't recognize
the stab as a bite so it's more accurate
now a little bit more fancy it's I guess
it's been on sale in Europe but there
planning on bringing it to the states
and it's just hilarious to me it makes
the weird product list for me because
who brings the same utensils around with
them all day like our is it in your
purse why is it in your pocket are there
are their sanitation wipes for after
every meal so you can put it back and
save it for later guys I've got a fork
so when I use this you would you find
yourself sorry I mean I guess if I
really was concerned with my nutrition
intake um somebody you know so go with
no yeah not carrying that around or fork
and knife I mean I might just go old
fashioned and one alligator two
alligator three alligator it but like I
said there's the people that were like
I'm old-fashioned I'm gonna go with the
horse and buggy and you reject the car
you know what I'm in for the happy spork
oh that gonna happen I need that next
year um okay so do it right on your
welcome Internet you're welcome startups
so last thing that you wanted to talk
about is the log bar ring which I
haven't even heard of really I know that
are I believe CNN espanol got to go see
it okay but you please explain to me
what the log bar ring is ok so the la
guerre ring was a very successful
crowdfunding project raised over 800
thousand dollars a lot of money and it's
a ring that you put on that enables you
to control your surroundings via gesture
really neat idea so we think of the idea
and we're like I'm going to turn off all
these studio lights and they just turn
off good very very cool idea you know um
but in practice at least right now and
this is the product second generation
that's being shown at CES this year it's
still very big and bulky and so I don't
know how many people can legitimately
rock that unless you have like right now
and that is a pool key ring ibuki so
it's like that wouldn't really work for
it looks like almost like a broke three
of them right there you're very fragile
my she hulk strength what are some of
the things that they showed off that
they bragged about it being able to do
specifically specifically they talk
about turning off and on lights with
gesture and it's it's linked to an app
so that you can plan what jesters you
like so you can make up whatever
adjuster you want to do whatever thing
in your house that you want you could
turn off and on appliances off and on
lights just interact with your
surroundings and now they have a ring
hub that they sell as well so you don't
need to buy special lights or special
appliances it sends it out via infrared
do you think that I would be able to at
some point the future be able to shut
off with a way of kales bad puns may be
unstoppable maybe runs on nuclear power
I think I shut it off right yeah it's
not going to but yes so that the ring
itself you press a button you make a
gesture and it's a lil you'll see a
little crystal on the side of the ring
press press a button make a gesture and
it does its thing um but to me I think
how hard of a gesture is it to walk over
to the wall and just flip the light
switch I think that's my heart thing
about what my agent it's Wally we're
going back to the wall e generation you
just all sit in the chair just a cop
guys it's gonna happen medic I was
playing xbox and I could like restart my
dryer load by you know playing my game
and just doing like BAM and it did it
that means dryer wave your hand it has
all my dears to be like this yeah this
one justify everything so like doing
wrong stuff going off at ulta xbox turn
off no amazing but yeah the the product
is actually better now than it was
before before it was made out of zinc so
it's actually interfering with its own
communication no longer okay no longer
all right well so okay so that's the WTF
stuff that we've seen at the show that
especially Tricia she's she is you want
to ask anybody about it trisha
