and this is a matchup between two
honeycomb tablets that won't break the
bank it's a prize 5 watch out between
the acer iconia tab and the asuste eat
at transformer now our judges for this
fight our CEO Andrew Donald Taco Bell
senior associate editor Eric shake and
bake Franklin and myself ringing in the
gun dating column will take all three
judges blind scores and average them out
the nearest tenth each round the final
price wide score will be an average of
all rounds using the same decimal system
we're putting in six rounds work for
this fight round one is design the acer
iconia tab has a smooth body with a real
nice metal finishing edges but pick it
up this thing is the heaviest tablet on
the market weighing in at one point six
nine pounds and trust me you'll feel it
now the asuste transformer has a nice
weight to it and a classy design there's
more screen and less bezel and that's
always a good thing plus I like its
texture booty that I could run my
fingers on all day a su space the first
round with a 3.7 and acer needs to hit
the treadmill with a 3.3 next round is
controls an user interface both tablets
are running honeycomb so the look and
feel is very similar the acer iconia tab
brings up physical rotation lock switch
so you don't have to go into the
software settings plus including Dolby
mobile to tweak the audio settings is a
nice addition now the transformer has no
lock switch but it has a volume rocker
placed on the side which is perfect for
a tablet primarily used in landscape
mode it also has a built-in screen shot
function so you won't need to download
any third-party app and they've changed
the navigation icons now I'm not really
a fan of the virtual keyboard because
including numbers makes it feel more
cramped but it doesn't hurt it here a
suit takes another round this time with
a four and acer gets a 3.7 this after
averaging two rounds the transformer
leave by four tenths of a point next
round is features these two tablets have
16 gigs of storage Wi-Fi and Bluetooth
and you won't find 3g or 4g on either
them but acer brings the most
connections you can find with hdmi and
audio out a micro
SD card slot on top plus a mini USB and
a standard USB port the transformer is
lacking when it comes to ports you'll
find audio out a microSD card slot the
less common mini HDMI and that's it but
there's a port on the bottom that gives
it its best feature the ability to dock
it to a laptop keyboard it's a great
option for an additional one hundred and
fifty dollars and you'll get two USB
ports but we're still comparing these
guys as tablets the acer iconia tab
takes round three with a four and the
transformer gets a 3.3 next round is web
browsing and multimedia both tablets are
using the same browser support flash and
have the same multimedia experience
which is a good thing HD video looked
great on both of them but what sets them
apart is their cameras the iconia tab
has a 2 megapixel front facing camera
and a 5 megapixel rear camera with flash
that takes richer and more detailed
pictures but it's a little pickier with
multimedia formats now the transformer
offers a 1.2 megapixel front facing
camera and a 5 megapixel camera with no
flash on the back but taking advantage
of the keyboard dock feature gives it a
real advantage win web browsing we're
calling this round a tie at three point
seven points apiece so after averaging
four rounds with just two left to go
we're locked in a dead heat next round
is two fold
these two tablets are snapping
performers when you're navigating
through honeycomb and it feels like an
identical experience when it comes to
speed the acer iconia tab was able to
pump out seven point eight hours of
juice in our tests and the transformer
squeeze seven point three hours of juice
which is still respectable now neither
of them were able to get close to apples
ten our iPad battery life but you'll be
more than happy with these solid
performers we've got another time this
round and the judges called even at four
with just one more round left to go the
final round that decides it all is value
acer iconia tab has specs that go neck
and neck with the more expensive
Motorola Xoom but it's price point is a
whole different story four hundred and
fifty dollars it's fifty dollars less
than an entry-level ipad 2 and it's an
excellent price for a honeycomb tablet
but then there's the asuste transformer
that cuts the fat and brings us a
four-hundred-dollar honeycomb tablet
experience with a solid form factor
bottom line this is a price point that
will make consumers think twice the
transformer brings a big bang for the
buck and gets a 4.7 and the iconia tab
gets a 3.7 go to average out all six
rounds and in a throwdown that was dead
even until the final round the asuste
transformer takes this battle 3.9 to 3.7
and is your prize fight winner both of
these tabs are honeycomb experiences
that do the platform proud but it's the
asuste epad transformers price that puts
it over the top i'm brian Tong thanks
for watching catch you guys next time on
another prize box</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
