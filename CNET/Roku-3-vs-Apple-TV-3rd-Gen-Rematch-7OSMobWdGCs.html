and we have a rematch
one year later between two CNET editors
choice $99 streaming media boxes it's a
prize five punch out between the boku
three and the Apple TV 3rd generation
our judges for this fight are executive
editor John ice-cream Falcone senior
associate editor Matthew the Big Show
Muscovy AK and myself really a big Tom
we'll take each round score and average
them out to the nearest tenth of a point
the final prize fight score will be an
average of all rounds using the same
system let's get this party started
round 1 is design the Roku 3 brings a
black glossy finish and thicker curves
their classic fabric tag and a weight
that feels solid the third generation
Apple TV is still a clean matte black
box with a glossy rounded edge that
holds up better against dust or
fingerprints with a solid weight as well
now the Apple TV brings a super
minimalist remote that doesn't do much
while the Roku remote can be swung
around all over the place or even used
as a whip all right back to earth and
the reality is that these are 2 $99
black boxes and that's it no one stands
out and we're calling this a tie at 4.3
points next round is user interface and
navigation the Roku 3 stands out with
this snappy interface allowing you to
see more channels and content and you'll
have plenty of customization to
personalize the entire layout of your
channels now one slight drawback is the
inside of a roku channel still retains
the old horizontal look and feel that
can be freshened up a bit but let's not
forget it's killer Universal search that
pulls from Roku's multiple content
sources Apple has nothing like this now
the Apple TVs interface is filled
elegant experience but it needs a
facelift animations are smooth and its
interface feels polished you can move
channels around to organize them your
way but hiding channels you don't want
requires you go through parental
controls plus the lack of any
cross-platform search is a big miss here
the Roku 3 gets a perfect 5 and the
TV get to-four software averaging two
rounds roku leads round three is
features the Roku three brings HDMI
1080p video support with 802 11 n dual
band Wi-Fi and an Ethernet connection
you'll also have a micro SD card slot
for additional storage and a USB port to
connect external drives and it even
supports mkv files now it's killer
feature is its enhanced remote with an
audio jack for private listening that
lets you listen to what's planed through
your headphones so you won't disturb
anyone else and those earbuds purple the
remote also acts as a motion controller
for games like Angry Birds and yes the
Roku has games and the Roku app for
Android and iOS lets you stream your
photos or music to the box and Slingbox
users can even use a Roku to watch their
Slingbox on a TV now the Apple TV brings
HDMI with 1080p support 802 11 and Wi-Fi
and Ethernet with an optical audio out
option the USB port is primarily used
for service so you can't connect just
any type of drive to it now its feature
set is impressive but only if you live
in the Apple ecosystem airplay lets you
play music and display content directly
from your iOS devices and airplay
mirroring allows your Apple laptop or
computer screen to be mirrored onto your
TV with just one click if it's supported
now Roku has no mirroring at all and
that's pretty sweet
again if you're an Apple user now if you
pay $24.99 a year for the iTunes Match
service you can access your entire music
collection and if you use iCloud you'll
also be able to view your photo stream
again that's if you're in the Apple
ecosystem the Apple TV is feature pack
if you like the shiny Cupertino fruit
but the Roku 3 is just beast with useful
features that work for everyone on any
platform the Roku 3 gets a perfect 5 and
Apple TV
get up for the final round that decides
it all is content both sides have
improved their content offering since
they last faced off against each other
Apple has added tons of new content like
HBO Go and WatchESPN and more recent
stuff like Red Bull TV watch ABC disney
content for the kiddies and the free
movie service crackle now Apple is
making moves and there's no doubt about
that but it still can't compete with
over 1,000 plus channels of content on
roku including this channel you should
really check out called CNET and the
roku team squashed its biggest content
omission with a native YouTube app you
can technically play more content
through airplay mirroring from your
computer if you have the right Apple
hardware but that's a workaround
now the age-old same content is king
holds true here and the Roku hits hard
again with a perfect 5 and the Apple TV
gets a 4 so let's average out all four
rounds and this battle started out even
but then Roku went on a tear with three
perfect rounds taking this battle four
point eight to four point one and is
your prize bite winner you can't go
wrong with two CNET editors choice
streaming boxes depending on what you
want and this battle is far from over
with the Apple TV prime for a refresh in
2014
