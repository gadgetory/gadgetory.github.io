Chromebooks are coming I'm Bridget Carey
and this is your cnet update more
Chromebooks are coming to a store near
you Google's cheap laptops are tripling
their store presence around the world
and in the u.s. most of those stores are
going to be Walmart's and staples
walmart is selling the two hundred
dollar acer c7 chromebook but before you
get giddy about a two-hundred-dollar
laptop remember you get what you pay for
that easter model has poor battery life
and a lousy touchpad staples will sell
better models made by HP and Samsung but
remember Chromebooks have the Chrome
operating system so you can't just
install any program on it it's good if
you do most of your work online think of
them as enhanced tablets connecting to a
printer can also be a pain you might be
better off with just a budget Windows
laptop but if Chromebooks are coming to
stores a Microsoft Surface RT tablet
could be coming to your school Microsoft
is targeting schools and universities by
offering serious discounts on its
surface RT tablet during the summer
institutions can buy them for as low as
250 dollars with that detachable
keyboard the retail price where the
keyboard is normally six hundred dollars
there's a new way to give your friend a
birthday gift on Facebook Amazon
birthday gift is an electronic gift card
you send to a facebook friend but the
twist is that you encourage your other
Facebook friends to chip into the gift
so you give a larger amount together
friends can give one dollar or as much
as 25 dollars and write a personal
message for a limited time amazon even
throws in three bucks as a bonus for all
you eager blackberry fans out there that
bought the new z10 touchscreen
smartphone you better update that
software blackberry just announced
there's a critical security bug that
needs fixing and if you don't download
the latest 10.1 operating system a
hacker could gain access to the phone
eighteen t is testing out a new concept
in new york it's called street charge
it's installing these solar charging
stations around new york city parks to
lit passers-by plug in their mobile
devices for a free recharge the stations
have cords to plug in different
the devices and it's completely
solar-powered the batteries inside will
hold several days worth of juice so
it'll help recharge at night but this
isn't a quick jolt of power a recharge
takes the same amount of time as if you
plugged it into your home outlet so you
better grab a snack and plan to hang
around for a bit the units will only be
around for a few months in New York but
18t is testing this to see how often
people use the station's or how much
work is involved in taking care of them
based on the test run you could see
something similar coming to your town
that's your tech news update you can
