astromech droid that will follow your
orders Spin Master has just the toy for
you the hero droid bb-8 is a realistic
RC toy recreation of the beloved Star
Wars character measuring it at 16 inches
tall well 19 inches if you count the
antenna that's about two-thirds the size
of his movie counterpart the toy has
several modes to follow an owner around
and respond to voice commands he will
act scared if he start talking about
storm troopers or kylo Ren but he perks
up if you mention his friends Rey or Poe
he can also come when called and be set
in a guard mode to alert you whenever he
detects movement nearby Spin Master gave
an early demo of a prototype during the
New York Toy Fair
bb-8 comes with a two stick RC remote
control to drive him around the joy can
also be set to follow me mode rolling
beside you as you walk along well I
should say will follow up whoever's
holding the remote you don't have to
worry about your Jordan getting into
danger it has a sensor for collision
detection Spin Master isn't releasing
details yet about battery life but you
will need to charge both the head and
the body separately the heads attaches
magnetically it may remind you of the
smaller bb-8 toy made by Sparrow that
came out in 2015 but this Spin Master
version is much more interactive hero
droid bb-8 is priced at 230 dollars
and rolls into stores this fall just in
time for Star Wars the last Jedi
