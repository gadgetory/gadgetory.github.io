razor blade for teen razors newest
gaming laptop addition to a landscape
that was pretty experimental before this
you had some crazy gaming tablet that
came out the razor edge they also had
the razor blade before this which had a
touchscreen a little doohickey on the
side here called the switchblade qi that
allowed you to touch and click at the
same time didn't have a lot of games
that supported it so what now for razor
well a pretty traditional gaming laptop
this really kind of looks like a MacBook
Pro Retina display dipped in black and
made available for your Windows 8
pleasure and that's not such a bad thing
it's all aluminium it's really sexy
looking it's compact
it's pretty thin and it packs very new
processor technology a quad core Core i7
4700 2hq processor 2.2 gigahertz and
it's also got nvidia geforce gtx 765 m
graphics 2 gigabytes that's a lot under
the hood here and it performs as well as
you'd expect considering those specs
eight gigs of ram and it plays games
very very well there's no real
compromise here it plays games like
BioShock Infinite Metro last light
really smoothly maybe not as nicely is
that super high-end gaming rig but look
how thin this is the song that can pack
into a backpack and go with you and also
it would be your everyday laptop which
is a really nice direction for Razer to
go into the price is expensive it's
$17.99 for this base configuration with
only 128 gigabyte SSD storage if you
want more you're gonna have to pay up
2:56 cost $2000 and 512 costs 2300 but
still you can actually upgrade the drive
in here yourself
it just voids the warranty and
apparently there's a second Bay let's
get to some of the downsides on this
well first of all there's no touchscreen
I don't know why but gaming laptops now
are for some reason ditching
touchscreens and this razor blade 14 is
part of that world
it is a 1600 by 900 display no touch and
the screen quality is probably the least
impressive among any high-end
top that we've seen recently the viewing
angles not that great the other downside
here is again so little storage on board
and the ports are limited there's three
USB 3.0 HDMI and that's it
no Ethernet no SD card slot even but
you're getting good battery life here
really good performance really compact
size and a traditional form and at least
the processors and the graphics are up
to date razors onto something here just
get that screen a little bit better and
you probably have a world beater in the
gaming laptop space
I'm Scotts time and that's a little look
at the razor blade 14 now available
pretty hot little number</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
