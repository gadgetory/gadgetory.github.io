operations director for the google lunar
xprize i'm here today at dfk I in bremen
germany with one of the judges from the
google lunar xprize we're here to look
at some testing activities being done by
the team part-time scientists they're a
bunch of guys who technically active in
other industries and they've got
together who form a team to go after the
google lunar xprize in their spare time
it informed about four years ago when i
first heard about the goon awake spies
from down it really just grow the entire
team and yeah it's been four years since
I'm Allen Wells I'm an emeritus
professor at University of Leicester and
I'm one of the Google X PRIZE judges
Google have introduced these milestone
prizes as a stimulus and as a means of
measuring genuine progress towards the
ultimate objective and that's where we
are at the moment the Gulf tested today
is to verify the image quality of the
camera so the reason why we've come here
to the dfk eye institute is because they
have this very awesome space hall which
is capable of simulating realistic lunar
lighting conditions to demonstrate a
very high resolution and high frame rate
video is something that is not that easy
to do the thing that we want to achieve
today is actually verify that the image
quality of the camera that we have built
this latest prototype matches up as the
requirements of the MTA mtas the master
team agreement basically the rules of
the competition so if it doesn't match
up and we send it to space then we can
actually get disqualified
the reason why you saw us putting up
different folders in front of the camera
is actually because we have been mixing
two different types of cameras so we're
having two black and white cameras which
are the de parallel ones there were ones
for the stereoscopic imaging that we use
to do this 3d scanning of the surface
and measuring distances to certain focal
point and then we have of course the
teller lens which is in the middle and
the talents and is actually different in
a way that d the other two cameras
actually already color census today
capable of seeing color themselves but
the teller lens is a black-and-white
sensor if you use a color sensor to
capture your colored image that's
totally fine but the point is to quality
is better if you use a black-and-white
sensor and apply right kinds of filters
what we did to be able to get things
done quickly and tested quickly is that
we've ordered all of the parts on the
camera as Sweeney printed parts so they
are basically plastic this gave her the
advantage that we could quickly test the
image quality but of course it has a
disadvantage if we can't do all of the
other tests that we want to do for
example the summer vacuum test something
that you can't do with the plastic part
or the mechanical load test but of
course for the image quality does matter
if the housing is plastic reason why I
believe this entire Google X Prize and
part-time sinus is pretty awesome at
least for me and for most of the people
on our team is that you you get to learn
so much more things that you would have
never come in contact with in the normal
life I think if we need really free will
already ruled live</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
