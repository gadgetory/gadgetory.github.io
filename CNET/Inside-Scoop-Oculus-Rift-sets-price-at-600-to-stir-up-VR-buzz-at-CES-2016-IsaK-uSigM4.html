coverage of CES 2016 the consumer
electronic show we're coming to you live
from the cnet stage in the South Hall of
the Las Vegas Convention Center I'm
Bridget Carey and I'm Jeff Bakalar in
every morning this week we're here with
the inside scoop where we sift through
some of the more interesting
announcements and news stories that will
hopefully help you see through the hype
happening here at CES so today is the
official start of CES the doors have
opened and thousands of attendees are
flooding the show floor yeah last year's
attendants logged in at around 170,000
people and we're expecting similar
numbers this year so let's get started
with the big news today now one of the
stories making headlines this morning is
news that broke well it's not on the
show floor but it was a follow up to
something that we first reported on
earlier this this week that's right this
morning oculus rift pre-orders went live
and to my surprise it's only six hundred
dollars and I say only because I was
getting ready to spend a thousand
dollars on a new oculus rift there's a
lot of hype for a long time on this
product absolutely a lot of speculation
about how much it would cost again I
thought I'd have to you know refinance
my mortgage but no it's only going to be
six hundred dollars you are though and
there's a there's a huge caveat here you
are going to have to have a pretty
powerful gaming PC to run that kind of
hardware yeah 600 is just the head
that's the headset the xbox controller
and that sort of apparatus you do need a
pretty powerful PC to run that to be
able to run the oculus as well so I
guess all in your may be looking at a
thousand dollars when it comes down to
it probably a little more than that but
that's what we're dealing with when it
comes to brueggers so it it's I I mean
I'm like basically at the checkout
screen so I you know if you want to
click it let's click it let's let's jump
in together let's jump into the rift oh
you know V are we expected to be a big
topic at the show sure right now so far
as press we got an early look
at the HTC vive pre which is the updated
version of HTC's version of this and the
little extra thing that makes it stand
out is the fact that it helps you
basically not trip over your own
furniture yes so this is interesting so
some of the big sort of criticism about
the vibe is that well it's going to have
me sort of moving around the space that
there could be furniture in and other
obstacles that I can easily trip over
when when I'm wearing a huge mask on my
eyes so they're sort of introducing a
parameter that will prevent you from
falling over yourself but I think the
answer little camera that actually looks
out into the room it knows that you're
there and you can actually see things on
your phone this is just shadows you can
actually make out details and what's in
front of you I kind of like how you know
every VR sort of product out there and I
guess the vibe is is maybe the most sort
of practical realistic competitor to
what oculus is doing but you know it's
kind of cool that they each have their
own sort of gimmick I hate to say
gimmick because what you have to right
now with with sort of wherever you are
that but it's I think the vibe is really
the one product that's going to give the
rift sort of a run for its money I'm not
sort of see how that shakes out the
spring sometime but we don't know too
much about that none of those real
specific concrete details but you know
we've played around with the vibe our
editors have gotten a chance to try that
out and you know I think everyone's
pretty sold on the technology so I'm
glad to know that jumping into VR you've
got PlayStation more well now its
PlayStation VR I'm still stuck calling
in Norfolk oh you know you've got like
three kind of heavy hitters that are all
jumping in this year so it'll be
interesting to see where the dust
settles and where people tend to migrate
I think that oculus rift coming in at
six hundred bucks is a big surprise yeah
a pleasant surprise so definitely
psyched to for the fact that people will
be able to afford it some people and I'm
curious what else we're gonna see in the
show floor now that it's open when it
comes to VR I mean so far we were seeing
things about the experience around you
not necessarily the tech of the goggles
themselves but there was this thing we
saw at a preview event at night called
the immerse
it as in as in sit your butt down on
this chair bring your dad that is that
is moving yeah and and jumping up and
down so like a Disney World attraction
ride the movies as they say it Universal
to the ice we have we have a first-look
from Sarah who got a check it out and
it's kind of interesting because you I
think they give you the option to sort
of put it on when when there's a moment
of sort of like acceleration where you
can say like okay now I'd want to
experience that right up this is the
kind of stuff you had to go to an arcade
and pay like five bucks or ten bucks for
it sit down I made a roller coaster guys
yeah I don't know if this is something
that I could really bring in my
apartment I feel like my downstairs
neighbor might be upset you're like oh
you know you can't be doing that here
well there's some more practical stuff
we saw last night from Intel sure had
this smart helmet now think back to what
Microsoft did with its hollow lens and
Intel showed off something that was
practical for the workplace right it's
called the daiquiri is I don't if it's
as tasty as a daiquiri no it's not
daiquiris the name of the company and
they're using Intel's m7 chip and
technology called real sense to sort of
give you an augmented reality experience
with a hard hat design so you sort of
look like you know almost like a
stormtrooper and in a weird way and what
it's going to allow people to do is sort
of use industrial sort of workplace
worksite applications the demo they
showed was someone wearing this hard hat
helmet contraption and sort of being
able to see through a bunch of pipes and
which pipe was defective that's exactly
what makes the most sense for things
like the hollow lens to I mean if I'm
trying to fix something on home and have
no idea how to fix it I want to be able
to see in front of me some instructions
and that's why this makes sense for a
workplace or someone who's you know just
trying to get the layout like a
blueprint of something in front of them
and overlay it on the wall that you know
that they're standing in front of and
it's a great tech demo I think it blew a
lot of people away last night but at the
same time it's like okay that's great
technology but people have to develop
for that and people have to sort of you
know take a step back and say okay this
is amazing technology but how do we use
it in a way that's Universal for a lot
of people I could see this being a more
proprietary situation where if you're
sort of going to have to go on a
case-by-case basis regardless this
daiquiri smart helmet it's available now
it's shipping today we're going to see
it on the stage actually later today
later today on tomorrow daily so that's
going to be great I one o'clock here at
the scene that stage so pretty psyched
about that going to stick around and see
if I could get my hands on long another
late breaking news came from a VW yes
volkswagen they got it they had a bus
concept car called the buddy I enjoy
wintech as a cute little name but this
was different you know we saw some
earlier concept car tech a few days ago
that was pretty extreme look like a
Batmobile here's a here's a concept car
that might be more practical though and
we have a some video now of the
presentation from the other night yeah
it's pretty cool you like you say we're
usually used to these flashy sporty sort
of cars but no this is a car for for
real people right for maybe people who
need that kind of I don't want to say
minivan situation but yeah this is
probably where that fits uh it's like
you said it's called the Buddy b.u.d.d.y
and it just has a lot of like practical
technology built into it and you know
they're saying well hey you know by 2019
we anticipate a car battery like this to
be able to charge eighty percent in
about 15 minutes which is pretty free it
sounds also practical if you're going to
you know I don't know make a pit stop at
the grocery store or something really
quick the only we wanted to do 15
minutes I mean that would be convenient
absolutely like a rapid charge situation
like kind of what we have with with some
phones now they take away all the
mirrors for uh cameras which is pretty
impressive and you can kind of see like
who's getting into the car with a series
of mirrors we're actually going to get
to see this later today which is pretty
rad around twelve-thirty you have a live
shot with buddy and I don't know I I
just this is the kind of car that I just
want to maybe give a hug to it's a buddy
it's a part of it it's a cute little car
so yeah you know i like i said it's
definitely a fresh change of pace really
awesome to see something where it's not
this over the top Bruce Wayne only sort
of invention yeah a concept car that you
might go all right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
