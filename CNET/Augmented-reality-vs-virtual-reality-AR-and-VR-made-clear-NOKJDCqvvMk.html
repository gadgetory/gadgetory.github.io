they kind of sound like something you
need a drug counselor to get through
don't they but in fact they're the
hottest two technologies going these
days let's learn about them so we can
compare and contrast what each of them
does so they allow you instead of
overwhelmed augmented reality is when
you look at the real world but it's
augmented with additional information or
graphics in your view now key to this AR
concept is that the things are indexed
to a location that means they occupy a
relevant place in your view as opposed
to moving with your gaze as you turn
your head and in many cases you can
interact with those visuals that are
augmenting your view ar can be had via a
phone and one of the many AR apps out
there or for higher performance you use
dedicated a our glasses know that AR is
increasingly being referred to these
days as mr mixed reality it's part
marketing term and part acknowledgement
of a ARS ability to augment the real
world while also bringing in unreal
elements glasses that augment your view
without being indexed to a location and
space are better referred to as
connected head-up displays now Google
glass was the infamous standard-bearer
of that sector but more recently views
expending blade an impressive set of
head mounted displays that include
integration of Amazon Alexa to help you
drive what's displayed by a voice
virtual reality is when the world you're
standing in is replaced with a virtual
one with some of these everything you
see and everything you hear is replaced
with something computer-generated now
the world that that takes you to can be
very naturalistic actually or extremely
synthetic and fantastic VR you're
surrounded in 360 degrees and the space
is three-dimensional now in its most
ambitious forms VR places are also
navigable as you can move through them
and use your hands to manipulate things
within them VR can be done as simply as
sticking your phone in a literally
cardboard head mount or
little more upgraded plastic holder but
the attention these days is mostly on
real-deal head mounted displays until
recently these were quite cumbersome and
always tethered to either a game console
or a high performance PC but more recent
versions acknowledged that tethering is
going to be a non-starter for a lot of
users and instead the new headsets build
the electronics into themselves or maybe
into a small companion processor you
wear on your belt for a pseudo cordless
experience the bottom line on AR or VR
is that you really have to experience it
to understand it and appreciate it it's
very hard to read an article or look at
a video like this and understand the
impact of these they aren't like a lot
of other technologies the good news is
you've got plenty of time
both of these are pretty green and have
a long way to go before they hopefully
merge into a pretty smooth continuum of
abilities whereas right now it can be a
little hard for the average user to knit
them together let alone find a use case
that makes sense to them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
