Technology I'm Bridget Carey and this is
your cnet update you drove reports of
18-team verizon putting more
restrictions on data plans but here's a
twist for you t-mobile will launch a
truly unlimited data plan beginning
September 5th no caps no data throttling
t-mobile is offering the same thing that
sprint has been offering but t-mobile
does it for cheaper let's look at sprint
starting place for unlimited data for
eighty dollars a month you're limited to
450 voice minutes and if you want
unlimited data and unlimited talk
that'll be 110 dollars but on t-mobile
eighty dollars will get you 500 minutes
a little more and ninety dollars gets
you unlimited voice you can even get
that price dropped lower if you bring in
your own phone but keep in mind with
t-mobile's new plan you won't be able to
use the phone as a hotspot at all the
old plans will still be around square
isn't the only mobile payment service
makin moves paypal has partnered with
discover to expand its digital wallet
footprint all businesses that take
discover would be able to also let
customers pay with a paypal account but
there's no word yet on how that'll all
work all we know is that it doesn't
require store owners to install new
equipment the service will roll out next
year and the evidence keeps rolling in
that the next iPhones coming out
September 21st the latest clue Verizon
staff have been told they can't take
vacation that day or the following week
also next month we should finally hear
about the price and launch date of the
new Nintendo Wii U console Nintendo is
holding a press event in new york city
on September 13th and the Nintendo of
America president will be there so yeah
he's got something important to say but
inside Nintendo news it's the end of an
era for the magazine nintendo power it
will publish its last issue this year
after 24 years of publishing about
upcoming games tips and sheets these
magazines were so important to players
before the internet reports say Nintendo
Power couldn't strike up a new contract
with Nintendo to keep the magazine going
did you know that the same technology
that goes into capturing human movement
for animated movies like Shrek or avatar
is used to design cars the other night I
got a demo affords virtual reality buck
for the new ford fusion hybrid engineers
build a virtual version of a car's
interior and use a virtual reality
capture system with headgear and gloves
to simulate a driver in that environment
they test to see how comfortable it is
for drivers to reach different knobs or
compartments you can see more of the
technology and hear from engineers in
