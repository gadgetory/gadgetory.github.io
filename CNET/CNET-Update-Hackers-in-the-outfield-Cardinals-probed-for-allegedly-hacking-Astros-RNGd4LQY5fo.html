America's new pastime I'm Bridget Carey
this is your see that update a password
storage locker makes a great target for
hackers wouldn't you agree then it
should come as no surprise to hear that
last pass a company that lets you store
all your passwords online under one
master password key was hit by hackers
the company reports that hackers
accessed email addresses password
reminders and the encrypted versions of
those master password keys so if you
used last pass it's time to change your
master password especially if your
reminder clue is easy like what was your
high school or where were you born
anyone can easily search for that
information online it's another reminder
that storing all your passwords in one
place may not be such a great idea
because nothing is hack proof you can
best protect yourself by using
two-factor authentication such as having
an extra text message code sent to your
phone as the second hurdle to logging in
that's an option on LastPass and other
services like Gmail and you should
always use two steps when available now
I hope the Houston Astros baseball team
is using two steps a year ago the Astros
were hacked internal messages about
trading players leaked online and it was
largely forgotten about until now the
New York Times was first to report that
the FBI is investigating the st. Louis
Cardinals for hacking into the computers
of the Astros in an attempt to steal
team secrets now we often hear reports
of foreign governments hacking into
companies service to dig up dirt but now
we're talking about corporate espionage
on our home turf the general manager for
the Astros used to work for the
Cardinals and he's a big believer in
making data-driven decisions you may
know it as the Moneyball phenomenon so
grabbing that data could be useful in
getting an advantage and it seems it
wasn't a very sophisticated hack the
story says someone may have just used
one of the general managers old
passwords to get in the system it's just
like the classic song goes you know the
words and this one two three wrong
password attempts and you're out debt
CEO
