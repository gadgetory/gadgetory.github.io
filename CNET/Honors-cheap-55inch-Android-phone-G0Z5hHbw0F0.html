Mobile World Congress in Barcelona with
honor
checking out two of his new phones the
top end 6 plus and this guy the 4x now
both the 6 plus and the 4x have 5.5 inch
screens but as the more affordable of
the to the 4x has toned down the
resolution slightly it has a 720p
display rather than Full HD so things
will look slightly less crisp although
in my own hands on time
it does seem perfectly sharp it's also
running on Android 4.4 KitKat now that
isn't the most up-to-date version that
honor goes to 5.0 lollipop
but the company has said but it should
be updating both phones to 5.0 lollipop
have come this summer it's running on a
64-bit octa-core processor clocked at
1.2 gigahertz now it does seem perfectly
powerful for you essentials but we will
have to wait to see what it can really
do in our full review and a phone also
comes with 8 gigabytes of built-in
storage which isn't a huge amount that
is a microSD card slot so you can expand
that storage on the back of the phone is
a 13 megapixel camera and there is a 5
megapixel camera on the front for those
embarrassing selfies physically it's not
the most stylish of phones if I turn it
around you can see it's got this black
plastic back that's been given like a
scratching effect to keep it looking
interesting but with an affordable price
tag that is probably forgivable owner
hasn't said exactly how much this phone
is going to cost yet but has said but it
should sit somewhere between its budget
Holle phone and the honor 6 well that
would put it somewhere around 170 pound
mark but of course that could change by
the time actually goes on sale later on
this year I want to haul the C net and
this is the honor 4x</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
