from cement here at Mobile World
Congress in Barcelona where I'm taking a
look at the cats
b15 this is an android 4.1 jellybean
smartphone it's extremely durable and
yes it is made by the same people who
create forklifts and mining equipment
this phone is rugged it's made of
aluminium and rubber kind of encasing it
even the buttons on the side er rubber
not plastic key at all there's a lot of
grip here there are these grooves signs
so that even if you're wearing gloves or
if your fingers are slippery with water
you can still kind of grasp on to it
same go for these edges they're thick
you can really hold it and that's what
it's there for these buttons are bright
all around it you can see it if it's
dark you can see them if they're kind of
covered in dust or mud or some sort of
muck there are screws that help
reinforce all of the openings keep this
phone as close as tight as possible keep
the internals protected from the
elements you can see that there are also
some flaps they're rubberized reinforced
on the sides and on the top that's for
the same purpose to keep these feels as
tight as possible and keep unwanted
materials out it is fairly comfortable
to hold in the hand much more
comfortable than you would expect of
course if you have kind of an outdoorsy
job or you might be wearing gloves then
you won't be feeling the sides but even
in your bare hands it is not
uncomfortable in the slightest the phone
is actually pretty durable I have been
knocking it around here at the booth and
in addition to that it is rated for
military specification ip67 that makes
it dust proof and it also rates it for
water resistance and that is up to one
meter and water for up to
minutes it's also reinforced with
gorilla glass so that helps keep the
screen a little stronger you see that
product in tons of other tablets laptops
and other smartphones as well the phone
is also drop resistant rated to a height
of 1.8 meters that's about as tall as
this damn now a lot of rugged
smartphones are actually not that smart
this one's kind of remarkable because
cat isn't even an Android maker usually
and this is one of the most current
versions of jellybean
it's got a four inch LCD screen on here
sensitive to touch one thing that they
are really highlighting is how sensitive
it is even if your fingers are wet so
we're going to wet this phone a little
bit even when wet the phone screen still
responds as for the other specs so
you've got a five megapixel camera on
here no flash but five megapixels is
still pretty good for this type of phone
it does take 720p HD video as well there
is also a front-facing VGA camera so you
can still do all your video chats inside
there's a one gigahertz dual-core
mediatek processor to keep the show
going the cat feed 15 is a 3G phone only
no LTE on this guy it will cost 329
euros will appear first in Germany on
March 15th followed shortly by the rest
of Europe the Middle East and hopefully
soon by America I'm Jessica dual-core
for CNN this is the cat
Dean Ambrose smartphone and it is very
rugged</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
