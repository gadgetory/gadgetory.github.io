resizing and why HDTV makes Hickey
viewers hey there and welcome to episode
who knows of the Q I'm rich demuro with
CNN TV and this is the show that
welcomes both HD DVD and blu-ray to the
party after a must click moment but if
some high tech companies like Microsoft
get their way your picture could freeze
and become unwatchable a commercial from
the National Association of Broadcasters
urging Congress not to share digital TV
airwaves with unlicensed devices this
after a prototype device caused
interference and early test companies
like Microsoft and Google want the
technology so they can develop high-tech
devices with short range wireless
functions survey also says americans
watched eight hours of TV a day which
leads us to our next story when you get
HDTV your viewing habits change sure you
might be more apt to watch nature
documentaries but according to a
knowledge network survey getting HDTV
makes you more selective about what you
watch and when about a third always
check HD channels first when surfing
that includes me half always make an
effort to watch a program in HD if it's
offered in both high and standard
definition not in the survey but the
number one thing I find with HDTV
newbies they don't realize HD channels
are in a separate hired number cheer so
help out a friend moving through the cue
trend hunter with a gallery of cool
bending machines and you thought it was
neat if you found one that takes debit
cards there's a concept bicycle rental
vending machine you rent a bike like a
smart cart then drop it off at another
rental station there's a soccer ball
vending machine from Nike for when you
kick one out of the park a hair
straightener vending machine a Japanese
machine that'll show you a 30-second ad
in exchange for a free cup of joe and my
personal favorite the Wonder Pizza
vending machine or piping hot pie in
under two minutes time for the beta and
today it's such a simple site there's
only one page pic sizer will resize your
pics in a jiffy spend less time resizing
and more time uploading profile pics
webpages and more the site lets you
select a picture from a file on your
computer or a URL then resize in seconds
scale down to percentages or two
from a list of standard sizes there are
ways to make icons banner ads avatars
forum pics and more there's even a way
to make desktop wallpaper sizes for a
perfect resolution fit finally it's back
to school time and there's nothing more
endearing to an adolescent in their
awkward stage than picture day this is
when you wear a new shirt that's
probably too big for you get a haircut
that doesn't comb right and find a
pimple the morning of the shoe wish I
had the photo marketing association's
helpful list when I was in school it has
great tips so kids look their best like
we're dark solid colors avoiding green
clothes since more schools are keying in
backgrounds getting haircuts a week or
so in advance and definitely not doing
what that mom on sunset tan did spending
1,300 bucks on a tanning package before
the big shoot how I really don't want to
do this what you need to do this for
your pictures let's go and whatever you
do don't take your pictures to kinkos
and copy them for friends and family
that's against the law I'm rich Demuro
would seen a TV the voice of reason and
a crazy wired world of good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
