buzz report and now for the gadget of
the week the gadget of the week is the
apple iphone now i know i'm a little
late to the party blame the baby oh
sorry hold on no III didn't already do
that I mean I don't know if you noticed
I haven't been here for the last four
months cooley you gave my show to cooley
oh god what did he do I gotta go watch
this okay I guess Cooley was pretty
awesome thanks Cooley come back any time
now where was I oh yeah the gadje of the
week is the open moco neo in 1973 it's a
linux-based touchscreen only three
hundred dollar phone otherwise known as
the iphone killer or okay it's not the
iphone killer yet but it's like the
platform for the phone that's going to
become the iphone killer once developers
start writing drivers naps and stuff and
once they add Wi-Fi in 3d sensors and 3g
capability so you know it's an iphone
killer the way linux is a windows killer
lots of promise never any death and now
for the news Apple stock hit an all-time
high this week thanks to the iphone well
let me amend that actually the apple
iphone was released on jun 29th as you
know and it was this huge big deal an
apple stock price actually didn't move
that much and then it went way up when
investors realize that people were
actually buying the iphone and that was
good and then this week this analyst
from jpmorgan chase came along and said
there would be a new iphone coming out
this year based on the ipod nano and
that it would be way cheaper than the
current iphone and then Apple stock
price hit an all-time high hint hint but
then JP Morgan Chase retracted the story
saying that the cheaper I nano phone was
unlikely to come out anytime soon
probably because Apple called them and
said they'd actually like to sell some
of their really expensive iPhones rather
than have everyone sitting on their
wallets and waiting for a cheaper
version but I'm still waiting
transformers is the movie that's
sweeping the nation this summer
gentlemen start your bandwagon first up
laptop maker higher which is offering up
a transformer no pilot check it out oh
I'm sorry were you waiting for it to do
something yeah no it doesn't transform
it just has a sticker but hey at least
it's terrifyingly large this week is the
big III game convention and the CEO of
Electronic Arts is throwing down with
the games industry saying that game
publishers are quote boring people to
death with the games that they're
currently producing so I figure let's
take a look at one of these games all
right
then scheme is boring we gotta frag his
pathetic loser again
are they going to come out with
something cool in other video game news
a Florida man is suing Microsoft 45
million dollars saying that the xbox 360
scratched his game discs the lawsuit is
seeking class-action status and claims
that the consoles are negligently
designed and manufactured now what
happened to cause such a large dramatic
lawsuit well apparently jorge brower's
xbox 360 scratched two of his games
Gears of War and madden NFL 07 Microsoft
offered to replace the games but get
this they charged a twenty dollar fee I
know right five million dollars is
nothing you should probably sue for
emotional distress to those bastards I'm
Mollywood and this has been the buzz
report thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
