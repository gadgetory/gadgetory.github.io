here and welcome to the Apple bite it's
so good to be back for all the good and
bad inside the world of Apple after CES
and then you know I took a little break
a little swim with a whale shark in Cabo
but what a week to come back to with
plenty of meaty news now the home pod
gets an official February 9th release
date with pre-orders this Friday on
January the 26th and we'll get to that
but let's start with the latest from
Apple now the Cupertino kids posted a
preview of iOS 11.3 that brings new
features and it just makes me sad that
the first thing they led with is an
emojis I know they're fun but come on
this is iOS eleven point three now AR
Kit 1.5 comes to the party and can now
recognize vertical surfaces like walls
and doors and can place on them it
previously could only really handle
horizontal places like a flat table so
this is an important upgrade business
chat will come to select apps like
Lowe's or Wells Fargo that will let you
directly chat to businesses through the
messages app the health app will be able
to view health records from specific
medical providers and the most important
feature that gets buried like more than
halfway down iOS 11.3 will show you your
battery health and recommend if your
battery needs to be serviced you'll also
be able to see if Apple's power
management feature you know that thing
that throttles your phone's performance
is active and they'll give you the
option to turn it off I know you might
not still like this but if they're at
least giving users these options that's
a good Apple of course it is that's also
after they were exposed for doing it so
you know a little give-and-take all
right iCloud messages looks like it's
making an appearance in the iOS 11.3
beta for developers but Apple didn't
mention it it appears to be back for
testing and evaluation purposes
and where is airplay to that brings
multi-room audio these were features
touted back in June of last year like
last year major features in iOS 11 and
we're still waiting almost eight months
later you know what that's a bad apple
yeah the first one of 2018
congratulations now the developer beta
is out
with the public beta coming shortly
which now leads us to the home pod and
no I'm not throwing out any bad apples
at it just yet
Apple announced the home pod pre-orders
will again open this Friday on January
the 26th in the US UK and Australia for
349 US dollars now France and Germany
will get it later this spring but
there's been no announced timeframe for
other countries like Canada but you know
what you guys still have great maple
syrup now Apple care will be $39 and
we'll cover the home pod for two years
you'll have to pay an additional $39
each time you damage it and it can have
up to two damage incidents similar to
the iPhone and other Apple care products
but Apple's press release really tells
us everything we need to know about it
on launch
there will be no multi user support none
but an even bigger fail no multi-room
audio support so why was this product
too late again
they talked up having stereo sound come
on with two home pods when they
announced it but a that feature won't be
available on launch so again what was
the delay for Apple has touted it as the
best sounding smart speaker and we'll
see if it is but if you're looking for
something really special from the home
pod the only thing it has a chance of
doing better than the Amazon echo or the
Google home even the Sonos one is
sounding better
it's behind feature wise in every other
way from Siri smart home device
compatibility third-party music services
and apps or smart skills like we know
you're coming late to the smart suitor
party you delayed the launch to fine
tune it but in the past you would at
least bring something compelling to the
table like this is truly a speaker for
the hardcore Apple enthusiasts right now
and it's arguably apple's weakest entry
into an established market that we've
ever seen and yeah now it's that time
that's a bad apple now will it get
better yes it will but there's been this
really bad pattern that Apple is now
establishing as their identity and brand
showcase a product early promise new
features and then release an incomplete
product and use roughly 6 months or even
more to finally get it up to speed
knowing that your loyal fan base is
probably gonna buy it anyways like they
did this with the Apple watch series
three witches finally a product that I
can get behind the Apple TV promised
dolby atmos in a software update but
let's see we're still waiting close to
five months for it we talked about iOS
11 already in its flagship feature
delays and guess who's next in line the
home pod and you know what I'm not
hating on Apple but this is honestly
just wake up this is the new Apple and
it hurts as someone who knows how great
they used to be like a lot of you
complain that come on get a host who
likes Apple but it's because you just
have no idea how great this company used
to be now our home pod review will be
coming out once I get it and I hope they
can impress me because right now I'm not
so sure for 349 now we can't have a show
without iPhone 10 rumors and the latest
ones
KJ's securities ming ching-kuo got
people's heads spinning claiming Apple
will discontinue the current iPhone 10
instead of lowering its price and
potentially cannibalizing sales with an
iPhone 10 that is like $8.99 or cheaper
in 2018 now if this is true that would
mean apples 2018 iPhone lineup would
consist of an updated second gen 5.8
inch iPhone 10 the rumor to the larger
6.5 inch iPhone 10 plus and then this
rumored mid-range 6.1 LCD based screen
iPhone the commercial Times reports that
the 6.1 inch or will have an even more
advanced LCD screen compared to pass
ones with a cutout for the true depth
camera system that I won't complain
about so you won't keep writing get over
it in the comments so think about it
we're basically 7 months away from the
next iPhone announcement yikes and check
this out I don't know how y'all feel
about this but I think Apple is kind of
trolling the Apple byte after they
released this ad during our break
like she's in the tree almost the entire
time and I'm almost positive like they
released this specifically as a response
to a YouTube show because they're always
watching a show about Apple on YouTube
yeah that's it all right that's gonna do
it for this week's show if you're
pre-ordering the home pod I'll see you
there you can email me at the Apple bite
at cnet.com or tweet me at Brian Tong
thank so much for watching we'll catch
y'all next time for another bite of the
Apple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
