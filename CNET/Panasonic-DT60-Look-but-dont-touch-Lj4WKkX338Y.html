today i'm looking at the panasonic dt 60
LCD TV for the past few years if anyone
asked me to recommend them a TV I would
always say by a panasonic plasma until
now I have never said by a panasonic LCD
but based on the strength of the dt 60
LCD i still wouldn't this is an
impressive looking TV with an attractive
silver finish and very slim bezel and it
even includes a swivel stand it also
comes with matching silver remotes one
of which is a touchpad model with voice
interaction this is an edge lit LCD but
without local dimming and based on my
testing this means fairly light blacks
picture quality as a result is
disappointing with poor shadow detail
bluish blacks in a very indistinct
looking image the other issue is back
like clouding with almost yellow back
light leakage on black screens colors at
least are good with natural skin tones
and primary red green and blues if
you're a gamer the game mode also has
fairly low latency 3d playback and sound
are also pretty good the issue here is
the TV is a thousand dollars over the
price of the excellent st60 which is
better if you're just watching TV and
don't care much for features or gaming
while this television is an okay
all-rounder I'd still say get a plasma
for this kind of money this has been ty
pendlebury for seeing it done
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
