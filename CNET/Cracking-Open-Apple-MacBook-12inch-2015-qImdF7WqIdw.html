lighter version of the MacBook Air no
Apple has completely redesigned this
machine from the ground up and I'm going
to show you how I'm Bill Detweiler and
this is cracking open the 2015 12 inch
MacBook comes in two main hardware
configurations and three colors now our
Gold test unit had a 1.1 gigahertz Intel
Core M processor 8 gigs of ram 256 gigs
of storage and Intel HD graphics 5000
chip and a Retina display now Apple went
with a single USB C connector instead of
separate power USB and display ports but
there is still a 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack the keyboard has been
completely redesigned the mechanics
under the keys the actual keys
themselves and the lighting is all new
the new MacBook also has apples force
touch trackpad which the company also
uses on the 2015 MacBook Pro now those
are just the changes you can see on the
outside there's lots more to see on the
inside so let's get cracking as with the
MacBook Air and MacBook Pro Apple uses
pentalobe screws to secure the new
MacBooks lower case panel to the upper
half of the case you'll need a special
screwdriver to remove them now once the
screws are removed you can lift up on
the panel from the back
unlike the air and pro however there are
several cables that connect components
attached to the bottom panel to the
other bits of hardware that are attached
to the upper case now to disconnect
these cables you'll also need to lift up
on the panel from the front avoiding
tightening the cables too much we can
disconnect the trackpad and keyboard
cables at this point I would normally
disconnect the battery here but Apple
actually built the battery contacts into
the main system board now I can try to
isolate the battery by shimming a piece
of plastic between the board and battery
but this seems like a really odd way to
disassemble the laptop so I went ahead
and disconnected the ribbon cables for
the USB C port
retina display and the audio board with
all the cables disconnected we can
separate both halves of the case and
really see just how different the new
MacBooks internal design is from the
MacBook Pro and the air for starters the
battery main logic board and the speaker
antenna assemblies are all attached to
the cases removable bottom panel not the
upper half which houses the keyboard
trackpad and ports now speaking of the
logic board the new one is significantly
smaller than those on the pro or the air
and thanks to the new Intel Core M
processor gone other familiar fan and
cooling assembly there's also no
separate SSD now this machine storage
chips are soldered directly to the board
the force touch trackpad seems thinner
than the one on the pro also the battery
cells are contoured to fit snugly within
the cases curved depressions and
although we can't really see its inner
workings as I mentioned earlier the
keyboards all new to now that our tour
of the internal hardware is done we can
actually get down to removing a few of
the components and after ensuring its
attached cables are disconnected and
screws removed I was able to lift out
the logic board next to come out are the
machines to speaker assemblies which
also appear to function as antennas now
as the battery is glued to the case I'm
going to leave it alone
rather than risk damaging it during
removal i'm turning our attention to the
upper half of the case we can remove the
trackpad which is held in place with a
few screws the new USB see connector and
the audio board assembly lastly we can
detach the Retina display from the case
and our teardown is complete so what
should we make of all the changes and
new hardware Apple put into the 2015
MacBook well first and foremost I think
it's a sign of where Apple is going to
take its laptops eventually all Apple
portables will have the new keyboard
force touch trackpad and Retina display
and as processors get more powerful and
produce less heat internal fans will
disappear as for their product lines
Apple may keep the pro around for power
users but the heirs days are pretty much
numbered there's just no reason for
to offer two distinct ultraportable
lines lastly although the changes don't
make repairs impossible they don't make
them any easier either I hope is ample
refines the MacBooks design they don't
forget about all of us who still need to
crack open their computers now for more
