tong and the two seven inch tablet kings
are finally ready to duke it out it's a
prize five foot shout between the iPad
Mini with Retina display and the new
Nexus 7 our judges for this fight are
senior editor Eric the tank man Franklin
associate editor
Xiomara knocked out Blanco and you know
who can't go wrong Tom will take all
three judges blind scores and average
them out to the nearest tenth of a point
the final prize fight score will be an
average of all rounds between the same
system let's get ready to rumble round
one is design the iPad Mini retina
finally brings the upgrade people have
been waiting for with its 7.9 inch
Retina display at 326 pixels per inch
its design is still superior with an
all-metal body weighing in at 331 grams
with clean edges and a 4 by 3 screen
ratio but it's a lower color gamut is
noticeable when matched up side by side
now the new Nexus 7 brings a slightly
thicker but lighter design at 290 grams
with its plastic body and rubber backing
but we all missed the leathery feel from
the first gen its 7-inch 323 pixels
print screen is just a sharp to the
naked eye but it brings a fuller color
gamut that's more vibrant with its 16 by
9 ratio that's also brighter design is
in the eye of the beholder but the
retina minis bigger screen and sleeker
design get smooth edge with the 4.3 took
for next round is controls and user
interface the iPad Mini retina brings
iOS 7 and it will always be the easiest
pick-up-and-play
interface the home button has multiple
functions to access current apps and a
few basic settings or you can hold it
for Siri get me tickets to frozen
Cheers frozen plating today I could get
tickets for you you'll also have a
notifications pull down from the top and
Control Center from the bottom up but
its lack of customization is limiting
the new Nexus 7 brings the latest pure
KitKat 4.4 experience with multiple
users and restricted profiles for family
members androids customization for
widgets and putting folders in the dock
isn't going away
notifications started in Android before
anyone else swiping from the bottom up
get you Google now and swiping from the
top right and down get you quick access
to your key settings now it may not be
as user friendly but customization is
key here and the Nexus 7 takes this
round 4.3 took 4 so after averaging 2
rounds we're tied next round is
paper-boat tablets packed Wi-Fi
Bluetooth and 4G LTE options but you
won't find any memory expansion slots
here the retina comes in 16 32 64 and
128 gig flavors with the newest a7
dual-core processor that's on par with
the full sized iPad air now Siri has a
prettier interface but Google now is
still better and Apple's maps have
improved a lot you can view the content
that's on your iPad Mini 2 a TV set
connected with an Apple TV if you live
in the Apple ecosystem and it's still
that ecosystem that's Apple's strongest
feature with its App Store that really
has the most tablet dedicated apps now
the new Nexus 7 comes with 16 or 32 gigs
of storage and a quad-core Snapdragon s4
pro processor that delivers but we're
talking about the most feature packed
7-inch tablet here who will now search
and commands are unmatched in speed and
accuracy compared to Siri Google Maps is
still more reliable than Apple's you'll
have gesture typing by tracing over
letters to make words Android Beam
brings NFC capabilities and you can now
stream some of your content wirelessly
to a television set with the chromecast
it also brings surround sound speakers
that the iPad is still lacking and the
new Nexus 7 even supports wireless
charging
the Nexus 7 shines here with a perfect 5
and the iPad Mini gets a 4 next round is
web browsing and multimedia Google's new
Nexus 7 brings the best mobile browsing
with Chrome it has an incognito mode for
private browsing and syncs your
bookmarks across devices
the iPad Mini brings Safari which is
just as solid with a snappy pinch and
zoom cloud syncing of bookmarks on other
eye devices and its own private browsing
mode but chrome works on both platforms
and it's our browser of choice now video
quality looks great on these two tablets
but the new Nexus 7 has the edge with
its brighter screen and fuller color
gamut that's noticeable and it's 16 by 9
resolution makes the iPad minis 4 by 3
res look like a lot of wasted space at
times but if you're talking web browsing
then the iPad Mini gets the edge now the
multimedia gap between the iTunes Store
and Google Play Store has really closed
but Apple still brings more exclusive
content overall BOE tablets have
front-facing cameras and 5 megapixel
rear cameras that shoot 1080p video but
how many of you actually use them for
this in public well actually a lot of
you now this round could go either way
and we're calling it a tie at 4.3 points
a piece it's after averaging 4 rounds
the new Nexus has a slight lead round 5
is performance both of these tablets
feel fast and snappy overall but we'd
give the iPad Mini retina the real world
edge with pinching and zooming in apps
and overall it's just a hair faster now
benchmarks don't mean everything but the
Geekbench 3 benchmarks show a
significant advantage with the iPad Mini
retina in single core and multi-core
processor performance over the new Nexus
7 the 3d mark ice storm unlimited
graphics performance benchmarks also
shows the same really the iPad Mini
retina spur formance is on par with
full-size tablets now let's get to
battery life and in CNET's video
playback drain test the new Nexus 7 gave
us an impressive 11 and a half hours of
video playback but the iPad Mini retina
boasts an industry best 14 plus hours of
apple juice for a 7
have the iPad Mini retina gets a perfect
5 and the Nexus 7 gets a for the final
round that decides it all is value the
new Nexus 7 16 gig Wi-Fi model starts at
229 the iPad Mini retina 16 gig Wi-Fi
model starts at 399 now the 32 gig Wi-Fi
new Nexus is only 269 the iPad Mini 32
gig Wi-Fi is $4.99 and that's 230 bucks
more now if you want to get to 32 gig 4G
LTE versions for both the new Nexus 7 is
349 and the iPad Mini is 629 for a 280
dollar difference that's just brutal
there's nothing to dispute here the new
Nexus 7 takes this round at the 4.7 and
the iPad Mini gets a 3 point 7 so let's
average out all six rounds and in a
battle that was neck-and-neck until the
end it's the final round value that
decides it and the new Nexus 7 takes
this battle 4 point for the 4 point 2
and is your prize fight winner at the
end of the day you're looking at the
iPad Mini retina with full size tablet
performance and a full sized price
versus the customizable feature pack
view Nexus 7 at a reasonable price and
the choice always comes down to you i'm

catch you guys next time for another
