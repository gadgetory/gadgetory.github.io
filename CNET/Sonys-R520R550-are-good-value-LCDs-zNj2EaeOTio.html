looking at the sony r 5 20 and our 550
televisions if you're looking for the
best bang for buck LCD TVs the mid-range
level is a great place to start models
like the samsung 5000 series and the
sharp le 650 are cheap and actually
outperformed the more expensive screens
above them the sony r 5 20 and r 5 50
belong in this group and as such they
offer a very good picture at a decent
price in screen sizes up to 70 inches
the design is elegant with a relatively
slim black bezel and a solid metal stand
that wouldn't be out of place in a cb2
catalog this is an entry-level smart TV
which offers the usual Netflix and Hulu
Plus as well as a web browser the r 520
doesn't have 3d while the r550 does
though both are available for around the
same price online the TV does have
modern gimmicky features like screen
mirroring and MHL though it did have
limited success trying to use miracast
in particular but picture quality is the
main reason you will buy any television
and the sony is very good for the money
it beats the pants off both samsung six
and seven series and is up to four
hundred dollars cheaper while it doesn't
have the deep blacks or local dimming of
the m-series vizio contrast and black
levels are still pretty decent sound
quality is also a standout by releasing
less TVs in 2013 sony has shown it's
able to concentrate on making each one
just that little bit better the r5 20
and our 550 are very good options if you
want a large screen LCD and don't want
to pay too much money this has been ty
pendlebury for cnet com</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
