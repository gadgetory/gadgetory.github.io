two-in-one hybrid that actually kind of
works i'm dan ackerman if this is the
acer aspire switch 10 it's another one
in an endless stream seems of hybrid
systems those are windows laptops and
also transformed into tablets and maybe
have some in between modes unlike a lot
of those other guys I actually have a
fairly positive view of the switch 10 I
find it shockingly easy to use it
doesn't have a big clunky button or
hooks that you have to detach in order
to to remove the tablet screen or twist
it around it's basically two little
sticks that come up with a magnetic
catch I'll show you just kind of hold it
like this regular clamshell laptop and
then you just lift up on this part and
it comes up right off and then you can
use this as a tablet reasonably thin
Windows 8 tablet and then you can just
slide it back on its not the it's not a
you're not gonna get a hundred percent
every time but I got a better percentage
of getting the tablet on the first take
on this system that I have with a lot of
other hybrids I also like that you can
flip it around like this it's reversible
and put the screen on backwards and that
gives you what I call kind of that kiosk
mode like this for like presentations or
you can fold the whole thing down and
have kind of a thicker tablet I don't
know why you'd want that but it's kind
of the yoga style and you can of course
just carry around just the tablet with
it so switched end avoids the biggest
problem with these hybrids in that you
can actually put the two parts together
fairly easily it's not a huge clunky
hinge mechanism now as a small evidence
laptop it's okay the keyboard is
acceptable not fantastic the touchscreen
response is actually really good this
has got an intel atom processor in it so
it's not super speedy if someone's
yukonos netbook level performance output
for a small screen or just for a tablet
especially if you're going to use the
windows 8 tile interface here or these
apps it's actually fine now how much
you're going to pay for all this you can
get this version which has a 64 gig SSD
hard drive that's kind of small really
for about 3 99 if you cut it down to 32
gigs you can find it for 350 frankly I'd
spend the extra 50 bucks and get just a
little bit of extra hard drive space I
think 32 is probably too small for most
people to use just restoring just the
basic stuff they use all the time I'm
don't ackman that's the acer aspire
switched 10</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
