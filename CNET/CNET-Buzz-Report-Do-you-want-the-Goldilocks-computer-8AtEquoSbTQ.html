and this is the buzz report first the
gadget of the week Intel showed off a
new kind of mini computer this week
dubbed for a lack of a better name the
mid mobile internet device smaller than
a laptop bigger than a smartphone it's
an internet tablet mobile television gps
nav device voice over IP phone and of
course does email web and I am but it
won't really replace your cell phone
kind of too big for that and it won't
replace your laptop it's not big enough
to do that so what are we supposed to do
here Intel embrace a third device in our
mobile lives I suspect Intel may be a
major investor in either a company that
makes wall adapters or one that makes
belt clips or hallucinogenics now the
news will they'll be launching a device
to tackle apple's iphone digit times
says that may very well be the case with
this new dell device possibly arriving
later this year dell just recently got
out of the PDA business though so this
makes for a rather odd turn around
doesn't it I suspect dell realize
they've got a lot to offer the handheld
market you see where I'm going yep its
top five things that Dells thingy can do
better than Apple's iPhone thingy number
five make you wait 11 business days
while it's configured just for you
number four support it from another
continent number three make it run
Windows barely number two load it up
with crap where and number one make it
tacky looking come on folks we both know
that the real life dude you're getting a
Dell dude will be getting an iphone from
the Apple dude dude a blackberry outage
in the news this week nothing major just
the users in the western hemisphere the
outage wasn't too long though roughly 12
hours but when they got the system back
up the volume of pent-up email was so
huge the network kept farting and
sputtering as it tried to get back up to
full speed and as of today people are
still reporting
some of their BlackBerry's now can't
access the web now eight million people
currently use a crackberry and their
utter lack of preparedness for these
occasional failings really concerns me
so here's a proposal I say they should
all be required to spend two hours a
month using a trio just to keep their
coping skills sharp and finally while US
regulators just recently said no to the
idea of cell phone use in flight Qantas
is about to become the first airline to
allow texting in flight on the thumb
board of your very own phone you bring
with you that's a hell of a lot better
than listening to somebody talk for
hours in that little small cabin and
once again we'll see the Australians
sweep the thumb puppet category at the
next Olympics I'm Brian Cooley this has
been the bugs report thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
