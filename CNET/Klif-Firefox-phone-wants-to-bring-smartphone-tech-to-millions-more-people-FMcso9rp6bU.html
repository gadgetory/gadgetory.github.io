taking a look at this it's the orange
clip it's a tiny Firefox smartphone
let's take a look okay so let's talk
first about that Firefox OS software so
if you're not familiar at Firefox OS is
a little bit like Android it's a very
basic but very easy to use interface so
your apps are arranged in grids in these
nice little circular icons if you swipe
down from the top you get a notification
bar just like on Android and if you long
press this home button you can see all
the apps that you're using and that's
how you switch around to do multitasking
it's running Firefox OS version 2.0
which is the latest version and this is
also a dual SIM phone so it will accept
two SIM cards at once a little more
hardware this is a 3.5 inch screen it's
got a 480 by 320 pixel resolution now
that's not very high but bear in mind
that this phone is quite basic and quite
cheap and it should be alright for
things like social media and checking
email inside this thing there's a
dual-core processor clocked at one
gigahertz and if I flip it around you
can see that camera on the back that is
a 2 megapixel camera
there's no front-facing camera though so
unfortunately selfies are out of the
question so this phone is going to be
sold exclusively through orange and
you're going to get it as part of a deal
now that deal is a bundle it cost 40 US
dollars so that's a very cheap way of
getting hold of a smartphone and that
bundle includes things like text calls
and data this phone is going to be
coming to 13 different markets by the
end of the first half of 2015 so it's a
basic phone but one that's very cheap
and quite cheerful on the questura C net
Ted 2 C net for loads more from mobile
