your television you were wrong get ready
for 4k TV that means twice the number of
horizontal and twice the number of
vertical pixels for four times the
overall number of pixels on the screen
the result better picture better clarity
and better detail at Sony Pictures
studios here in LA they are ready for
and possibly even launching the 4k
revolution they're designing new cameras
shooting all new content and remastering
that big library of movies and TV so
let's talk about 4k specifically what
does that mean for consumers but we're
doing with ultra high-def is expanding
the range of colors that we can actually
put on the screen we're expanding the
range of contests so that the the
brightest right the highlights that
reflect off of something can really be
truly as much higher than the things
around them as they would be in real
life and it creates a greater sense of
immersion more realism in in looking at
the picture to make that realism and
immersion possible sony has built some
new cameras that can shoot 4k and even
8k native content 8k blasts all the way
to 76 80 x 40 320 pixel resolution
so we're gonna find out what we look
like on 4k they're rolling on us and
then what are some of the things that
you can do with a digital image that
comes out of a camera like this well one
of the things we've done with this is
when you decode the picture you can
decode it as a fork a picture or you can
decode at six here AK and what that
means you can do is that you can
reposition within the picture you can
zoom in you can blow up parts of the
picture and still have a full 4k image
and the 4k operation goes on over at
color works Sony's main hub for
post-production specialists work on
scanning and color correcting 4k content
and remastering older shows and movies
into 4k today they're restoring Lawrence
of Arabia in 24 k frame by frame what's
amazing to film nerds is that they're
resurrecting these movies from the
original 35 millimeter negative instead
of a process to print as a result
there's no image degradation because 35
millimeter is actually the 4k of its day
here's the before image of Lawrence of
Arabia and four after we got a chance to
visit Sony's viewing space the
difference won't be visible to you but
trust me it's major so if you can press
in to see the detail you'll see that
there's a great deal more detail in the
horses you can see that the the image
holds up even when you blow it up and
double it so you could just zoom and
zoom I mean even to the naked eye and
even standing off frame off access like
you said I mean you can see the
difference is phenomenal the 4k TV story
is even more than just the pixels new 4k
TVs can also display more colors than
existing HDTV set all that translates
into a new specification called
ultra-high definition or ultra HD it
also means ultra high prices at least
for now prices are coming down but
expect to pay between 5,000 all the way
up to forty thousand dollars for a 4k TV
so what is the the future of 4k
consumers are just starting to learn
about it you guys are way ahead of the
game what's good what's it gonna look
like in two or three years I expected is
going to be a little bit like we've seen
with HD and I think that it's reasonable
to expect that within the next three to
five years that 4k displays are going to
be more and more common so 4k is
inevitable and you'll be there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
