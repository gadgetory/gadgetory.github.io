first 360 video experience inside of our
studio I'm gonna do a little bit of the
Apple buy just to kind of get you an
idea of what you see around I'm all by
myself well except for our friends up in
the speaker so we can give this shot a
shot and we'll see how far I go okay
okay alright are we good yes okay here
we go in three two what's up Brian Tong
here back from vacation and back for
your weekly dose of the Apple bite now
first I would like to thank no shirt
August for you know holding down the
fort last week
although newcomers to the show probably
thought I was on acid which I was not so
let's get to the Apple versus the FBI
situation it's big
and gets more complicated by the week it
all started with the FBI's court order
for Apple to build a backdoor into iOS
so they could gain access to data that
was locked on the iPhone from one of the
now-deceased San Bernardino terrorists
they basically want their own FBI OS
clever huh now Apple said no Tim Cook
said it would be a major setback to
online privacy and a dangerous precedent
I'm onboard with Tim and Apple and the
tech world like Google Twitter and
Facebook agrees so how did this come
about
it's been confirmed by BuzzFeed that
government officials actually reset the
iCloud account password to the
terrorists phone once it was in their
possession Apple said this prevented an
auto backup on iCloud that could have
potentially given them more information
but of course it doesn't stop there in
addition to the San Bernardino phone The
Wall Street Journal reports the Justice
Department is pursuing court orders to
make Apple help them attract data from
about 12 other phones so where are we as
of now the deadline for Apple to respond
to the court order will be Friday
February the 26th and Apple is expected
to argue that its fight with the FBI
should be settled by Congress it's Apple
versus the FBI national security versus
user privacy on the surface but really
it has far more reaching implications
that could go as far as weakening data
encryption overall which makes this a
fascinating and important case so check
this out everyone watching if you guys
want your voice to be heard this is a
great discussion that we can have back
and forth look
this an email to the alpha-beta cnet.com
or tweet me responses if you can figure
it out in 140 characters and I will hook
you up with an apple white sticker who
doesn't want that
alright I guess you'd have to watch the
rest of the show to see what we talked
about please</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
