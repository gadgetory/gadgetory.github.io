styling and fashionable compact size but
just as that act is getting a little old
along comes act 2 a smartphone app that
helps raise the curtain on connected
cars let's drive the 2011 MINI Clubman
John Cooper Works and check the tech the
enormous sort of iconic speedometer in
the modern Mini has long been a silly
waste of space a Pixar --is-- caricature
of the original car but when you load it
up with an LCD screen navigation and new
connected technology that real estate
becomes pretty desirable ok it's 2011
I'm sitting in a mini and there's one
point I want to get across right away
I'm over the round goofy thing in their
cabin it was funny for a while
cute maybe chic that was just annoying
it's this whole bulbous salvador dali
meets it's a small world and it's just
annoying me to no end most importantly
though is this interface we have not yet
had a mini that has this interface on it
this is all new because it has the
latest navigation but also mini
connected let's take a tour vehicle info
is obvious stuff you've got some
settings for the system CD multimedia
this is going to bring you a variety of
choices including we've got our single
optical disc slot right here under
external devices we're going to find my
ipod touch or other iOS device I've got
that hooked up on this little pigtail
right there you can also of course hook
up a USB device like a thumb drive on
this same connector now the map
resolution is really good its standard
BMW stuff you've got this menu on the
left that drives me nuts to be honest I
just don't find that intuitive at all me
if you go along this left-hand side here
you've got to kick over to get to this
ribbon menu these never become natural
for me I never can quite remember what
these little icons are so I got up go
over each one and pause and wait for the
flag doesn't do it for me but maybe your
mind works differently most importantly
here's mini connected this is the really
interesting stuff let's spend a minute
looking at this look at all the features
mini connected has
when you connect your iOS device and no
Android yet by the way and I've got the
app on my ipod touch it works on ipod
touch as well as iPhone I've got a
newsfeed this is odd it's mostly mini
news but if I want and here's where
everyone always gripes like whoa whoa
well why are you putting news on the
screen well because if you want you can
have it read to you as evidenced
lightball 2011 was a hit parade of
massive proportions but ever stop to
wonder how does in the spotlight keep
their cool when things heat up and the
cameras start rolling wow that sucks I
had better text-to-speech on my PC I
think in the mid-90s you've got a
Facebook utility here again to make this
really lean so it's not too distracting
but to be honest is still distracting it
kind of strips things down and makes
them kind of clean here's our Twitter
application on the dash and again you
can scroll down to these things in a
very lean form and you've got unique
Twitter tools here favorite or
unfavorite retweet so they've done a
pretty good job of taking the most
popular tools out of the interfaces for
Facebook and Twitter and put them here
on the car contextual menu doesn't
answer all the questions that I get all
the time about isn't that insane to have
that kind of needless crap distracting
you from driving there are lots of
canned posts in the app for both
Facebook and Twitter none of which read
like you actually wrote them but instead
like whoever kidnapped you did to make
it look like you're okay to Google tools
in here Google search and Google sent a
car search of course lets me go search
for whatever I want and navigate to it
call the place what have you a pizza
joint whatever you want and Google sent
a car would be if you're at a Google
Maps and you want to send that to the
vehicle you can do that so it goes the
other direction from outside the car to
in now the controller I'm using to get
around everything you see on the screen
again it's not touch we do a voice
command but I prefer to use the
controller and it's an oddball down here
it's a version of I Drive but as you can
see it's physically implemented very
differently here's your home button
here's a back button that takes you
through previous screens you've been
accessing and most importantly here's
your controller this little chrome knob
sticking up here again you can turn kick
it around and press just like an eye
drive controller but the shape is
completely different
some folks are going to find this
a little hard to get their hands on it's
tiny Oh check this out I've got the
Pandora app on my ipod touch got it
cabled in like I've been doing for all
the many connected stuff and look it
when I launched the app it comes up as a
source as a function under Mini
connected now not at the same time if I
have many connected going I get those
choices like Facebook Twitter and web
radio if I have Pandora running I get
that instead so it's not fully
integrated but it's nice to have it
available to you this doesn't always
work on a lot of cars and because our
Clubman that asked we've got the turbo
motor hasn't changed in a long time on
these mini still 1.6 liter sidesaddle 4
with the turbo technology it's all
standard s stuff you're going to get 181
horsepower 177 foot-pounds of torque 0
to 60 on this front-wheel drive car is
about 6.8 with that manual 6-speed if
you get the automatic it gets a little
slower down to about 7.1 not
dramatically the MPG on this car is 27
35 get the automatic and shave 1 mpg off
of each number the Clubman is an odd
bird it's a stretch mini that is not
quite long enough to warm it back doors
not quite short enough not to the barn
doors in the back are a stylish retro
touch but that big mullion down the
middle is pretty annoying
now minis used to be the best little
point-shoot car on the road they're
still really good that way they're fun
handling cars but compared to a lot of
the other small cars that have come
along today they're no longer sort of a
class of one the ride is buttoned up
dialed in planted all those things you
expect fun a really well-made vehicle
that has some weight on it I'm glad
we've got the manual gearbox in this car
I think we had an automatic recently and
I was very unimpressed it was also a non
S though so let me tell you I'm not big
on that straight 1.6 with an automatic
that's a dog car you really want to look
into getting a turbo on any of these
vehicles or at the very least you're
going to get a non turbo make sure you
get the manual gearbox because that
other combination doesn't work this car
works nicely it's perky it gets along
lings good it's not a planted car even
with our our jcw package and the fact
that it's an S I could add some more
suspension tweaks to this car to really
straighten out the this thing the little
tippy little leaning and this is really
the worst speedometers to get a glance
at that needle which is a dark orange
against a graphite ring of relatively
small typeface for a big speedometer
because we have the LCD display is not a
good glance and see how fast I'm going
speedo you got to kind of stare at it
for a minute luckily you've got a
digital readout here on the tach just
under 33 grand gets you started for this
high trim mini again with the John
Cooper Works package then there's a lot
of adding to do to get it seen that
style first off if you want the
automatic that's 1250 I'd recommend
against it you want the mini connected
package for a grand that will get you
the LCD screen voice command USB and
iPod connectivity Bluetooth including
bluetooth streaming then you want to go
750 more to roll in the navigation
function within that and finally I'd
recommend the premium package which gets
you the Harman Kardon audio automatic
temperature control special wheels dual
panoramic roof and xenon headlights then
just find a nice stout putty knife and
some paint remover to get those pre
fatigue graphics off and you've got a
nice car
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
