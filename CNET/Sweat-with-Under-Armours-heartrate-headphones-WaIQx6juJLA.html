heart rate headphones they're designed
for working out and are rated IPX five
so while not fully waterproof they'll do
just fine in the rain and with sweat the
headphones worked with the you a record
app which lets you track runs and
workouts and receive audio updates for
things like pace distance and heart rate
zones you can also get accurate
on-demand updates on your heart rate by
tapping the underarmor logo on the right
ear bud other features include an inline
remote and microphone for taking calls
changing songs and changing the volume
as for battery life you can expect up to
5 hours of usage which is the same for
similar headphones overall they sounded
pretty good
and the hook design kept them in my ear
when walking and running but here's my
problem with them they feature an open
design and don't go far in the ear so
while this allows you to hear cars and
people around you and running it also
means they aren't very good for blocking
out noise and really aren't worth
wearing when you aren't working out and
at $200 that's a lot of money for a pair
of part-time headphones now while the
heart rate feature is cool most people
probably don't care about it and those
who do are better off getting a heart
rate running wash or using a chest strap

watch heart rate headphones check out my
