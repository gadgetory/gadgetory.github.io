babe back in an old soul watching plies
and children on the street
what we said about to do in building
this place was to build the ultimate
playpen for musicians this is how Bob
Weir envisions the future of music the
Grateful Dead frontman has created a
state of the art music and streaming
studio to broadcast unbelievably high
quality sounding music over the internet
to fans around the world welcome to TR I
do you want to just change the way that
people consume music or experience it is
it for the musicians or for the audience
or both it's for everybody music is for
everybody so for the musicians we come
here we have a great time for the
audience we try to make it really easy
Grateful Dead set the standard back in
the sixties of first guys paying
attention to the PA and building it we
streamed out the highest the consumer
can receive butting on the internet on a
regular basis both audio and video eyes
and we're only limited now by what the
consumer can receive so if you're
watching at home this is something
comparable to getting to see Bob where
the Grateful Dead or some other band
like in a coffee shop you know the
permanent dream it's the closest you can
ever get to actually being in the band
it is a studio but it's a live
performance studio so it's not sterile
like a normal recording studio is it is
built for live performance the sound is
amazing it's a very relaxed laid-back
atmosphere and it's in the true
traditional Grateful Dead
what the studio is in every sense mind
blowing at the center of it is the
constellation I could use a little more
nine years a cutting-edge sound system
developed by audio engineer John Meyer
to enhance the sound that musicians here
on stage will they call me the breeze
all around the sides and back there are
some 80 speakers hanging that soffit and
then hanging down from the ceiling you
also can't see them unless you look real
close through a bunch of microphones
there are a couple dozen of those and
they take it up in through software and
then put it back out through the
speakers how about this to begin with I
can show you that this is how this room
sounds all by itself you just turn
everything huh clap it's the room number
one club again now we're not now we're
in a theater again a smaller theater yep
no in a Cathedral oh wow again this is
another cathedral but on and on it goes
we've got anything from living rooms to
ballparks and everything in between we
haven't got the Grand Canyon yet so a
band can come in here and you guys can
play or they can play and they can
stream it and make it sound as though
they're anywhere in the room yeah and
we're what we're trying to do this right
now this is all on an iPad here but
we're trying to get it on a footswitch
the heart and soul of t RI is this audio
control room known as the inner sanctum
here a mix comes in from the studio and
that is pushed out to the world and this
is where the show all comes together the
live performance is then switched and
streamed out to fans we have a switcher
you know we have all sorts of different
monitors to see and behind this we can
watch all the different shots and it's
basically like a TV studio but it's for
the web the one hiccup in the system is
that on the other end a listener has to
have a fat bandwidth pipe and the
computer hardware capable of decoding
such a high quality signal otherwise the
music just sounds like regular old
streaming audio can you geek out for a
minute on how you're doing that and what
the limitations are filling at home is
just bandwidth right at home well its
bandwidth at home to enjoy it but it
started with Bob yeah and grateful dead
fashion he had an unlimited budget he
far exceeded the unlimited budget by
getting every possible new toy that can
push the fattest data rate out of here
Abby peaches and cream we built this
place with internet blood cast in mind
what we're trying to do is make it so
people will be able to gather at a
friend's house and everybody will be
able to watch basically a concert there
without having to drive a long way
after midnight
