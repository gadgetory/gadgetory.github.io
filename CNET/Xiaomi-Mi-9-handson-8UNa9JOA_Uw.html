Xiaomi me 9 now as you can see they come
in really nice colors and if you're
outside of China you're gonna get your
hands on these a lot sooner than you
could before the first thing you'll
notice by the Xiaomi me 9 are the colors
there are three colors that will be
available globally there's a blue a
purple and a black yes there are three
cameras on the back the main camera can
take pictures up to 48 megapixels in
size however Xiaomi says the phone will
use its AI to put together a very clean
and sharp 12 megapixel image by default
if conditions are right the me 9 could
take a full 48 megapixel picture if you
want one of the rear cameras shoots
ultra wide pictures Xiaomi says it uses
its software to correct for wide-angle
distortion unfortunately we didn't get
to test that out in our hands-on on the
front you'll find a 20 megapixel
front-facing camera to unlock you can
use the in screen fingerprint sensor
from my short time with the phone the
sensor was very responsive the phone is
very light and feels sturdy in the hand
the me9 is using shammies new UI
software on top of android 9 pi you
won't find an app drawer here instead
it's kind of like iOS with icons right
on the home screen to access your
already running apps you'll have to use
a gesture slowly swipe up and you can
access an app switcher everything felt
plenty snappy going from app to app and
that's probably because of the internals
inside you'll find the Qualcomm
Snapdragon 855 processor in tests the
855 performed up to 45% faster than last
year's model the Snapdragon 845 the
global edition of the Xiaomi me9 will
ship with 6 gigabytes of RAM there are
two storage options at 64 gigs or 128
gigabytes of internal space there is no
expandability though there is a fourth
model that will be available in China
only it's a Xiaomi me 9
transparent addition it's similar to the
meet 8 Pro and that there's a back that
shows a representation of the internal
components you're not really getting a
look into the phone this beast will come
with 12 gigabytes of RAM and 256 gigs of
storage all the models support qi
wireless charging as well as Xiaomi's of
charge turbo feature Xiaomi showed us
two wireless charges the support of
charge turbo a pad and a car dock they
are capable of charging a me9 at 20
watts to put that another way Xiaomi
says you'll be able to take a me 9 from
dead to 100% charge in 1 hour and 40
minutes wirelessly this is the Xiaomi me
9 will have full reviews at cnet.com
