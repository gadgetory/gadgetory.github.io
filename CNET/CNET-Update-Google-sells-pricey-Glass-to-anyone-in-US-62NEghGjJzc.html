yeah wearables are weird I'm Bridget
Carey and this is your cnet update
google is lifting the restrictions on
who can buy Google glass anyone the u.s.
can now spend fifteen hundred dollars
plus tax to own an explorer version of
what is essentially a face camera with
apps but for most folks there's probably
a better way to spend your money Google
glass is still in this open beta phase
it's one big social bug testing
experiment on how the world assimilates
two computers on a face and when it's
ready for prime time the price will go
down to something more reasonable
hopefully around two hundred dollars
because it is a smartphone accessory but
for the eager beavers that wants to pay
more to be the first to try it out
Google will happily let you order one if
it can sell glass too enthusiastic
technology evangelist it'll help put a
positive spin on a device that's faced
reputation as creepy geeky and intrusive
but the world has warmed up to wearables
for the wrist LG has a new smart band
that goes on sale in the US on Sunday
it's called the LG life band touch the
bracelet is part fitness tracker parts
smartphone remote control the display is
a touchscreen and if you put your hand
over the wrist it will silence a phone
call it also controls music health-wise
it counts your steps and connects with
LG's new heart rate earphones which have
sensors in them that measure the pulse
in your ear it works for both iOS and
Android devices the wristband costs 150
dollars but the earphones do cost more
they're one hundred and eighty dollars
now will most fitness bracelets measure
things like steps and movement the
jawbone up wristband also tracks your
driving habits you see jawbone now works
with this smart car tracker device it's
called automatic and you plug it into
your car to give you data on your
driving habits the feedback is supposed
to make you want to speed less to save
money on gas but when that information
syncs with the jawbone it'll
you feel bad if you drove somewhere when
you could have walked but there's
another odd twist to this merging of
information you can log your mood and
diet in the jawbone app so that data is
compared with where you drive to see
what route makes you happiest in order
to avoid road rage yeah I don't think a
nap can help with that but if you like
to try it it works for both iOS and
Android that's your tech news update you
can find more details and reviews on
these devices at cnet com from our
studios in New York I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
