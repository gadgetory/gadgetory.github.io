left not in the air not with soot but
all over VW's face we've got a big
problem with diesel gate
i'm brian coolie here with my top five
things BW has to do to clean it up
number five find someone to run BW
america the guy they had lined up to be
the new boss in the state's just bailed
he said his wife didn't want to move
here can you blame her she might run
into someone from the Sierra Club and
apparently VW had no backup exec lined
up and I put this down at number five
because VW has to keep making progress
on number four through number one
whether they have a leader in the US or
not companies tend to do better with
less chaos number four get to the bottom
of all this who knew when did they know
it and was there a C in their job title
those are all key when it comes to the
severity of fines and the depth of
firings that are coming now BW America's
current boss Michael horn told Congress
a couple of engineers were responsible
for this whole cheating tech this
physics a couple of software engineers
who put this info whatever reasons that
tells me either The Wizard of Oz is his
favorite movie or VW is the worst
overseen engineering company in the
world either prospect seems encouraging
number three compensate stakeholders
everybody has their hand out many of
them rightly so start with VW owners who
now find themselves making monthly
payments on a question mark wrapped in a
stigma riding on four wheels it took
just hours for class-action lawsuits to
crop up all over then there's
stockholders they saw 40% of their value
wiped out in 30 days that's like a tech
stock interest in cars is killing the
dealers Kelley Blue Book reports VW
Interest off 18 percent true cars says
VW diesel interest off over half
Automotive News says dealers aren't
happy about either number as you can
imagine and the Federal Trade Commission
is out there on behalf of all Americans
saying that VW live deceptive ads with
all those clean diesel commercial
analysts put a rough price tag of 40
billion dollars on cleaning up this
whole mess when everyone's paid number
to get TDI back on the road let's not
forget VW diesels were hot accounting
for 24% of their Us sales in 2014 so
they've got to bring them back
now the O 9 to 15 cars have known
cheating software but the 16s also have
software the EPA believes is at least
suspect so all of them are in quarantine
in the port part the VW plant in South
Carolina a combination of new software
new fuel injection hardware under the
hood and possibly new urea injection
gear under the chassis look like the
complex messy path by which TD eyes will
come back to market and will you even
like your car after that early test by
Consumer Reports found that power and
mpg suffered noticeably when they took
some cars and tricked them into running
clean number one fix the cars we already
owned this matters most because current
owners spent real money on what turned
out to be a lie that may not work as
well when it is fixed it may be worth
less when they want to sell it it's
gonna make them uninterested in
recommending one in the car business
everything starts and ends with happy
customers the US the Europeans in
California have given VW a variety of q4
2015 deadlines to at least get the fixes
design and then plan a recall and nobody
yet has ruled out a massive buyback if
the fix makes the car kind of crummy
it's gonna be a busy remainder of the
decade for what's shaping up to be
nonetheless the world's largest
automaker poor top-five list to weight
the car lover go to see net on cars calm
but non top-5</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
