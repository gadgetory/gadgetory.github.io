refresh as we're here looking at the
2013 models and you don't need a
scorecard to spot them luckily Ford gave
you a new face on all these guys they
all get kind of a Shelby like mouth now
on the front and a piano black strip
between the taillights in the back and
those taillights are also got some LED
technology in them as well but what
happens under the hood of the GT is the
most interesting story this car which
already had a pretty Rorty v8 now gets
up to 420 horsepower it's got a
different transmission as well that's
six-speed Automatic to go with the
performance of that engine now goes into
a full manual mode you drop it at a
particular gear and it stays there all
the way up to the redline and the fuel
cutoff so if you want to play manual in
your automatic you can do it now inside
all these Mustangs they've got a revised
about 4 inch size LCD between the gauges
and among the functions there is
something called track apps you can
monitor your acceleration your braking
and your lateral acceleration in other
words you can see exactly how badly
you're scaring yourself oh and check
this out you can equip these cars now
and I'm not kidding with what they call
the pony projector I don't see it on
this one but apparently it's a walk up
light when you burp the keys that's a
gutter or puddle light but it shows a
pony logo in the light pattern kind of
like the bat-signal I don't make this up
now among the hotrod Mustangs I've
always preferred the boss over the
Shelby this is more of a driver's car to
my feeling but the thing that was
missing was no possibility whatsoever of
getting Ford Sync in this car that made
no sense
the Fiesta have Sync well now that gets
fixed for 2013 and this guy will have it
too and I've saved the best well at
least the most for last
the Shelby goes to 650 horse for 2013
six hundred foot-pounds of torque what
will you do with that Ford says that 5.8
liter supercharged v8 is now the most
powerful production v8 in any car line
in America all I say is you're gonna be
parachutes because you might leave orbit
to earth if you're lucky</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
