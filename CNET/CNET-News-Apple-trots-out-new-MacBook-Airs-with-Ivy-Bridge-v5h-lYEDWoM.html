macbook air has revolutionized the very
idea of the modern notebook with this
all aluminum enclosure it's incredible
unibody architecture it is a
breakthrough and everyone is trying to
copy it but they find it's not so easy
our customers love how thin and light
and incapable this incredible consumer
notebook is and it is really changed the
consumer notebook market so we're going
to update it with some really great
features and updates for example the
latest processors we're now updating
macbook air with the new generation 3rd
generation Intel Core processors
otherwise honest are you British
depending on configurations they can run
up to 2 gigahertz of dual core i7 see
with intel turbo boosting they can get
as high as 3 point to give you hurts you
can configure up to eight gigs of memory
and that's now faster memory 1600
megahertz memory in the integrated
graphics that they run on a dramatically
faster up to sixty percent faster so a
really nice speed increase and as you
know the macbook air is built entire run
flash storage and now you can put even
more in it you can put up to 512 get
your buns it's terrible
so siddity and quick to the launch
applications to put up your machine to
wake up from sleep but now I'm making it
even faster it's up to twice as fast
before it's over 500 megabytes as reads
teen I know some of y'all don't know
what that means it is faster than any
hard drive that you can put in a
notebook today we're also making the i/o
faster on aware Avenue USC three and USD
three is really the tough gets ten times
faster than us speak to now other people
started to ac3 into their products as
well and this is how they do it so
they're all ports on there maybe usually
three for you three to four color code
them so you can tell the difference
that's not how we do it so here's the
macbook air as you know the macbook air
has a port on each side on customers
like that and we're gonna have USB 3 as
well as duty to support so you don't
have to think about it you just use
whatever port you want to the same
camera technology that we have inside of
the macbook pro facetime ATT 780 720p
camera to cross the board a lot of
really nice updates you know the macbook
air comes in 11 h and 13 inch size so
here the configurations let me bring up
the 11-inch first let me highlight some
of the things that have changed so it's
soft 1.72 gigabits dual-core ipod
there's more memory at the entry
configured staff as well as up to 4
gigabytes of memory and we've got the
integrated graphics now sixty percent
faster of course faster flash faster USC
and the prices of 999 in 1099 that's one
hundred dollars less expensive than
before and here are 13 inch
configurations they see they start with
a 1.8 figure it's dual core i5 faster
memory faster graphics faster USD in
1199 and for 299 both one hundred
dollars less expensive than before
so that's the update to the macbook air
and best of all start shipping today</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
