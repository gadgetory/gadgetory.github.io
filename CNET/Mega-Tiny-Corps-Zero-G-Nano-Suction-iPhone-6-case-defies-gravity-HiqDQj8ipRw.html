to give you a quick look at a prototype
iPhone 6 case I've been playing around
with in advance of its debut on
Kickstarter it's called the 0g
anti-gravity case it's from a startup
called mega tiny Corp it looks like your
standard iPhone case but it's back is
covered with nano suction material which
is basically made up of thousands of
tiny suction cups that allows you to
stick your iPhone to almost any smooth
surface you can buy $10 nano suction
pads right now that you can stick on the
back of the case but mega tiny says this
is the first case that will have nano
suction material integrated into the
case itself the final cases will have a
cutout window for the Apple logo and be
cleaned up a little but the concept is
the same what's cool about the material
is that while it's really sticky you can
put the case in your pocket and not have
it grab on to a bunch of lint and other
crap and even if you do get some dust
and particles on it you can easily wipe
them off with a damp cloth while the
folks at Megaton II say the case will
hold up well over time I can't confirm
that since I've only used it for a few
days I left the case overnight stuck to
a window and it was still stuck there in
the morning so it adheres really well
that said I'd probably use a screen
protector for a little added protection
and yeah mega tiny happens to sell those
too I'm David karna and that's the
zero-g antigravity case that's due out
in June for both the iPhone 6 and 6 plus
it'll retail for around $50 on Amazon
but mega tiny will have earlybird deals
for less than $40 thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
