once shiny new Mac will begin to slow
down sure it may be frustrating and you
may want to go out and buy a new one but
there's no need because there are a
number of ways you may be able to regain
some speed but before you engage in any
maintenance it's recommended that you
backup your data to an external drive
which you can easily do using the Mac's
built-in time machine feature the first
thing you want to do is check for our
software update new versions of Mac OS
contain performance enhancements and
security improvements to keep your Mac
running smoothly and safely head to the
Mac App Store and click on the update
tab to see if there are any updates
available now over the years you've
probably cluttered your Mac with files
and applications you no longer use or
need if this is the case it's time to do
some cleaning start by looking in the
Applications folder if there are apps in
there you can't remember installing or
never used simply move into the trash to
reclaim some hard drive space just don't
forget to empty the trash out every once
in a while next up you will want to go
through and either delete old files or
add them to a cloud service like Google
Drive or iCloud open the finder and
select a folder from the sidebar for
example I'm gonna choose the download
folder next click to sort them by size
and delete the larger files you no
longer need you will also have the
option of dragging and dropping the file
to a cloud service for safekeeping
this way you'll be able to free up some
space on your Mac while still being able
to access important documents now if
your Mac is slow to boot up the problem
may be there are simply too many
applications to open at startup it's
likely you never set these apps to
launch but some apps are set by default
to change this head to System
Preferences followed by users and groups
then click on the login items tab in the
top right to see a list of apps that
open when you boot up your Mac now
simply remove the check marks from the
apps you no longer want to open up start
now if you have done all of this and
nothing has changed there is the option
of upgrading to a faster hard drive like
a solid-state drive or adding more RAM
this method won't work on all Macs
especially newer models and whilst not
too difficult some novice users may be
better off simply buying a new computer
to see how to swap a hard drive or add
more RAM check out how to Zena</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
