apps out there finding that special
someone can be difficult that's why
there are so many apps that find you a
partner
but these days you've got to have a
gimmick say hello to the strangest of
the strange coming at number five is
toffee dating it's the first dating app
for people who are privately educated so
if any of you wound up going to a public
school
forget toffee it's not for you you
commoner here's a line from Toffees
description toffee nose and research
shows that people with similar
backgrounds are more likely to stick
together if you have shared similar
experiences and are like-minded yes one
of us one of us there are not a lot of
reviews for this app on Apple's App
Store but it has a whopping one star out
of five
number four is luck see the company says
luck C is the number one Millionaire
Matchmaker app let's take a look at some
of the features the service is free if
you earn more than $200,000 or if you're
voted in by other users based on
attractiveness you can sort people by
wealth or if they're hot or nearby
because why not luck see also says that
41% of Luxy singles earn a million
dollars or more we're at number three
and that is hater liking things in
common with someone is very important
hater
takes a different view matching people
by what things they mutually hate hater
used to publish some infographics
letting you know who hates what let's
take a look at top hates by zodiac sign
it turns out that capricorns do not like
dirty bathrooms meanwhile Pisces hate
nuclear bombs
there's no info on who hates dirty
bathrooms caused by nuclear bombs though
number two is settle for love the name
itself sounds like a downer doesn't it
here's what sets settle for love apart
from the rest of the field when you
start your profile you create a list of
good attributes and bad ones the good is
called shine the bad is called shade for
shine you answer questions like what
makes you shine and what are your
strengths for the shade side you upload
an imperfect picture of yourself
you can put your imperfections right up
front so in some respects settle for
love gives others a more well-rounded
view on a person but it's still odd and
then number one is the new app and
inspired this video Samsung's
refrigerating the best way to explain
this is by reading you Samsung's own
copy refrigerating is a service that
helps you to find love based on the
content of your fridge simply upload an
image and let the world know what kind
of person you are
refrigerating will then hook you up with
a variation of fridges of different
tastes to pick and choose from oh man
you've got to love Samsung or you get to
find love thanks to Samsung do you know
of any other weird dating apps let us
know oh my as act iron I'll see you
online but Nana dating</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
