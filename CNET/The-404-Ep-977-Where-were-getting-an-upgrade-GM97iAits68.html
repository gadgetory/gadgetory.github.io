very negative way keeping my desk now
I'm just kidding Wilson's out

raining on Chinese near wilson celebrate
through karaoke he better be outside

he better be in line for the parade in

firework only to have a go out by the
damp air yeah i love how wilson on
friday was trying to convince all the
other chinese people in the office to
take monday OC really he is the only one
that actually followed through that it's
like senior cut day and you're the only
one that yeah cut yeah well we moved
that to next wednesday back sorry I
should have roll with that I could have
stayed out later after the Giants want I
know yeah how about those giant he
celebrated yesterday I celebrated all
the way through I I you know the
funniest thing is I went out maybe like
10 20 friends deep to see the game you
might have with 20 people we were
upstairs and dances it's awesome and I
barely saw the game really I barely saw
I I look you know I obviously because
who's just so many it was just it was
the honesty was a firetrap I'm sorry to
say this it was a so crowd like you'll
stop letting people in yeah it was so
great well it's alright cuz you didn't
miss a lot I mean the game was fairly
boring wasn't it was it not I mean up
until the end of the third quarter notes
it's always interesting when your team
wins yeah for sure well even so I mean I
was watching the game and I was really
into it cuz I uh you know maybe made a
wager with with the internet a gentleman
a gentleman's bet thank you yet nobody
was the budget handshaking right what
you do wanna tell us what the bet was us
maybe like a gentlemanly wager how many
roses did she was 50 rows bedroom boxes
of cigars these guys ok cool and a lot
of 50 to go no I 155 cigars but the fact
of the matter is this gentleman the game
was sort of boring until the second half
when things start to pick up the only
reason I really also cared to is because
our sister office out in San Francisco
you know where this is like the only New
York San Francisco sort of thing but
with the button of the heads not going
to be a fan of the Yankees ever because
I can't stand them but you know football
I don't really pledge allegiance to any
team any team that plays in New Jersey's
if I'm a fan of as the Jets and Giants
do and so it felt good to beat the San
Francisco paper I heard a lot of people
yesterday talking about the game didn't
watch myself a turn it off after Steven
Tyler servicing in the National
he sang the national and see that the
only part that I said online we watch
the entire program sort of his bad is
bad yeah he's not really good singing
kinda Raven quotas way to the amino me
wrong as mr. a legendary band but
they're really didn't wasn't really
known for its vocal expiration is yeah
yeah all the expert gave up this guy's a
judge right yeah he's a judge on
suggesting other people which I also
watching that I watched it yesterday
there to there like one in the morning
I'm sorry man the viewership is I'm
gonna say Protoss almost like an idol
that shows for stupid people well that's
tough when you have like the voice it's
right by me like you agree I don't watch
if I guess it's for first of all I take
personal offense to that because I
watched the entire season last year now
don't get me and I what makes it stupid
it's just very no no he didn't say it's
new but he said to people who watch it
uses generalization I know any delays
and I'm part of that group too because I
used to watch Marietta so I'm stupid as
well why do you say that just is the
same thing over and over again I mean
it's literally been what 11 seasons like
who come on read it it's been ok I admit
that last last year Scotty McCreery and
now there's like Jennifer Lopez and and
I need a change I me likes to use what's
happened now no one's quitting all it is
is a big forwarding coke commercial
regardless my point is that after i
watch that I heard a lot of people
talking about how much they hate San
Francisco so much that you know the
normally Jets fans they actually hate
the giants but they'll still root for
them over San Francisco is kind of like
a lesser of two evils kind of thing okay
what's what he just said I he lets
goalless isn't it like a shuck and jive
with me what do you just do there yeah
well I want a wow how do we get weird
that people hate San Francisco so much I
hate it they'll still root for Tina they
don't really like over San Francisco uh
dude IKR you are like my fan and right
back in the gold okay so here's the
thing with that Justin number one is two
teams playing in the same building yeah
I get to jazz playing cymbal yeah right
also the Giants and Jets don't have that
rivalry of two local teams like you
would think they would not like have you
make the Mets and Yankees like you and
even that rivalry is dying because the
Mets are so freaking terrible
I mean right so that sort like if it was
you know like the Red Sox in the Yankees
that's a huge rivalry mention how they
don't no one would ever cross the fence
on that they need to start hating each
other a little bit more if you would
like that yeah they do it is not that
big of a beef I feel like why Rangers
Devils is a huge er uh beat writer yeah
I seen you beat up for now never do
crazy as a gang fight though wasn't like
that but anyway that's the story with
what happened over the weekend so it's
very exciting and you know to our cnet
SF people you know hey sucks to be you
yeah enjoy that losing have a bit proud
there's there was bets made apparently
our our our buddy Eric while made a bet
with some of the people at ness effing
they have to wear Giants and New York
gear which is pretty awesome if you ask
me yeah that's pretty cool I mean that's
worth the whole win right there sure all
right uh let's talk about other news
that happen over the weekend okay uh
everyone knows before we ended the week
last week megaupload got shafted taken
down by the FBI and now other file
sharing dump sites as i call them that's
that's the right nomenclature but that's
a slang we're gonna go ahead and say
that's a slight right but uh you know
filesonic one of the biggest file
sharing websites on the internet right
turned off uh you know public download
right so that will this is man I you
know how when we covered the story last
week on the show the whole megaupload
getting shut down yeah we were not that
worried we're like oh you know pirates
always gonna be one step ahead of of
like you know the mpaa the re right but
now yes over the weekend filesonic a
huge um i think they're called storage
lockers not outside don't buy dump site
are they ended their rewards program and
they're also not letting anybody
download files that you didn't upload
yourself personally yeah which is
obviously a huge hit people don't go
there to back up their stuff you know
whether it's legal or not should be all
on file share but the you know let's
give people the benefit of the doubt
yeah i think some people still use those
sites and like we heard from all those
tweets that came in last week when
people are outraged over the megaupload
are shut down right there
are still some people who legitimately
use this from selling businesses that's
the huge thing to huge business uh
applications for this mm-hmm I think a
lot of people were upset though because
filesonic also fileserve shut down
another website so what do we have we
have we have a couple of prey to even
say it no no don't say the name yeah I
say they're all kidding aside there are
still uh uh the vast majority of these
types of sites are still untouched yeah
the thing is that they're not free to a
lot of people pay thirty dollars and up
a year for their premium service model
lets you upload more storage space with
that I think they're getting really
shafted yeah that that that seems to be
the victims of this situation yeah yeah
i don't know i'm wondering if legitimate
cloud storage lockers are next like
box.net for example which i personally
use and this is what I've always been
nervous about is when i upload my
personal files into a cloud sharing
service like this if something happens
where the government shuts them down
what's going to happen to my personal
data are other people gonna have access
to that it's a good questions me nervous
a good question almost like a storage
room like they have like a love like a
TV show the auction off your data yeah
and you could buy something data are you
be i got microsoft word six yeah yeah
it's just the news yeah go for 39
centers windows 98 not good that's why I
keep all my data under my bed you're
right is my mattress we know it got a
data that is yeah adult data it's a
different kind of know but this is
legitimately scary do you do you have a
storage and cloud sites like this I I
don't you know I you know I mean I you
know I was thinking the iCloud I'm like
yeah you know only thing I using this
for mostly documents i just use a
dropbox and i used a free tour nifty
good right I'd rather walk around with
like a 32 gigabyte thumb drive in my
pocket yeah then they're never much
stuff just floating around up there just
here I just I don't I don't trust it
actually hard story it's really
interesting because everyone knows
because I've talked about a lot that I
sort of prepared my own cloud storage
system within the last year with the
synology uh you know drive i have an ass
this ness and you know it's great
because it's super reliable for me but i
still there's still something about it
where I'm just like man I
you like I feel like I'm still
vulnerable somehow you know i mean III i
hear you because it's definitely like an
uneasy feeling because I i have like old
like ide hard drives SATA drives romina
console you know every time capacities
go go you know go up right good to get a
better price I've like hard drives of
hardship and and there's so many
redundant files because i'm so paranoid
one goes losing yeah and that's the one
thing that I really appreciate even
though people not a big fan of it about
at least like back of the day like DVDs
and CDs you can stack those things on a
spindle leave on a shelf your gravy you
never really worry about that yeah it'll
stuff you can least physically see the
disk you could wipe it off your even
share shave a layer down if it gets
damaged but with a hard drive when it's
gone it's go on and that's that's what's
also scary about solid state drives are
quicker but they don't give you a side
of when they're going yeah they just go
hey Jason everything like a regular
platter drive you got to know you here
or just it just operates really slowly
good coin and you got ever thought about
and you go you wait let me back this up
in and for those who hear that click I
would suggest grabbing file by file not
trying to do a whole background at one
time because because if you try to copy
it at all at one time and it goes on you
you lose everything so just maybe get
grab the crucial things first right and
you know right that's crazy you bring up
a really good point because those are
mechanical pieces moving around right as
opposed to a solid state drive which is
basically a gigantic flash card will you
work with a lot of solid-state drives in
the lab have you noticed any of them
failing do they just shut off well I
haven't I don't get to keep them that
long because their endurance systems
that ship and usually the primary drive
for the boot the boot out the operating
system would be on a solid-state the
secondary drivers you know like maybe a
two terabyte a terabyte right Ivan I've
even gotten some system with to raid
solid-state there really quick but the
thing is I've never had them extensively
to do that and another thing that
another people a lot of people aren't
aware of is that you're not supposed to
defrag a solid state either you can
damage it as well doing that huh and
I've noticed when some vendors send
their systems in they don't disable the
defrag which they should oh man that's
interesting stuff i I've had I've had
flash cards uh far down on me really
yeah how's that happen I don't know like
on my on my EVO I had a 16 gigabyte
microSD card
that one day just stopped working and it
was unrecognizable by any computer
couldn't and I literally had you know
all these uh photos in and all this
music on there and it's just gone yeah
it's just backs up the other that's not
mean well that's the thing every now and
then like what I'll do is when I'm
getting a new phone I may just plug my
old one and copy everything over to my
desktop yeah they're like certain photos
of my son I have that I want to move
over but yes in terms of files it is
annoying what about um I was reading
this the other day and I the name of the
app escapes me for Android there's a
really good backup service that you can
get for free i think i think it's called
drop squeeze or something like that
robbing them where every photo you take
automatically gets put up into you know
like Flickr Picasa whatever you want to
go on and the same thing with I know if
it does it for music I know does for
photos that's something I could really
get on board with were like everything I
take you know automatically goes in now
have Galaxy Nexus and that's solid state
on board right i believe it's ours it's
gotta be uh so yeah it's you know so
sort of nervous about that it's hard to
keep track a lot of a lot of that stuff
too like for example i had a flickr
account that i paid for is a premium
like a pro account and i uploaded a
bunch of photos but then my year
subscription expired and they don't let
you see all of the photos you've
uploaded unless you're a paid
subscribers brie your attitude gigabyte
cap right i uploaded more than two gigs
like i think i had like three or
something like that I couldn't see that
one extra gig that I had to pay for ya
in order to expose I've an idea i mean
you're talking about that gig thing just
made me think about it nothing like
everything you sign up everything you go
to you have to sign up for right we need
a company and anybody can have this idea
one company that goes out there you
create one login that just works for a
bunch of companies well somebody to set
up an agreement like that maybe Google
can do it let's sort of like with
facebook login right facebook login but
I'm talking about like for all these
little hole-in-the-wall sites but you
just you hate first name last name
gender cities thing I mean I don't know
how many things I've just not bothered
with because I had to fill out all this
long ass form just to get like one photo
up or 1x such a bummer one extra meg of
storage is some crazy it just drives me
crazy on this forum something on and all
it is just just gathering information I
understand that that's why I be great if
you can
like when aggregate just puts all this
good feel like that exists already
there's like one password for all of
your storage locker passwords i forget
was the facebook line i need his care
that open ID was what was the thing that
but that's the thing the thing that
makes me worry the facebook login is
that's what exactly it is it is our
facebook locket so do you really want to
plug this in on some third-party site so
they can have your login information and
it's only that though you know face once
you're logged in through facebook on
another site then it's just just mining
information even not just about your
personal information about your habits
and exactly i would just like to walk
and go into a site and just create a
generic login a generic password that
doesn't track to any other thing that i
can just use everywhere that doesn't
connect it that doesn't connect it to it
just from there and they handshake with
one another I don't want Facebook
accessing my foursquare so I check in to
foursquare and it goes on my facebook i
want i want it separate but i want one
log in i want to do this again and again
and again 20 bring this up because you
know you hear so many people on the
internet worrying about their privacy
all I don't want to give my name to this
I don't wanna go there I'm gonna get
spam gonna do that and I recently just
found out that yeah you can worry about
the internet and what you know Google
does with your information but have you
ever received like actual mail like spam
mail like likely as us like as a
repercussion from doing something
through google no no well guess what
when you get a ticket a speeding ticket
okay your own freakin town will sell you
out and sell your name and really you've
noticed more junk mail coming in hundred
percent as soon as i got that speeding
ticket i got like two three weeks ago
yeah my own freakin town sold me right
the f out i just sold my information to
everybody and now i'm getting emails
from you know lawyers and some naughty
mail snail mail correspondence from
lawyers i will defend you this in that
guy yet Wow nonsense everyone's all up
in arms on the internet guru okay so out
the freakin town you live in is gonna
sell you out the second you break the
law away no Jay Rizzo because you and
your on the for old no absolutely not I
mean you could argue that snail mails
more damaging I mean to the environment
obviously but also your time it takes
four to six is elitist any mail has
anyone gotten a man than all you know
what I'm gonna I trust this guy I'm
gonna freakin you know have
represent me to business it's ridiculous
that your own government is willing to
sell your name and address to people
it's ridiculous that they have a
processing fee for your ticket your
ticket could be like you know I remember
I got like a cell phone take it like
back in the 90s or whatever think was
like forty dollars for the ticket when I
was like twenty dollars for the ticket
15 or 20 oz would take whatever yeah but
it was like a forty-dollar processing
fee I was like that's more than the
ticket was the most absurd thing I said
well you know what I'll process it let
me get back there I'll process it myself
because I'm like what do you get off of
this handling fee processing fee you
know people are funny that and the term
pre-owned it's used people it's not it's
used use dude he's not real mean people
is so slick with the work that were just
crazy processing fee handling fee prio
and I'm like there's other ways of
raping you just say tax yeah that's what
the government does tax um you know
getting back to your spam thing your
spam snail mail yeah have you seen those
email sites were if you put in your
address or fill out a form it'll be like
a do not mail you get at it's like a do
not mail list do you think those lists
actually work or those games just get
your email and I barely know AI feel
them you really no way to tell yet there
cuz you don't know how are you gonna
like who's what third-party you know
research group is gonna conduct right
you know an indifference another survey
you know I mean yeah I mean those do not
call spams I feel like those work
because I haven't gotten one in a really
long time I don't get after i Jennifer I
don't get any uh like sell junk oh
really i'm getting so i can so i get a
lot and that to me is is invaluable i
feel ya the the fact that I've been able
to go this long I've had this cell phone
number for 15 years yeah and I've never
once that I can remember I've gotten
jump I've never ever to send Jeff some
junk mail no you don't you get i get
tells John yeah I get talked a lot worse
that might be because of what I'm using
the phone to call and text message but
but do for you regardless it's pressing
on well I think one way to avoid that
and I don't do it is like whenever you
see those commercials that say if you
want this ring tone text 555 has never
never done
to do that never never just texture I
mean they'll even the all-star when
you're doing the all-star voting you do
from your phone I'm like you know what
Dottie what do that either I never do
that that's probably the way to avoid
getting like you know text junk Israel
but texting one of those once your
numbers out there it's out there and
there's no real you know language that
I'm sure you can you know get your hands
on the language that gives tells you
your rights or the terms of service
automatically enter into the second you
text one of these totally curious i'm
not blaming anything right now but what
about the Red Cross I mean I donated a
lot of money around the time of the
earthquakes and tsunamis I mean if I was
if I was leading up the Red Cross yeah
and I'm all about getting as much money
for charity as i could write right you
put that towards charity I don't know
and put a pass I don't know I won't
blame them either I mean you're the own
ten that you live in is very ready
willing and able to sell your
information back to other people this is
a very cyclical conversation I just
realized that a lot of my texts and call
spam might be because of all the voting
I've done through american idol there
you go weird you guys again had a big
reason amazing three pound I call a lot
and text a lot less I mean it's free uh
Taylor Hicks was a big guy you really
want him to make it was as named Taylor
last last year was like four years ago
yeah how's the less you know what you
know what I'll say this then for those
who feel it necessary find it necessary
after tax you can use as a nap talkatone
that you can use on iOS devices and on
google android devices you can use
google voice so my suggestion would be
text via your google voice number i like
this way to get spam junk through google
voice you could filter blog delete
without even being bothered mark I good
advice from the JK that's what I say we
got to take a break when we come back
we'll get some calls from the public and
some emails Joey will help us sift
through the madness all when the 404
returns stick around we will be right
back this is the 40
or ever f'ers the show where we all sing
songs I very graves here and I don't
know if you've heard about this thing
about trumpets being heard all over the
world but I'm hearing it now and it's
supposed to be signaling the end of the
world or something everybody's here oh
no it's not coming from outside inside
those see what this is worth coming from
it's just my cat playing the keyboard
clear to welcome back to the 404 uh
people are having problems with our live
stream but we're going to look into that
but it's alright because you downloaded
this after the fact so good for you

it still exists once the internet is
over yeah um the internet is crowded it
is pretty crowded there's a lot of tubes

don't know what that would like a weird
Skeletor and deeper and deeper um I got

sleeve hello thank you for calling movie
though yeah God the closet is Umi phone
and press press one now that's what I've
been waiting for that's awesome remix um
so let's see what we have here oh this
was weird on Friday Justin I were
talking about what are the toughest
questions that your kids can ask you as
a parent right and one of them was about
why do birds fly south for went for the
winter and I believe this is a teacher
who had a student come up to him and say
this hey guys from the fourth-largest
show this hearing you talk about birds
flying south for the winter ironically
enough i'm a teacher and earlier today
one of my students was telling me that
if you put a magnet on a person knows it
physically cannot fly it has something
to do with magnets so really dumb for
just a minute then again it was you know
how its mass so kind of thought the
trade-off but some less yeah keep hangin
on personality alright so he didn't he
doesn't say whether or not it's actually
true right I don't know man that sounds
dis ok so if four people I couldn't hear
the voicemail that student was saying
that if you put a magnet on a bird's
head it wants nose on its nose it won't
be able to take off basically be yeah
has there been a huge snopes me right
now has there been a huge like you know
study on this to like well you know what
was the 300 magnets all three hundred
birds beaks and last thing we can try is
putting a magnet on this thing's nose I
mean we've done everything to screw with
this bird and it's so weird I hate these
urban legends you know yeah I never know
what is it was a limp like salt on their
tails no that's a snail if you put salt
also about a little electrical level
that makes the alka-seltzer thing is
also true as resin tablet at every will
make it explode pop pop goes the pigeon
I've tested that myself have you really
I bet you have you said that like you do
something hi papa I don't like there's
nothing online about snopes magnetic
birds so
and I I call BS on that kid yeah so hey
there little kid you know what the hell
you don't last week also talking about
uh obviously the big news from Apple as
we could text books in iBooks Author and
stuff like that and then we started
getting into like whether or not uh this
country was spending enough money on
students right I found out over the
weekend that we actually spend more
honest on students than any other
developed country which is shocking and
terrifying resident know that okay uh
n-new Jersey actually spends the most
per student would know that but uh yes
so basically this guy's talking about
what happens to all of his uh sixth
grade students in his town it before
this is uh dread calling from Isaac uh
here in Iowa and guys are talking about
these iPads book covers and all that oh
come get my my kids they go to do they
go to school here in Iowa and I mean I'd
say there's probably a couple thousand
students they get this but 6th grade
through 12th grades have all been issued
I max the school Edina my max and and
all the elementary school my other kids
they uh they all regularly mess around
on iPads and their classrooms
educationally uh but and I also use book
covers so you know just thought i'd let
you guys know that's pretty cool man i
would really uh i mean if if he's
correct in what he's saying they all get
imax maybe that's just what they get um
in school I don't think they like
shipping with an I'm a grey or put this
under your you know shoulder the the the
the way the world shifting is really
crazy because when you hear things like
that my mind automatically tracks to
like you know what about the lower
income areas and the disadvantage these
kids are going to be any terms of just
being I mean my son gets busy with my
iPad yeah and I just wonder about those
kids that just don't I mean a lot of
them are fortune because their parents
have smart phones you get to play with
it but right it just it just really it's
like a really unfair advantage yeah that
the certain minority kids a don't out of
course access to these things I mean
kids that have grown up with touchscreen
devices will probably learn better
through an iPad that they're comfortable
with right it won't seem like learning
as much as reading a book is but you're
right you make a good point
not all kids grow up with that kind of
technology like okay what do we do with
the old stuff so like miss school got
all the new imacs whatever it had to
replace something where does that go
right you know not right where does our
I mean one case i don't like just
throwing things away like i'll go around
the office you know we you know you know
we are printers or whatever we you know
the computer for Justin and his mom
whatever I don't like to see things go
to with your seen it would just be nice
if there were a way to get these things
to the right places without someone
making a profit there's uh are there are
some organizations some like electronic
redistribution organizations that do
stuff like that that sort of you know
take uh people's I don't say scraps but
people's leftover technology and give it
to people who don't have any yeah sure
but I don't know I don't know where it
all goes but uh I feel like when you
were like did when you guys were in high
school did you get any was there any
like sort of really cool stuff that the
school was like hey you're gonna learn
on you know some bad there were there
were computers well I mean I had a
computer but my computer is an apple too
plus right yeah so there was nine and i
was very fortunate to get that good
because those things are really
expensive back in the attic friend who
just bought the 2e yeah so my parents
bought the two plus off him but you know
my family to have money like that they
would have been able to go out and buy
me we're talking about like putting the
phone on the modem like literally taking
the research yeah i'm playing like
choplifter and stuff you know like like
a floppy floppy disk you know it's like
those things are really expensive back
in it geez how old are you yeah this
would it this way my screen I had I had
I had I had the green screen it was
black green I remember that yeah we had
that many letters yeah and you know I
was very fortunate but not a lot of
people with that fortunate it makes you
think because and not to mention had I
not had a friend that was able to afford
one knew I wouldn't been able to get one
you know for sure I thought you know I
have old school credit do I've died of
typhoid fever many a time yeah yeah you
80 but it's true though no that's how I
know your old scrap malaria for a while
I'm here I've killed so many deer oh my
god that's ridiculous how many times you
called me oriental 2 i'm totally Douglas
I'm not no damn
damn road you hotel then what about you
in high school I remember getting a
lesson on how to use Doss in elementary
school that's how old I that's pretty I
remember like brun load run it was like
Brian yeah yeah I remember them telling
me like okay if you want to go back in
the directory you have to type in CDs
odd on right or like dir dash W I
remember them at telling me those very
high school are in middle school before
we learned how to play like you know I
was like you know the funny thing is
like where I work now is great but I was
so impressed myself back in the day when
we can like take the windows 98 you'd
make a directory on the hard drive
install the windows 98 this to the hard
drive yeah copy to the hard drive as an
insult I was so impressed with myself
when I first to do that it's like only
you know make directory Kashi all right
i said no i am god I've got me look at
me I'm controlling the machine I
remember I was in day camp why was an
outside no I but there's one activity
they had called computer lab and they
sat us in there with about 12 computers
and I forget what it was I was too young
to remember and we were like programming
and illustration uh top by dots right
round by dots and it was like saying you
know this row this column it was more of
a grid program really I but it was
disguised as yet out of like you're
happy don't I deserve and all I made it
say was like hello yeah you know in like
big block letters right that was a big
achievement it was like one step above
pushing tax into paper and then read the
paper up get more or less kinda like
that exactly that's a good point all
right we got one last call talking about
mega upload let's see if we agree with
this guy what's up for for this is Titus
child from Houston there are two things
I want to talk about with megaupload the
problem with megaupload is that the FBI
is charging them with the fact that they
knew the site was used for illegal
operations and they promoted it that's
why they're being taken down okay
because they're at a if they're knowing
that they are doing illegal operations
brings them outside the umbrella of I
think it's called the digital rights act
megaupload is a legal operation as long
as they are just like as long as they
are just the dumb pipes just like
YouTube don't is uh you know YouTube
will take down any type of video that's
uploaded uh once they're notified they
don't have any type of knowledge if
anything if a user upload something as
illegal alright so now what he's saying
is that megaupload is guilty of
promoting the fact that they are used
for illegal activity is that the I don't
know if it was promoting but from the
story that i read they actually looked
at the chat logs and email logs of the
employees and some of the employees
internally discussed how they knew
people were distributions like a syrian
operators no i mean i mean like it's not
a secret that mega up of course not but
the FBI basically chose their target
right and did their research and really
you know it's sort of like whenever they
catch someone you know like a big drug
dealer there's like watching for nine
months yeah and that will document
everything and it sounds like that's
what happened when they go right dude
what forget you know I just when you
said that and doc we said drugs like I
can't walk home hmm without smelling or
seeing someone smoking up talking about
a real drug I'm talking about hard but
everybody's have to do it because I walk
up and down that block and I scene I
smell it every day how come the cops
don't stop it is what a good cops have
bigger fish to fry yeah I know like you
know like people hopping the train right
no they're not looking for people to
enjoy things they really hurt yeah
that's true too I don't like the smell I
don't like it it hurts me well then
you're gonna walk away and I smell it in
one second I'd rather smell that than
cigarette smoke I don't like that either
well it's not a perfect world I've been
easy that then fools rumbling around in
the street all drunk on a Saturday thank
God a coyote AJ next to my house okay I
don't you take the shot what if you know
stumble on you i'm talking about you
know it's annoying drunk imagine
methamphetamines a huge deal in new york
and on the east coast where it's only
inexplicably in Montana apparently but
dare you to look my house
Wow defending you know I bad Cheech and
Chong not about that we don't engage in
those guys I'm saying I joke with you
you don't think our boy it's legal right
turn like a commute terms of like when
I'm walking up and down a block and I
can't see something on a day-to-day you
know we talked about don't you want me
while they're there quickly check bags
or give someone a ticket for hopping the
train right but I could literally not
walk up this block okay first of all

weekend in New York honest yeah i'll
give you like jaywalking across the bed
read all the appropriate listen mr. san
francisco matter now i I'm just saying
there you come over there there are
certain things that happened in New York

talking about is one of them you gotta
pick your battles man I want to battle
every 10 sometime the law was meant to
be broken all right listen kiddo how we
arrived to this I don't know how we're
getting heated them but we got our got
to get to some of these emails cuz we
always you know troll people to send in
an email to us it's the 40 Ford sina com
um I want to talk about we're talking
about funny ssids right our buddy ryan
from indianapolis says a little over a
year ago i had some rather loud
neighbors living below me in my
apartment complex rather than going to
talk to him about the fact that everyone
in the building could hear them partake
in their adult activities I changed my
network name to what you see below I was
shocked but never heard from them again
and we look at his SSID and it says 1831
we can hear you having sex so imagine
every time you're looking for Wi-Fi you
see that up I live in 1831 I guess my
baggins just a little too well bangin I
mean does that prevent them from
latching on to your network though I
thought point of this was broadcasting
like much broadcasting right side like
like like the big bang theory they're
always like you know like pennies a key
chains you know children change a
password again it's like penny get your
own Wi-Fi yeah yeah like they bug out
like don't tread on me I always forget
that you're a big big bang theory yeah
really bad just because it's CBS now you
just because that whatever reason he
chose yeah I've watched a few times to
not get but you got it they need to film
an episode here yeah they need
affirmative restriction to the choir
here they go yeah neither should we need
a sheldon in here man you know you know

SSID or funny passive-aggressive SSID
