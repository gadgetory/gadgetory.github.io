Facebook I'm Bridget Carey and this is
your cnet update facebook wants to be
more than just one of the apps on your
phone it wants to be the home screen
skin of your device the facebook phone
that everyone has been talking about is
actually a skin for Android called
Facebook home when the phone is turned
on instead of a home screen of apps
you'll see the most recent photos posted
from your friends it's called the cover
feed and you can interact with those
photos with likes and comments all by
tapping and swiping you no longer have
to open a facebook app to start
interacting on facebook if you get a
message from someone their Facebook head
pops up in a bubble called a chat head
if you get a notification about someone
their picture also appears with Facebook
home the phone centers around your
Facebook feed and connections the
software can be downloaded from the
google play store on April twelfth but
only a few of the latest Android phones
will be able to try it that's the HTC
One which isn't out yet the HTC One X
and X plus the galaxy s3 and s4 and the
galaxy note 2 there's even a new phone
coming out that has facebook home
pre-installed it's called the HTC first
and pre-orders begin now if you want to
be among the first with the first it's a
hundred dollars with the contract on 18t
and comes in four colors if you're
considering downloading facebook home
here's a look of what to expect first
the cover feed which is just a feed of
recent status messages and post from
your friends in the demos we see
pictures of cool people doing cool
things but think about the photos posted
on your feed motivational pictures with
lots of tiny text on it maybe some
blurry pet photos pretty much any
picture can turn into your wallpaper for
the moment and you'll also see
advertisements yeah not at first but
advertisements will be coming eventually
because that's what we want on our
phones as for navigation there's a
circle with your head in it tapping it
gives you three options send a message
open the menu of apps for your phone or
open the most recently used app you also
see little head circles pop up when your
friends send a text message or Facebook
message facebook calls them chat heads
and shad heads can be moved around the
screen they just hover over whatever
you're doing staring at you waiting for
a reply or you can throw the icon away
if you don't want to answer this seems
like a program you want a facebook is
you're only social network that you
obsess over and for many people that is
the case a recent study says smartphone
users are on Facebook three times longer
than on other apps when it comes out
April twelfth those with a compatible
phone can also just try it once before
committing to a complete switch over and
it'll come to tablets over the next
several months that's your tech news
update you can find more details on
facebook home on our show blog sina com
/ update from our studios in New York
