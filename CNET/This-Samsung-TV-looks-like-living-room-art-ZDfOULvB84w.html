TV and it's all about style like many
TVs this one is basically all picture
with a super thin frame around the image
a classy metallic edge a tiny Samsung
logo and a really nice slim profile from
the side but it's the other design
touches that really set it apart the
triangle-shaped base supports a rigid
metal arm that holds the TV's suspend it
over your tabletop or cabinet for a
sleeker look than most other sets the
only cables you need to connect to this
TV one for power and one for the input
box are completely hidden behind the
panel on the TV's back the result is a
basically wireless look from any
direction including the back this little
input box with 4 HDMI for your devices
is the key it can be stashed near your
streaming box game console and other
devices allowing just that one wire to
the TV Samsung's remote can also control
your devices itself so you can kick
those other remotes to the curb setup is
easier than with a universal remote
since the TV actually recognizes most
devices as soon as you plug them in sets
up the corresponding input and programs
the TV remote all automatically so what
about image quality it's very good in my
test but quite a few cheaper TVs can
perform better black levels and darkroom
performance were decent but not
spectacular and while the TV can get
impressively bright for light rooms its
high dynamic range image didn't quite
have the pop and impact as many other
mid-range sets I compared with the MU
9000 Samsung is betting you'll pay extra
for a TV that looks great even when
turned off if high style is your
priority but you don't want a more
expensive q LED model it's worth a close
look
