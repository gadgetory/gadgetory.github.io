and I'm here in the Vizio booth behind
me you'll see a 65 and a 55 inch member
of videos new P series the P stands for
performance or picture quality or purity
or whatever Vizio wants to call it but
at the end of the day this is videos
first 4k resolution television this set
has full array local dimming of the LED
backlight which is my favorite feature
for an LED TV it generally leads to
really good picture quality on account
of really deep black levels and
excellent contrast
so we'll see how this TV performs a
person but right off the bat that's a
really promising feature of course it's
got 4k resolution it also has an HEV C
h.265 decoder in hardware which allows
it to take some streaming services and
put them up in 4k and what Vizio claims
is even better quality than the
competitors Vizio also talks about the
processing power of this television has
a clear action rate of 960 which would
help reduce blurring the set can also
accept 24 and 48 frame signals and
reproduce them with excellent cadence in
addition there's 120 frames per second
input mode that should lead to smoother
frame rates for PC gamers the styling on
the P series is very similar to the M
series that we really like last year for
vizio very minimalistic with a little
Vizio dongle sitting in there on the
lower left all told the P series looks
like one of the most competitive 4k
resolution TVs we've seen so far at CES
this year and it's also knowing Vizio
perhaps gonna be one of the least
expensive that's a look at Vizio P
series 4k television I'm David Katz my
