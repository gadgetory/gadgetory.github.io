first episode I'm Ashley together and
your time is money you don't have enough
time to play everything binge everything
watch everything but that's what I'm
here for
every week we're gonna go through the
news in Hollywood and I'm gonna tell you
whether you should fire sell investments
in your pop culture properties let's
start off with the biggest pop culture
property happening right now that's
right everybody Avengers infinity war is
coming out this weekend
there is no question Avengers infinity
war is going to make a ridiculous amount
of money analysts are saying it could
blow past two hundred and twenty million
dollars at the box office but the real
question is who's gonna get murdered in
Avengers infinity war and that's why I
created this beautiful board that
definitely doesn't look like a
conspiracy theorist to figure out who's
gonna die okay
so let's start with Loki this guy all
the time betrays people I mean he
probably betrays the little old lady at
the checkout stand behind him at the
grocery store
he sucks and at the end of the day he's
probably gonna make Fanus really mad so
I'm gonna say sorry Hiddleston it's time
for you to go on top of that some
speculation has maybe suggested that
Thor might be on his way out but I think
he had such a great time filming thor
ragnarok that he is going to be in for
another thor movie so I think we can
safely say that he'll still be around
also he's beautiful
alright let's talk about vision because
really guys if anyone is out there
hoping that vision is gonna survive this
you may want to not hold your breath
because he has an infinity stone in his
forehead I don't see him surviving this
one because obviously if Thanos has to
fill the Infinity Gauntlet with the
stones all right final two questions is
it going to be cap or is it going to be
Tony Stark Iron Man the real question
for these two is who can replace them
now with Tony Stark
we just had Black Panther come out and
my girl Cherie Teenage total genius who
is smarter than Tony and
banner probably combined and has all
that wonderful what Condon technology is
a really great replacement for Tony
Stark not gonna lie as for cap if you've
read the comics you know I have Bucky
with the good hair down here but at the
end of the day I like to think that he's
actually maybe a little bit
irreplaceable and so I'm gonna say at
this point our DJ is almost as rich as
Marvel itself so I'm gonna go ahead and
say that it's gonna be easiest for him
to retire
sorry Tony Stark I love you baby but
you're getting an ex I think he's gonna
be the one to bite it in Avengers
infinity war but win lose or draw
whoever eats it in the movie it's
obviously a Buy so everybody get in go
see that movie it's gonna be the thing
everyone is talking about and also again
avoid those spoilers you guys I have
been desperately avoiding them a
speaking of Avengers infinity war
spider-man is going to have the iron
suit in the insomniac game insomniac
announced it would be including the iron
Spidey suit that we are gonna see an
Avengers infinity war in it's game later
this year
this suit looks dope it looks so good
that it makes me want to sing spider-man
spider-man I'm a massive Spidey Stan
he's got suits check them out I love mum
let's all shout look out it's your
neighborhood spider-man that was
terrible but you know what really makes
me angry the fact that you have to
preorder this game to get that suit I am
NOT about pre-orders insomniac and I
don't know what you're playing out here
I am gonna buy your game I am gonna buy
your game but I'm also going to sell off
that pre-order don't pre-order games
everybody it's a trick I hate that I
hate pre-ordering games it's the worst
thing in the world to me but at the end
of the day that suit does look pretty
cool so if you want a perder I guess but
I still recommend no pre-orders no
pre-orders all right in happier news
that's right Nickelodeon ordered 40 new
episodes of double dare and it's going
to be coming to your TV sets this summer
that is really exciting stuff and Nick
is promising all of the same great
challenges like that sweet nose-picking
challenge that you remember from the 90s
there's no word yet on whether or not
classic host mark summers will return to
reprise his role but at the end of the
day I think it would be really nice if
Nickelodeon found a cameo spot for him
at some point during the run if they are
looking for a full-time host though I
have a suggestion that I think
Nickelodeon will be very happy with and
that is of course me oh my god I
congratulations you have made it to the
next part of this show oh okay
our senior recap correspondent mark

1 and Westworld check it out
