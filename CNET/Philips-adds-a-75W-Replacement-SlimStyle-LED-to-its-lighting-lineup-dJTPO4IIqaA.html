is the Philips Slim style 75 watt
replacement LED and this is a update on
last year's slim style as you can see
it's the same design same flat kind of
ping-pong paddle shape it's also a
brighter bulb offering 1100 lumens of
light and that's right at that 75 watt
replacement mark that you want when we
tested it out the philips slim style
tested above that 1100 mark so it did
very well it's also a very efficient
bulb at about 85 lumens per watt that's
as good as or better than any of the
competitors that we looked at just like
with last year's slim style this flat
design with the diodes distributed out
along the perimeter of the bulb does a
very good job with heat management it
helps the bulb perform well under heat
heat affects it less and that comes in
handy when you want to use the bulb in
an enclosed fixture like a porch light
it also offers strong performance on
dimmers and that's a change from last
year the previous philips slim style
with flicker and buzz as you dialed the
light down low because parts inside
would rattle a little bit with the
magnetic resistance from dimmer setups
that's not good this bulb did a lot
better we didn't detect any flicker of
buzz as we tested it and the light dials
download and a minimum of about 12%
brightness it doesn't dim down quite as
low as I'd like the Cree 75 watt LED
gets down below 10% and the philips
standard LED gets down as low as 1% but
it still does very well much better than
last year so kudos to philips for
improving the design given all of that I
think it's safe to call this a bigger
brighter better philips slim style but
it will cost you a little bit more the
bulbs gonna sell for $13 at Home Depot
which is about 5 bucks more than the
original slim style and all you're
really getting for that extra 5 bucks is
the uptick from 800 lumens to 1100
lumens along with the improved dimming
performance that's not a bad price it's
actually the best price we've seen yet
for a 75 watt replacement with other
bulbs coming in at 15 20 or even 25
dollars so if that's the kind of bulb
you need I think it belongs at the top
of your list but if you're just looking
for a good LED and you're not sure you
need that extra brightness the original
slim style or another LED that cost a
little less might be a better deal
thanks for watching check out the full
review at cnet.com along with the rest
of my led reviews for seen at appliances
