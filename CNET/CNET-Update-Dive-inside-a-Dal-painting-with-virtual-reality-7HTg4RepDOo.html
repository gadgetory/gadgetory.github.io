inside a painting I'm Bridget Carey this
is your CNET update most of the hype
around virtual reality centers around
gaming but there are so many other
possibilities for this medium that we're
just beginning to explore the doll a
museum in st. Petersburg Florida
blended virtual reality with art and
it's going to take visitors on a trip
inside the mind of Salvador Dali with
its latest exhibit the experience is
called dreams of Dali and programmers
brought to life the landscape of one of
his earlier paintings the archaeological
reminiscence of millets Angeles from
1935 I put on an oculus rift headset to
jump in and began to explore these
ancient monumental ruins in a moonlit
landscape but the designers of the
experience also put other pieces of
Dolly's work inside the ruins so
visitors may have a few unexpected
surprises but in virtual reality it all
feels very close to giving it just the
right amount of creepy feeling you start
to feel like you're lost inside this
warp Dali world but how do you create
something that Dali would approve lead
designer Nathan Shipley of the firm
goodbey silverstein and Partners
explains we think that if Dali was alive
today he would love VR and he would
absolutely be involved in this sort of
sort of thing but he wouldn't be trying
to like worry about minuscule little
details of the individual wrestlers who
wanted to represent what was in Dali his
mind it took the team about four months
to create this VR experience which
you're expected to go through for about
five minutes it's on display as part of
the new exhibit called Disney and Dali
architects of imagination the two
artists were friends and collaborated on
an animated short called destino
although the VR portion doesn't have the
work of Disney inside of it you can't
think of it as being on a thrill ride of
sorts as the museum's executive director
explains both artists work to create
experiences that were out of the
ordinary leaving you feeling just a
little bit vulnerable I think it was
wonderful
that they were able to go beyond their
worlds go beyond the strictures of what
was normal at that time and create
environments and media that we're new so
in that spirit we're following Disney
and Dali and creating this for our
viewers you don't have to travel to
Florida to check out the VR when the
exhibit opens on January 23rd it's going
to be available online at dreams of Dali
org and you can see it in VR from home
if you have Google cardboard or Samsung
gear VR that's it for this tech news
update but there's much more to explore
in VR in an upcoming report I'm going to
show you how businesses want you to go
shopping in virtual reality from our
studios in New York I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
