the PlayStation Empire with this console
now it's taking that same device making
it smaller cramming 20 games into it and
selling it back to us as the PlayStation
classic we're seeing it for the first
time today let's go check it out the
console itself is a really nice
miniaturization of the original hardware
from the buttons that feel not exactly
like the originals but pretty close to
again the really really nice controller
port look and even a lot of details on
the back the power ports in roughly the
same position is on the original console
as well as the HDMI port was the other
thing but it's even got the axillary
port that you used to be able to plug
accessories like the game genie into
unfortunately although it really looks
like a very real latch this does not
come off so please don't try to open it
you'll probably just break what is
otherwise a very nice sculpt the
PlayStation classic boots up with the
classic PlayStation startup Sony logo
that you remember from the 90s and
straight into this really simple basic
menu its bare-bones it doesn't have any
background music at all it's just
exactly what you see the simple square
artwork for each of the 20 games a small
settings menu down below and a spot for
the memory card and the safe State Games
boot up and finish the sequence with the
PlayStation logos you don't quite get
the whole effect you did in the original
PlayStation where you get the Sony logo
and then the PlayStation logo together
but this is actually really similar to
what you would get if you blew that one
of these games on the PlayStation 3
starting straight for the PlayStation
logo and then going into the game itself
one thing I like that differentiates
Sony's PlayStation Classic from
Nintendo's efforts is that its
controller is USB that means there's no
proprietary connector it plugs into a
standard port that you're already
familiar with and you already know how
it works there's no word yet if plugging
this USB for it into a computer will let
you use this on PC games or any other
device that uses USB controllers like
Playstations other consoles but it's
nice to see a standard connector and my
favorite part about it is the connector
has this thick Sony PlayStation 1 star
I'll pour it on the bottom that looks
just like the connector from the
original PlayStation controllers
effectively it doesn't do anything but
when you have a plugged into the console
it makes it look way more like the
original controllers are plugged in
there
unlike Nintendo's console which are
using these weird sort of bulbous Wii
controller extension boards the
controller itself feels really good it
has that same classic PlayStation d-pad
which is a really nice separated
directional input and the basic face
buttons the same controller shoulder
buttons are here smaller but one thing
that you'll notice is that it is the
basic Sony Playstation controller that
means if you grew up using one of the
dual analog variants or the more iconic
Dual Shock controller this is going to
be just the simplest control scheme and
that's a little bit of a shame because a
lot of PlayStation games including some
of the ones they think that are on the
PlayStation classic they don't require
dual analog control but they actually do
benefit from them in some way so if you
were hoping to play Metal Gear Solid
with the more precise dual analog
controls you're just out of luck once
you actually boot up a game it's a
pretty basic no-frills experience Here I
am playing a Vadis II and it's not at
all different than the original game
down to the point so that means there's
no extra frills you can't change any
filters there's no special turbo modes
it's exactly as you might have
experienced it on the original
PlayStation except for the slightly more
clear HDMI output in fact the only real
change in the experience comes when you
want to change games still have to lean
forward and press the reset button but
when you do it brings you to a main menu
that automatically creates a resume
point every time you press reset the
game will automatically create a safe
state of where you were if you go back
into the game it picks you up right
where you left off and if you exit out
one more time the system will ask you if
you want to replace your existing resume
point with a new one and that's about it
as far as special save features go every
game does have a standard virtual memory
card that will hold the same 15 spots is
the original though so you don't have to
worry about managing multiple games
across a single memory card every game
has its own dedicated one
apart from that there's really not much
of the PlayStation Classic beyond that
basic experience there is a settings
menu but all it has is health and safety
information screensaver settings your
basic language that you set up at first
boot and if you want to reformat the
console back to this default settings
similarly the guides mode only just has
a link to the product website and a
simple console guide that tells you how
to quit the game turn off the console or
change a virtual disks during game play
if you're playing a game like Final
Fantasy 7 that require multiple disks
there's gonna be a point in the game
where it'll ask you to change discs that
seems to be the only point in which the
eject button is used on the PlayStation
console sadly it doesn't actually open
the lid but it will give you the chance
to actually change virtual disks and
move to the next point of the game a lot
of the games on the PlayStation Classic
are definitely products of their time
though all 3d graphics with jagged edges
and lines low textures and really
funny-looking polygons it's just sort of
what happens when you play 3d games from
the 90s era some games really do show
their age but others like 2d games like
Raymond and mr. driller have really
clean looking 2d graphics and they're
smooth and because of their style that
they weren't pushing the edge of 3d from
the time they just don't show their age
as much show how old a game is going to
look on a Playstation Classic well he
depends on what style that's in
like any classic console though the
biggest thing where it wins and loses on
is the library of games and like the
Nintendo and the Super Nintendo there
are a lot of great titles on the
original PlayStation and nailing it down
to just 20
that's a hard task there are great games
on here that are huge classics like
Metal Gear Solid and I'd love the
original odd world and Resident Evil but
it also kind of makes you wonder about
what's missing
for instance twisted metal is on here
but I would argue that twisted metal too
was definitely disappear your game and
Resident Evil the original is one of my
favorites but again Resident Evil 2 is a
little bit better another problem is
that well some of the games on here are
super iconic they're maybe not the best
experience now Tom Clancy's Rainbow six
may have spawned a huge franchise of
games but the original game on
PlayStation just has some really tough
controls to wrap your head around from a
modern perspective there's also
countless games on here that fans will
be hoping for that just aren't around
iconic games like Tomb Raider and
parappa the rapper aren't present even
Sony's 1990s ish mascot isn't here Crash
Bandicoot despite it being playable in
the lobby of the Sony Playstation
building we saw this demo in
if you've been trying to decide at the
playstation classic is for you we can
tell you up to this first look that what
you see is pretty much what you get you
get a small console that looks
remarkably like the original but it just
doesn't have that many extras just the
20 games we already know it comes with a
single controller and no extra special
features but if you want a simple basic
experience you'll be able to get it on
December 3rd for $99.99</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
