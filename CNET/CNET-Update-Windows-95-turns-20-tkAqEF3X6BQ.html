birthday windows 95 I'm Jeff Bakalar
filling in for Bridget Carey who's off
this week this is your CNN update if
things continue to go Tesla's way most
cars on the road will be electric
driverless or both but once every car on
the road runs on electricity we may
start to see some interesting
modifications to the roads altogether
the UK government has announced a plan
to start testing an electric highway
lane that charges an electric car as it
drives down it 500 million pounds are
being made available to test the idea
with real-life trials due to start
taking place later this year now this
story is sure to make you feel a little
older than when you did this morning
Microsoft is celebrating the 20th
anniversary of the release of Windows 95
back then this operating system saw an
incredible outpouring of buzz and
fanfare as the OS promised the next
generation of computing and for the most
part it kind of deliver it I mean
windows 95 was a big deal I think I got
it as a gift
I think somebody bought me windows 95
wrapped up and I got it as like a gift
and I remember being like oh my god it's
Windows 95 but seriously it was a huge
jump from Windows 3.1 and it's set in
motion a tradition of milestone software
releases for the company and speaking of
Windows I'm sure you're aware that
Windows 10 launched last month and for
the most part it's pretty great but what
you may not know is that Windows 10
includes face recognition software so
users can log in with just their face so
an Australian newspaper attempted to
fool the feature dubbed Windows hello by
having six sets of identical twins
attempt to log in under their other
twins account in each of the six cases
Windows 10 didn't skip a beat correctly
preventing the wrong twin from accessing
their siblings account that's pretty
impressive and finally we may and I
stress may here have evidence that
Android pay will be launching August
26th who's the source you might ask
mcDonald's of all places an internal
document that made its way into the
subreddit for Android this morning says
that employees need to prepare for
Android pay beginning on August 26 guess
we'll just have to wait and see what
happens but I'm not going to go to a
McDonald's to find out that does it for
this update for the very latest head
over to cnn.com
