Facebook friends I'm Bridget Carey and
this is your CNET update if you are
wondering where your friends are hanging
out this weekend you can track them down
with your Facebook app Facebook has a
new mobile feature called nearby friends
it tells you which Facebook friends are
near your location
this option is slowly being added to the
accounts in the US over the next few
weeks and when you get it you'll find it
under the three lined more button most
of the time it will share general info
but if you're trying to meet up with a
friend you can send him or her an exact
pinpoint on a map of where you are for a
short burst of time like say just for
one hour and before you get all creeped
out keep in mind this is optional and if
you turn it on you can control which
groups of friends can see your location
and that's important because chances are
you don't really feel all that close
with all 500 of your Facebook
acquaintances if this sounds familiar to
you that's because Facebook did try this
already in the summer of 2012 but
Facebook quickly removed it because it
was possible to let strangers know your
location and that was uber creepy this
time around Facebook has given you more
control on sharing oh and if you're
listed ages under 18 you will not be
able to use this Facebook is also
updating its separate news app called
paper the whole point of paper is to be
a place that highlights news stories and
you can also scroll through your news
feed without the ads but now Facebook
through and more Facebook e features
like birthday and event reminders and
being able to insert a photo into a
comment paper has been around for two
months and it's not exactly a must have
app Facebook editors curate a bunch of
news stories they throw into categories
like tech sports cute things
no really cute is a section Facebook
isn't sharing numbers on how many people
are using paper it's only a matter of
time before Facebook makes money off of
it paper may eventually put Sponsored
Stories in the stream and as for nearby
friends maybe we'll get coupon
for nearby businesses if the app is free
you can count on ads we just learned
that Samsung plans to put advertisements
in its free music streaming service it
has a weird name
it's called milk music and it only is
for people with a Samsung device
Samsung's blog has a graphic that says
the basic service will have ads but
there will be a premium service coming
soon without ads it'll cost four dollars
a month and it'll come with some
exclusive features to sweeten the deal
that's your tech news update you can

our studios in New York I'm Bridget
