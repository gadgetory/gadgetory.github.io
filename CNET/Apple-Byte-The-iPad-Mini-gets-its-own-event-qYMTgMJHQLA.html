welcome to the apple pie for all the
good and bad inside the world of apple
now you're probably getting fatigued
with the non-stop barrage of iphone
stories so we'll start with a couple of
other stories and then we'll beat you
down with the iPhone ones all right now
the September 12th date is still the
expected target for Apple's new
announcements and yeah you know about
this guy but the Telegraph reports that
apple is also planning to launch what's
described as airplay direct technology
that will allow wireless music playback
to speaker systems without the need for
an existing wireless network now the
rumored smaller dock connector will
pretty much eliminate the current
speaker docks moving forward so it's
most likely a chipset that stereo
manufacturers will be able to integrate
into their systems so we'll look to see
what the Cupertino kids have to say
about it Macotakara also chimes in with
a report from their sources where they
believe the next gen ipod nano may come
with Wi-Fi capabilities to enable itunes
in the cloud support they're also
reporting that the new 7.85 inch iPad
will be officially called the ipad mini
and not the mini me like we guessed here
many of us here at the office were
devastated by this news but we were
cheered right back up after all things D
and other sources confirmed rumors that
the ipad mini will debut with a separate
event of its own sometime in October and
we mentioned that possibility on last
week's show now that's a trick or treat
and that makes no sense now in MacBook
Pro news an NPD DisplaySearch analyst
has also told CNET that production is
underway with the 13.3 inch Retina
display for the macbook pro with the
2560 by 1600 pixel resolution and it
started up in the third quarter now this
specific display is for the 13 inch pro
and not a macbook air and they're being
produced by samsung LG d and sharp
according to our source with production
underway a new retina 13-inch could
still make it before the holiday season
and my Apple biters who are asking over
email we still haven't heard any chatter
from the iMac or mac mini camps all
right let's ship to the iphone yes the
iphone and images released earlier in
the week that showed off and assembled
front-panel highlighting what was
claimed to be an NFC chip but that's
been shot down by an antec and others
due to its primarily metal backside and
very little space at the top and bottom
of the phone dedicated to the glass RF
windows next-gen iphone accessories with
the 9-pin dock connector been published
by ilounge that show accessories from
skosh including dual device wall
chargers and car chargers that of the
rumored dock connector to use with an
included micro USB cable for the
accessories to connect between the new
iPhone and the charger and if you can't
wait for the iPhone and you want one now
you know my Chinese thieves got you
covered with their own knockoff called
the goophone i5s the name of the
goophone i5s on the two-tone back design
but still keeps a three and a half inch
screen with a five megapixel rear camera
and it's really the best of both worlds
alright let's take a quick break for a
useful tip from da Nobel to make your
itunes music sound a whole lot better if
you spend a lot of time listening to
itunes i'm going to tell you a few
simple things you can do to improve your
audio experience first off invest in
some better headphones there's no
miracle that's going to make these sound
any better seen it has a roundup of
great choices under fifty dollars that
will provide a night and day difference
in audio quality a good in-ear headphone
or over the ear headphone will also help
lock out external noise so that you can
hear details in your music and not have
to turn up the full volume to drown out
distractions if you already have
headphones figured out try the sound
enhancement setting in itunes open up
iTunes preferences and select the tab
for playback you'll see a sound enhancer
box that you can check on and adjust to
your taste moving the slider up seems to
make the stereo effect a little bit more
dramatic
audio files may turn up their nose but
if you like what you hear just go for it
while you're here you'll also notice a
box for sound check that will
automatically adjust the volume between
songs so that you're not racing for the
volume control every time a quiet song
comes on personally I keep this off but
if it fixes a problem for you you should
use it it's especially handy if you have
music playing in your office I should
also mention the iTunes equalizer you
think this would be in the playback menu
but it's actually over here under window
open it up and you'll see a 10 band
graphic equalizer that you can tweak to
your heart's desire you can start with a
list of presets like rock hip-hop or
classical or you can make a manual
adjustment to any of them and dial on
things just the way you like now one
cool trick that few people know about in
itunes is that you can actually assign
different EQ presets to different songs
if you know that you want a little extra
eq when Led Zeppelin comes on here's how
to do it select a song or group of songs
and then select get info from the file
menu under the options tab you'll see a
setting for equalizer preset along the
drop down menu all the different presets
hit OK and now whenever those songs come
on they'll sound just the way you like
alright thanks Donald but I think I'll
just keep my music collection on my
personal custom setting sexy alright
you're already in the know that the big
a vs samsung trial resulted in Apple
winning a walking one point oh five
billion dollars in damages after a jury
found that samsung infringed on six of
seven pounds in the trial and Apple
infringe on none of Samsung's then
several internet sites started
legitimately reporting
Samsung made the entire now with 30
truckloads of five cent coins that's the
Internet we're dealing with today people
and entirely not true now Apple is
seeking a ban on sales of eight Samsung
phones in the US some are less no models
but the list includes the galaxy s 4g
and the galaxy s2 they also plan on
putting a permanent ban on the Galaxy
Tab 10.1 in the United States as well
will wait to see if Apple takes this
ruling and runs with it against other
manufacturers even tries to target
Android directly but one company that
has no intentions of settling with them
is HTC now both companies have been
suing each other since 2010 because they
love each other so much but there's one
thing that ACC's next 10 inch tablet
won't look like based on these leaked
images and that's an iPad but you know
what it sure looks a lot like an imac
you go out with your bad self HTC now
just a few quick things we wanted to say
a big congratulations the Steven gold
and his wife are due and I've already
delivered by now baby-g who's officially
the Apple bites youngest fannin is
somewhere in this picture and a reminder
our 200th episode party is going down on
sep tember the 7th in San Francisco with
free drinks and giveaways and all kinds
of crazy stuff we're taking our cameras

my Twitter or just go to this link and I
might even let someone like this into
the party if they're lucky all right
