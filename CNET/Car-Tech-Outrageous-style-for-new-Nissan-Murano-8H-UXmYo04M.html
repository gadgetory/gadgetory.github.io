athletic for their creations but I think
that word definitely applies for the
2015 Nissan Murano first we have what
Nissan calls the V motion grill it's
pretty bold in this car we also have the
boomerang headlights and taillights
that's a standard Nissan feature now
down the sides we have a belt line that
really kicks up hard at the rear and at
the same time the roof slopes down to
meet it they have blacked-out pillars
all around and what Nissan calls a
floating roof design and in this
platinum trim model with 20-inch wheels
the waist gets really narrow giving it
that athletic look the base Murano goes
for twenty nine thousand five hundred
sixty dollars but now we have the
platinum trim model with all-wheel-drive
that goes for forty thousand six hundred
dollars that comes standard with LED
headlights navigation and these 20-inch
wheels we've also added the technology
package with adaptive cruise control and
a panoramic sunroof for two thousand two
hundred sixty dollars that brings our
total CNET style with destination the
forty three thousand four hundred
seventy five dollars in the cabin of
this platinum trim Nissan Murano we have
a really nice interior design
I feel like this comes up to the level
of Lexus RX we have this trim on the
console and around the sides here it's
kind of metallic but it's also wood
looking I wonder if they harvest it from
aluminum Christmas trees but I like to
look for the head unit we have a totally
new nissanconnect 8-inch touchscreen
here totally new software this is pretty
interesting stuff they have a new
interface we have this menu strip along
the bottom I really like this because
this gives you quick access to all the
different features these new maps are
crisp and clean I really like the look
you get traffic coverage really broad
traffic coverage actually not just on
freeways and highways but on surface
streets as well they've also added a a
pinch zoom feature too so if I pinch in
like that it zooms out if I pinch out it
zooms in so for navigation we have
pretty much the standard ways to find
destinations but we have a new feature
here it's part of the Nissan connect
apps feature so if I bring it over here
I've actually got my iPhone connected
here running the Nissan connect app so
that gives me Google online search so I
hit that and this has been allotted from
days of searching for destinations
online I can do a manual search I can
use voice search I can send a car from
my phone at categories to here so that's
that's really convenient and for other
apps with nissanconnect we also have
Facebook Twitter I Heart Radio and
Pandora makes us a very connected car
for other audio sources we have
bluetooth streaming we've got a USB port
here for iOS devices in USB drives we
also have a USB port in the back so your
rear seat passengers can plug in then
you can choose music from their devices
here we have HD radio and satellite
radio as well now I put this into
reverse and we get a surround view
camera here that's really convenient for
parking this big boy seeing what's all
around the car behind the wheel here I
have a really easy driving experience I
think that's kind of the point with the
murano is they don't want to make it
something you have to think too much
about driving and one thing I really
noticed in this cabin which I really
appreciate is that there's no sport
button there's no eco button you just
get in and drive and that's kind of the
point now under the hood we have a 3.5
liter v6 engine if you know Nissan's at
all that's a pretty common engine for
them it's part of their VQ series of
engines they've been using it for ever
15 years now almost it's kind of showing
its age it doesn't have a lot of
efficiency features that other
automakers are using in their engines
like direct injection or things like
that we get 260 horsepower 240 pound
feet of torque out of this engine not
huge numbers but they're definitely
adequate the EPA rating on this engine
is 21 miles per gallon city 28 miles per
gallon highway the heart of the
drivetrain Nissan's really big tech
achievement is is this continuously
variable transmission or CVT now if you
don't like C GTS you haven't driven a
Nissan because this one works really
well I've got these virtual shift points
so I can pretend to shift it's pretty
smooth there's a really well program I
like how it does it but now let's give
it some real acceleration and see what
happens
it lets the wheels spin a little bit and
it just powers through it lets the
engine speed run really high you see the
tack needle run up to four thousand five
thousand then you see that tack needle
blip as the transmission changes ratios
to accommodate the speed that you really
want and really tap that engine power a
couple other features I should mention
really quickly in this platinum trim
model is we've got blind spot monitoring
system with whites on the a-pillars to
show me if there's a car in my blind
spot we also have adaptive cruise
control the nice thing about the Murano
is this platinum trim gives us a lot of
nice features extra amenities but every
Murano is going to have the same driving
experience which I really like it
definitely accomplishes what this car
should be doing very comfortable ride
very easy ride and that's the key
