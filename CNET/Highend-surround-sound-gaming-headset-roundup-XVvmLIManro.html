surround sound system gaming headsets
have come a long way besides maybe you
don't have the room or money for a 5.1
setup in your room or apartment I've
been gaming with surround sound
headphones for almost a decade now and I
think if you're serious about having a
respectable audio experience one of
these high-end gaming headsets is for
you this is only a small sample of
what's out there but hopefully it gives
you an idea of how to spot quality when
shopping for a new surround sound gaming
headset ok let's start with turtle beach
turtle beach offers an endless amount of
options for Xbox and Playstation
platforms and the most expensive model
is the 800 line of headsets the elite
800 and elite 800 X offer surround sound
and noise cancelling features for ps4
and Xbox one respectively and they
charge in these really convenient
cradles
plus they have optical ins and outs on
the base so you don't lose sound on your
regular AV receiver setup but and this
is a big but they both go for $300 that
premium price is mostly for the extra
features and solid build quality but
actually they started to annoy me after
I wore them for an extended gaming
session fortunately for ps4 owners I can
recommend the stealth 500 P which is
only $100 it removes the charging cradle
Bluetooth and noise cancelling features
but it retains what you want that's the
surround sound and check albeit it's got
this really super awkward USB dongle
setup for Xbox one the 500x is a cheaper
alternative but it's still pricey at
$230 gone also are the cradle Bluetooth
and noise cancelling features but at
least you can chat wirelessly on Xbox
one and game surround sound ok let's
move over to astro gaming the new
tournament ready a 40s are super
comfortable lightweight and come in two
varieties one for Xbox one and one for
ps4 and you can use them both with a PC
connection as well because they're wired
you get minimal sound delay like you
might encounter with other wireless
connections the a40 TR s come with a mix
amp pro that lets you mix game
and chat audio in real time now there's
two versions available they're both for
250 dollars the white version is for
Xbox one that allows for chatting
without a clunky adapter the mix app can
also connect to a PC where you can
access EQ management software called
command center it lets you customize the
experience when you plug in the mix amp
to a PC all you do is download the
software and you can do a ton of
customization all these settings are
available and then you load that into
the mix amp now if you're a twitch gamer
and need to have a precise gaming no
delay experience the a 40's are really
the headset to be Astro also offers the
ability to customize the headphones and
they sell a mod kit for the 840 s it'll
actually let you swap out the ear cups
the headband and a boom mic nose mod
kits go for $60 finally I want to take a
look at a headset that's specifically
designed for PC I absolutely love the
logitech g930 3 Artemus spectrum
wireless surround headset it goes for
about $200 but it provides the best
surround sound for PC that I've tested
the G 933 lets you customize the RGB LED
light that shines when it's turned on
and the logitech gaming software allows
you to assign commands for the buttons
that are on the headset itself you can
also customize EQ settings as well now
for wireless PC gaming it's all you need
but for $50 cheaper the g6 33 does the
same exact thing but with a wired
connection now there are plenty of solid
products that I didn't get to include
here SteelSeries makes a great headset
in the Siberia line and Sony even makes
proprietary headsets for the ps4 that
are actually pretty solid as well
hopefully you've gotten a good taste of
what to look out for in the high end
surround sound gaming landscape be sure
to reach out to me on Twitter if you've
got more questions about anything you've
seen here I'm Jeff Bakalar for cnet.com
