we have a big time battle between two of
the most rugged digital cameras on the
planet if you're extreme this is the
prize fight for you
it's a picture-perfect punch out between
the panasonic t s4 and the olympus TG
one our judges for this fight are senior
editor lori Gruden and senior editor
Josh Coleman and we'll take both judges
scores and average them out to the
nearest tenth the final prize fight
score we're gonna average using the same
system let's keep it clean first round
is design and interface now these aren't
the sexiest $399 point shoot cameras
you'll ever see but who cares when
they're waterproof up to 40 feet deep
shock through from six and a half feet
high and freezeproof down to negative 10
degrees Celsius
these cameras are rugged now the
Panasonic T s4 is the sleeker and more
stylish between the two coming in four
different colors but it's LCD screen is
smaller and a disappointing lower res
plus if you're wearing gloves while
using these specific cameras it's harder
to feel the T s4 s buttons especially
its navigation pad you also have to go
in and out of different screens to
change the settings and it's just not as
simple to navigate the limp is tg1 is
thicker it's bigger it only comes in
gunmetal black but it has a better grip
a bigger and higher res screen and it's
navigation is better organized with its
mode wheel that clicks into place and
it's d-pad that allows you to tweak your
camera's key settings on the fly without
jumping into another screen sure its
design is chunkier but this camera is
crushproof up to 220 pounds the ps4
can't claim that so it will survive even
if a big girl sits on it the Olympus tg1
takes the first round with the 4.5 and
the Panasonic ps4 gets a three next
round is features both rugged cameras
have built-in GPS to log your photo
locations Panasonic's ps4 has an
indicator light on the top and on the
Olympus it will show you on the screen
the ts4 captors AVCHD an mp4 video and a
1080p quality
it also has modes like miniature for a
tilt shift lens effect and a 3d mode
that takes multiple shots and overlays
them to play on 3d TVs
computers or frames over all the
features package is pretty standard here
now it also has a removable battery that
requires you to use a wall charger so
you'll need to carry multiple batteries
if you're on the go
now the olympus TG one uses a removable
battery and it allows you to plug your
camera directly into any power sources
using a USB cable that's a lot more
versatile but its biggest feature is its
bright f/2 aperture lens that's a fast
one and no rugged camera on the market
comes close it takes 1080p video it has
multiple shooting modes and special
effects as well plus it has an LED light
in macro mode and a bayonet mount for
different lens attachments the olympus
comes out strong once again with another
4.5 and the panasonic gets a 3 so after
averaging 2 rounds the olympus tg1 takes
a strong lead next round of shooting
performance check out the numbers here
people and the cameras match up pretty
evenly panasonic has an edge when it
comes to the first shot from start up
and it also has a faster shot to shot
time but it's still very close now the
shutter speeds are identical in bright
lighting conditions and the olympus TG 1
is just a hair better in dimmer lighting
Panasonic sonic speed autofocus was
slightly faster than the Olympus as well
but using both cameras continuous
shooting mode in our tests Panasonic's
ps4 took a picture on average every 2.7
frames per second while the olympus TG
one took a picture every 4.3 frames per
second now if you lower Olympus's
resolution to 3 megapixels it can be set
to 15 or even 60 frames per second both
cameras are pretty neck-and-neck overall
and we're calling this round a tie at 4
we're down to the final round that sides
at all and it's image quality
when it comes to image quality these
guys just won't value when they're
focused on being rugged cameras the
pictures tend to look soft or
over-processed resulting invisible
artifacts even at ISO 100 now Olympus's
tg1 photos are too cool and have more
processing artifacts while the Panasonic
had a better white balance now neither
camera stands out here and in the final
round we're giving them both threes so
let's average out all four rounds and it
was a prizefight where the olympus
charged heart out of the gates and
panasonic just couldn't make up the
difference and the olympus TG one takes
this price by four to three point three
and is your prize fight winner i'm brian
tom thanks for watching and thanks to
our sponsor ebay and we'll catch you
guys next time on another prize
