student appliances here with the Samsung
active wash washing machine that's model
number W a 5-2 J 8700 ap so the most
desirable washing machines on the market
today are the front load machines
they're typically cheaper they usually
have smaller capacity and fewer features
but Samsung is kind of blowing that out
of the water with this new model it's
1199 dollars so it's priced closer to a
front load model but it has so many
features and the most interesting one is
this built-in sink it has a built-in
sink with a Ridge surface so you can
actually wash stuff like you would in
your kitchen or bathroom sink so you can
hand washed off you could pre-soak stuff
or simply target really heavily soiled
spots where you put it in the regular
cycle in addition to that it also has a
bedding mode and a super speed
technology that claims to be able to
wash your clothes in just 36 minutes we
haven't had a chance to test this thing
yet but we saw it at CES and we just got
one in the studio and we're so excited
we wanted to show you here first this is
just a sneak peek of Samsung's active
wash washing machine so we'll have a
full review for you soon so stay tuned
for that thanks for watching i'm megan
Willerton foreseen at appliances</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
