welcome to the Apple by for all the good
and bad inside the world of Apple let's
jump into the show in I know many of you
are just waiting for Apple to release
something so you can spend all that
money instead of paying your bills well
your wishes could come true after
bloomberg is reporting that Apple is
planning to unveil their next gen apple
TV set-top box by April its negotiating
with time warner cable and other
potential partners to add video content
and wants it to be available for sale by
the Christmas holidays but the release
date could change depending on the
timing of content deals now the new
apple TV is expected to have a faster
processor and an upgraded interface and
9to5 mac recently reported that the new
Apple TV hardware references are already
appearing in the latest iOS 7 software
builds the current apple TV is noted
with the 32 notation and 41 is the new
model now rumors of a full-size Apple TV
TV I've been pretty quiet since the end
of last year and really they need to
prove they even have a concept that
works and resonates with us before
selling a three-thousand-dollar TV set
we've also got iphone 6 rumors and news
galore this week a new report from the
Korea Herald claims Apple's iPhone 6
will gain a bezel free display when it
launches later this year according to
the South China Morning Post Apple is
preparing to release not one but two new
versions of the iphone in September
coming with a 4.7 inch display and for a
bigger bulge in your pants a 5.5 inch
display with both phones ringing a
higher 441 pixels per inch density now
that falls in line with the rumors of
two screen sizes floating around right
now the report also says both displays
will be made from sapphire crystal and
they will be flat not curved now there
are rumors flying back and forth about
what will Apple's Arizona sapphire plant
actually produce first Chinese media
sources say they have iphone prototypes
already using sapphire display panels
but a sapphire screen on an iPhone would
make its price point too high instead
the rumored iWatch is 2 inch panel would
have much lower production costs and be
more affordable and buy affordable you
know Apple is going to sell it for about
four hundred to five hundred dollars
afford
now the volume of raw materials in the
number of sapphire furnaces Apple will
have on site will allegedly allow the
big a to manufacture 200 million
five-inch sapphire displays and that's
more than enough to meet their ulead
demand for iPhones but again it's
another wait and see now a report from
LED inside also says Apple will take
advantage of new advancements in LED
technology and shift to even thinner
components for the iphone 6 and upcoming
ipad models it will allow Apple the
shift from a point 6 millimeter
backlight on its thickest side to a
point 4 millimeter one and you know what
they say every point one millimeter
counts alright Sony will likely be
providing the front-facing camera
sensors for iPhones and other devices in
the future Japanese business site Nikkei
says sony and apple are in negotiations
that would double sony shipment of
camera sensors in 2015 now sony's
provided the iphones rear camera since
the 4s and one place the iphone could
really improve is with its front facing
camera for all you selfie lovers and FYI
I refuse to take selfies and guys how
could we not do the show without talking
about flappy bird the world's most
frustrating game that took over in just
a few weeks but was then taken down by
developer dome new NB cuz he now says it
was just too addictive that was the main
negative so I decided to take it down he
was also making over fifty thousand
dollars a day and he's making even more
cheddar after people swarm to download
the game before it was cooled don't you
took down the game that's a bad apple
now flappy bird was so maddening that
there's how-to videos giving you tips to
play and other people well they just
beat the game a different way see right
there
now I just want to let you all know at
home I'm a pro with my best score at 27
that's right at 27 so we'd like to honor
dome to end with one last run at flappy
bird let's go easy peasy first pipe
seriously Oh easy second oh come on oh
that happens all the time I hate that
but let's be honest the game is genius
and if you haven't checked out apple's
website lately they just put up a video
that pays tribute to the 30 years of the
mac and apple as a whole while being
shot entirely on an iphone now 100
iPhones were used 70 + hours of footage
was shot from 15 shooting cruise around
the world and it was edited from a
single command center with an original
score in Los Angeles so let's take a
look at the snippet

create our own video to show you at home
