is people think I guess yeah once they
see you you know intelligent movies are
like everything everybody's like Tom
Cruise height like everybody is like
gonna be poor foot nothin right the case
no they shoot you from a very high
exactly all my cameraman or seven people
right there dude god he looks so tiny
portable jibs everybody following a very
good that's what that's like sure my
camera guy's name is Jim no that's what
I mean you talk about someone being born
for their so exactly well again thank
you so much for being here thank you uh
you're here promoting a brand new movie
which the three of us were lucky enough
to check out the other day it's called
comic-con episode 4 fans hope rolls off
the time it does just like the last
movie the proposal represents the
greatest movie ever sold I'm just trying
to make the longest most difficult idols
mom you're just trying to piss off every
marquee curator in the world runs out a
letter the guys like damn it god again
he there he is we need more letters
here's another movie from his burrow buy
more letters that's why the next movie
only has you know seven titles or seven
letters it's great that's right and
maybe we'll get to that a little bit as
well yeah uh like we said we're really
big fans is so is a big pleasure for us
to have you here thank you uh we watched
the movie it's really good we actually
really surprised we were really big we
were shocked we were shocked that we
actually enjoyed it you know usually
this stuff that he does but make such
crap but this one we actually watched it
was amazing what's crazy about this
though is it's sort of out of your mo
for the most part a lot of your films in
the past
dealt with maybe more political messages
sir to do serious stuff yeah and this
comic con movie is very light-hearted
it's endearing it's it's charming that's
fun it's a lot of fun to watch is very
easy to watch what was sort of the
guiding force changing gears with this
time either the biggest thing is you
know when you watch the film and I tell
people all time that that's a though
yeah i really liked any other movies and
I'm like well then you're gonna love
comic con episode for that because
because I'm not in one frame of the
movie right let you know I think they're
not in one frame I don't do the
voiceover you don't hear me you don't
see me so if you've hated every film
I've made up til now where you watch
this movie it's a breath of fresh you
should give this film a chance Kenneth
Turan from the LA Times likely love this
film and is the first film ever mine
days like then I'm convinced just cuz I
wasn't convinced that's what's at which
I'm surprised that's why the New York
Post like also hates every film ever
made was like well I'm not in this one
they're gonna love this movie or star
not so much now they'd like well screw
them so what's amazing though to me is
that you know that's part of the your
movie experience to me when I watched
you know if like supersize me and and
the 30 days on FX stuff like that yeah
do you have this charm about you you you
are really good at telling stories and
whatnot and this whole time we didn't
know going into it in the whole time I'm
like all I can you know as a pop up in a
second you know you think I'm a
stormtrooper helmet yeah yeah the whole
time you was Darth Vader ya know the
whole thing for me was uh you know i'm
i'm a fan i grew up a fan my whole life
love comics video games genre movies
when michael ironside made that guy's
head explode in Cronenberg scanners i
change my life forever like that was the
moment that made me want to make movie
really yeah completely and so um you
know but as a fan I didn't want to like
make a movie about comic-con is like I'm
a fan coming to make a movie about that
was just not the story to tell I want to
tell the story people who were going to
comic-con for very specific reasons that
had real goals or missions things they
want to accomplish I said there's a
better way to kind of tell the story of
this kind of pop culture mecca sure and
and that's what the film does it
profiles a handful of people are
everyone from cosplay aspiring
professionals yeah aspiring artists arm
and then a couple that actually met and
fell in love because of comic because of
comic-con how many times I her that's
geek love man peak love is real it's the
most raw of all love
that we write not uh and then the the
documentary is peppered with the sort of
uh intimate interviews with celebrities
people in the industry people who are
geeks at heart yeah and it just guides
the story along pretty well yet that we
had amazing enemies people like you know
Kevin Smith in and Seth Rogen's have
green Kenneth Branagh you know Frank
Miller Stanley Joss Whedon vain it's
epic Frank Miller we were we have had
you get had to find him where is he I
mean he's there Clues but he comes out
for comic con way he pops out shows up
he'll do a signing real to a panel he's
in and out of town really quickly but
one of the producers on the film with us
is Thomas toll from legendary pictures
you know legendary who made 300 it's
like he's got a great relationship with
Frank and was able to like the kind of
squeaky man that's pretty cool yeah we
were all so psyched that you found Corey
Feldman yeah I know where you found that
or he's well look because well because
Corey Feldman actually has a comic book
label we're done which is which is
amazing i think you have people like you
have him you have gerard way you have
thomas jane you have some of these guys
who have basically said there's really
something here about these stories and
it basically launch their own comic
labels that was the biggest present
cause at quinto you know like there's so
many folks Thomas J no you know it's
sort of like people come out they're
like oh you know they come out and
they're like wearing a cape and he came
and he came out drunk him with no shoes
on he showed up for his interview we
interviewed him like first thing the
more like nine in the morning he showed
up loaded ladies like he had not been to
bed all night it was there barefoot am
like wow Thomas J drunken bear but right
now we're gonna go with that life
imitating exactly seriously it's like
the D is the punisher looking was there
any uh celebrity that you sort of came
into contact or any sort of a public
figure that you were surprised I'd like
really you sir or ma'am I brought it we
interviewed Kenneth Branagh for the film
and uh you kid Branagh was there was the
year that Thor was coming out and he
gave such an amazing interview like a
broader who like broke down why comics
matter and about why heroes are
important and told talking about it from
Shakespearean terms and and he talks
about how Shakespeare alive today
Shakespeare would be at comic-con is
what comic con represent I mean it was
an amazing interview right and so for
him i was i was very impressed that's
that's really cool the the films also
produced Joss Whedon Stanley what was it
like working with that
God is like I met Stanley the whole idea
of the film came from just this chance
conversation i had with Stan in 2009 I
got hired by fox through the simpsons
20th anniversary special for them and so
the minute we got that job i said we're
going to comic-con right I'd never been
so we're going to come come we're gonna
cast for Simpson superfans we're gonna
find these people who are like really
rabbit and passionate about the simpsons
and while we were there shooting that i
met Stanley one night at a party one
over to introduce myself just to tell
him you know how much he changed my life
as a kid how his comics know made me
want to tell my own stories and he goes
all my god morgon things it's really
nice you say you know we we should we
should make a movie together yeah we
should make a documentary we should make
a documentary about comic-con and I was
like yes we should mr. Lee Italian cut
to a year later we were making a movie
with you know with him with Joss Whedon
CEO thomas toll from legendary pictures
Harry Knowles Nina cool news mean it was
it was epic the way the whole thing came
together that really is amazing and a
much better Stanley impression that I
thought of that is not that I mean in
the greatest part is they sure they sort
of a follow Stanley through these
corridors with the Steadicam and that
sort of just like him be like no you're
the greatest thank you I you and I
shaking hands give me the most gracious
guy you'll ever meet like the the
greatest thing I learned from hanging
out stand being around him so much
making this movie is just how good he is
with the people that basically keep him
employed yet like these people who buys
comics who support him for years and he
gives everybody so much of his time and
he won't ever pass up a photograph an
autograph a picture with a kid like
anybody that he will give you the time
to talk and it's amazing that is amazing
um you know and it's interesting because
he's an older dude uh Marvel's been 89 e
nine years old mean and he still goes
non-stop like you like he's playing
racquetball and he's like we were a
comic-con we were out with him a common
till four in the morning like the guy
the guy is a machine it's incredible
that's really cool to hear uh yeah and
in you know Marvel has had so much
success overall my decades and decades
and then just in the past 15-20 years
the the franchises that are just
becoming epic and just these huge sort
of you know industries in their own
right yeah uh you know does he ever
express how that sort of effects and
because it happened so much later in in
in I think lifetime well I think he's so
grateful I mean here's a guy who
when I started watching I got turned on
spider-man comics from watching
spiderman on the electric company right
when they have this like these that he's
really bad live-action spider-man's not
that I was like this is amazing and
Stanley would do the voiceover for like
he would tell the stories and that's why
I started reading his comics you know
that would've been like you know mid
seventies you know into the like lid the
mid seventies early eighties and it was
remarkable you know and so when you look
at kind of what's happened with Marvel
with comics with how they've so
blossomed and become you know these you
know tentpole movies some of the best
movies being made now in this summer is
gonna be the biggest box-office summer
year for the firs honor films you got
hunger games into the Avengers into the
dark night into spider-man like this is
going to be the biggest summer
box-office ever and i think that Stan
just realizes he's fortunate to have had
any success usually whenever you have
any success is great but i think he is
so grateful for what's happened right on
yeah on you mentioned a little before
that you yourself you you have this love
for comics what for you personally and
specifically yeah what is it about
comics in terms of characters are there
any specific characters that you have a
very close passionate all knows as a kid
it was plastic man like I still I still
have such an affinity to Plastic Man
really yeah and I loved plies the
Plastic Man comic book i love the
plastic man khartoum they started making
it like I what I wanted to make plastic
man if I was gonna make an animator
live-action movies like that's the one I
want to make I would make plastic me as
a superhero movie right now Bruce can
was a little bit too old playhouse man
so I gotta find a new guy with the chin
you could be that guy but uh but yet
like no I love that as a kid into this
day um you know I still read a ton of
stunna comics people say you know either
like all the comic comic books are dying
as I comic books as books as paper
things are dying for sure you know but
as an industry its flourishing right now
I buy more comics digitally than I ever
did as a kid yep download them from
comiXology stream my ipad right never
even leave the house never have to put
on pants get out of bed and never it's
amazing that s and and what I said I
told this somebody else what I think is
exciting about this like there was this
real kind of democratization of cinema
that happened a few years ago where you
know things like you know the advent of
like high definition cameras prosumer
cameras cheap editing software and
computers if you had a camera in a
computer and a good idea you could make
a movie if the barrier of entry now for
animators for artists people who can now
make their own comic book is
now gone so now you can literally make
your own digital comic sure they can
have an audience the same thing has
happened in this industry while people
say no it's dying i say i completely
disagree i think there's going to be
even more great independent work come
out now because now i don't need a big
publisher yeah now i don't need you know
to have you know a DC or marvel like pay
for the printing costs not twenty thirty
thousand dollars now it's like as bits
my time it's sweat equity and for me to
get it out digitally like it's it that
there's gonna be so much great stuff
coming out in the next few years I think
it's exciting it happened to the music
industry that's right happened to books
literature and now it's happening come
and now seven comic books and i think
that uh you know i think it is going to
be completely it's gonna be
reinvigorated you know in a way that I
think we don't really know but i think
you know comics you there there is some
nostalgia still to comic books and there
will be people who collect them i think
what will happen with the printed comic
is it will become it'll become more of a
more of a a collector's item I think
what I know record I what I think what
they'll do is they'll do limited edition
runs I think they'll do like one of five
hundred you know where then you like get
a numbered print of this comic book
because so then it really does have
value because there's there's such a
limited supply I think that's the way
they'll go with these these comics and
graphic novels Jeff and I well we're
watching the movie we're sort of
lamenting the idea of having those long
stacks of comic books where you'd have
the dividers a new rifle through all of
them and I think that comics now that
they're so digital yeah so you've lost I
collectors element part of it and it's
something that I kind of Miss like
turning the pages i read comics on my
ipad right now because i just can't
afford to buy like a two-dollar connick
every day yeah excited it's and for me
it's just it's it's a changing the tide
don't you know i don't want to go I
don't want to carry a ton of books
around yeah I don't wanna carry ton of
books in my bag when I travel or like on
my iPad I can have you know you know
dozens of books you know dozens of
comics graphic novels are fantastic it's
also crazy to think that with the new
Retina display on the iPad they actually
look better on a digital screen than
they ever did yeah by holding it close
to you right you can't do that's one of
the most under discussed features of
this new iPad I feel like just how
amazing comics look on this new screen
all I mean they've so pop the sharpness
you know even on I had an ipad 2 and i
just upgraded you compare them and there
is a subtle but just that clarity in
that sharpness it's really awesome I
mean it nice it's tough to be like well
I don't you know okay I don't need a
book anymore yeah exactly yeah I have no
problem letting that guy I don't have a
problem
you go either yeah it's just it's just
something we all have to get used to but
I I do agree there is something about
check out my collection behind me yes
rate which is jamming you enjoy you can
still collect you can still be that guy
that does that but for me it's like I've
so downsized my life like in the last
few years like I had so many dvds and I
had walls of DVD that I never watched it
and so I finally got to the point when I
moved into a new apartment I was like
why why did I have all this stuff why do
I have all these dvds that I never
watched so i purged so many of that so
much of that stuff and because there's a
bunch stuff that I still do collect but
like but on the halls like why I'm this
other stuff i'm just i'm not even
enjoying right there is something
liberating about uh detaching yourself
from the physical object is awesome
right yeah that's it's it's enjoyable
thing are there was there was a
character that you guys were following
Oh character I of comic book salesman
yet Chomsky who's phenomenal who was a
very interesting dude and and passion
probably one of the most successful
probably not the most successful comic
retail in the United States has
mile-high comics uh he's my comics com
check it out he has like the large
selection of comic books in the United
States probably in the world uh he ships
anywhere in the United States like it's
amazing like his sword he just moved
into a new warehouses like 60,000 square
feet Milo its mind-blowing but it's the
amount of comics he has is incredible
this guy's been doing it for decades
right for decades now and he loves it he
loves what comics represent he loves the
idea of them the smell like there's a
scene in the movie where there huffing
comics and then they're smelling the
table like like you smell that and they
like oh yeah that's the Midwest that's a
nice that's a that's Indiana rating
smell that's Indiana like they can tell
wishes have come from just based on how
they smell it's amazing that was the
Requiem part of via of the film but that
was a really really cool um and his ark
basically surrounded about you know the
sort of transition in digital him
struggling with sales and stuff him
trying to keep his business alive you
know because here he is he's at this
crossroads of people who love and
collect comics and a new generation who
love comics but aren't just buying them
right they don't collect them they uh
they become something you know as I said
much more nostalgic than something you
have to have he also talks about how the
comic con in general which is not so
much about comics anywhere you have
movie premieres you have panel
discussion yeah toys video games so much
more than just comics
I'd ever gonna stop calling it that yeah
I mean I think it'll still be it'll
still be comics I think it's still
rooted in the comic book like that's the
the Alpha the Omega this place is still
coming from comic and comic book culture
right and there's still tons of artists
they're artists alley still exists I
think you will see the vendors of paper
comics continuing to get smaller just
because there's gonna be less and less
demand it makes sense just by you know
in terms of evolution of the industry
that's right arm it was interesting the
interviewees that you uh got to talk to
other theme that was going on was
basically how comic-con has evolved into
not just a comic book show but basically
a sort of platform for any franchise
that is capable of being obsessed with
that's right which is a very interesting
sort of the regular there's a glee panel
there i guess like here two ago it was
it was near shooting it was the year
after and I was it was here we shooting
there was a Glee panel for the first
time they're like it because like a
gleep an already regoli really glad he
doesn't he was it he was so upset that
the glee pedals there and uh but it yet
but it's india anything you can obsess
over they have something there for and
but it's the the video games makes so
much sense the extension of video game
culture being there like Holly Conrad
one of the people we follow in the film
Mass Effect you know kind of watched her
and she said in their interview
something that was really i think
eloquent in terms of putting it in
perspective for people like myself where
she goes mass effect like video games
for me are what Star Wars was for you
yes like you know Star Wars which is
this thing that came along that changed
everything for you like that's what's
happened with video games for my
generation like shouldn't we play these
deep experience video games that tell
stories to tell overarching stories with
characters and you get involved in the
community around them she goes that's
what's happening is like there's this
shift into this gaming culture and
whether it's you know mass effect or
halo you know whatever like they have
really deep experiences with loyal fans
and that's in specifically with mass
effect and it's perfect the the timing
with that because mass effect 3
obviously just hitting yeah the whole
you know I talk to people who will say
without stuttering without flinching
mass effect is their favorite piece of
sci-fi uh you know fantasy all yet
that's real policy yeah that's what
Holly says and uh and you know she got
me to play the game which I enjoyed game
very much but it's still not Star Wars
to me yes I'm using the star what is
greater than isolated to me it is
absolutely alright
yeah the definitive Morgan Spurlock I
think I did I think I when I take a step
back Slyke not only impact I had me but
the cultural impact of that film i think
is still much greater than math yes i
agree with that absolutely um have you
heard about the uh there's there's all
these different theories about watching
Star Wars out of order and like there's
a right way to watch it I've heard of
the machete letter I thought the right
way to watch it was start with number
four five and six and then be done
exactly that was a curve I just sort of
put your drink on the case of allegory
and those are the coasters while you are
exactly it's a drink holder uh but yeah
there's all this interesting stuff to
check out about that arm i also want to
talk about more into the where comic-con
is going there are a lot of people who
seem bitter about where it is going you
mentioned the glee thing as a hardcore
sort of comic book guy you know I think
we can all sort of like things that I
think there are things that probably
shouldn't be at college sure you know
like glee probably shouldn't shouldn't
have been able to have a panel at
comic-con yeah I understand I understand
that that it is beyond just comic books
or sci-fi culture their video games now
they want to create things that you know
is that are the popular arts anything
that has a popular fan base or audience
that like they want this to be a place
where you can congregate comfortably and
be happy about it and all come together
and is as Joss Whedon says in the film
are we not dope right all being so we're
all being so obsessive over this one
thing so I understand why they want to
do it but yeah the there's things that
like the leap and I understand but
that's what I love the panels that they
have a comic opera share the fact that
they have this this incredible
experience where you can have writers
come and talk about writing the shows
that you love or the movies that they
make the production designers that talk
about it i mean there's such a deep
experience within comic-con and one of
things that i predict will happen in the
next few years is that because there's
so many people who want to go so many
people they can't like that the place
sells out like a rock on so yeah like
within our but yeah i think this year i
think this year was less than 90 minutes
that they sold out a hundred and fifty
thousand passes to come on and i think
what they will start doing and if they'd
if they aren't then i will suggest it to
them what I predict what I predict
they'll start doing is what what Ted
does is that they'll start making the
panels and things that are happening
live real time on the web right you
could pay 500 bucks sure our orbital or
less what are fifty bucks it's not like
50 bucks to watch you know just the the
panels from your house you know you can
select your handle
I streaming watch them live ithaca
multiples you have you know that you
watch all the panels you may not get the
expiry can watch the panels like i
predict some like that will happen and
tons of people will watch oh yes
indicated and everyone will pay and will
be huge enormous that's right i mean get
some copyright like a lil something by
there right there are few people is
right exactly David Glanzer that was my
idea here you go I'm calling you guys
right now yeah i definitely understand
the whole idea geeks getting bitter
about not being able to attend comic-con
when there are panels likely i feel like
uh gigs have always suffered for their
passion when up people describe
comic-con as this mecca where they can
go and you know they feel they even get
in exactly now that they're banned from
it bitches other people are there yes
like uh you know all for the rest of the
year they feel like outcasts and this is
the place where they go and they
describe it in the movie as you know
like they're people like minds that go
there yeah like the the what i love the
one person says the film's girl says use
it's like we have our own country this
time we have our own Reds our country
its place where we can go you know
nobody looks at us differently no it
looks at us weird i love yet film
because nobody looks at you strange cuz
you're a six foot two black men the
likes were supergirl costume like you
are completely normal you know that
point it's it's fantastic if only that
behavior could translate in the real
world that's right right yep kinda has
all the answers it is a comic-con is a
place where you know it is uh that all
the tribes have learned to love each
other and get along it's a utopia and so
the Trekkies in the Star Wars fans can
get along why can't we all exactly
better well said I think my favorite
part of the movie is when they're uh
sort of prepping one of the girls that
hasn't ever been to comic-con before and
they're describing the smell another
conference floor and I've been to the
Javits Center New York Comic Con and
also the one in San Diego there's
definitely a distinct smell well and
especially by like day day three day
four where people are wearing the same
costume they've been wearing that for
three days cuz it's the pits not the
people because there's people who come
like alodia is in the film is there's a
as a professional cause player named
alodia comes from the Philippines that
we follow in the movie and she literally
gets paid to go to Comic Cons and dress
up it's amazingly that's her full-time
job and she looks bananas yeah like she
looks like an anime character um but but
nobody's like they're like she travels
you know with like a makeup person and
she has a different costume every day
most you'll know do that most will have
their one costume that they were every
day that gets all funky
and just keeps getting funkier as the
time goes on so by Sunday like those
costumes some of those costumes are
right there's no wardrobe change know
the order there's nobody cleaning that
it's just and it's sunk into the walls
in the carpet like some good doctor by
Sunday yeah that's bad news is bad news
but that's what that's why you know
that's the like you do what I do and you
wait and do all of your shopping until
sunday afternoon like I don't start
shopping till this two hours left of
comic-con really and that's when I go
buy anything that I want because at that
point everything's on sale yeah there's
nobody wants to pack it up and take it
home share so you have to brave the funk
yeah but you get really crazy sars news
gonna get a gas mask get a gas mask the
money spent on the gas mask you'll save
in the toy exact so works out well the
gas mask pays for itself I tell you the
boot that I want to set up which is
again and again Sammy's gonna take my
idea is I want to get a booth at
comic-con that sells costumes really
nobody sells costumes at comic-con I'm
like you would clean up if you sold
costumers there you would clean like
there's nobody there selling these
costumes and because everybody's there
like you start seeing people wear them
like I want to wear a costume I wanted
if you had that you would like print
money of course and it would be the
greatest thing I thought you were gonna
say a pine tree air fresh pine stand
right next door to the costume boot like
the necklace versions yeah i think the
costumes like fifty dollars behind
reassures are a thousand that's
ridiculous very funny uh the movie
comic-con episode for a fans hope it's
out right now on demand everywhere it's
everywhere cuz when we released the film
you know was in select theaters and when
greatest movie ever sold came out like I
did all this press for the movie I was
everywhere like and within a week and a
half of that movie coming out i was on
conan i was on colbert i was on jimmy
kimmel like all within 10 days in the
movie opened on 18 screens right so most
people in the entire country couldn't
even see it should i said we're not
going to release the movie like that
again so this one like we released it in
select theaters it's in like la San
Francisco Portland this week it opens in
New York DC Boston but at the same time
it's day-and-date video on demand on
itunes on xbox on playstation voodoo you
name it like it is everywhere any place
you can download digital movies you can
watch it that's very cool so if you have
the internet I mean you're doing you got
the world wide interweb if that
Internet's coming into you that's right
you're gonna be able you got access you
do you can watch the movie right
and I recently just did that for the
first time I checked out have you heard
of goon yeah this the I secondly I her
which I heard funny it's very funny yeah
and if you're a nice i can you
absolutely love it I'd never done the
whole on demand with my cable box thing
before it's I sound like I'm from a
different point what is this the future
I could what is the movie in my house
I'm trying to shove a dollar bill into
my caleb us it's not working but and I
was like wow this is great lazy no as a
filmmaker what do you think of that
because a big topic of discussion on the
show is how the movie going experience
like getting into the theater and
obviously it varies by just experience
though it is an experience positive or
negative I find lately it's been neg
depends on the movie for me it depends
on sale like there's movies like I want
to go see in a movie theater right um
you know like documentaries most
documentaries I will watch documentaries
at my house unless it's like burner
hertzog cave of forgotten dreams or Pina
you know like these 3d movies that came
out with last year that are beautiful
spectacles to watch sure but you know
most docs I think you can watch on
television I'm in your house but like
the Avengers I'm not gonna watch The
Avengers on my house on demand like I
want to see the vengers in a movie
theater aight i want to see that on the
biggest screen i possibly can with a
whole bunch of Yahoo's in the audience
we're gonna be as excited as me exactly
like that's where I want to see then
there's those movies that you want to
have that experience with avatar I
wanted to see in imax 3d right i wanted
to see that in a theater but for me I
think that there is something special
and especially a comic con because there
is a great theatrical experience that
you have with this film so we partnered
with a company called tug at Tugg calm
right where anybody that wants to host a
screening in their town can sign up with
tug basically you become the promoter if
you can like you know partner with a
comic book shop whatever you sell a
certain number of tickets you trigger
the movie and then you can have your own
kind of comic-con screening in your town
people come in costume you can create an
event around it really cool it's cool so
now we're doing these tug events all
across the United States and been kind
of partnership with the same type of you
know digital release because I think
there are people who want that
theatrical experience just like I do
right now I love that and a movie like
this is fun to see in a movie theater
with other people in costumes it's crazy
sure um or you may just want to watch it
at home what I mean to be totally as
I've become a little jaded if the
movie-going experience I think it's sort
of and maybe I don't know maybe seeing
one in Manhattan is not the greatest
venues to see a film depends where you
go the cuz
I'm a big fan of the kips bay on the
east side of a theater is the best place
for sure I agree with that arm mount
Hoboken there's a theater there that
still has that you know uh feel
realistic seats wellness is relatively
new arm but there there is that sort of
feel of like over a respectable film
watching experience all right no
everyone knows that what the cell phones
in I don't I just maybe I'm too easily
damaged don't go to movie in Brooklyn
where people are yelling at the screen
the whole time and like they're talking
on their phones during the movie I'm
like really it's not the part where he
calmly tells everybody exactly exactly
it's a very noice I'm the people I
remember I stopped going to the Union
Square movie theater last year when they
had bedbugs there's a crazy outlaw seats
I will never go to cater yeah you've
just given me such the scheme's oh my
god you'll never go that they don't
touch anything it's like outbreak meets
contagious that's right place exactly
it's a regal right that's a recent yet
is yes cross that off there and that is
all my Thank You union square let's
switch gears a little bit we only have a
few more minutes with you i wish i could
go longer but maybe you'll come back i
look at that be awesome would love to um
we want to get into the whole street art
sort of thing that's been going on and
we recently found out that you yourself
are a big fan yeah and you're actually
curating an exhibit called the new blood
yes all I think space gallery in Los
Angeles it opens April twenty-eighth
April twenty-eighth features amazing
artists like saber Melrose Garcia design
Ron English you know kid zoom tim biskup
Gary baseman you know it's it's awesome
and it's very cool because Super Size Me
was actually my first exposure to Ron
English yeah I I didn't I just love the
art and if you recall to the film for
people who are listening it basically
breaks up the chapters they're sort of
like slope and when he any old and all
those paintings already existed like I
went and met with Ron and interviewed
him after I saw one of his original his
original fat Ronald paintings MC
supersize which he then recreated like
the the the MC supersize you see
everywhere now was the one he created
for our Super Size Me poster for
Sundance right and that's now gone
everywhere but ron was the one who kind
of got me into the whole kind of street
art scene lowbrow art see sure I started
running around with him and meeting all
these amazing people SAS Christian Colin
Christian you know
uh tara mcpherson you know was the guy
just got to meet so many these people
and love the art and just became
obsessed over like that's the one thing
that I'd collect you know obsessively is
is street art really yeah that's cool um
yeah I mean that that scene is just
exploded it's incredible and like what's
interesting about the new blood show is
that there's this generation now of
artists who who now are growing up with
that as their influence yeah like these
the people now who've grown up you know
looking up to the people like Ron
English ramirez garcia shepard fairey
who are now using them as their model of
this is what i want to be that's what i
want to spire to be so for me that's
what this this art show is about it's
about this transition of kind of passing
the torch from that generation of
artists to the next ones and each one of
the people in the show has been
handpicked by the artists they're the
established artists are saying here's
the new blood here's the artist you need
to know about and some of them have been
there protégées their apprentices or
just people they think that you know we
need to get a handle on yeah I mean it's
um you know uh having watch stuff like
uh exit through the gift shop it's just
very I mean aside from whether or not
that is yeah what it says it is mr.
brainwash is for real he's a real guy we
followed him in our hulu series a day in
the life yeah he's he's the real deal i
do think but i do think banks he
recognized like i have the chance to
create yeah an artist is very dark and
is that what you think I mean there's
there seems to be a divide I think I
think that um I think that he was
already wanting to be an artist every
started shooting and start creating his
own art I think banks he encouraged him
and even banks he said you should pick a
date for a show right and I think Banksy
at that point start realizing the end of
this film is gonna be this guy he's not
a dumb guy he know sort of brilliant he
sort of realized wait a second and so
things happen in his greatest gift of
the art world is saying look I created
this right I create my greatest art
creation in art is mr. it was like
street art inception that's right he
really likes he incepted us all with mr.
brainwash and la seems like a better
venue for street art of that caliber I
was I wanted to ask you you know in your
experience collecting exhibiting do you
feel like there's a difference in the
way that the west coast embrace of
street art as opposed to the east coast
I remember when well the graphics
project was supposed to happen in the
Brooklyn art museum that's right and
that got shut down because they're
worried that kids will be influenced
starts break I mean have they been to
Brooklyn I know yeah there's my pain
everywhere it's already yeah
really attentive and set when are in the
streets didn't come out here because i'm
from the west coast but i was here that
show was so good it was an Roger Gastman
who did the book the history graffiti he
was one of the co-creators on that show
I mean they did such an amazing job on
that and I think like the graffiti scene
you know there's a tremendous amount of
street art here the graffiti art scene
really kind of wood born out of like the
New York the New York seen this is where
it kind of came from sure the first wall
writers and then kind of expanded across
the country but I think in terms of like
graffiti art being accepted yes in terms
of graffiti are being accepted into the
art world the art world still driven by
popular New York gallery like as much as
you have something in a show at you know
in LA in a gallery you want gagosian to
take your stuff right you want you want
to be in a big New York City gallery I
think that you rec'd this this is still
where I think the the hard numbers are
defined in in the art scene yet I mean
it's interesting to see also how you
have these guys who you know there's
that those core people who again they
resist the you know explosiveness they
resist the selling out quote-unquote of
it all but you know I think I'm like you
said the generations that are influenced
by this movement are really they're the
ones to watch because it's sort of like
okay this has had its day let's see
where it goes from here yeah and to me
that's probably the most interesting
part of it and I just think it's amazing
to living in in places like this where
you can have these artists come in arm
uh there was a roller have you heard of
rodents unbelievable dumating Belgium I
think she's from he count he comes and
it's just like one day you just get all
these photos you're like look who is in
Brooklyn look who is there d face was
just here like a couple ways and it's
just like it's a bit cool you're just
gonna pay I love it you come and do what
you gotta do is there a future in I
would I mean I'm just saying I think I'm
gonna just ask you now sure can you do
something can you make a film about
street artists or do you know I mean I
just I I would clearly passion I'm so
passionate I've talked about this with a
few different people like I would love
to make a film you know almost like a
you know some sort of a sphere film I
just don't know what the what the angle
is do you just tell it from different
people's points of view right you know
how do you what is that movie and so
because for me it is something that I so
really believe in I'm so passionate
about I'm sure yes four inches i don't
know what the the angle is to get into
the film without just being a historical
film like just you know Roger Gastman
who is what I was just talking about
he's just done a film called wall riders
which basically talks about the history
of graffiti up to
I think it kind of ends with almost like
right before the hip hop movement kind
of exploded like I don't know where it
stops which I think hip-hop was the next
step of kind of graffiti becoming even
more popular just because it was very
much entangled into the hip-hop culture
and then from there was when it really
became art right really it was after the
hip hop scene was and when it suddenly
people suddenly started becoming artists
that were able to sell works far that
pay actually people paid for um you know
I think that you know to tell that story
I think will be fascinating but I think
Rogers already kind of running down the
path right on yeah very cool well
unfortunately we are running out of time
I would love to be able to pick your
brain for hours to come but hopefully
I'll be back and I would love to come
back we would really appreciate that
again comic-con episode for a fans hope
