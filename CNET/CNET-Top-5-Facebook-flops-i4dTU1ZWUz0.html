complicated but in spite of the wild
popularity of Facebook I kind of feel
bad for them aside from their disastrous
IPO this company has released more dud
products over the past few years than
anyone I can think of I'm Donald Bell
and today's show I'm here to refresh
your memory with my list of the top 5
Facebook product flops features that set
out to change the world but didn't at
all starting things off at number 5
Facebook Lite now this was a stripped
down version of Facebook that was
engineered to load more quickly for
users on slow connections or slow
Hardware they tossed out the apps it
toss out the games they decluttered the
whole interface oh and they also tossed
out a bunch of those annoying flash
based ads on the sidebar but those are
the crazy pre-ipo days of 2009 turns out
that catering to poor people and serving
less ads wasn't a project worth keeping
around after less than a year Facebook
light got switched off at number 4
Facebook questions with 1 billion users
at your disposal why not put them to
work solving life's great questions
launched in 2010 and killed off in 2012
Facebook questions gave users a way to
pull their friends for questions like
where it's the best pizza in Portland or
which plan of the 8 sequel is the best
or where the hell did Facebook questions
go it was supposed to be a fatal blow to
Yahoo Answers but instead it just kind
of withered away at number 3 the ticker
in 2011 Facebook did a major overhaul
their news feed and gave us a terrifying
and very annoying little window onto all
of our friends likes and shares and
comments it was like peering into the
naked soul of Facebook and seeing its
neuroses for what it really was and
people hated that thing
so Facebook quickly saw the error of
their ways and gave us a way to hide it
please hide it do yourself a favor
awful coming in at number two face book
deals oh this is a time when Mark
Zuckerberg had the huevos to take on
Groupon and LivingSocial I have to admit
it kind of seemed like a good idea who
better than Facebook to know where you
live what you like and where you like to
travel but maybe it was a little too
perfect a little too perfect not to be
creepy
after four months Google deals got
slashed now before we get to number one
let's stop picking on Facebook for a
minute you know another internet giant
it makes a ton of mistakes Google
you're my favorite five Google flops all
of which are really just as embarrassing
as anything Facebook has done that said
at least Google has that whole don't be
evil mission statement thing Facebook
could have used that to help prevent
them from thinking up number one beacon
hey here's an idea let's make it so that
Facebook can keep track of all the sites
you browse outside of Facebook so that I
can share that information with all of
your friends what could go wrong not
creepy at all the idea was such an
affront to privacy that it resulted in
the class-action lawsuit and even Mark
Zuckerberg later admitted it was a
mistake which is not to say that he
won't try it again
so there you have it five ideas launched
by the king of social networks that
wound up right in the gutter for more
top fives like this head over to top-5
