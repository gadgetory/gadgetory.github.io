the International Space Station as
everyone's favorite low-earth orbits
sharehouse turns 20 we ask how it got
there how did the astronauts survive
onboard and who exactly left that weird
Pizza stain on the communal couch I'm
Claire Riley welcome to watch this space
from the CNET studios in sydney this is
your weekly guide to everything on earth
you need to know about space and tonight
the International Space Station is
turning 20 old enough to vote not quite
old enough to drink
sorry ISS you're gonna have to lay off
that moonshine for another year the idea
for an International Space Station goes
all the way back to Ronald Reagan who
was no doubt kind of tio de bout missing
the first space race and getting to
shoot junk into space I guess that's
what you get for gallivanting around
Hollywood movie sets Oh Reagan Byrne
topical anyway
in 1984 Reagan called on NASA to build
an International Space Station within a
decade it took another 14 years to get
off the ground but on November 20 1998
the first module of the ISS was launched
the Russian built u.s. owned functional
cargo block known as Zarya not that one
there we go was the first component of
the ISS to be launched two weeks later
the u.s. built component known as unity
was also launched the whole ISS was
always going to be way too big to shoot
into space in one go
it weighs close to a million pounds now
instead the space station was built in
stages over the years with all the
different modules blasting up from Earth
on 42 separate assembly flights before
being attached to the ISS in space piece
by piece
think of it kind of like a king-size
IKEA bed that doesn't quite fit through
your apartment door so the Russian space
agency and nasa took all the parts of
their floor borg threw them into the
space bedroom and then connected them
with the double flew and shmoo goose
board where their remote ly operated
allen key as it stands or more
accurately floats now the whole space
station is just one yard short of a
football field from end to end
that's 357 feet all because this is
space where smart people use the metric
system instead of just measuring
everything in yards and penny weights
and thimbles
that's roughly 109 meters so what's up
there well in honor of the
Space Station's early noughties history
why don't we take a tour of the ISS in a
style similar to yet legally distinct
from mtv's cribs
that's right Claire we're up here on the
ISS so sorry if I break up just a wee
bit but they've led us on for a special
viewing this whole area is about the
size of a six bedroom deluxe house in
the Hollywood Hills it's got a gym where
they work out at least two hours a day
they've got two bathrooms complete with
the great suction toilets they use up
here and of course a water recovery
system to make full use of the beautiful
imported water that they get on the ISS
most importantly for the Instagram game
up here they've got that gorgeous 360
degree viewing window which is just a
delight there are also six fabulous
sleeping quarters up here or you can
just peg yourself to a wall and sleep
like a rock star
fun fact those sleeping quarters need to
be really well ventilated otherwise you
wake up in the middle and I gasping for
air because the carbon dioxide has
pulled around your face like a bubble
isn't that great outside there's an acre
of solar panels with a wingspan of about
240 feet or 73 meters that's roughly the
size of - Mariah Carey walk-in wardrobes
and when it comes to parking your ride
up here Claire the ISS can have the six
spaceships connected to it at once for
when the crew wants to bring their crew
around now while we're up here Claire I
do just want to touch on the technology
they've got installed they've got
350,000 sensors 50 computers all
connected with eight miles of wiring and
of course internet via satellite which
makes for some really sweet LAN parties
MRI
no I've lost the connection okay well
the ISS orbits the earth 16 times in a
single day at a speed of 5 miles a
second
that's roughly 1 orbit every 90 minutes
all up we give the ISS four and a half
stars it could be a little bit more
spacious but we love what they've done
with the place and it makes for a pretty
sweet pad back to you Claire thanks
Claire that space crib truly is dope AF
the structure itself is impressive but
what's more impressive is the fact that
since expedition 1 first visited on
November 2nd 2000 the International
Space Station has hosted humans in space
for 18 uninterrupted years more than 230
people have visited the ISS in that time
more than half of them from the US and
the ISS has even hosted a handful of
space tourists but the bulk of the time
humans spend on the ISS is spent working
doing research and conducting remote
experiments for scientists back on earth
that includes everything from growing
plants and biology experiments to track
house cell growth differs in space
measuring the effects of weightlessness
and microgravity and research on how
humans cope under extreme conditions and
then there's all the time astronauts
spend communicating with us here on
earth sharing their experiences with
students suni explainers on how stuff
works in space and yes even briefing the
stars of the movie the Martian on how to
act as believable astronauts though
friend of the show Matt Damon needs no
acting tips whatsoever so there you have
it spend time on Earth's most remote
sharehouse and you're gonna have to work
out two hours in a gym every day pee in
a suction tube sleep against a wall in a
bubble of your own expired air all while
hurtling around the planet at five miles
per second sorry but that air BnB gets a
solid one star review from me that's it

Claire Riley fussiness goodnight and
Godspeed I'm not sure why they've got me
wearing two microphones Claire but I can
hear you loud and clear from the ISS
here it is really quite amazing that
they let me up here I have done no
training zero training whatsoever
oh no we think the ISS is a great
holiday location for mum dad
the kids no kids okay and it has a
wingspan of 240 feet which is roughly
equivalent to three furlongs or two
hogsheads - the power will go again</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
