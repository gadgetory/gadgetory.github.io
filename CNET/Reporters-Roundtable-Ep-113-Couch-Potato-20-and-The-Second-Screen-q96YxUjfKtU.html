roundtable i'm rafe needleman in San
Francisco this is our weekly show on a
single tech topic each time and you know
next week what's happening on March
seventh Apple is announcing everybody
expects the ipad 3 that's what we think
is going to happen now why is this
portable but not all that portable form
factor working out so well what is it
about a machine that is best used on the
couch one growing case use case for
tablets is the second screen it seems we
aren't just satisfied anymore with a
watching TV like we used to or just
playing a game now we need a second
screen to keep us engaged businesses are
growing up around the whole idea of the
second screen and programmers and are
starting programmers by programmers I
mean content programmers content
developers are starting to take this
ancillary auxiliary screen market
seriously and that's what we're talking
about today that's right it's couch
potato version two so to talk about this
day I've got two people who are really
expert in this category on my left
Jeremy Toman who is the chief product
officer at digit Jeremy thanks coming in
sure and across from me oh they do Luo
Tian's who's that I told you I would
stumble over that name I'm sorry olay
Lucia's who is the chief creative
officer over at MX and they make second
screen apps thanks for coming in hello
thanks for having me all right so listen
to me when I was growing up the second
screen was a swanson salsbury steak
dinner right that was it what is good
why do people want need this or they
just being shoved this the second screen
concept up Alicia I said first of all I
think it was a funny phenomenon when we
started making second screen apps we
realized pretty quickly you know what we
could have done this as soon as the
laptops came out it's just nobody really
thought about it maybe these machines
were too awkward but people who are
starting to have the laptops open and
and you know look at IMDb and and what
not at the same time I think that when
you talked about the form factor it just
had to get maybe that little bit smaller
it had to be like a one-handed thing you
can throw down like a mag
the other etc and I think what happened
at the same time is that with the rise
of social networks we see that the
teenage generation is just basically not
collecting content any more like buying
dvds or albums or CDs they aggregate in
content and they want to do that all the
time so the attention split is really
where this market started being
interesting for investors where people
realized while the eyeballs are going
away from just the TV screen and we
probably want to be on all these screens
people have talked a lot about about
with younger the younger generation
about the always-on generation about
people are always plugged in and engage
is that what this is about what or me
it's partially about that i think you
know follow point was just being made is
that there was already stats that people
were using a second screen while
watching TV so numbers were sure that we
were seeing even two years ago was in
the forty to sixty percent of TV
watching happen with the second screen
in hands that could have been the laptop
but it's really about the the phones and
the tablets i think the interesting
that's going on is this kind of
push-pull for now phenomenon is that
marketers here hey you know sixty
percent of TV watching happen to the
second screen in hand you know people
are as you said right young people are
doing all this and then what's happened
is that's turned around saying oh well
they must be using those second screens
about television all the time right and
they think that's the big thing is a lot
of the time that's words of friends or
it's angry birds or it's texting with a
buddy about plans you're doing tomorrow
so there's tons of opportunity don't get
me wrong second screen for TV is huge
but i think i think it's also being a
little bit kind of shoved down people's
throats right now you got to do this you
got to do this and I think we're maybe a
little bit away from figuring out where
that happy medium really is going to end
up yeah I kind of feel the same i
thought about analogies before you know
like maybe going back to Friendster and
MySpace to think about why did they not
work and all of a sudden Facebook and
Twitter take everything by storm maybe
we're in a three-legged horse race right
now we're like we have this thing people
have it in their hands what can we do on
it but the experience hasn't really been
figured out now once the guy I do want
to get into I do want to make everybody
aware of as we go on here olay your
company MX builds actual second screen
content apps yes we do and Jeremy your
company digit does directories and
remotes well we have a TV Guide and
remote control application okay so
different
approaches to making use of the smart
big screen whether it's a phone or a
tablet while you're plopped on the couch
watching you're watching your TV are you
guys at odds or complementary or what I
mean can only run one app at a time
right well I mean I don't think
anybody's house i think the ones that
are at odds in my opinion are about the
what you do while watching TV so if all
these company makes an app for a given
show let's pretend it's 30 rock that 30
rock Apple might be at odds with a
company like getglue who's really trying
to use get you to use their kind of
generic second screen app at the same
time so I think we're going to see some
issues there our focus is really all
about up until the point where someone's
watching TV at that point we you know we
think the user might be off again
whether it's words with friends or or
the aforementioned fictitious 30 rock
app we don't really know what people
want to do after that point yeah no I
think that's where that's where we're
similar in terms of we're trying to
figure out the second screen but very
different we have focused on rich media
experiences we're trying to figure the
user experience when you're interacting
with the content around the show we were
building content complimentary to the
show that you're watching and the social
integration the check in and the talking
with friends really was a second thought
for us we first of all we tried to find
an engagement the right amount of
interest towards the first Queen versus
the second screen and the interesting
thing that we found is that when we do
that the second screen turns into the
first screen I'll go on that's
fascinating so people are spending
millions of dollars per episode and and
they say well let's have a second screen
app and they give some company maybe
yours I don't know I'm making this up
fifty thousand dollars to build an app
and it turns out the people are watching
that app more than the hugely expensive
show well it happened when we started we
build a swing technology that can
control the disc a blu-ray disc from the
second screen app so all of a sudden and
that's funny because you're making some
somewhat of a remote concept to all of a
sudden that second screen up turns into
the remote control for your for your
movie and you can go and like oh this is
cool who's that and you tab on it and
then the disc jumps forward to that
scene and all of a sudden you edit your
sent you added your own version of the
film by interacting with the second
screen we're not in the TV space yet so
I say way different so we can control
the playback of a film digital or on
ray so is this is this more important
this whole concert that we're talking
about is it more important for live
appointment viewing or for what you're
talking about where you pop a disc in or
you or play a stream yes and yes I you
know I think the live it so TV kind of
falls and for the anyone not familiar
with the terms there's an appointment TV
which is the stuff you watch live it's
it's really five categories it's a
reality TV events like the Oscars and
sports news and then big episode so like
the season finale of entourage would be
it would be an appointment show because
everybody wants to watch it or the
season premiere Game of Thrones things
like that that's appointment TV there's
be that's the burgeoning social TV side
of things where people maybe are
checking in or tweeting or doing
something while that shows happening and
then there's there's catch up TV which
is everything else so if you're watching
last week's episode of the 30 rock on
your DVR you don't really care what
someone's tweeting about because you're
you know seven days behind so I think
the social TV side of things is very
very appointment driven that's where the
check-ins come into play the tweets and
hash tags etc and i think that's that's
an area where i don't think anybody in
this room knows where it's going to go i
have a personal suspicion that would you
know we it's very hard to build an
entire platform around something that
only accounts for about forty percent of
TV watching that's that's kind of my
beef with social TV yeah but i think the
would you call it the the second
watching ketchup the ketchup the ketchup
TV is exactly where what we
experimenting with comes into play
because we also have to look at you
start something of your DVR or a hulu
stream what is it that's interesting is
it interesting to review all the tweets
that happened while that was like
probably not so much but would be
interesting to say if you'd say 30 rock
well what's that crazy stars and stripes
underwear that Kenneth is wearing right
now can i buy that somewhere alright
that's maybe the sad sounds like the
marketers both fans like a total fantasy
it's like i'm watching TV and they've
got all this product placement and then
i want to buy that things like maybe I'm
old but if I'm watching a highly
produced care lovingly crafted even
maybe even commercially crafted but
doesn't matter it's crafted it's time
coded to the nanosecond I want to watch
that show well I mean you're right i
mean i think i think this is a divot the
biggest policy is that there's the
is this energy right now toward
distracting people from the shows are
watching and don't get me wrong I think
there are a lot of times for the
complementary apps make a lot of sense I
think a lot of the stuff that all these
companies doing makes a lot of sense for
a lot of the content I think it's got to
be like a it can't be the pendulum
that's sitting at one end it can't be we
expect you to do lots of interactivity I
mean we've heard we've heard from
marketers since the 90s about being able
to watch two by Jennifer Aniston sweater
the ways the thing is like yeah we're
gonna sell them that sweater and no
one's done it nobody seems to really
want it but it sounds great in the white
paper so I I not a belief on the the by
the thing you're watching I do that I do
though think the who is that character
I've seen them in the movie before
what's going on here you know that quote
sounds familiar where's that from I
think that aspect of you know kind of
that real-time quick research thing is
where some of these apps could be a lot
of fun and I completely agree and I
didn't mean that that buying off the
television thing is what we're for it's
good that you said we need something to
disagree on no the digital over later
Hollywood has been it's an old fantasy
but you know who is going to be who's
going to be allowed to do that right if
not the content owners themselves what
I'm interested in what I'm fascinated
about is to find the right mix to find
the right amount of stuff that you can
do on your tablet for example we're
experimenting with a safe for later
function so you have content coming
across the second screen device and you
see something that you're interested in
you shouldn't you know pick this up and
then I start digging around you should
just be able to hit the easy button
right right and say okay so later I'll
go back and research that or even have
an archive right it'd be cool of one of
your apps could just at the end of it
you can say you know who are all the
guest stars what were the great quotes
here what was that underwear you know
all the things is just there for you
right that means what the second screen
can come in really valuable you know you
during the commercial break pull up the
you know the little things that you've
been missing etc and I think I think
there's tons of opportunity lighting
ahead on that side and it sorry no go
ahead and in that space I think it's
interesting to watch the metadata
companies the companies that are now
trying to figure out how to tag all that
information / timecode so like who is on
screen right now write the content
recognition isn't so far that it will
recognize Brad Pitt's voice and say
that's Brad Pitt somebody has to look at
it know that he's on screen at that
moment in time but that can't be too far
away from us
um right as far away as the electrical
engine in every car maybe I don't know
okay anyway go ahead yeah but now you
your company does second screen content
and you do a bunch of of children's
programming if i'm not mistaken while
we're moving into that space you know
we're just starting an initiative with
the national academy of sciences and it
looks into how we can leverage the fact
that children middle school to high
school age children are constantly that
literally living on their mobile devices
any moment they're not in this classroom
so how can we bridge that gap and how
can we leverage the excitement about
entertainment properties like movies and
games into educational learning it just
strikes me I mean kids watch the same
show over and over and over again and so
I could see inside what I'm trying to
get into is get at is how different
types of programming lend themselves to
an ancillary auxiliary app sports
obviously sure its real time and if
you're a sports fan I mean we already
sports fans news viewers are already
spent finance news viewers are already
getting essentials essentially second
screen content with all the crawls all
over the screen I mean your barrage with
information why not offload that right
sure I mean it's a really good point
rape is that one of the biggest mistakes
made in TVs or especially in new TV
stuff is companies that start blanketing
TV is this one thing like like all TV
watching is the same because it's just
so not the same there's every genre is
different when I watch a comedy is very
different than watch one-hour drama very
different than sports and by the way
just shouldn't be watching televised
news anymore that's just that should
only be on your second screen that's
just terrible but use Express what my
guests do not express those of my repair
companies CBS thanks Jeremy sorry that's
all right all your news from the
internet people but I think that's the
thing is what I like about what always
companies doing in a bunch of other
startups i knows that they're focusing
on very specific types of content so
I've seen some second screen apps all
around sports that are great because we
all know that you're watching the game
you wanted to find out like what was
this person's streak or the hitting
average or whatever it is for whatever
given support and the biggest mistake
and the only advice I'm giving to anyone
in the spaces stop thinking about that
all TV is equal because it's very much
not yeah and I think to the point i
think the tweet statistics during the
academy awards are fantastic
stuff gets a little boring and screened
the tweets go up the halftime show is
almost no tweeting yeah let's talk about
that so there were two there Jeremy you
mentioned that there was appointment
viewing there's two kinds there there
are several kinds but there were two big
events recently that had a lot of second
screen potential the Academy Awards and
I guess the Grammys and then the Super
Bowl did you guys experienced any of
those with the second screen in Hanoi
and what was it like and where were the
opportunities there I mean there's it's
been there's a lot of kind of blogs
they've been indexing this content
recently a company how bluefin labs
there's a ton of stats on kind of second
screen no really more social what are
people tweeting during shows things like
that interestingly we're at this pace
right now we're social activities during
TV for appointment TV are on their rise
I mean every event it's going up and up
and up and there's whether it's tweets
per second or overall tweets or a number
of users tweeting all the stuffs on the
way up so we're really at this
interesting kind of growth era for the
what do you do while you're watching the
show but they've diagnosed already that
the stats on the academy awards and the
stats and the superbowl were radically
different and even the Grammys actually
apparently beat the Academy Awards for
tweets per second or overall tweets or
something like that no one doesn't it
only mean that maybe the Academy Awards
were a better program well there's also
the more engaging and less time on
Twitter better content there's also the
argument about you know if you're
watching you're watching the Academy
Awards you're probably watching a lot
more video the Grammys really you really
need to see Adele or are you really just
listening to it right and but was also
interesting as the the side analysis of
the potential demographics that you know
who you know are the are the Academy
Award audience tweeting as much as the
Grammy audience probably not yep it's
interesting i tried the academy award so
tried a bunch of the social apps and
they were mostly very disappointing
experiences and first of all I watched
the Academy once with friends mm-hmm and
every two seconds the star appears on
screen and make such jokes everybody's
always laughing and this banter and so
the sinking just doesn't work into now
couldn't catch it I mean it's just not
the fault of the app but the room was
just plain too loud when it finally
caught it I really didn't know what the
f wanted me to do and so I went to the
official Oscars app which was which
where they knew exactly what was going
to happen went on stage which was not
set
and the only good thing that I found
there was that you can actually go
between camera backstage Yammer the
Oscars did something very very
interesting and I see this happening in
sports potentially as well where there's
the main screen you know you see these
control rooms right everybody seen the
picture of a other TV director and the
giant control i'm surrounded by monitors
in the dark you know nuclear bunker with
the big screen saying take this shot
take that shot and what you are seeing
when you watch any show is one shot of
dozens and what the second screen apps
do like the Oscars opted is let you
watch on a second screen a different
view right which is a really interesting
idea really interesting but also deeply
flawed because it had audio they were
doing interviews backstage while you're
hearing you know Murray on stage making
jokes etc but I wanted to talk about
some of the other apps because I felt
that there was a huge wasted opportunity
what I was really looking for was not
the tweets what I was really looking for
was expanding on the film that was being
discussed like okay there's a there's a
foreign documentary foreign short
something like that you've hardly ever
heard about it so the apps wasted that
opportunity and giving me that right
away real time in really deep
exploration I had to go back to the IMDb
app and look at look up those films so I
think that's where the user experience
and the sinking really have to come
together agree links them I completely
agree I think again it's this focus on
you know this is the problem with with
TVs industries is a minute I driven all
the money in TV is about advertising and
so you kind of follow the money to see
where the innovations happening and the
money's and sad as goes ahead buying and
then you've got the social TV phenomenon
which is getting advertisers and
marketers excited so they're investing
in it and so instead of companies
thinking about it holistically saying
what would be the greatest experience we
could make around the Oscars around the
Super Bowl around 30 rock around
whatever it might be right now too much
of the emphasises we know people are
tweeting we got that we got to capture
and engage and I think I think that's
great but it feels like the kind of this
whole social media thing all over again
with with companies just artificially
shoving their way into consumers lives I
think instead if the Oscars had you know
a great you know Oscar pool thing hey
collect with all your friends make you a
little voting ballot here's a links to
all the all the movies were in it
here's the previews behind-the-scenes
content you know I'm not a big fan of
all this
Aang third angle thing I want to work to
watch TV I'm I just want to kind of sit
back and just watch it I don't mind
sending out the tweet or whatever but at
the end of the day I think I think it's
again people are expecting us to put too
much time and energy into what's
supposed to be a pretty entertaining it
what they call it they call I mean the
big difference between computers and
television is the what they call the
lean forward versus lean back right and
with this stuff I mean which way my
supposedly don't put a tween we lit a
device between mean for ya is lean
sideways as like a seder you might have
forward together it's a big mistake
because it's it's it's this is the
things that people are using the term
they're saying oh it's it's lean back
but it's not what lean back actually
means is that you're laying back and
you're not doing any your mind is
leaning that you're leaning back you're
not you're not engaging with something
the most you might do it's like American
Idol you'll pull your phone and vote
right or girl you'll you'll do some
little tiny amount amount of interaction
lean forward school there's there's a
lot of times where I'm happy to engage
with content that's fun sometimes but
but we've got to decide you know are you
letting someone just kick back and relax
which is really why most Americans watch
for hours of TV a day it's it's not to
be engaging in voting and tweeting and
challenging and picking it to be
escaping from the run-of-the-mill day
daily lives it's like I want to sit back
and watch these watch whatever whether
it's train wreck TV or sitcoms or dramas
whatever might be right but that isn't
that exactly the reason why we're here
because those statistics are drastically
changing and the spending power
generation is apparently not doing that
as much anymore as they used to it we
can go into this one I vse a stat that
shows that here the stats I know TV ad
dollars went up last year TV ad TV
watching went up last year overall video
consumption went up last year and
anytime that I hear the argument it
always comes back to well kids these
days and they watch the youtubes but
there wasn't one what I mean okay
statistics that say that ninety-two
percent of the 13 to 24 year olds have a
mobile device active running while
they're watching TV of course is 400
texts a day they're sending something
like 60 text an hour including while
they're in classrooms right I think we
have a whole other issue with that to
deal with right well I wanted to go back
to the to the point you may
um earlier I lost my train of thought he
was one of the things you said oh they
you are actually painting a somewhat
hopeful view vision for future content
consumers which is that they're engaged
mmhmm yeah that's exactly that was the
point you said that the instead of
figuring out the greatest experience I
think maybe there's also a flaw in the
in the production workflow that you know
people get together like we have to make
this out because these stats just came
out and we have to write there really
quick and we don't have time to really
think about what is a great experience
and with the speed that everything is
moving where we apparently doubling our
knowledge on the planet every 18 months
you know how do you figure out if fairly
complex behavior pattern that involves
the whole body your mind your eyes your
ears and potentially the person next to
you on the couch right so I think
there's there's definitely ways to so
speaking of the person next to you and
one of the big parts of second screen
experience we've got we've touched on it
a little bit is the idea of the social
TV viewing or social content consumption
now of course on computers there we have
moved into an era of social games Zynga
world warcraft people are accustomed to
gaming now with friends the second
screen can be a great enabler of social
content consumption where we used to sit
on the couch maybe with our family now
for sitting there in home alone we can
actually be engaged with other people is
is that a big part of the second screen
movement here it's a big part of the
movement I think it's a tiny part of
reality you know first of all just just
on my again getting bones to pick with
the term social it's that social gate I
mean gaming's been social since the
atari 2600 the web's been social since
the 90s and TVs been social since the
day it was invented with multiple people
watching multiple shows sitting on the
couch talking about the water cooled the
next day all we've done is change the
pace at which people can share those
experiences I think there will
absolutely be more socially engaged
stuff where you can chat with friends
etc the problem i have is i think if i
look at the one biggest trend in TV it's
more personalized on demand in location
viewing in other words you watch what
you want where you want whatever no
rules apply anymore so in that world
how do I have a social experience with a
buddy of mine across the coast watching
the same thing because he's going to
take a bathroom break right like it it's
a funny comment but it's true how do you
really create you know if you're one how
do you really get everybody who's having
a socially conjoined experience to
actually pause together no I have
problems with that I think that's over
they are dead i think i think that's I
think that's like you I think a killer
I've dream and I think that's exactly
where the you know being in control of
when you pause your thing and what are
you watching a jumping maybe to the next
episode etc is I think that's an
inherits I kind of spin ice to talk
about human nature right but I don't I
think that putting people in the
driver's seat has worked really really
well working with a car literally yeah
and now it now it works with their
digital video devices so but leaving
comments are showing off a cultural
reference seeing something that you that
Jeff Bridges is saying relating that to
another film now I think that's where
the social network is powerful we can
where you can show off making that
reference sending it to a friend and
they might be able to relive that moment
in the film I think that's a really good
point a lot of this social networking is
really about what some guy forgot his
name called the ego bua or the ego boost
it really is you say it's your sharing
but really you're showing off it's about
your ego showing off in competing you
know we are just animals aren't we I
want to talk about two things really
briefly here one is the concept of the
second screen app that automatically
synchronizes with what you're watching
on the on the big screen whether or not
it's live or recorded and that uses the
technology that a yahoo acquisition into
now made popular where it actually
listens to what's happening and syncs up
that's called a CR automatic content
recognition it's actually called audio
fingerprinting or audio watermarking
content recognitions the big picture
video recognition would fall into a crs
how how big a deal is then who's winning
who's losing and who are the big players
in ACR right now big players I mean so
in turn l didn't actually invent the
technology they licensed at which wich
is interesting there's a big player
called an audible magic Gracenote does
it I think Roby does it there's before
other startups doing it it yeah yes it's
a it's a pretty common thing it's fairly
commodity I mean I know started building
it from scratch in their estimate
from from start to finish is measured by
weeks now so I don't think it's actually
a hard problem I think it's interesting
but to me it's a band-aid technology
it's something that will get us kind of
a from where we are now to the future
because one I mean all we're not far
away from a highly connected living room
at current TV replacement cycles
basically everybody in America will have
a new TV within seven years the most
common TVs being sold today are
considered smart TVs which means they
have Wi-Fi connectivity built-in and so
if your TV and your set-top box are
smart they actually know what they're
airing and so you can just inquire over
Wi-Fi and find out the exact thing and
it ties back to the first screen second
screen flip that we've experienced with
a bluray control which is a fairly
esoteric nice right now because you know
blu-ray players that are connected with
an iPad that's connected but that demo
sells itself and and that's exactly
where you're going with us the setup box
implementations that companies like nds
are doing right now where you can
actually go over IT back and forth
between the TV head end I find it a lot
more interesting than audio
fingerprinting audio watermarking and I
agree it's a band-aid hmm now a couple
of interesting comments in the chat room
one says from cousin of jab talk about
what fantasy football has done to
advance this idea talk about social
content attached to one of the most of
you know engrossing content forms or is
sports I'm amazing not more I am stunned
by the lack of innovative fantasy second
screen apps I think a friend of mine
does see I think actually CBS Sports no
plug intentional I the Yahoo fantasy
just to give both big company and I'm
sure ESPN blah blah blah but I was told
by a buddy that that the CBS Sports
second screen apps for fantasy are great
and he said that some of the games he
was watching he saw on his iPad that one
of his players had scored pre before the
screen showed it because of small time
delays yeah but I think I think there's
a wealth of opportunities i'm truly
amazing there's not more startups doing
that especially compared to the social
TV stuff which is which is a
yet-to-be-determined where people want
to do fantasy sports has lots of money
lots of users and the natural draw for
innovation and it's and it's an
extension of the experience which is
exactly where the mobile device is great
once you're done with the game or once
there's a break in the game then you
engage with your ex
and you stay in the moment yeah I find a
powerful too I was cousin of John not
because of chap I blame the typography
on this stupid chat app I have here
courier damn you uh also venture but
Ventura bum says give me a top chef chef
second app I want to know about the
guest chef his restaurants etc I guess
recipes man what a perfect idea for for
them to bookmark a recipe when you see
something being made that two fat ladies
whatever like chicken wrapped in bacon
so I want that recipe boom say hate to
say because I don't really love that
channel but can you see has had a second
screen app that is so powerful in terms
of you by what you see right away you
know so and that's where the your
recipes and you know how they promote
the product not so directly but through
the experience that you're having with
it and it ties directly in today that
doesn't surprise me i mean III got the
chance to talk to some QVC and HSN
people when i was at sling of years ago
and they understand consumers and buying
so well and they're like the zynga of
buying oh I mean the stats they have is
unreal on how people by what triggers
all that kind of stuff so fan because we
started talking about buying and
somebody wanted a recipe but yeah meets
related because it's all that but the
recipe apps makes sense by the way and I
also still go back to you know you
almost don't even want to have to
bookmark you always want the second
screen up it shouldn't that you
shouldn't necessarily need while you're
watching it should just be here's all
the stuff about the episode you just
watch right and there's yeah here's
every episode of every show i watch Top
Chef here's every episode every chef
just made here's the restaurants there
at I actually went looking I was in I
was in Chicago few years ago and I went
looking for who which Top Chef chefs are
in Chicago so there's so much of these
bringing together kind of from your TV
to your mobile life opportunities that I
think it's gonna be a fun few years yeah
and I that's exactly right totally great
seeing all of these second screen apps
need a much stronger standalone
experience like you pick it up and you
engage with the content even when you're
not watching the show how easy would it
be to what every chef it's not every
show every show has a website yeah but
it's n at CN its behavior you take this
thing yeah and you just the recipe
appears you walk over to your kitchen
yeah and you can cook it it's not you
know it's that it's almost like it
needed to be mobile in the home before
this was really needs to be more
integrated like the stable they all have
a website
also have a Facebook page and sooner or
later they'll have some kind of mobile
experience see the good one but the good
ones will make an end to end the good
ones won't just be just while you're
watching TV they'll take the concept of
how this top chef fit into your life if
you're a super fan right how does how
this american idol right if you're in
the maritime not a idol fan but
obviously it's very popular i'm sure an
idol fan would love all of the
recordings of all the artists that have
gone on maybe links the original songs
right if someone covers some classic 80
song that you get the original video in
there too and that's being served up by
vivo and you can share it on your
Facebook page and you have an easy
listening device now to do your own
karaoke over it and share that which was
all possible because I feels like
karaoke the same way I feel about 3d TV
yeah not positive no uh speaking of
which oh so we don't we don't think this
is a again I believe the 3d is is a
gimmick the company many people caught
industry will think I'm wrong but does
this have the same danger of moving into
gimmick territory that idea of the
second screen ancillary app some of it
yes some of the stuff we're seeing so so
let me they announced earlier the
myspace and friendster era i would say
that today second screen is more in the
geo cities era as it pertains to where
we are with web and social i mean we're
nascent and so most of the startups that
you even think are common today are
probably going to fail so so we're so so
early and what's going on with TV and
second screen but i think it's unlikely
that some of this won't gain momentum if
you think about what we just
brainstormed as a fantasy football or a
Top Chef type of app those don't seem
far-fetched whether or not you're going
to do all these quirky check-ins get
points with a prize you know get some
reward for watching show all that kind
of stuff seems weird to me but the fact
that you watch a show you want some
immersive stuff and you're going to go
look things up later seems very connect
the dots got to be more see it's got to
get more seen seamless our devices no
know where we are they know what we like
you know that at some point they will
just know what we're watching and then
it's probably an API that you can build
experiences on top without really having
to start a nap or show and Abner startup
and I think that's the confusing
fragmentation right now that makes the
experiences weird what I like to
bookmark the world
I'm sure that's out there was gumming up
for that yeah I'm sure there is uh all
right we've done yeah we've time for a
more what what about the the television
manufacturers and we were talking about
them knowing what they're watching now
my TV and knows obviously or could know
when I'm watching a broadcast show but
there's a time when I'm streaming a home
movie or watching something over the
internet on my Roku my boxee maybe we'll
know that maybe not but what is the role
of the TV manufacturer in integrating
with other living room devices
especially the ones on the couch I mean
I've spent the past six months talking
to every TV manufacturer on the planet
so they don't all know you know some of
them our vesting hardcore in building a
platform so that their TVs are smart
some of them are taking a very connected
centric approach where they're kind of
opening up the TV to the network and
letting things happen a lot of them
really haven't quite figured this out
there all building their own second
screen apps but none of them I mean they
didn't have iOS developers two years ago
in fact they didn't have you I
developers five years ago so these are
brand new challenges for the TV industry
some of them are navigating very well in
my opinion and some of them are are
really experimenting which is great I
mean Sony Samsung vizio and LG have put
out some very very advanced stuff just
to see what happens and I think that's
great to see it's dreher to ready to say
the Japanese can or Korean or US
consumer electronics company that
effectively loses money on most of the
tvs they sell is experimenting in a
product category that you know people
spend a thousand to fifteen hundred
bucks on I think it's great just from
the I'm not really savvy in the
manufacturing field but just from the
experience really what what the second
screen does right now is what vh1 did
with Papa video and Papa via was on the
TV that there was no mobile device to do
that and I think that's where the TV
manufacturers have a huge opportunity
right now to bring some of that metadata
back onto the screen so you don't have
to look down to find out who's on screen
right that could become an overlay or if
you have a 20 but not 21 by nine TV you
know there's a huge space all of a
sudden wait additional content into if
you wanted to I'm interested I'm not
sure how that's going to work but I
would be interested in figuring out or
helping to figure out those experience
and all you work with
10 companies with yes media producers
and live with studios media producers
and what's the trend there what's their
take on the second screen I think it's
all part of them figuring out the future
of digital distribution and whether
collateral content and the brand
extensions need to go from people to
experience them properly I mean now that
the DVD is kind of you know going away
and directors common where's the
directors comment you know that's what I
what I was thinking through this whole
thing is like I want the director's
commentary on my iPad while I'm watching
the show with you know separate
headphones maybe different views yeah
initial renderings that's exactly this
yet we are that we are experimenting
with writing send me your next I want to
see that that's cool are we not supposed
to make fun of you for that statement
right make fun all you want I still want
it now I i mean i think but there's only
so many times your point is that there's
as many opportunities as it shows and
consumers going all the way back to this
is why 3d is a fad and and connected and
second screen isn't a fad there's so
much things that people are going to
want there is room for some app
developer to figure out a simple
platform for developed for delivering
you the size of commentary there's
someone else can make the voting thing
someone else can make the recipes thing
I you know the one one of the biggest
questions in my eyes right now and I
have a hard time seeing is will you have
to second screen apps or 200 right I
think that's a very very tricky thing to
figure out because when you go generic
you lose out on the Disney I mean all
the companies always working with Disney
doesn't want a generic experience they
want this animated etc experience try to
assignment try to sell me more lunch
boxes right that's what they're trying
to do and the other end of the spectrum
as we were talking on the hall you have
small come small TV effectively TV
startups like the new shows they don't
have big budgets they're not going to go
invest in these massively immersive
things where generic stuff kind of makes
some sense but I have a real hard time
figuring out what what a consumer is
going to be tolerating on their on their
iPads you know will they have 10 15 apps
that they don't mind hopping back and
forth between or will they have to it's
hard to figure out maybe when you power
up a fire up a show the app comes over
the network automatically and there you
have it and goes away when you're done
if you wanted to but they wouldn't i see
that does not need doesn't know that's
build it alright good see you guys later
that's that's the the future where it's
you know in the device good vibes we are
out of time
thank you ollie lou chins is the chief
creative guy over at MX which does
second screen apps where can people go
to see some of your product MXM XCOM has
a good selection of the work that we've
done most recently we've collaborated
with Disney's if you go to Disney second
screen calm you'll see what they've put
out with our help and yeah I will do
that when I watch those shows with my
kid and Jeremy thoman is the chief
product / officer / digit that's di jit
sorry and they do a really cool program
guide app you want to tell us a little
bit about that and tell us where to get
it sure you can get it in the iOS store
Android as well di jit just search for
it well you'll find it so the app is
designed to be both the TV Guide and
remote control the remote control part
requires you to either have a Roku or to
purchase a beacon from Griffin they're
about 50 60 bucks online and it
basically is like an ir emitter that
sits on your coffee table and can
control all the devices in your home and
then use our guide to figure out
everything from social stuff what are
your friends watching we hook up with
facebook as well as set up your own
favorite shows even have only your
favorite channels what's neat is you can
you know the average person only watches
12 channels so in our app you can just
filter out all the channels you ever
watch and just see your own personalized
guide and that's that's what we're doing
Jeremy olay thanks so much Thanks coming
in Steve thanks for producing we'll see
you guys next week another episode of
reporters roundtable see you then bye
