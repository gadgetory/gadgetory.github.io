for a sleek gaming laptop there are
options out there the Razer Blade 2014
is precisely that thing I usually think
gaming laptop and you thinks I'm big and
bulky the Razer Blade is sleek it looks
like a Retina Display MacBook Pro it is
thin it is all metal and is black it is
very cool-looking it turns heads and
this actually came out last year in a 14
inch model and before that there was a
razor blade in a 17 inch model that had
a touchscreen and touchpad off to the
side
the switchblade UI now that's still
around in the razor blade Pro but the
razor blade is this 14-inch version last
year we loved the fact that it was sleek
had great battery life had good
performance but that screen was not so
great now it's back again and this
screen is a 3200 by 1800 really crisp
great viewing angle display and guess
what else
it has touch yep it's got touch which is
very rare in a gaming laptop can be
really great if you're using Windows 8
it's a really nice plus not really that
important for gaming but that new
resolution display really really good
and that's not all this add this also
has the new Nvidia graphics it is NVIDIA
GeForce GTX 870 graphics inside it also
has a quad core i7 processor eight gigs
of RAM is what it comes with and the
only configuration option you can pick
from is how much memory is in here in
terms of storage space you can pick a
128 256 or 512 gig SSD the 128 it's
pretty small for a gamer and it's also
not a cheap laptop you're talking $21.99
going up to 26 99 so pretty pricey what
you're getting though is a little gaming
powerhouse this plays games really
nicely sounds great looks great
really good keyboard really good form
it's got three USB 3.0 ports what's the
drawback well the price and battery life
battery life was not spectacular but no
gaming laptops got great battery life
you wouldn't expect that in selling this
then it's about four and a half hours
for regular use but if your gaming
might only be about an hour and it gets
pretty hot pretty fast you can of
everything in this world if you want
something that's thin and powerful for
gaming there's really no other option
out there the Razer Blade 2014 is
beautiful and it performs well I think
it's a really good improvement
I'm Scott Stein and that's a look at the
Razer Blade 2014 edition now available</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
