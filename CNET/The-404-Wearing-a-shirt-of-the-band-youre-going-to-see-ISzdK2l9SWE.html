break if the guy wants to wear a t-shirt
and show his fans okay loves them not
illegal that's not illegal it's not
illegal it's just like a faux pas like
an unwritten social idea it's like uh
being Asian and ordering the Chinese
chicken salad no I can't do that because
it's bad right yeah they're so different
I think that's your face I always feel
weird even though I love Chinese chicken
salad those mandarin oranges is so good
but you just can't do it it's a social
faux pas in the Asian communities like
saying trust me so you're saying doing
so is it like taboo for a Japanese
person to have hibachi yeah person going
to benihana they can't do it we digress
where you can do this but historically
wearing the bent wearing a t-shirt of
the band you're going to see I douchey
kind of douchey way I didn't talk about

Skrillex a suggestion no he was outside
a hotel uh-huh I was a little drunk okay
and he was outside and someone said to
me I that Skrillex and I said oh that
little kid yeah he's like five foot two
had his big like hair over with his
black fingernails right and ice and I
yelled at him and I said he sounded like
a broken frosty it was like a drive-by
insult and he was probably like whatever
