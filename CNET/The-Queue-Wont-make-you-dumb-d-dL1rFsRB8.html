before YouTube and summer camp for geeks
the queue starts right now hey there I'm
rich demuro with Cena TV in New York
City congratulations applebees and I hop
on tying the knot now craving stuffed
french toast steak isn't so weird after
all now your must click moment we look
at ourselves is really leading the next
wave of the internet before YouTube
there was broadcast com it's the
brainchild of Todd Wagner and Mark Cuban
eight years ago the site with a very
successful IPO and this video takes you
on a trip down memory lane all of a
sudden we're going to start setting new
habits you're going to immediately go to
a website like broadcast calm knowing
you're going to be able to get an
unedited version of the video and then
if you miss it you can also go back and
watch the archives broadcast calm was
the go-to place for streaming audio of
sports games and blossomed into much
more you know one time I was leaving a
voicemail and stumbled while reciting my
own phone number that's probably why I
didn't get that g for job thankfully I
could press pound and record another
voicemail but now I know what happened
my cell phone is making me dumb that's
according to neuropsychology expert Ian
Robertson he says an over reliance on
technology is making us remember less
less we use our own memory the worse it
gets apparently before cellphones people
committed more digits to memory and now
we just look everything up the company
who pioneered fast forwarding through
commercials is pressing the rewind
button with monthly ratings of the most
watched ads sure they've done it before
for the Super Bowl but now the ratings
have a fancy new name TiVo stopwatch
service the interesting tidbit here the
list of least fast forwarded brand
campaigns among top cable networks it's
those infomercials even I'm guilty of
watching them way too long when
broadcast networks are singled out fedex
kinko's ads or tops for catching our
attention as are those rgx body spray
ads mainly because of this girl remember
when summer camp meant sharing a cabin
in the middle of the woods swimming and
playing dodgeball all day then cooling
off with a tall glass of bug juice well
that was before the ipod ruined every
at Tech camp your kids get to do even
more of what they're doing at home
learning about technology camp courses
include adventures in game design gaming
athletes no physical activity required
digital video editing robo contenders
and programming to be fair there are two
courses where you spend half your day
surfing the web and the other half
actually surfing at the beach on to the
beta if you stumble upon a website you
like and you want to find more like it
ulysse it will help you do just that
enter in a URL to get started and you
list it spits out a list of similar
sites the site combs through links
keyword searches tags ratings and
browsing patterns to come up with their
results and if you like the Q you'll
really like the q remember we're on two
days a week just come back to cnet TV
for fresh episodes or you can subscribe
through iTunes I'm richest a mural with
seen a TV in New York City don't say I
didn't tell you so</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
