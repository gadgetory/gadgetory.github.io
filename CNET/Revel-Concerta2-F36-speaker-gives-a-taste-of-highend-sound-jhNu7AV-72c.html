a well-respected brand in audiophile
circles its new concerta two series is
perhaps its best value set of speakers
yet a $2,000 the f 36 is a large set of
floor standards which with their white
or black gloss finish look even more
expensive than they are the design is
simply beautiful with a curved cabinet
which is also designed to minimize
internal reflections this is a 2.5 Way
speaker with a set of 6.5 inch aluminum
drivers and a one-inch tweeter like the
more expensive performer series these
speakers are designed to be dead flat in
their frequency response what does this
mean
most figures are rolled off in the mids
and at the top so the rebels can sound
brighter than others bass is also for
that we did find it a little pronounced
in the mid bass in our testing room
you'll want some good amplification to
run them we used a Rotel stereo amp and
with the right music they can give a
full detailed performance if you like
classical fusion or singer-songwriters
these are the speakers for you like most
models of this type they are a little
unforgiving of poorly recorded material
so Punk or rock might sound a little bit
harsh however if you want to extract the
most detail from your music while still
enjoying full bass rebel F 36s will
slaughter most speakers under $1500
