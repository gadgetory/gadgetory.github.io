it's your basic tricked-out smartphone
but it does have kind of a couple
novelty features that we are looking
forward to getting the opinions on from
our real-world testers we have Massimo
crystal and Kyle now each of you are
gonna get this phone for a couple days I
really want you to dig into it put your
email on there it's okay we'll check it
out now as you guys use this phone I
want you to focus mainly on design
features and usability just try to
evaluate those three categories as well
as you can I'm Kyle itani executive
chef/owner of hopscotch in Oakland and
I'm really excited to see how the galaxy
s3 compares to ask for hi I'm crystal
Silva the art director here at big fish
and I like to raise caterpillars in my
free time I'm Massimo free or esky VP of
Sales and Marketing at back roads and
this s4 test is going to give me street
cred with my teens oh my gosh it's super
super super light this phone in my
pocket for a pair of fans that are like
this is fine totally perfect you don't
even know it's there it's so light it's
really easy to get to the battery and
get another battery in there if you
wanted to carry replacement it also has
a microSD slot right here so if you need
an extra memory easy to put that in as
well hey it just beats level the screen
itself given the size and the resolution
is beautiful I played some of our hidden
object games on them and graphics are
meant for tablet size screen and so
everything looks amazing on here the
screen makes it awesome but the actual
hardware itself proved to be a problem
the position of the power button here if
I'm holding it like this my thumb would
cover and hit this back button which
have kept pausing the game I was getting
really frustrated I like the size of the
screen face in the color the resolution
is really impressive
plastic material I've heard some people
wonder about that I mean we had it for a
few days I don't know how durable it
would be over the long haul because
sometimes things get pegged around in
the kitchen a little bit how many times
what we do I was surprised by the eye
tracking feature I like it so looking at
the screen and then look away first
whatever reason and it pause which was
awesome i look back and it starts right
up so it's useful for i'm actually
talking to somebody but if I if I
intentionally want to pause it by just
that that shift doesn't cause it to
happen that shift does so there there is
a spectrum that I have to make sure i
turn my head enough to initiate that I
like this is actually really awesome yo
BMO Cancellara una notte al vostro
albergo there it is then you just pop
that into a text and away we go the
phone has this really awesome translate
feature totally picked up my Italian
translated it into English but if you
just wanted to use this feature just so
that it picks up different languages and
you can use them for texting you can
just go and grab this piece of text and
drop it into a text
camera has a higher megapixel in the s3
it also has a burst mode function where
I can take multiple pictures at once and
then just choose the best one for later
so that I can just toggle between each
photo and see you know what is focused
the best I'm gonna go with that one and
I just save it ah power button it is
pretty smooth to be doing video capture
and be able to have the controls not
stutter very much you'd expect a lot of
jitter when it zoomed in on video and
there wasn't a whole lot of jitter
that's pretty good I really love the
mapping feature I mean it's a google map
so that's fantastic very accurate you
can get bike routes on it which is great
the only thing I didn't like was the
advertising on it it seems to take up a
lot of the screen so that was kind of
annoying but I think that'd work totally
fine hey good morning guys and now they
make sure you check the google document
from last night the google docs are
great you know they downloaded the dr
appt very fast and then i just have all
my documents right there on me at all
times throughout the day and i can just
go from one duck into the next and make
sure that you know every cook knows what
we're doing for the day and it keeps
things really organized up here when
you're wearing it for working out but
the gym let's say it's really really
huge so you'd have to wear it down here
and at least with the software that i'm
using you want to look at it so you'd be
doing kind of thats so it doesn't really
work for me oh you're playing the
too we have a lot of devices here that
we designed for android and iOS and so
we constantly as developers have to be
testing our own games the operating
system took me a little getting used to
coming from iOS considering i like a lot
of Google products it felt like that and
so all that was really straightforward
I'm to find out what our testers thought
of their time with the s4 all right
let's start with you much ammo what was
your overall impression of this month I
love the size and I loved how light it
the phone that I have right now it's a
little difficult to navigate but I give
it one thumb up and one over here okay
crystal how about you the feel of it was
really great i was surprised it was good
to be plastic and the resolution of the
screen made games look beautiful but
it's just too big for someone sighs
pockets i typically have okay
interesting alright and then Kyle you
were our potential upgrader how did it
sit with you I liked it a lot compared
to the s3 shape the screen resolution
it's all an upgrade I don't know if I'd
really like just go out and get it now
maybe wait till I three new and then you
know get the discount hunted or
something but yeah it was it was good
all right so give me your total
breakdown buy or not buy uh not by not
buy right now until the upgrade tell the
discount okay crystal what about you now
for Brazil for me for my husband okay
it's a good gift all right I'm about to
about how about you yeah not not for me
either in terms of size i would go maybe
if my eyes get any worse i would buy it
but for now i'm sticking with what I've
got so that to me just shows how tough
the smartphone market is right now that
the s4 is definitely a premium phone but
if you don't have a reason to upgrade or
a reason to switch from iphone for a
reason to go bigger it's just gonna sit
there
we'll keep watching good luck ask for</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
