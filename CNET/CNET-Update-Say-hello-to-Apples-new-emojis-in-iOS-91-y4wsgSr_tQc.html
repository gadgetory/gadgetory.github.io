Bridget Carey this is your CNN update
the next operating system for iPhones
and iPads iOS 9 it comes out on
Wednesday September 16th Apple is adding
updates to Siri the Maps app and new
search tools newer iPads are gonna get
multitasking abilities but some may
argue that the most exciting changes
won't be arriving until the next update
version 9.1 because that my friends is
when Apple will release new emoji in a
developer beta of 9.1 we can see that
Apple has created art for more than 50
new icons the site emoji pedia org
highlights the new cast of characters
including new sports icons facial
expressions food like the much
longed-for taco and burrito and there's
also animals a new hand gestures like
the rock on sign of the horns and yes
Apple also created a middle finger emoji
the crude expression is a bit
controversial but Microsoft and Google
also created art so you can send people
the bird a group called the Unicode
consortium sets the standards of which
symbols are in the universal Unicode
keyboard language but it's up to Apple
and other companies to design how they
want those icons to look or even if they
want to give people the option to use it
the middle finger was released in u2
code standards since summer of last year
but it's only now that Apple designed an
image and added it to the keyboard in
the meantime you'll have to find more
creative ways to show your negative
feelings in emoji because these icons
are not expected to be added to the
official iPhone and iPad keyboard
software updates until sometime in
November of course these days emoji are
not limited to our keyboards there are
emoji apps that make it easy to copy and
paste photos of other images into your
text messages for example the Star Wars
app has Star Wars characters that you
can copy and paste and now for the first
time the Pope even has his own emoji
commissioned by the Catholic Network
Alitalia and created by the app maker
swift media the Pope emoji app has 52
icons and 14 gifts with Pope Francis in
American settings to support his visit
to the US and reach Millennials in new
ways we're living in some strange times
oMG and if anyone is periscoping the
Pope's visit to the US this month they
can do so in landscape mode
Twitter's live video streaming app has
forced you always to take vertical video
but now it finally added an update so
you can also broadcast videos to the
world horizontally and now if you start
a private broadcast you'll see a list of
mutual followers and friends to make it
faster to share a video that's it for
this tech news update you can keep up

studios in New York I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
