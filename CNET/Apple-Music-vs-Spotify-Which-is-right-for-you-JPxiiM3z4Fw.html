streaming block available on iOS Mac PC
or Android later on this year
it's fashionably late compared to
Spotify so which one is right for you
regardless of which one you choose this
is what you get if you pay for the
services on demand streaming custom
playlists from albums or songs of your
choosing saving music for listening
offline and recommendations for Apple
music you choose favorite artists and
genres when you first start up the app
the Spotify it learns what you like from
your listening habits but if you want to
separate them here's what's different
first up what does the free service get
you
Apple music lets you listen to radio
stations including the beats one service
but with ads or you can listen to your
own music from your existing iTunes
library Spotify gives you full access to
on-demand streaming with ads every
couple of songs on desktop or shuffle
play streaming on mobile apps now on to
special features Apple music has Siri
voice command so you can do cool things
like this play the theme song from
frozen Spotify mobile app has running a
feature that finds the pace you run out
and selects music to fit start running
to detect tempo
new tempo 190 steps per minute as for
the interface Apple music definitely has
a few usability quirks searching for
music could be more intuitive and
navigating back to select an option you
were previously on can be confusing
Spotify certainly isn't perfect but at
least you can swipe from the left side
of the screen to bring up your main
sidebar the catalog is also slightly
different between the services both have
around 30 million songs but Apple music
gets Taylor Swift and dr. Dre's album
the chronic neither have the full
Beatles catalog yet but if you still
can't decide you can sign up for the
free trials of either service and take
them for a spin I would love to know
what you think if Apple music floats
your boat or if Spotify is more your jam
