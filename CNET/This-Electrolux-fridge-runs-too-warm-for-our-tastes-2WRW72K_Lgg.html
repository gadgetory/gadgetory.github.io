here beside thee here we go electrolux
ew27wd55gs a bit even worse it's the
perfect size for a carton of eggs so if
I take this carton and stick it right in
pretty tempting spot right there fits
like a glove
you shouldn't fit your eggs they're just
way too hot so I don't like that design
at all
and here's another qualms those luxury
clothes drawers I mentioned they have a
little resistance built in so it takes a
little extra tug to get them open I
don't like that I end up yanking too
hard on it pulling it out too quick and
then when you close them they're
supposed to close naturally on their own
kind of finish that last half inch by
themselves and a lot of times it failed
like on this side if you look at can't
even close it anymore because the
mechanism pulls out at the front easy
enough to fix I just have to pull it out
and reach in and rehook this thing on
both sides and then it works again but
still that's a pain and that happened a
lot when I was testing it out now that
said there are some things that this
fridge gets right
you see these drawers down at the bottom
of the doors a lot of fridges have them
and they're kind of hard to get into
because of the overhang of the bigger
shelves above them on the Electrolux
models these tilts out so it's really a
lot easier to get in and get
kid-friendly stuff at a low height like
applesauce they're jell-o pudding that's
a nice feature the marquee feature of
this fridge though is the wave touch
control panel on the front other
electrolux's have the controls on the
inside of the door or they have what's
called IQ
and that's the same thing except all the
options are always on the wave touch
models they're off until you touch them
so I touch the top here and I get more
options I can hit options to wake them
all up and they'll fade away when I'm
not using them it's a very small
difference basically they just added a
few lines of code so things fade off and
you're not using them and charged 100
bucks more for it all there are a couple
of features in this fridge that I like a
lot and I would like to see in more
fridges but the performance is just not
good enough for the price I don't want
to have a fridge that's running above 40
degrees and the majority of the fridge
compartment when I have it set at 37
especially if I'm paying thirty three
fifty for more check out my full review
at si.com for CNET appliances I'm right
