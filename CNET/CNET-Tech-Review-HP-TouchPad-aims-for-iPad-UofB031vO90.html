whether puts a damper on the Verizon
iPhone launch in New York City
HP gets behind webOS in a big way and in
a little one double your pleasure with
Sprint's Kyocera echo and dude don't get
this Dell it's all coming up right now
hi everyone i'm brian tong and welcome
to the scene that tech review where we
collect our hottest videos of the week
and tell you what's good and what's bad
in the world of tech and offer some
unique tech wisdom in the form of the
bottom line let's start with the good
February 10 2011 a date that will go
down in the history books I'm speaking
of course of the day the Verizon iPhone
went on sale to the public for the first
time
Maggie Reardon was at the Apple store in
Manhattan but she didn't have a lot of
company I'm Maggie burden with cnet.com
and I'm here at the Apple store on Fifth
Avenue where Verizon and Apple are about
to kick off the Verizon iPhone the
crowds here are not quite what they are
for a normal iPhone launch its 6:50 here
in Manhattan and there are seven people
in line the phone actually goes on sale
at 7 o'clock this morning and the
temperatures are in the teens snow was
on the grounds and people are staying
home so tell me what brought you out on
this bitter cold day in Manhattan to to
buy the iPhone I got to go to work and
aside from that I'll be traveling later
today so I just wanted to get it out of
the way you know this morning so I
thought there was gonna be a really
really big line I was surprised I got
here around 6:30 and I was fourth in
line so I was previously on t-mobile and
I guess now I'm on Verizon customers so
it's actually my first time waiting
online for anything and
probably won't do it again it's a little
silly but it's about 7:30 here now about
a half hour after the doors have opened
it took only seconds for the line to
dwindle down to nothing
clearly Apple was expecting a bigger
turnout the story inside is just a sea
of blue shirts with Apple employees
willing to help people but there aren't
a lot of customers to help I guess we
finally have our answer to the question
what will keep people from an iPhone
launch 20 degree weather in Manhattan
I'm Maggie written with CNET news so now
that the wait is over have you decided
if you want to buy one or not last week
Brian coolly told us his top five
reasons why you shouldn't buy a Verizon
iPhone and frankly he'd made some good
arguments before she left on vacation
Hollywood took some time to outline the
top five reasons why you should get one
let's hear her side of the story
hi I'm Hollywood in for Brian Cooley
with a scene at top 5 the top 5 reasons
to buy ever eyes an iPhone see recently
Brian Cooley brought you top 5 reasons
not to buy the Verizon iPhone limited
global roaming no simultaneous voice and
data no 4G whatever hater
if the presale numbers are any
indication at all the Verizon iPhone is
going to be a monster hit but if you're
still on the fence here are five reasons
you might want to take the leap coming
in at number five no death-grip
because of a slight redesign with the
iPhone 4 those issues about holding the
phone wrong and losing reception are now
solved and you won't need an ugly rubber
bumper to use with this model bonus at
number four the Verizon iPhone can act
as a mobile hotspot providing wireless
Internet access to up to five devices
yes it costs an additional 20 bucks a
month but that's a lot less than a
Verizon MiFi costs AT&amp;amp;T is rumoured to
be working on offering the mobile
hotspot capability but right now they
cannot match that feature and it is
super handy especially if it's paired
with number three
Verizon's unlimited data plan for 30
bucks a month now granted verizon says
the plan will only be available for a
limited time but if you're a serious
pandora streamer a podcast downloader or
a Netflix watcher on your phone and you
want to do the mobile tethering the
unlimited data is a huge plus for as
long as it lasts moving on to number two
duh better voice calling in his top five
reasons not to buy coolly noted that
with CDMA technology you can't do voice
and data at the same time that's true
but on the flipside when the phone only
does voice you're a lot less likely to
get dropped calls because the voice
isn't being crowded out by the data
that's right I'm saying they can hear
you now and finally the number one
reason to buy a Verizon iPhone for God's
sake people you've been waiting for
years already
it's like Santa came and it's Christmas
morning finally finally you can open the
present and have your very own iPhone on
Verizon who cares if there's gonna be
another version in six months
go ahead scratch that itch
alright that's it for this week everyone
for more top 5 videos head on over it's
a top 5 dusty Netcom I'm Hollywood and
thank you for watching there you have it
guys the pros and cons in the Verizon
iPhone debate and let's be honest I'm
Ali's not getting an iPhone anytime ever
now where do I fall in this fight you'll
just have to tune in the Apple byte to
find out and you can check it out at
Cena tv.com it wasn't all iPhone news
this week in fact HP put all its weight
behind the webOS platform at an event in
San Francisco on Wednesday among HP's
many announcements was the unveiling of
two new Web OS smartphones
here's HP's senior VP and GM Jon
Rubenstein with the details
then stick around for Eric Franklin as
he wraps his mammoth hands around the
tiny HP beer this is the HP veer the
veer has all the features even the most
sophisticated smartphone offers coupled
with the unique functionality of webOS
so it's everything a smartphone should
be in one powerfully small design in
fact it's just about the size of a
credit card me I never leave home
without it it's slide-out QWERTY
keyboard is one of the best most usable
keyboards we've ever made it has a vivid
2.6 inch capacitive touchscreen and a
gesture area for navigation with the
veer you get a high performance web
browser it gives you access to the full
web including support for Adobe Flash
and it comes with a built-in GPS that
integrates with location-aware apps to
help you find your way or find cool
things to do the veer has full
multimedia capability including a 5
megapixel camera and it comes with the
USB port and audio jack using a really
really cool magnetic connector
vier supports HSPA+ 800 2011 B&amp;amp;G and
bluetooth 2.1 with EDR it's got 8
gigabytes of storage and the same memory
as the pre 2 so it's got more than
enough horsepower to play even the most
intense 3d games
the veer is one of the first smartphones
to use Qualcomm second-generation
Snapdragon 7230 processor and it comes
with all the sensors you'd expect from
this class of phone its performance
stands up to any device of the market
and with HP's mobile hotspot the the
veer can act as a mobile Wi-Fi router
for up to five Wi-Fi enabled devices
never before has a smart phone done so
much and felt so little all of us and
especially our CEO can't wait to get
HP's first web of webOS device into
users hands as soon as possible the new
veer will be available in early spring
the veer is just one way we at HP are
thinking beyond as I said before
customers want a device that works well
for them and a lot of people out there
spend their time on the go while they're
on the clock they want a smart phone
that makes it easy to do email view
documents and have video calls with
colleagues but they also want to browse
the web watch YouTube videos and play
Assassin's Creed all in the same device
and they wonder why is that so much to
ask
well it's not too much to ask of HP
today we're introducing a smart phone
for professionals who want a powerful
productivity without giving up their
personal passions
meet the pre three yeah come on
finally a phone you can use for business
that you don't want to leave at work the
pre three is a full-size fully equipped
office on the go it's a thin portrait
slider with the largest QWERTY keyboard
we've put on any web OS phone to date so
it easily handles business class email
it has a gesture area for navigation in
a gorgeous three point six inch WVGA
display it's okay okay that's two and a
half times the resolution of the pre so
it really accentuates the webOS
experience for both professional and
personal use pre three has full
multimedia capability including a five
megapixel camera that shoots HD video
with video stabilization and a forward
facing camera for video calling pre
three comes in two versions HSPA+ and
EVDO Rev a world phone supports a 2 mm B
G and N and as well as Bluetooth 2.1
with EDR it comes with 8 gigabytes or 16
gigabytes of storage and again the same
memory we have in the pre 2 so running
even the most demanding applications is
a breeze the pre 3 includes the standard
suite of sensors you'd expect in a phone
with this level of performance including
a compass its Qualcomm processor runs at
a stunning 1.4 gigahertz
it's got great performance all this and
more makes the pre 3 a professional
workhorse designed for today's
increasingly increasingly blended mix of
work and personal life hey guys is there
at Franklin C net we're here at the HP
web OS event what I have right here the
Revere let me give you an idea of how
small it is this is my iPhone 4 right
here right next to it and it's as you
can see about two-thirds the size with
touch pads even smaller than the pre
trying to use it myself my hands are
really big so the buttons are actually
too small for me I'm gonna have to
resort to using my fingernails to
actually use it to actually get some
kind of precision with the buttons one
of the new features of webOS 2.0 is just
type so basically if you have a card up
and you just start typing you'll get a
couple of options and like I just type
rats just as a random and you can even
use that text to go to Google Maps go to
Wikipedia to do more research on it or
you can like go to Facebook and just
post whatever you just type it just
feels really small as a camera on the
back really lights I feel like people
who don't really like larger phones are
probably gonna be really be into it we
don't know anything about pricing yet or
anything about confirmed days so far but
stay tuned to see nuts and we'll be
bringing you more news I'll be beer
during CNET's live blog of the event
Donna Bell said that the veer actually
looks like a choking hazard that thing
is small now stick around for more from
HP's event later on in the show so now
we've covered iOS and web OS what about
Android while Sprint also managed to
squeeze in an event of their own this
week they showed off a new Android phone
called the Kyocera echo and answer the
age-old question what do you do when you
can't make a phone's touchscreen any
bigger add another one
New York whereas Prince's unveiled the
Kyocera echo this is the first dual
touchscreen device and it'll be
available later this three as you can
see it has two screens and 3.5 inches
diagonally in both WB da resolutions
they've optimized the software here so
you can use applications in standard
mode which is just a single screen there
is also a tablet mode the feature that
I'm most excited about is the simulcast
mode which allows you to use two
different of applications on the screen
at launch it only be available on seven
applications mostly the main core
features like messaging photo gallery
browser but it's a pretty cool feature
that I think will take multi-touch into
a new level
the only no.14 air another feature I'm
disappointed about is it's printing a 1
gigahertz Snapdragon processor which may
be enough to power this device but
everyone's looking to the dual core
processor so that's a little bit
disappointing one thing we will be
checking once we get this a device in
for review is battery life they're
saying that you'll get about 5 hours of
talktime on here and it's performing on
par with other smart phones they are
shipping the device with an extra
battery though so if you do run out I do
still have an extra cell with you the
karasek up go will run Android 2.2 with
no custom UI also has a 5 megapixel
camera and will chip with an 8 gigabyte
microSD card pre-installed this will be
available starting next week for one
$99.99 the 2 year contracts for cnet.com
I'm Bonnie saw here in New York with the
Kyocera echo is it just me or does the
echo look a lot like a Nintendo DS maybe
we should keep an eye out for a Nintendo
phone sometime soon now while we're
waiting don't hold your breath let's
take a quick break but we'll be right
back with more tech review right after
this
welcome back to the sina tech review our
weekly video digests of all things good
and bad we've seen here at Sina TV i'm
brian tom filling in for Mollywood who's
on vacation this week now continuing on
in the good this year at CES our cell
phone editors pick Motorola's Atrix 4G
as our top phone from the show you can
head over to seen at tv.com for a full
review of the phone itself but before
you do that check out this video from
Scott Stein he took a look at the Atrix
4G innovative docking station to find
out how it stacks up against a regular
laptop hi I'm Scott Stein senior
associate editor of cnet.com and this is
not a laptop this is actually a laptop
dock that is connected to the Motorola
Atrix 4G smartphone from AT&amp;amp;T now we
just reviewed this phone on cnet.com and
this dock is a pretty well-known and
well hi peripheral we talked about it at
CES and it's a it's gotten a lot of
attention because it's one of the first
laptop docks that's available for a
smartphone what is it exactly well as
you can see it attempts to sort of
expand that Android experience so for a
larger screen and we thought hey you've
got the smartphone reviewers take why
not hear from a laptop editor how it
works as a laptop and that's exactly
what I'm gonna do on first glance
looking at it it's thin it's really
nicely designed it sort of feels like a
bit like a MacBook almost like the
Google Chromebook that we looked at at
the end of last year huge trackpad and a
slightly compressed keyboard there's
nothing inside it though what this is
essentially is kind of a dumb dock that
connects to the phone which plugs in
here on a little swivel dock through a
little USB connector and a power
connector here and it blows it up on the
big screen now in addition to showing
what is seen on the on the Atrus itself
it also gives you a full firefox 3.6
browser that is baked into this dock the
browser is great the OS environment
really kind of feels like a sort of a
splash top browser those Quick Start
os's that sometimes you see on netbooks
that give you a couple of functions but
not a full OS environment on the other
hand the browsing experience is a little
bit slower than you would get even on
say a netbook based on our initial
anecdotal experience it does feel nice
and
you know Google Docs was a little bit
slow you can play flash thanks to the
Tegra 2 processor that's built in here
so we got flash oh there was a little
bit sluggish fairly you know it was
about the level experiencial is what you
get in a sort of an atom netbook one of
the other small neat tricks on this doc
is that it has an HD video playback
center where you can play back your
videos and your photos and your music on
the large screen and thanks to the Tegra
2 processor
video playback actually looks really
great we played back some of the videos
we shot on the Atrix and they looked
really great on that 11-5 screen so the
idea here is that this dock which also
has an 8 hour battery built into it and
can recharge the Atrix waltz plugged in
will function is a little mobile
workstation for you you can sit it on
your lap or put it on a desk you can
view your phone and it's full
functionality from within the dock
itself so you can actually make phone
calls via Bluetooth or otherwise while
having it in laptop mode that's pretty
cool and you can play back of course any
of your apps you can blow them up into a
larger screen so blows up the app to a
larger size here but take note this is
not a touchscreen so you can't do any
multi-touch techniques like you would on
an iPad as far as ports and peripherals
go there are two USB ports in the back
here along this lip and you can use
Wi-Fi or you can use the 4G data
connection but that's it if you unplug
the phone from the dock the dock doesn't
work on its own so again this is really
a docking tool think of it as kind of a
smart keyboard more than anything that
really is like a laptop there's no
internal storage in here I mean really
it's just a chassis you know what's
surprising this is an Android phone this
is a Chromebook like laptop what does
the browser do you expect to be on here
probably Google Chrome but no it's
Firefox the cost is $500 for this dock
unless you get it as a package with the
phone and a tethering plan in which case
the phone and the dock or $500 together
now what does that get you in the laptop
world it gets you alive
I mean $2.99 gets you a 10 inch atom
netbook which is the cost of this dock
in the bundle package $500 were buying
it alone would get you a wide variety of
laptops 11 6 laptops including the ones
with the new AMD fusion processors you
could also get an eye
which while won't have a keyboard will
give you a lot of that great big screen
functionality overall there's a lot of
interesting ideas baked into the concept
of a laptop phone dock and we'll
probably be seeing a lot more of these
types of ideas soon it's not there yet
particularly if you're spending your own
hard-earned money on such a device
you really just might be better off
having a phone and having a netbook or
having an iPad with you but for now it
could be an interesting view as to
what's to come I'm Scott Stein and this
is the Motorola Atrix 4G and it's laptop
dock that's by far one of the coolest
docks I've ever seen but 500 bucks
that's way too much but don't worry
Motorola will let you keep your award
okay it's about time let's see what
we've got this weekend the bad as more
and more of our files and documents and
data moves into the cloud many of us
rarely need a printer very often anymore
but if you're still in the market for
one and happen to come across this
all-in-one printer from Dell
I think Justin you would say keep on
walking hi I'm Justin new associate
editor for cnet.com with the first look
at the del V five one five W
multifunction printer so unfortunately
this all-in-one leaves a lot to be
desired straight out of the box it's
marred by physical flaws and a bulky
design not to mention a cheap to line
color LCD display that looks like it
belongs more on a graphing calculator so
let's take a quick tour of the machine
you'll notice it has this bucket design
with a 35-page auto document feeder on
top that's actually useful for scanning
copying and faxing multiple pages or
photos you also get a standard flatbed
scanner underneath and Dell also
includes optical character recognition
software that does its best to read a
scanned document and import the text
into a word processor of your choice the
printer has no problem stacking
individual sheets of paper in the output
tray down here but we did experience
several paper jams during testing once
we approach the 25 sheet output limit in
contrast most other printers we test can
hold at least double the amount for the
same price so the Dell also comes with a
tow 2.11 BG wireless connectivity
that's supposed to help you cut the cord
and free up USB ports but we experienced
a lot of installation errors and too
many pop-up messages that gave us a
headache and we just defaulted to a
hardwired connection after a while we
should also note that the V five-on-five
is a big ink gutter it uses two separate
ink cartridges for tricolor and black
and you can also purchase high-capacity
cartridges from the website but these
standard cartridges that came with the
unit didn't last long enough for us to
actually finish our tests so be prepared
to spend lots of money on ink refills if
you choose to buy this machine so with
lots of frustrations and expensive ink
cartridges the v5 one 5w doesn't have
many redeeming factors so instead of
purchasing this guy we recommend
spending your money on a more capable
machine like the less expensive epson
workforce 310 or the slightly pricier
canon pixma
mx870 you can read more details in the
whole review on cnn.com but that's gonna
do it for me I'm Justin you this is the
del V 5 1 5w all in one printer and that
sounds pretty good to me so instead of
getting that Dell printer you can just
do what I do and use the printer at work
don't you ok let's go ahead and check
out this week's bottom line earlier we
saw two new smartphones from HP but the
real news that came out of the event was
the debut of the touchpad HP's 9.7 inch
tablet which also runs on Web OS Donal
bill was on hand for the announcement
and to help guide us through a hands-on
demo
hey i'm donald bell for cnet.com we're
here at HP's think beyond event in San
Francisco where they unveiled their new
touchpad tablet a competitor to the iPad
that runs the webOS operating system
they acquired from Palm let's go take a
look at today HP is entering the mobile
landscape with a breakthrough new
product that shows the power of webOS as
a multi device platform this is the HP
TouchPad the touchpad nolle looks great
feels great in the heads weighs a little
more than a pound and a half and it's
just over 13 millimeters thick
the screen is beautiful bright and
viewable from any angle
it supports video calling that way and
has Beats Audio technology for
unparalleled music playback through
either built-in stereo speakers or
through Beats headphones
it's a powerful work tool - and as
everything you need to be instantly
productive you can access and edit your
Microsoft documents since touchpad comes
bundled with Quick Office and you can
collaborate with colleagues using Google
Docs Dropbox and box net the touchpad
supports VPN to connect to corporate
networks and working with Skype and
others to enable video calling if you
need to print something and who doesn't
touch pad is compatible with HP's Linde
industry-leading printing solutions
letting you send documents while it's
needed tens of millions of HP's
networked and wireless printers no
matter how you're spending your time
online touch pad brings it all together
it helps you keep your busy life on
track now when you turn it on the first
thing you'll notice is argue
and this is not just a really great way
to get in and I have applications it's
really a workspace and you know it's
instant-on so being able to turn it on
and instantly see what it is you're
working on and get right back to it is a
really powerful feature now when I'm
done with an application I just flick it
off the top of the screen like that
around the bottom the screen here you'll
see we have quick access to a few of the
more popular applications that you're
going to use and at the top we have
notifications we have the ability to
actually swipe through and do triage
right here
it's imagine you're in the browser and
you get an email you'll see a text
notification come across the top and
then go back to the browser you can
actually check it out right here so
being able to to manage your email and
do triage from here is really powerful
feature we've done some reformatting of
the email application to take advantage
of the large display at the touch pad I
can drag over like this and that will
reveal other messages I have in my inbox
so I can easily switch between them and
if I didn't want to do a ton of emails I
can just drag over here you know I've
got more than one account I'm sure you
guys probably do too and so being able
to just crank through emails and my
different folders and accounts and go
through them like this is a really
powerful way to keep my inbox in check
now the other thing I'll show you here
is our keyboard this is a five row
keyboard and also we let you resize it
so this is something I think it's really
going to come down to personal
preference some people don't want a big
or smaller or sometimes you might just
want to go big right but we also have a
connected photos experience here so this
pulls in pictures from both things that
you have on the device as well as
connected experiences through Facebook
photo bucket or Snapfish let me show you
another application
Kindle the Kindle application gives you
access to Amazon's entire online library
and I can flip through books flip
through pages just like you'd expect
that supports bookmarking and
note-taking now taking a quick look at
our browser we also support flash so
what you're used to seeing in a web and
the web browser is what you're getting
here so I have here my pre 3 and I've
looked up a recipe for chicken mushroom
panini and if I want to share it with my
device I just tap it there like that and
so it'd have to be tapped on the sensor
itself yes so the sensor is right around
here and that's the home button sensor
essentially right correct it's not it's
not the home button soft but it's it's
that's that's where we put this enter
for the for the communication between
these two that pretty much concludes
what I have to show you today the bottom
line this week Web OS for the wind well
for this week at least now HP seems to
be putting all of its eggs in the webOS
basket while the landscape is littered
with tablets trying to be the next iPad
HP is attacking the entire Apple product
line by bringing web West to phones
tablets and even desktops later in the
year ok that's it for this week everyone
Molly we'll be back next week with a
brand spankin new CNET tech review until
then there are tons of great videos
available every day at Sina TV com
see you next time and thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
