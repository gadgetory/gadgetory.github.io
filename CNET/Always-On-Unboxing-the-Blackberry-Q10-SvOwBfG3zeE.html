this I have been waiting and I am
excited about this perversely because we
didn't have good luck with the
blackberry z10 no we were not fans but
blackberry is all about that physical
keyboard so the blackberry q10 or as we
are calling it the BB q10 I love that I
mean if barbecue is involved how can we
not love it we needed torture test this
thing by throwing it in barbecue sauce I
think we do actually I think we have
some other ideas all right can we can we
finally let's do it right there it is
boom cutin done to them oh that looks
like a blackberry it's half
underwhelming half awesomely old school
I love them I love the physical keyboard
I really do that screen is tiny though
doesn't it feel tiny yeah that's just
embarrassing yeah Wow look how small
that is wah wah I'm assuming it's so
lightweight because the battery is not
in there yet I mean it's a nice size
overall it feels nice in the hand I
don't know that you'd want something so
top-heavy if the screen was a lot bigger
that maybe I know bones are getting so
big now I feel like you could still get
a lot more real estate on the screen and
keep the keyboard and it wouldn't feel
too weird and it was music like very
very upset it's very nicely packed box
here got a whole bunch of instructions
which you need because it's a brand new
operating system that no one's a reason
before that's completely impossible to
navigate as we found out so painfully in
Barcelona okay aha battery alright so
cool beans but this out right now whoa
this is like the linguine of headphone
cards fettuccine it looks like
fettuccine I bet it's yeah yeah what it
is what are those little hoops for I
don't know my earrings alright we'll
finish that up and do the specs the BB
q10 is running BlackBerry's newest OS
10.1 its processor is a Qualcomm
Snapdragon s4 with 1.5 gigahertz
dual-core CPUs it has two gigs of RAM
but just 16 gigs of flash storage it is
expandable via microSD but only up to 32
gig the display is kind of sad it's a
three point one inch screen and the
resolution is only 720 x 720 speaking of
the keyboard it is the biggest selling
point it has a full four rows with 35
cheese and blackberry says the keys are
thirty percent bigger than on previous
models in terms of the camera the rear
facing shooter is 8 megapixels with an
LED flash and 1080p HD video recording
the front facing camera is 2 megapixels
and can take 720p HD video the q10 is a
4g phone and it also supports Wi-Fi
Bluetooth and NFC battery life could be
dicey the battery is 2100 milliamp hours
but it is removable so you could carry a
spare blackberry claims up to 13 and a
half hours of talk time over 3g and 14
days of standby time but that's also
over 3g for connectivity you'll find
micro USB for charging and micro HDMI
for sending video to tvs which you will
want to do because the screen is so bad
the BB q10 costs 199 dollars on contract
oh look i can get maxim for
hello and that only I sippers what are
the only apps available you can borrow
that for a minute if you want so other
than that first impression yeah it you
know not not a very responsive screen in
our short time with it yeah but and
small and not a lot of real estate but I
like the keyboard I know I mean I'm
excited to do some email I guess and try
it out but man has a full-featured
smartphone in a world overwhelmed with
full-featured smartphones yes this does
seem a little on the weak side maybe not
quite a smart read our full review over
at cnet com to find out if it is the
crackberry for you if you really have to
have that keyboard spend some time with
it yeah but I'm not gonna use those
weird headphones</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
