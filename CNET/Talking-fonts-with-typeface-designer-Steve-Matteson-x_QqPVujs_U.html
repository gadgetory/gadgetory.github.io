editor at C net here with Steve Madison
creative type director at monotype
imaging thank you for joining us Steve
absolutely great to be here thank now
what is a creative type director I've
been a type designer for over 20 years
and now I direct a team of type
designers and help my type designs get
executed by a whole team of type
designers and type projects can range
from one typeface to multiple weights in
a family and it requires really a team
effort to get a complete family done and
what is your first font that you've ever
designed the first typeface I did was a
typeface called Andy and it was based on
the handwriting of a childhood friend of
mine who had wrote with his left hand
and his letters kind of slant back to
the left and you can see on the top line
there's sort of a back slant it's kind
of a laid back looking handwriting and
he had the same kind of handwriting all
the way through adulthood and so when I
first started my career I was starting
to learn how to draw type and digitized
letter forms and he sent me a letter and
I thought wow this would be really cool
to digitize so I digitized the
handwriting from the letter and then
wrote him back a letter typed in his own
handwriting so it's kind of a fun way to
get started in the type design business
and what kind of other fun fonts have
you done
another design that's you see everywhere
and a lot of people love to hate is
called curls it was commissioned by
Microsoft so they commissioned me to do
a design that they would put into the
publisher product that people could use
using scrapbooking and that sort of a
thing and now we see it used everywhere
and sort of people are tired of it and
so it's it's not one of my most proud
moments but it fulfilled the customer
specification of a very curly fun design
and another font that people see
everywhere is actually something that
are isn't a lot of phones and you
designed the Android family fun is that
correct that's correct
in 2007 Google approached me to do a
typeface for the user interface for the
Android platform they required a design
that was neutral but not so neutral
because Google sort of a fun company and
so we wanted to have a little bit of
levity to the to the
sign and sew droid sans' was drawn and
then they needed a serif family as well
to browse web pages that had serif to
text and for those who might not
understand what is a serif font a serif
typeface is what you would typically see
in books and printed books and of course
the seraphs are the the little ending
strokes on on the letter forms and you
can see that there's a lot more contrast
of thick and thin strokes in a serif
typeface as well which makes it better
for reading so what other fonts have you
designed for Google well their branding
group was very impressed with the way
Android the Android platform was working
out and they liked the typeface droid
sans' very much and what they didn't
like was droid sans is sort of
compressed it's a little bit narrower
design because it was designed for the
mobile space and had to fit a lot of
information on a narrow screen and so
for a branding approach they wanted a
little bit wider version so Google sans
it's now called open sans is what
they're using throughout their Chrome OS
and through their branding and
advertising and as this still retains
some of the playfulness that was enjoyed
yeah that was the intention was to keep
the it's somewhat neutral but it has the
playfulness of the the two-story lower
lowercase G and when you add a little
bit of asymmetry you add a little bit of
playfulness a little bit of click
casualness to the design and Microsoft
actually commissioned you for another
kind of fun as well yes so in 2003
Microsoft decided to do a rebrand and
that they wanted to start from the
typeface and work that throughout the
entire brand from their user interface
on the desktop to all their packaging
and promotional promotional material and
so we designed a new face that was
neutral and humanistic and friendly and
approachable in appearance but it had to
be very legible on screen because they
were going to use it for the user
interface now they've adapted it to
include in the Windows Phone so that it
really ties together the entire
Microsoft corporate brand and where
exactly have we seen some of your other
funds so I mean I've seen in phones I've
seen in
these tablets and what kind of devices
we might see your designs in well the
first product I think my typefaces were
shipped in where was the original Xbox
the great big black angular
aggressive-looking gaming device and so
that called for very aggressive angular
looking typeface designs and then just a
few years later they decided that that
was the wrong brand voice for the Xbox
and so they made a much more
contemporary smooth looking device and I
worked on those typefaces which again
they complement the brand of the actual
piece of hardware are there any other
places that we could read your designs
yeah the typefaces are becoming much
more popular on reading devices such as
the Barnes and Noble Nook and the Kindle
and on the iPad
they the pixel density of these new
screens are becoming so sharp that
you're getting close to print when it
comes to the resolution and so you can
actually change the typefaces in what
you're reading on these devices to more
correspond to what your what your
preference is and so I've done designs
for the Barnes and Noble Nook for
instance that are designed specifically
to look good on that that ePaper screen
which is a very challenging environment
to to work in and on devices like the
the Samsung Galaxy you can read droid
serif when you're browsing the web so
well thank you so much for joining us
absolutely thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
