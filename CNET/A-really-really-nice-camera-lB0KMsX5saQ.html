possibly the best designed NEX model
thus far this interchangeable-lens
camera delivers excellent photo quality
very good performance and a great
feature set as well it's also cheaper
than the NEX 7 all of that makes it a
much better deal and as such it replaces
the NEX 7 as editor's choice for people
who are looking for something more
compact than a DSLR but with the same
level of control quality and performance
unlike other NEX models the 6 has a real
mode dial on top plus enough direct
access controls to streamline shooting
for those of us who like to operate that
way the electronic viewfinder is bright
and refreshes quickly enough for burst
shooting because the cameras bigger than
the models without a mode dial or EVF
there's even more room on the back for a
comfortable grip the menu system still
gets a little annoying and now the card
submenu has been rolled into setup which
makes it quite tedious to find important
options like card formatting and Wi-Fi
setup like the 5r the Wi-Fi features are
pretty basic though most competitors
offer similar you can upload to Facebook
or Sony's play memory service or
transfer directly to your phone there's
also a remote shutter app that lets you
use your phone or tablet as a larger
screen but all you can really do is snap
the photo also new is the ability to
download and install proprietary apps
but the whole operation seems to offer
more benefit to Sony than to the camera
owners for instance the free picture
effects plus app duplicates the effects
in the camera but adds watercolor and
illustration both of which are already
built into the NEX f3 the photo quality
really is quite good with clean JPEGs as
high as ISO 800 and for the most part
usable images as high as ISO 6400
depending upon the scene Sony's image
processing is so well done that I really
couldn't get noise reduction better at
any ISO level by processing the Raw's
though it still helps for recovering
highlights a shadow detail colors look
relatively accurate though Sony doesn't
offer a neutral color option and
renders a nice tonal range the video has
some artifacts notably aliasing and
moire
but the low-light tonal quality looks
better than average and there's less
color noise than usual the new 16 to 15
millimeter power zoom lens complements
it well though there's no way to control
the zoom from the camera body it's got a
nice easy to feel in fine zoom switch
and unlike Panasonic's power zoom lens
you don't give up a manual focus ring
the lens is good but at 16 millimeters
there's quite a bit of edge distortion
and vignetting the camera is quite fast
as well pretty much quick enough for any
shooting except maybe fast-moving sports
while the Wi-Fi and app implementation
is pretty annoying the rest of the
camera feels pitch-perfect I'm Laurie
brunnen and this is the sony alpha any
axis</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
