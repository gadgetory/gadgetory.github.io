this is decree 100 watt replacement LED
bulb this is a bigger brighter bulb than
anything that Cree has done before with
1600 lumens worth of light output now it
gets that from 18 Watts giving it a very
impressive efficiency of eighty eight
point eight eight lumens per watt that's
great that's a very efficient bulb and
that's just as good as what Cree has
done before meaning that this might be
destined to get Energy Star certified
it's not there yet though now if you
take a look at this bulb you'll see that
it is noticeably bigger than the
previous generation of Cree bulbs here
it is next to the 60 watt replacement
LED that Cree put out about a year ago
you'll see that the bulb is a lot bigger
but also those heat sinks are a lot
bigger dissipating quite a bit more heat
all right so let's turn the lights out
and get our light box out here's the 60
watt replacement from Cree and then here
in the middle is the 75 watt replacement
that they put out a couple of months ago
and here on the right we have the
hundred watt replacement and you can see
a pretty clear growth in the light
output it's got 800 lumens than 1,100
lumens and then 1600 lumens you can see
that difference you'll also see that
there is a slightly less yellowy tone to
the hundred watt replacement it has the
same color temperature as these two
bulbs are all 2700 K low end of the
spectrum kind of warm tone but because
of that extra brightness the yellow enos
doesn't really come out quite so much it
looks like a more neutral tone of light
so let's get that 75 watt replacement
out of there and replace it with the
Philips 100 watt replacement this is a
very comparable bulb to what Cree is
offering they both have 2700 K color
temperatures they both put out about the
same amount of light that Philips bulb
is 1680 in the Cree is 1600 so it's a
little brighter on the Philips side of
things price wise they're also very
close the Philips bulb is priced 2497
whereas the Cree bulbs going to retail
for 1997 that said Philips is already
Energy Star certified and that means
that this bulb will be a little cheaper
in areas that offer energy rebates Cree
isn't there yet they just submitted it
and it takes a couple of months so might
not be until this summer when you can
get it for cheaper than 1990
but for now philips has the pricing edge
in those regions here we have the two
bulbs in paper lanterns here beside me
I've got the philips bulb on my right
and the cree bulb on my left you can see
they're almost indistinguishable there
are very equal in terms of brightness
and color quality and you can barely
tell the difference so either way you're
going to get a good quality reading
light or really for any household
purpose all in all I think this bulb is
a great addition to crease lineup of LED
offerings it's got the 10 year warranty
that we like so much it's got a good
deal of brightness and the price point
1997 is better than most if not all of
the competition with the cree 100 watt
replacement LED i'm CNET's rad Chris</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
