an employee if he or she was really good
at their job it's a question you
actually might want to ask yourself if
you're considering buying the $1,200 LG
l dt 9 9 6 5 b d lots of little things
about this dishwasher bug me but man
it's really good at cleaning take a look
at the upper rack see the way the bottom
raises and lowers here I think it's
meant to be helpful somehow I'm just not
sure how what ends up doing is making it
hard to find any position for glasses
and bowls so that they're actually
sitting firmly in there and I was
following the recommended loading
pattern from the instruction manual and
still this thing was a pain in the butt
everything ends up feeling unstable and
knocking into each other and it's hard
to fit anything on the side columns with
the stem holders down and if you want to
use the stem holders you have to put the
wine glasses in the second row so
they're taking up twice as much space as
they normally would it's just not great
and despite having a helpful program
guide on the inside lip of the
dishwasher a lot of what's here is still
counterintuitive to use there's a bunch
of symbols here near the control panel
good luck figuring out what they all
mean I to consult the instruction manual
and even then I had trouble remembering
and these symbols are what tells you
what options you have selected it's also
not great at drying dishes and that
might be a bigger problem for some
drying aside it gets just about every
big thing right look at this thing
beautiful the black stainless exterior
resists fingerprints really well it runs
at a quiet 42 decibels according to the
manufacturer's rating if you don't abuse
your dishwasher and you rinse everything
before you load it in anyway you can
spend less and get more features than
this guy but the LG l bt 99 6 v BD is a
great cleaner so if you're willing to
overlook some annoyances you might
actually find it's worth the price
