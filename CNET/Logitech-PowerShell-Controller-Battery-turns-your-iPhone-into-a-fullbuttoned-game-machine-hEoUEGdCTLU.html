holidays you've wanted to turn your
little iPhone or iPod into a handheld
game system or you fancied some sort of
stocking stuffer the Logitech PowerShell
controller plus battery for the iPhone
is a perfect little turn your iPhone
into a game system doohickey it is
however a hundred dollars and it's one
of two iOS seven game controllers that
are out there this plus the Moga ace
power that i've already reviewed now
what's up here well iOS 7 actually
allows for full game control with
accessories that are officially part of
this m5 program now that means that
games could have Universal controller
support and there could be games all
over the place that allow you to play
the sort of stuff that used to on
Nintendo and Sony
however Kirby enthusiasm a tiny bit
because a lot of games don't have full
controller support yet now the
PowerShell looks like kind of an
old-school NES controller or a
playstation controller before they went
to analog sticks there's a d-pad here
there are four buttons there's also a
left and right shoulder button on top
and those are all analog yeah weirdly
but true they are analog buttons which
means that the more you press down on
one of these left or right areas on the
d-pad the faster you could go in some
games what we'll use that for who knows
now the Moga ace power actually has all
these buttons plus two analog pads and
to trigger buttons behind the shoulder
buttons so it's like a playstation or
xbox controller that's pretty cool and
that's called an extended button layout
versus the standard one that's here
that's a nice feature set but to me the
feel and the button finish and the way
all these buttons press is a lot better
on this logitech now this has also the
ability to charge your device up just
like the Moga ace power so it's kind of
like a Mophie Juice Pack you plug this
in via microUSB comes with a cable and
you can charge this device and then put
your iPhone in here and it will recharge
your iPhone so far it seems like it's a
little hard to tell when this battery is
topped off and how long it will take to
charge up your iPhone and that also
means you're going to deplete the
battery on this so it's more just like
extra battery life when you're out
playing games and it's long it's really
long I mean you can keep your phone in
here there's
hammer access on the back you'll be
talking on a big old banana phone with
this luckily it pops up pretty easily
you just slide out like that and there
you go
you have this long accessory to stick in
your bag how big is it compared to other
game systems of the past well it's a lot
smaller than a sega game gear from eons
ago but it is a lot bigger than a
Nintendo 3ds and it's even kind of a
little longer than a PlayStation Vita so
it's not really creating anything super
compact but if you want to play games
and use buttons this is kind of the way
you're going to go and in particular
grand theft auto san andreas which just
launched is probably the best use of
these buttons you can use it to play the
whole game and even these specific
button prompts are built into the
software so you know what to press and
it feels great a lot better than
pressing those on-screen buttons for a
game that complicated and long also
games like Sonic 2 limbo Bastion pac-man
even just remember that you have to have
a lightning port in order to use this
this does not have bluetooth so you
connect it with lightning which means it
supports the iPhone 5 the fifth
generation iPod Touch and the iPhone 5s
weirdly this does not support the iPhone
5c there is a built-in insert here that
you pop in to use the iPod Touch the
Moga ace does support the iPhone 5c but
anybody with a 30 pin you are out of
luck this also in order to get headphone
out has to use a built-in doohickey that
plugs into the side that runs into the
device and juts out so it's a little bit
annoying
I'm Scott Stein and that's a look at the
Logitech PowerShell controller plus
battery one of the first and what will
probably be a long wave of game
controller accessories for iOS</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
