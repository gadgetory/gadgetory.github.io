what makes this one really special is
Intel chips are really inside of almost
everything so we have a variety of demos
and little stations that showcase some
of the stuff so if you just take a
chance to look around this area we have
their stage but there's places here like
drones with cameras on them we're gonna
take you back over here
to show you kind of the next evolution
or improvement of their daiquiri headset
that we saw last year it's really like
they're augmented reality type headset
but used for industrial purposes so
let's go over here so this is one of the
stations that you definitely want to
check out here we have the daiquiri
glasses right again they still come with
a headset but over here in this spot
it's basically a setup where you're
dealing and messing with like a nuclear
reactor and it's all done through the
headset and through augmented reality
that's really cool okay now the other
thing that we have here is a BMW i8 I
was nice enough to you know loan them my
car and we're gonna give us checkout see
how it works out here Thank You Leonard
here we go right tech tech all
everywhere hololens and what you don't
see is that I can see lay out a digital
layout of a variety of things like a 5g
antenna coming out of the car I can see
different like numbers and data flying
everywhere I'm gonna go inside this car
and inside I can see like a 5g tower
there's traffic signals there's a 5g
connection here and then even cars
driving by me like outlines of them it's
just one of those cool things that you
can only experience here inside of
Intel's booth and we wanted to give you
a little bit of taste of what's here all
right another aspect of Intel's booth is
showing their chip technology inside of
sensors really in their wrist and on
your waist that are called their Curie
sensors really involved more with
measuring physical activity for speed
and what we have here is an amazing demo
basketball stars and dunk elite
throw one down but really it's measuring
the data that they're doing as this is
all happening and you can see it's one
of the biggest things here going on in
the Intel booth got a big crowd it's
another way to merge technology with
lifestyle</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
