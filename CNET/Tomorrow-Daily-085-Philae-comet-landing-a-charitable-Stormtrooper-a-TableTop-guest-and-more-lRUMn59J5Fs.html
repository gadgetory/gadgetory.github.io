successful soft landing on 67p go
science there's a man walking all over
Australia dressed as a storm trooper for
a good cause though okay guys that was
that would have been weird otherwise and
also a new way to scan for your veins
might make trips to the doctor a whole
lot easier oh thank god yeah because
they're pretty tough already sera daily
greetings citizens of the internet
welcome to tomorrow daily the best peak
talk show in the known universe I'm host
Ashley skellige enemies always kill
anonymous can i address that terrible
clap i did at the beginning work yeah
you want to try that again i went like
this well it was it was like you were
summoning a waiter i was i need more
bread yeah more bread its but but it's a
story we're very excited about for real
like that's why I club so let's all
right get to the head Brigade headlines
okay so we've had a rough couple of
weeks for space a rough couple leo it's
true not a lot of success not a lot of
successes but today we had a little bit
of something to celebrate about pretty
cool stuff alright so the feel a probe
that was launched off of Rosetta which
is this this 10 year long mission to get
to a comet called 67p feel a made its
landing yeah we're exciting so when it's
a first yeah it's the first time we've
ever landed it successfully on a comment
this is awesome so this video that we're
watching right now is actually the
entire process of getting Rosetta to
this comet and how we were able to get
it there so here it is like they do
these gravity assists with Mars and
Earth a couple of times I think they do
three gravity assists with earth just to
be able to get into the trajectory in
orbit of that comment which is nuts
incredible amount of calculations they
so many new that which has close to
certain other asteroids and missing
certain times and I mean it was nuts so
here they are they're gonna zoom out and
like there's the comet they get through
this flyby of an asteroid and they go
all the way down and like look at it
it's gonna meet up with this comet this
is crazy so this took this launched in
march of 2004 so this is before YouTube
even existed they launched Rosetta
that's crazy to think about yeah ten
years ago youtube but didn't always
exist no but but it seems like it's been
around for a really long time right this
has been on its mission for 10 years
over 10 years 2004 and it finally made
it and so this morning
this is the visualization of exactly how
it would work so Rosetta that's the
bigger craft would drop this probe name
feel a onto the surface of this comment
67p in this comment is humongous just
can't it's a gigantic gigantic comet so
it would land on the surface and what
they're hoping for is as it does testing
it wants they're hoping scientists can
discover more information about the
origins of life and whether or not
comets might have brought water and
other organic materials to earth so
maybe the Comets are the reason we exist
I mean that could be a really cool
discovery scientists it's going to Rove
around the comment it looks like it's
just going to drill and take a panoramic
picture so I don't think it's I don't
I'm not a hundred percent sure but as of
right now there were a couple landing
problems so one of the things is is
obviously it's a comment moving through
space it has very low gravity so it was
supposed to fire in each of those legs
harpoons down that would anchor it into
the comet so no would not go anywhere
would not be like the Curiosity rover
it's not driving around on 60 70 yeah so
it's there it's a hot spot no grand
theft no grand theft comment so I but
and then it would do this panoramic
picture and then it would be able to
send all that information back it so I'm
like a 30-minute time delay just about
it's like almost 30 minutes for that
information to get from the comment to
earth which is pretty impressive yes
yeah super impressive so take all these
pictures it would do some drilling but
right now the harpoons that were
supposed to lock it onto the con it did
not actually fire and they think it out
this that feel I landed twice they think
it landed and maybe took off again
turned and then re landed but they're
not a hundred percent sure it's actually
it was sleeping at the time of like when
we wrote all the notes for the show they
said we've lost contact with it for now
and then we're going to re get contact
with it again at this time tomorrow and
and then we'll be able to have some more
information and figure out some more
things but yeah like this is incredible
tremendous accomplishment like you said
huge calculations all kinds of great
stuff here that here's the team they're
looking or waiting I mean it was very
very exciting from that was the one of
the pictures that rose
took of the probe like heading towards
he's like I see you and they both have
no they are celebrating when they
realized that it was a it was a landing
made it so great I mean what a great
moment I'm not excited this that's a
first it's the first time we've landed
on me it's the first ten years in the
making yeah and everybody please save
your Armageddon jokes because this is
not an asteroid it's a comet what all
these oh there you go save your Bruce
Willis joke all right um but really this
is a tremendous achievement you can
follow feel a that has his own Twitter
it's adorable you can go over to feeling
feel a 2014 is the Twitter account but
that's the hashtag of the day the
hashtag tag of the day today is TD
Rosetta and we want you to just just
send up your congrats to feel a 2014 on
the ESA at esa you can send it to the
european space agency because that was a
huge achievement so send over your
positive tweets your congratulations and
really that's all we ask of you today
yeah send some love to the people that
actually made a hassle yeah that's the
ambient really is tremendous and
incredible and so much work and I
believe they said that that craft had
been designed like 25 years ago God
design of it was made 23 and then it's
taking this long like get the funding
and do the calculations and build the
graft and get it out there so this is I
mean gonna really long this has been a
really long time like to get this well
know when it's gonna be like done doing
what it does set up there to do i
believe by march of next year it will be
too close to the Sun the comet will be
too close to some for the robot will not
be able to function i'll get too hot so
they said it won't be like they're
hoping it'll be a little longer but it
might only be a short amount of time not
only be like weeks that they would be
able to get that sounds like it only had
like a very small amount of processes
that it needed to do it has about 10 has
10 different processes that they're
hoping it will get done and transmitted
back to earth so did you transmit back
that very curse to see what we get out
of this yeah it'll be really march will
have stuff so hopefully yeah i mean 30
minutes 30 minute wait time this was as
long as it pizza or a pizza yeah half
hour or less or it's free um tell me
about this stormtrooper because this
seems crazy okay and a galaxy here where
we are right now there is a man that is
walking from just all around Australia
9,000 miles across Australia
that's his path he's going all the way
around it look at that in a stormtrooper
uniform now I don't even know if you
know but Australia is pretty hot yeah it
gets really really hot but let me get to
why he's doing this he's doing this for
charity as you see in the in the video
he's doing it for a you know a
children's a children's charity so the
Monash Children's Hospital Monash show
has a hospital and Melbourne he's hoping
to raise a hundred thousand dollars for
doing well that's very noble yeah it's
very noble and it's also it's not only
to raise money for this but it's also to
bring attention to the group that he
belongs to called the five-oh-first
which is a group of people that dress up
his stormtroopers and do charitable
events like the only not-for-profit
group that has the blessing of like
Lucas are Lucasfilm and is neat like
they're they're totally cool at them
they're legit their costumes are awesome
and obviously they're trying to do good
all the time currently he's raised
twenty-three thousand five hundred
dollars that's pretty good which is
about a fifth of the way but he's and
he's uh he's still got these he's still
got a lot o still got a ways to go yeah
yeah he's still walking he's still got
aggressive right now yeah I still got a
ways to go and one of the fun facts is
that he's eating just like animals and
roadkill that he finds that's disgusting
yeah this isn't it like an intense
journey like he's pretty grueling he's
gonna be yeah this is a pretty intense
thing so he said at the beginning so
hopefully you know you'll get a chance
to donate and again it goes to the
Children's Hospital yeah I'm wearing
this to a group that you know is a
charitable groups yes it's called
storming Australia if you want to check
it out and the guys name is Scott lux
Lee so I may be related to Robin of a
Robin of Locksley maybe Robin of
Locksley um but yeah that's pretty cool
he's uh I guess he's expected to keep
walking he said he might be done around
july of next year's he's got like six
Marcus it's been almost a year right now
very year yeah he started hiking last
year on the second of November this is
this is pretty intact yeah that's pretty
crazy Scott Locksley you're better than
we are you're yeah I don't what's it I
there's a lot of questions that come up
I think when I first heard this article
like hey does he have a job like what's
going on any man does he only
because he does eat roadkill yeah but I
guess see my favorite quote of his from
that was if it's bloated I don't eat it
and if it bleeds I eat it wow this guy's
yeah at the end of it he's gonna be
hardened dedicated there's gonna be
tough he has a wife and kids oh yeah
he's gonna come home he's gonna have a
real interesting life to adjusting back
to the real world it's gonna be so
bizarre where's your where's your
husband oh he's out walking Australia
dressed as a storm trooper but for the
kid but for the kids what matters yeah
it brings it back to sanity levels stray
out there um Cal have you ever given
blood yeah I have me too and you know
the worst part about giving blood is
like when you go and maybe they have
kind of an assistant that is like not
very good at finding a vein yeah that
happens and they have to stick you
multiple times they poke you like the
word that it's really stupid and then
you feel like maybe you don't ever want
to go back oh yeah it like ruin gervais
you ever want to go back um this
actually this invention of this gadget
might change that this is really cool i
love this video ooh that's uh that is a
projection of that man's veins on his
arm this is awesome so it's a new device
that uses visualization scanners to find
veins under your skin and then when it
does find them it projects exactly where
they are on the top of your skin so this
uses this is that's amazing so cool so
you can see there you go there's his you
can see his veins so and the veins are
the parts where there is not light on
the red and then I believe on the green
it is where there is light if i'm not
mistaken so Dan dr. dan Waller is the
senior researcher on this project and he
says that he uses a near-infrared
technology to project an image on your
skin and because veins have a lot of
deoxygenated hemoglobin it absorbs
near-infrared light so the device uses
that information to figure out where
your veins are and then project that
image it's fantastic yeah so it's really
neat so right now it's actually in
testing this is not something that like
oh we might see in five to ten years
which is a lot of our medical stuff that
we talked about on the show yeah this is
actually in use in testing rate this is
today daily instead of tomorrow daily
well it's tomorrow daily because it's
actually happening in Australia which is
its tomorrow's Australia episode
australia day I don't know but it's
they're working on in Sydney so if
you're in Sydney and you're going to go
give blood at the Red Cross they are
going to take 300 first time donators
and 600 repeat donators or donors
donators or maybe talking about that's a
new word is that a new word okay and
they're going to test it so what they're
hoping is that this will obviously
decide how feasible it might be to roll
out to a bigger market how fast can they
get it to new markets where can you use
it is it you know let's just roll it out
so this is a you know small test batch
and then they're hoping to roll it out
wider and I would imagine you if you're
a first-time donor and you have an
experience like that you might be more
inclined to come back yeah that's not
bad doesn't really don't have to keep
getting you have to keep being jabbed I
mean that is literally the worst thing
in the universe like when you have
little tiny veins and then you have
somebody's like oh I'm really sorry like
and they're they're trying but the env
it's a volunteer you know you're like on
the on the giving blood the blood stream
bus or whatever they call it and you're
like trying to donate blood and then it
they just can't get it and you're just
like I'm miserable is the worst thing
ever it's worse enough getting stuck one
time much less like multiple that's
enough needle talk for and that's enough
of that all right well on that on that
note then we will give kill 30 seconds
to relax and calm down we'll be right
back with our very first in-studio
interview um don't know that's yay
that's yay needles odd yes yeah it's
good we'll be back with our very first
guest which we're very excited to to
introduce to you guys and and then of
course we have user feedback and our
phone target for the day so don't click
away tomorrow daily
alright our next story is about Ashley's
hat what is it and where did it come
from I love that that's how we're coming
back from the show hi everybody welcome
back uh my hat I'm just gonna own it my

The Syndicate prod my grandma didn't

into it yeah let's get into it every now
and again kale and I are into the exact
same thing and this week we're both into
tabletop season 3 it's coming it's the
season premiere is tomorrow it was
crowdfunded they crowdfunded it over on
IndieGoGo they made a bunch of money I
want truckload of cash good which is
awesome they made over a million dollars
to produce their third season and uh we
were lucky enough to have our very first
guest on the show Boyan radakovich one
of the nicest guys I've ever met super
delightful literally one of the best
people ever he's a producer on tabletop
he did he helps choose games and
everything and he is great so he came
and talked to us but there was a catch
so check this out okay so we are here
with table top producer boy on
radakovich hey guys we are so excited to
have your very first guests inside yo
it's awesome i'm so excited but here's
the thing your name was actually too
long to fit kale in the studio it's like
15 letters I'm Josh together boy
radakovich like there's no room for kill
anonymous yeah sorry but so what we
decided is we're gonna ask you some
questions and we're gonna have your roll
a dice at the end of each question if
it's even I'll ask the next question if
it's odd Kayla last the next guy like
it's like a game okay it's a perfect
game to talk about again yeah let's do
this it's Joanna show about games you
we're gonna get meta it's a youtube show
about games talking about YouTube get
it's very mad and very confusing okay so
let's start first question if somebody
has never seen tabletop what is it oh
it's a very difficult question yeah so
tabletop is a fun celebrity gaming show
that you can find on youtube you go to
youtube.com slash geek &amp;amp; sundry or you
can go to hulu com / tabletop and
basically Wil Wheaton comes together
with the celebrity gaming friends and we
play board games and it's really fun
awesome okay let's roll the dice ok the
next question even me odd kale let's do
this thing BAM odd all right all right
so uh what what game do you think
created the most heated match like I
want to know I don't know where people
in season 3 or season to anyone spoil
irony okay so I want to give spoilers I
don't go so in season two Lords of vague
sorry Lords of Waterdeep for sure
because there's an episode there were so
it's a kind of deeper strategy game will
is on there with Felicia Brandon latch
and Patrick Rothfuss this is an awesome
episode really fun a lot of good
chemistry but will is like I must win
this game and like in the break we sit
down and he kind of sits with me it's
like okay what do I need to do we go
throw the strategy oh that's not and
he's just like I'm gonna win I'm gonna
win and then Felicia just totally
destroys him I know ruined so you can
just see his whole expression just like
k then he's like crying on the table he
still talks about that game even now to
Felicia he wants a rematch no just like
he's like I can't believe you did that
to me and you know so it's like it's a
is a broken there's a little part of his
heart that's broken no no and I will
never recover whenever it's felicia day
gee it's a very good episode was it's
your channel whatever yeah i recommend
you watch it in season 3 there's a
there's a lot of them there's a lot of
games that will is like I must win
because he's trying to improve his win
record oh yeah and so Jen baseball card
is embarrassing but nothing is stats are
like not so good so yeah okay so there's
a lot of good stuff out there alright
let's do another role
I have done this even you guys
crowdfunded yes three oh my god yes and
I noticed that in the trailer there is a
brick wall of a bunch of names and I'm
assuming that's maybe like a that was a
reward here yeah it was amazing so a
little bit about like all the rewards
that people got to do so tabletop was
create as part of the YouTube initiative
to create creative content we're part of
that and then when Google fun you know
that fundings ended we were kind of left
holding the bag and so we really didn't
have enough money to make the show
because we really do it at a very high
level and so we once IndieGoGo and the
backers were so generous it was amazing
1.4 14 million dollars it's like
ridiculous that's crazy and one of the
packages was you can get your name on a
brick wall and so when you look at the
set for season 3 you'll see all those
little means those are backers in tiny
gold lettering yeah sharpie and so our
pas Kevin Melissa I'm sorry got out
Kevin Melissa you guys are amazing like
it took them three days to write it like
every name up there it's amazing we're
going to try to release a
high-definition image where everyone's
on their like zooming yeah so you can
zoom and scroll and stuff that's crazy
yeah so it's because of you guys have to
put together like a hundred and fifty
megapixel image like just heed this nah
it's probably it's probably because it's
a video too right oh boy Wow yeah coo
coo town fun times yeah it was amazing
but we couldn't do without you guys oh
and also there were some backers that
pledged at such a high level that they
got to hang out with us it was amazing
so like they were on set and they got to
like take those selfies with Karen and
stuff oh that's pretty fun yeah that is
pretty fun okay so that is it for our
questions okay you're all done oh thank
you i watch tabletop guys season 3 it
airs on YouTube go to it YouTube's let

the show you can check out wil Wheaton's
blog it he's got a full guest list of
who's gonna be on the show so yeah
tabletop season 3 so on that note hurts
tomorrow by the way starts tomorrow on
that note user feedback all right we're
gonna burn through these ok let's go
yesterday we asked you guys use the
hashtag TD karate and tell us what you
would train your robot to do and who
would drain it your face looks like
we're gonna enjoy these very excited
Richard reticence said I would load all
the mechanics of every car in the world
so I could have my own personal free
mechanic whoa he'd sue puppy right all
right genius hey soos wrote us and said
Atlas plus Google's self-driving car
plus unified weapons master combat armor
equals Robo quedo so I can become the
Green Hornet I like that well yeah and
then Joseph wrote to us and said I would
i er hash Ashley and kale to give me
news instead of reading some story on
the internet because who is better to
get news from oh he would hire us to
train his robot
to give the news the way we give the
news and I tried to make him a pizza or
something yeah not a good okay so and
then Bray on wrote to us and said i
would get Batman's Butler Alfred to
train my robot to take care of my
parents PS love the show since day one
wait but I see okay i was thinking okay
i thought the same thing you did which
was Bettman doesn't have parents so how
would Alfred know how to train a robot
to take care of your parent but Alfred
was around since before he he loved the
Wayne's yeah but if he did I know but he
didn't I mean like he didn't take care
of the parents well enough they died
yeah but you know what was all fer gonna
do what could he have done in that
moment ok stuff terror I didn't need
train him to be Batman lazy to train the
road what's the robot to take care of
his parents I guess that's sweet so take
care of his parents make him food clean
their house yeah like Rosie the robot
but an Alfred above yeah and it wouldn't
be an old man yeah be a super 6 foot 3
robots oh yeah i forgot that it's a
terrifying roller human strength yeah so
it's someone in the comments by the way
in youtube was like was like yo are you
guys are are you know crapping on the
fact that you know they taught them to
do karate that's not hard to do that's
that's pretty hard to do to train a
robot no i agree yeah we agree on we're
not disagreeing with you at all that is
amazing we just don't want weaponized
robots I just don't want a robot
roundhouse kicking me in the face like
chuck norris in a year that's all I'm
saying but it is it is amazing credible
we didn't say that in the video yeah it
is incredible feat that programmers are
able to do that with software doesn't to
watch that robot balancing on a cinder
block I can't even balance on a sitter
black with one leg so pretty impressive
no we would not we don't we don't
disagree with you we agree ok time for
our last piece of user feedback which is
always our phone tog refer the day
alright so Kyle our rights to us and he
says he sent us this magical picture
whoa he said iphone 5s panorama mode
edited in adobe photoshop express taking
it Harris beach in Brookings Oregon Wow
look at that picture that's that's
stunning yeah that's that's pretty
amazing I looked what they do bigger
version of it like if you can watch this
on a large screen oh this this image is
really impressive I mean he obviously
you know he cleaned it up in Photoshop
Express I'm sure he changed some of the
levels but thing is at the end of the
day this is probably pretty close to
what the original picture was which is
pretty impressive it's a really good
panorama way to go yeah Kyle are high
fives I'm 5s we're high fiving you
through the internet we're high fives
cool yeah kayla facebook you but that's
our phone charm for the day pretty
impressive stuff if you are interested
in sending in your phone tog raphy your
your story ideas somebody sent us some
