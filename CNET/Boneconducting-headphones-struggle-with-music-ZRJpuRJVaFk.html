cnet.com and I'm here with the
aftershocks sports M two headphones
that's right I said headphones even
though these are earphones or they at
least they look like earphones they
don't actually go in your ears they use
bone conduction technology to pass sound
through your cheek bones this is a
military technology that was designed
for communications for military use and
now it's made it into some of these
consumer headphones you'll see a few of
them out there and they're really
designed for someone who wants to have
that open ear experience to let sound in
while you're riding a bike or doing
exercise these leave your ear completely
open and then you do get sound passed
through your cheek bone how is that
sound well it's not all that great at
least for music I actually liked it I
was on the treadmill watching TV with
these and they actually sound very good
with speech they were also good for
making calls these do have a mic built
into the battery pack which is
rechargeable via USB
these are aftershocks second generation
bone conduction earphones there's also a
Bluetooth model that's in the works one
of the funny things about wearing these
headphones is that when you do crank up
the bomb they will vibrate on your
cheeks which kind of tickles a little
bit ideally you would use these at more
moderate volume levels and I would
equate the sound of sort of listening to
almost a transistor radio through
earphones they are stereo and they sound
okay but certainly not like your typical
earbud style headphones so what I'd say
about these guys is if you're a stickler
for good sound these are not the
headphones for you these are really for
someone who wants more casual listing
and that open ear experience that really
wants to let the outside environment in
and be able to hear cars coming and also
they are good for use at the gym if you
are watching TV and making calls those
are the aftershokz sports m to bone
conducting headphones
thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
