we're here at the sony playstation 4
event in new york city just want to
recap real quickly what was announced
the entire event was really focused on
games a lot of major developers got on
stage and showed off what they're
working on not necessarily games but
what they're capable of doing with the
new hardware we saw that watch dogs and
beyond two souls will probably be
PlayStation 4 games they were originally
sort of announced its PlayStation 3
games and we also got to see that a lot
of titles will also make debuts
simultaneously on PlayStation 3 and
PlayStation 4
another big focus of the event was an
impact on social gaming how people will
share videos of what they play how that
it will integrate with facebook now
strangely enough they did not show us
what the actual playstation 4 hardware
is going to look like we did get a
glimpse of what the new controller will
look like that's called the DualShock 4
and we did get to see what the new i
sort of stereo camera device will look
like as well again no price no hardware
and all we know right now is that it
will have a holiday 2013 release sony
and Gaikai are teaming up to bring the
biggest streaming online gaming
initiative we've ever seen so far that
includes things like streaming games
live to demo them before you buy them
some interesting stuff being proposed
here at the sony playstation 4 event in
new york we will be following up with
much more on cnet com for now I'm Jeff
Bakalar thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
