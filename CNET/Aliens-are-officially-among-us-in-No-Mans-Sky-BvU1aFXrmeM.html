no man sky from hello games isn't like
any other game you've played before from
the first time you load in on a strange
alien planet it's clear you are not the
center of this universe not necessarily
the hero of the story and you are just
in amongst this universe and hopefully
engrossed in it after getting some
hands-on time with the game the only
thing that's truly clear is that there
are no guided objectives aside from the
faint suggestion of continuing to move
toward the universe's core but with 18
quintillion planets to explore you'll
likely find yourself creating your own
objectives and taking in the scenery no
matter where you find yourself this is a
I like a canvas that you can have so
many different type of game experiences
that you can become a traitor or fighter
and Explorer you can be a survivalist
you know those things they're meaningful
during my demo time hello games
announced that no man's sky will include
NPC alien races making your journey much
less lonely it'll also make your travels
much more entertaining since you'll need
to invest time learning alien languages
and trading with the locals to curry
favor and maybe snag some upgrades for
your equipment once you have a better
ship more fuel and improved survival
skills you'll be able to expand your
exploration discovering new species
meeting new races and maybe even finding
a point of interest from another player
who already has traveled to and departed
the very same planet you're currently
standing on we're still curious to find
out how different or similar planets and
ecosystems will end up being in the
final version of the game but even no
man's skies developers don't really know
what's out there since the planets are
generated by math but now at least we
know we aren't alone in this universe
so this we want it to feel real and we
want it to deliver for me something that
like a book could never do
the film could never do that feeling of
like honor this is mine and I'm the
first to be here and I like that about
the game no man's sky blasts off in
outer space on June 21st 2016</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
