one of the company's mid price TVs for
2016 but includes a list of features
you'd associate with high-end
televisions it has worthwhile picture
enhancements like high dynamic range and
full array local dimming as well as
remote that's actually a full function 6
inch Android tablet the TV itself has
relatively generic styling with the dark
gray finish and a thicker panel one
distinguishing touch for the unusual
stand legs which are made of bent metal
and remind me of clothes hangers a
tablet remote on the other hand is
pretty unusual and Vizio thought it out
well even including a nifty magnetic
wireless charging cradle control the TV
is handled by vizio smart cast app which
replaces a traditional on-screen menu
for stuff like picture settings and
changing inputs Vizio also includes a
simple standard remote but it only
handles basic functions one advantage of
the tablet is more apps than a
traditional Smart TV system a big
disadvantage however is that you have to
go through some extra clicks on the
tablet to get stuff like Netflix and
Hulu up and running on the screen it's
the same process used by Google's
chromecast device and it's great if
you're used to using your phone for
everything I find it more cumbersome
than a standard TV based app however so
if I bought an M series I'd probably
connect a streaming device like a Roku
or Apple TV instead of using the tablet
as ambivalent as I am about the tablet
based control I love M series picture
quality for the money it has an
excellent image thanks to the local
dimming system that creates deep black
levels and lots of pop without uneven
lighting across the screen that can
plagued some competitors ii also handle
the latest high dynamic range sources in
both HDR 10 and dolby vision format
whether from Netflix or Vudu in the end
the best thing about the M series isn't
the free tablet it's the excellent
picture for a very affordable price
