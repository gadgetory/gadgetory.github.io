with the Cree connected led our editors
choice winner in the smart LED category
we first reviewed this bulb back in
January and liked it quite a bit it got
an 8.5 out of 10 work with the wink
platform at launch and did quite a nice
job on that platform it would turn on
and off when you came and when it would
turn on and off on a schedule you could
control it remotely from the app all
that works perfectly but we didn't like
that it works just with wink at lunch
she wanted more official partners well
in the months since we've seen those
partners emerge first up with smart
things which added official support for
cree LED zin last month you can also
control it on staples connect now with
official support coming in the next
month or two and you can control it
using the Philips hue bridge so if
you've got color changing hue lights and
you want a slightly less expensive
option to add to your setup these work
well when I say less expensive that's
exactly what I mean these are $15 lights
that's about as cheap as smart lights
get fact that's exactly as cheap as
smart light let's get Philips hue Lux
bulbs cost 30 apiece
well can we moe bulbs cost 30 apiece
this is one of the few options that's
really come down to an accessible price
point it ties the GE link LED at 15 but
I think this one works a little better
with the platforms that we've tested
both on may be a little laggy R there on
the wink of but you've got other options
now which is really important the other
options also bring in new features and
functionality for instance the Philips
hue bridge and the smartthings hub are
both IFFT compatible they have if
channels so you add V bulb to these hubs
you can control it using if you can't do
that with wink beyond those connected
features this is a very good bulb draws
eleven point five watts and puts out 815
lumens of light at 2700 K that's a nice
yellowy color temperature and when you
turn it on you can barely tell that it's
not incandescent it's got that same
silhouette and that's the cree 4 flow
design at play it's the bulb from last
year the dumb version of this bulb that
creep it out the same design here with
the cree connected LED i think it looks
pretty good some people might not like
that when the bulbs back off it's got
kind of a plasticy look there's no glass
but all in all I like this design if you
decide to go with a more expensive
competitor like Phillip C Lux or Belkin
Wemo LEDs you might notice a slight bump
in color rendering capabilities maybe a
little bit better efficiency but not
enough of a jump to justify the price
increase those cost twice as much per
bulb as decreed bold
throughout fitting all homes worth of
light
you're gonna want something a little
more affordable the Cree bulb also does
a better job connecting and automating
of these platforms than the equally
price to GE link LED all in all that
adds up to a pretty terrific value the
best option that we've seen in the smart
lighting category yet and that makes
this bulb the winner of our editor's
choice thanks for watching check out the
rest of our reviews at cnet.com for seen
