lightbulb testing box out today so you
know what that means we're testing out
light bulbs and specifically we're
looking at bulbs that have high CRI
numbers that stands for color rendering
index and it represents the bulbs
ability to make colors look correct so a
bulb with the high CRI should do a good
job making your reds look red greens
look green etc etc specifically we're
looking at the Cree T W series LED and
the GE reveal LED both of these have
high CRI x' in the 90s and they're
hoping to offer the same amount of color
quality that you'd get from your old
incandescent bulbs like this one so
let's kill the lights for just a second
switch our setup and now here we've got
a bowl of nice tantalizing M&amp;amp;Ms sitting
under a 60 watt incandescent bulb just a
typical normal light produces color as
well you can see that these all look the
way they should it looks appetizing look
colorful looks bright now we're going to
switch it out and see how the other
bulbs compare first up is the Cree TW
series 60 watt replacement LED now this
is an 800 lumen bulb that uses 13.5
Watts to put out that same amount of
light and you can see the color looks
pretty good I'm not sure I'd say it as
good as that incandescent light the
incandescent CRI number would probably
be somewhere around 99 this is a CRI of
93 so maybe not quite as colorful a bowl
of M&amp;amp;Ms but still a pretty darn good
looking one now we've got the GE reveal
LED in place and you can see the candy
still looks great but it's a little less
bright the amount of light coming out of
this bulb is not the same as cream I
shirt kind of fading more to black it's
not quite as wide a pool of light and
that's because it doesn't have as many
watts it's not putting out as many
lumens it's only 570 lumens as opposed
to Crees 800 and that puts it kind of
below what you want from a 60 watt
replacement the reason for that is
because both of these bulbs both Korea
and GE are filtering out part of that
yellow light in order to give a more
even distribution of the spectrum in
better colors the Cree bulb amps up the
wattage a little bit and that makes up
for the lack of brightness with some
extra power and you get the right amount
of light the GE doesn't do that the GE
reveal just filters that light out and
doesn't compensate so you get a dimmer
bulb that said these colors look pretty
good
and as we continue testing it we found
even better results in some of our other
photograph tests you can take a look
here at some of the sample images from
our comparison gallery the GE reveal did
a very nice job the colors all look
vivid and they look correct there's
something a little yellowy about that
Cree light it's not filtering out quite
as much of that yellow light and if you
look at the spectrometer graphs from our
testing that holds true you can see that
take a look at this graph for instance
now this might look a little unwieldy
but these are just lines that represent
the amount of light that each bulb is
putting out over different parts of the
spectrum so right in the middle there
those big humps you see those represent
the yellow part of the spectrum that's
all the yellow light that these bulbs
are putting out which is quite a lot and
if you look there's that weird kind of W
shaped dip for each bulb that's the
light that's being filtered by each bulb
that light's not getting out of the bulb
it's not affecting the color and that's
why they have higher color rendering
index numbers but if you look the GE
reveals W dip right there it goes up a
lot further down than the Cree bulbs the
Cree isn't filtering out as much of that
yellow light and that's exactly what the
photographs show also one other thing we
want to notice is that the Cree line
goes a lot higher and that's those extra
Watts the area under those graphs under
those lines that's the amount of
brightness you're getting and so the
Cree is amping up the wattage it's going
a little higher it's giving you more
brightness so when it filters some of it
out it's still giving you the correct
amount that's the thing that GE doesn't
quite get right I wish it was a bit
brighter
overall both of these bulbs did a great
job the Cree TW got the better price
point a longer lifespan and a much
better warranty but the GE reveal
despite being a little bit more dim it's
the bulb with better color rendering it
does a better job making those colors
pop and look accurate so that's the most
important thing giving your
consideration for CNET I'm right Chris
