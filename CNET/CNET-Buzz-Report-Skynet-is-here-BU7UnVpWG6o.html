report the show about the tech news that
everyone is talking about this week it's
white iphones apple's doing a phone
company again and badass exoskeletons
but first it's the gadget of the week
the edge of the week is that elusive
unicorn of the tech world the white
iphone yeah they say it's going to come
out this time like a year after it was
announced and we're not talking about it
because it's going to have super mega
cool new features or it will transform
into a Decepticon or anything like that
it's just that if it comes out we can
stop talking about it according to a
tweet from an apple senior VP the white
iphone will will arrive this spring so
either that gives Apple until about the
middle of june or we'll hear about them
petitioning to extend spring into around
november and now for the news back to
Apple which continues to carpet bomb the
tech world with lawsuits this week they
have filed a copyright and patent
infringement lawsuit against Samsung
over the galaxy phones and tablets I
mean it's not that surprising Samsung
does make Android products we know how
Apple feels about those also the galaxy
s does look exactly like an iphone 3gs
but here's what's weird samsung also
makes a bunch of components for apple
yeah no matter what happens any company
partner holiday parties between those
two are going to be awkward speaking of
apple security researchers this week
reported that the iphone and 3g ipad
have been secretly making a record of
everywhere you go and when you go there
and then storing that data in an
unencrypted file on all your devices
haha no one knows why Apple at press
time had not responded to questions
about it but basically anyone who gets
your phone or accesses your computer via
a jealous ex your boss or a private
investigator can now uncover an
incredibly detailed record about all
your whereabouts so that's awesome
that's why i have an android phone
because google would never collect
information about everything you do all
the time and store it in a gigantic
database that's destined to become
self-aware and maybe even already has
wait
second more on that in a minute in other
news match.com says it will now screen
its members and check them against a
national sex offender registry this
comes on the heels of a class-action
lawsuit filed against the company by two
women who said they were sexually
assaulted by men they met on match com
now on the surface this seems like a
good idea kind of surprised they were
doing it sooner on the other hand if you
use a fake name or a fake address or you
have the same name as someone on the sex
offender registry list hilarity will not
ensue buyer beware all right now for
some happy news from the science is
freaking amazing Department comes a
story about a man who has been in a
wheelchair for 20 years but with the
help of a kick-ass exoskeleton from Argo
medical technologies he was able to walk
again and even go up and down stairs and
about Lee bicycles
it's just the third post and the episode
last week the ReWalk exoskeleton should
be available by the end of this year it
costs 150 grand the battery looks like a
backpack but it lasts 48 hours and it's
nice to see technology helping people
isn't it and for a look at technology
casually enslaving people let's see
what's clogging the tubes this week if
you noticed your computer's acting a
little squirrely lately it might be
Skynet that's right the evil sentient
computer intelligence that dominates the
world in the Terminator movies was
scheduled to become self-aware Tuesday
night at eight eleven pm it's not
scheduled to attack until april 21st so
we might have a few hours left it's
actually got quite the ominous twitter
feed um but actually we already survived
the real self-awareness moment
considering that in Terminator 2 Skynet
gain self awareness on August
twenty-ninth 1997 and the new date comes
from terminator the sarah connor
chronicles TV show come on you guys know
your nerd trivia or but wait maybe it's
an alternate timeline pretty sneaky
Google I mean Skynet and that's it for
this week everyone and possibly forever
I'm Molly wood and thank you for
watching
when you tell you about my daughter this
time it's a meaty stand is a family
father you told</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
