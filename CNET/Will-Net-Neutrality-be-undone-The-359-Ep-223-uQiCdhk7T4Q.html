another week's worth of podcasts from a
couple of guys who don't listen to me
ever ever ever that's Reggie and in the
house very 3:59 podcast we have Roger
Chang and Ben Fox Ruben episode 223
what's up guys we're sorry we're sorry
Queen Alyssa to you it's really just
been who doesn't listen hey hey yeah
throwing up that's right alright when we
talking we'll talk about net neutrality
it's a hot topic John Oliver talked
about it last night on last week tonight
and we're our own Maggie we got an
exclusive interview with FCC Chairman
Ajit PI I will break that down for you
and second up we'll talk about Andy
Rubens next project no relation no
relation to bed Fox really right any
reuben better known as the founder of
android and he's got a new startup
accelerator
which we're gonna boot rich Nieva got a
chance to dive into what it was it's
housed in a an old Fry's Electronics
warehouse which I kind of loan makes
sense I love that detail so we're gonna
talk about that as always if you've any
questions about these topics leave it
the comment section right we'll pick up
the best we'll get to them in three
minutes and 59 seconds here we go we'll
see in the chat in a couple of minutes
and here we go in three two
welcome to the 359 I'm dr. Chang I'm Ben
Fox ribbon what will let you Charlie
look like in the coming months well we
don't really know because FCC chairman
algae pie has begun his assault on the
existing rules well he says he's all for
an open Internet he doesn't agree with
the regulations in place our own Maggie
Rand sat down with PI says that he wants
us to return to clinton-era light touch
regulations but a lot of critics say
that just gives Internet service
providers a lot more leeway and way too
much power and what do you think I think
that it makes sense that a Republican
chairman would try to do something like
this it is interesting that he is at
least at the moment trying to convey
some sort of positive aspects about like
I'm for the open Internet I'm not trying
to you know destroy your internet people
but III don't think that he has a ton of
credibility in the marketplace over this
so we'll see how people actually respond
to those yeah
it's interesting he is a former Verizon
lawyer which john oliver who actually
devoted a segment yesterday on the show
to talk about net neutrality the point
out points out that you know it's kind
of a dangerous connection there right
and then the fact that you know all
these guys all the internet service
providers like Verizon Comcast they also
all say were for an open Internet mm-hmm
they just don't agree with the rules in
place we just basically they don't want
laws restrictive doing the things that
they say they are not going to do right
and generally those are the types of
folks that are going to win out the most
if net neutrality does get thrown out
its those ISPs yep as opposed to Google
Amazon Netflix yeah I mean like there's
this enormous list of other giant
companies that are also fighting to keep
net neutrality rules in place so who
exactly is gonna win out the last time
around and we expected this would last a
little bit longer than it did but the
last time around you know the Netflix is
of the world ended up winning out this
time I mean like it's all under the FCC
right like I'm sorry is gonna make the
decision yeah the issue here is or you
know the reality is that this is a
republican-controlled FCC now there's
three Republicans two Democrats so if
they all vote in accordance with with
pie basically those rules are throw out
the window
okay so ultimately what do you think
this means to consumers is this going to
like raise my bills for certain things
like is my Netflix going to get more
expensive or am I going to have to pay
more for my internet service
you know the worst-case scenario I'm not
sure it will affect your your bill what
I think will happen you'll have
different various services like the idea
of that neutrality is that all Internet
traffic gets treated equally right
regardless you can't pay for better
access to a person but theoretically you
could have Netflix pain to ensure that
it's stream does really really well
whereas that next Netflix let's try to
come up this crackle or whatever like
less or no video service they're not
going to be able they won't be able to
pay where I have that that higher stream
call or higher quality stream which
means you can stick with Netflix my
argument with that though is is that
Netflix if they end up having to cough
up too much money that's going to
trickle down to the consumer yeah I mean
like that's f Acula t'v yeah it's a
possibility yeah yeah next we also
wanted to get to plague
around global it's a new startup
accelerator that's being backed by Andy
Rubin no relation but this guy is like a
really big deal in the tech world oh
yeah a lot of Android yeah father of
Android he also ran Google's robotics
division before he laughs you don't he
hit up their mood shots to fish
basically for a little while so we'll
see I mean like we don't really know too
much about playground world global at
this point our own rich Nieva got a
chance to go inside and check it out yet
we do expect some really impressive the
most interesting thing is that you know
with a lot of these storms all focusing
on on software you know this cut this
guy's really focus on hardware right
start back to physical things which is
kind of nice and really the the most
exciting thing that we're hoping to see
from him is a new phone he's right he's
a new phone from this startup or from
this accelerator so we will soon and
obviously it runs on Android but we'll
see what it looks like
well see what it looks like all right
for more of these stories chickasaw know
seen it Roger Chang I'm Ben Fox Ruben
thanks for listening so let's talk about
edgy a little bit yeah okay so what
we're arm what was Maggie's impressions
of him cuz he seems like a pretty for
lack of a better word with it kind of
guy he's pretty else he's a really nice
guy but the tricky part is right now no
matter what his perspective is he's the
enemy right well for power internet user
consumers for consumer groups for
Democrats or a lot of major tech um yeah
if you're a Republican if you're a pro
business if you're internet server
service provider if you're anti
regulations your best friend yeah if
you're yeah exactly so this is this is
really I mean like this is this is a
major Republican platform is we're
against too much government regulation
so his primary argument is is that these
net neutrality rules are based on
utilities rules let the fine men dictate
itself let the market dictate itself let
the government get out of the way and
you have to at least respect the fact
that this is a traditional government
perspective that this is this is what
voters voted for when they voted in
Donald Trump that whether you're for or
against that this is what you would
expect this is the message this is what
trickles down okay this is Donald
Trump's platform and it eat he's the one
who appointed pie so
yeah he's basically following the bad
day just like top wheeler followed
Obama's mandate when he instilled the
actual net neutrality rule Obama kind of
made the push for it right kind of kind
of forced a Tom wheelers hand and really
kind of got that going right in to be
fair to the other argument that like
everybody was like really celebrating
the concepts of net neutrality we won
Tom wheeler is you know this hero let's
look at the other side of the coin is it
possible that a Jeep I could make
reasonable arguments to say this could
somehow help consumers yeah well look
his argument is that what netted trip
with the netted Charlie laws in place
there are too onerous that they
basically choke off any kind of
investment for these these internet
surfers brush your networks not gonna
get faster it's not gonna get better
because these companies are gun shy
about vesting because of net neutrality
laws okay my immediate impression on
that is that Verizon is not hurting for
money right right that's the
counter-argument he's made arguments
about sort of the level of vestment
falling since net neutrality has to put
in place people can't dispute those
numbers the thing of it is is those
numbers you could basically you could
you could mess around and make exactly
to make any argument so I don't know
like that's it's highly debatable
whether or not his argument holds water
but you know he's sticking to the fact
that you know without these regulations
he thinks that they're gonna invest a
lot more networks number so you get a
lot better lot faster and more effective
mmm and that's the most endearing
commentary I've heard on the entire
process thus far but we chose know what
those arguments are absolutely yeah
Maggie's story does a really great job
elaborating on that the conversation
they had was seemingly uplifting if
anything yeah be low-key he stuck to his
talking points it wasn't very
controversial I think there was a line
we actually cut out from the store at
the Emery we actually asked this this
interview happened on Thursday and
Maggie actually asked you know I have a
joke a question like what if John Oliver
Donald call a Tom wheeler the previous
FCC Chairman I did go because he was
actually a member of the cable lobbyist
Association so he asked or she asked a
Jeep I like how he would react to what
he would think John Oliver would call
him and he kind of punted that question
which is why we caught it he didn't
really given any kind
but it's just it's kind of funny cuz
that John bought John Oliver goes on on
Sunday and actually makes a centerpiece
of his show everyone and actually once
again this happened three years ago when
he talked to my net neutrality he got
people to go and email FCC gov crashes
site this time around I think he did it
again on Sunday saying it's back up now
but site I they briefly crashed because
of the response that that came from John
Oliver I think that there was at least a
little bit of there was quite a bit of
surprise that wheeler was able to push
through the net neutrality rules the
first time around I don't think that it
like like they're probably going to get
thrown out right like there's what like
what are the chances that this isn't
going to happen now that the Republicans
are actually in control know this almost
you're almost assuredly going to have
those rules thrown out title two
regulations really wonky title to is
this utility style set of laws that
basically now protecting net neutrality
that will almost certainly get thrown
out what gets it put in his place is
still for debate and really what the
fears are is that it isn't just that a
child or title to that gets thrown up
like any rules get thrown out like that
pile will just destroy all regulations
and let these guys do whatever they want
right yeah and for something idea that
they could govern themselves is really
the principle that he's operator which
you know that's not always the case with
these guys right if you create another
yeah I I understand the the primary
argument for maintaining that neutrality
is like let's say like I cover Amazon if
like whatever Amazon's you know like
their competitor is going to be right if
they can't afford that those faster
pipes yep don't don't never actually you
know other pages won't even load so
Amazon's like yeah it was all like you
get Amazon instantly but jet calm like
takes five minutes alone right you'll
never go jet they'd be dead in the water
before they even got started
yeah yeah and as of right now for some
of us having the option of what service
provider you can actually get depending
on your local depending on your area is
already pretty choked yeah you get like
one or two right I've got I mean like to
realistic I have well I have a telecom
provider and I have cable provider right
so I've got either Verizon FiOS or I've
got cable visions
- but you know what they it might as
well be one because they'll kind of act
the same way right you know there's not
we need stars you should kind of has
star e done anything yet dollars don't
like pilot never will because oh come on
it's such a gradual issues with story
are so vast in terms of getting spectrum
that it's just I mean I hope they do I
hope they are hugely successful so in
case you don't know what star E is
because we wrote about it last year and
then haven't really since then is we
would be a third option of extremely
fast internet service
you would have to like put some sort of
like weird satellite object out your
window to be able to get it and it's
it's something that's still being
piloted by that what was that what did
the guy do before then what was that
thing
it was Hugh levy service he was stealing
like a beast oh crap
how do we done and sent Joseph in court
we wrote about it like a million times
what's that uh app do you remember that
TV service was I'm gonna look it up now
my court ruled was stealing from I'm
obviously who cares uh but know what I
will just say in terms of like
alternative wireless services there was
light squared there's clear wire okay
area it was area yeah it was there yeah
we did Joe that's been weird name yeah
it's a weird name I'll admit but we had
LightSquared we had clear wire we had
numbered adventures that wanted to be
like that third alternative internet
sources just work out right LightSquared
I think was like a unmitigated disaster
if I remember correctly all right let's
uh delve into the chat for a little bit
yeah Brian and Barry in the chat says if
the ISPs get to sell my data at will
then I want cheaper internet prices Oh
wouldn't that well that's yeah what
that's an entirely different issue right
now Teddy Charlie no it's not absolutely
different no it's also cut its tripping
out regulate it is but it's not part of
this particular that's channel of rules
that they've already kind of stripped
that out the privacy stuff is kind of
gone long gone no it was it was hadn't
yet gone into place right yeah they were
that they'd actually pass the rules and
they kind of
put it on pause to kind of look at it
and I'll G PI of the Republican right no
we're not going to do it no more privacy
expanding on that Matthew says agreed as
bad as net neutrality is privacy is
worse referring to the lack thereof I
assume uh has definitely more immediate
I think effect on you your personal life
like net neutrality is ultimately more
important because it's sort of this
foundational fundamental principle
governing of the Internet and whether or
not it'll actually kind of exist after
audit and PI and Republicans are done
with it it's the remains to be seen I
think also um you're not actually
getting a new it's it's not like the
government all of a sudden took away a
protection that you used to have right
you never actually had that ISP
protection in the first place they tried
to give it to you under Obama and then
when Trump got elected it just never
went into place right uh speaking of
principles svet says net neutrality is
not about the money it's about having
political control over the message on
the Internet
ooh yeah ooh that's hot stuff
yeah hypothesis yeah uh imagine soggy
says if we can get screwed over by
companies for more profit it will happen
companies are already providing faster
internet due to competition like Google
Fiber man I am loving these comments
mm-hmm boy you should all become
reporters because usually wait hot takes
you're mentally in the right place right
now until the FCC takes your site down
sure right sorry but they're but their
skepticism is warranted and SEC won't
take your site down he'll just let it
languish slowly no nice by itself right
expanding on that imagine soggy refers
back to the comment from svet he says uh
theoretically an admin could charge CNN
more than Fox News if they would if they
could
ooh yeah that would be absurd Styx and
then it's just stories gonna be a whole
nother sandbox for special interests
yeah I mean it could eventually open
Pandora's box
yeah but ultimately if they can't make
money off of it like oh that's that's
the bottom line for a lot of these guys
yeah it's not they're not pushing a
political agenda that's they're just
pushing
ever gets most viewership or makes the
most money my immediate impression so
bad reality shows and yeah which is what
we have and cats which is our reality
basic well our TV a lot of the ISPs are
really getting um like burdened by
Netflix traffic I feel like they're
gonna go after Netflix first it's like
if they do have to do like some sort of
if you want to call it a shakedown you
want to like just get them to pay more
money whatever I feel like Netflix takes
up so much space like as far as those
pipes are concerned that they might get
them well then they should friggin a
absorb that and appreciate it it's
simple supply and demand
I mean sure that makes a given to that
is like well we're spending this money
investing in our infrastructure but we
don't get we don't get to reap the
benefits of what Netflix gets right
because it looks not that they're making
money hand over fist exactly because
they've got to pay for content costs but
you know they're they're basically
riding on this internet for free right
you know I basically getting their
profits and the carriers and you know
service providers sort of want us they
want their cut too right they're
basically saying tell me if I'm right
about this like we're not the highways
we're not the railroad you know like
we're creating this private network that
now like the government is trying to
make into a public service like that's
essentially what net neutrality does
yeah yeah that's so like we're not it
like if like the government builds the
highways not ISPs or you know private
industry or whatever there's an algae
more like well we built these highways
the highways need to be maintained and
upgrade all the time that cost money
we need that that's why we need our cut
right right when you're constantly
traveling over this highway we'd we need
the tolls for to maintain the highway to
make sure there you go tolls holes holes
is always an important aspect of any net
neutrality
yeah medical get at tools so that asks
how is this different than a hacker
hijacking your account and threatening
delete to delete it all if you don't pay
their ransom okay that's probably a
little too far really different what if
the movie League is like completely
illegal and not something I would
suggest anybody uh I mean some would say
having their freedom of the freedom of
information taken away as a crime that I
mean sure but I think that's probably
taking a pretty strong argument to my
right and it is a little dramatic that
they're not killing access they're just
theoretically allowing cable companies
or phone companies to bottleneck it
bottleneck it or give priority access to
CERN bits but it's really about money
it's I don't know if it's it's political
I think it's definitely more money
driven net neutrality protects small
business a giant like Netflix can afford
to pay the ISP ransom but a smaller
company may not effectively bankrupt
them and I think that's no that's the
classic examples that Netflix can pay
for those faster highways faster access
but like the next video startup may not
do it why not be able to have the
pockets for that or what I'm running
away from this is this could potentially
be a stifling of innovation yes that's
biggest argument there for a lot of
consumer advocates that was wheelers
argument too he talked a lot about yeah
right yeah yeah exactly it's a confusing
and somewhat frightening time we I think
we've been and also the art world and
the arguments are also like both sides
have like co-opted the argument right
because the other side you know will
argue like well no if nano Charlie
actually stifles innovation because we
are not innovating on our network so
we're not getting faster but you have to
be faster to be do more things right
yeah so it that's why it's a really
confusing issue because like both sides
can make a pretty valid argument about
innovation gen and a few others are
hoping that there can be a discussion
sometime down the road about free
internet access I don't know how that
would come in also in this current
climate I don't I don't know how free
would work so until then what steps do
we need to take I was actually thinking
that perhaps we you I don't know what
you guys do after work but if you want
to get in on this this plan of mine I
was gonna start a internet speakeasy
okay with VPN access so that you can
hide from the everybody yeah it's hide
from the everybody but you have to be
careful which VPN service you use
because they can look at everything
you're doing that's true mmm we could
just be on the hook even worse that's
remote can we do one of these like
internet speakeasies just around one of
those lincoln YC hubs
so which is like the definition of an
open Wi-Fi network right oh yeah I guess
you wouldn't have the VPN aspect or um
but as far as like free internet service
at least like Manhattan in parts of
Brooklyn are already getting some
version of it there are a lot of cities
but it's not like you could just sit
there all day well I guess you could
some people have but not like your whole
internet service right you know like
have X - you've got a cubby park right
next to this you know this big kids is
this big kiosk thing but at the same
time there have been like stops and
starts of like all these different
municipalities trying to get some sort
of free Wi-Fi or free inner beauty Wi-Fi
has always been a dream for a long time
yeah and this is probably the furthest
along that it's gotten so far I don't
really know how successful or how
impactful it's been and kind of changing
consumer habits but you know if it does
well then people might actually see more
of these pakodi points out that there is
free internet access it's called free
Wi-Fi hotspots you're right however
that's like going to your high school's
library and hoping get access to
anything besides like the Yahoo front
page right and they're also it's also
super spotty like yeah you didn't do the
municipality than you would at least be
able to tell people like wouldn't that
be amazing like welcome to New York City
like Wi-Fi is everywhere yeah right they
are speed and your bandwidth you can't
even watch a YouTube video on those kind
of things like know what my tube is it
really screw it up for everybody else
right yeah here's the jerk oh it's gonna
be a weird few months anything else guys
I'm having a hard time we're late
digesting all of this because I'm
already in a miserable spot I'm not
happy with my ISP and I'm only fearing
how like this is going to progress oh
yeah whoo I love my eyes I'm afraid to
say cuz I think they might have me
killed oh please
spectrum spectrum okay somebody named I
used one out there I use cable vision I
mean like I don't have a choice I little
yeah you don't have a choice because
like you you're basically stuck with a
region-specific cable provider right I
spent last week calling around searching
around trying to find other resources
the only other thing about Verizon not
in my area right see I'm actually moving
next week to an area where they have
Verizon FiOS and
caste but you're right that the pricing
is fairly similar yeah I'm probably
gonna go with Verizon because the speeds
are a little bit better right but you
know like it's still a duopoly we have
does not force down prices as much as
you would hope they wasn't
yeah just miserable hate the Internet
Wow look I'll get you a drink man sorry
poor guy alright let's end it all that's
our day hi guys abroad every Monday
every Monday hope you enjoy your net
where you got it all right if you like
David you saw or heard here or maybe not
say so Brian check us out I see that our
podcasts also available iTunes student
