the show about do-it-yourself tech and
how T's I'm Sharon Profis and I'm Eric
Franke it is time to get back to school
and there is so much to keep track of in
the new school year that starting off on
the right track can really make all the
difference that's right you want to
optimize your experience while using
your computer we've got some tips for
you there are so many ways to set up
your new Macs but if you're just getting
started here are 5 of the most essential
settings first let's get something
really important out of the way keeping
track of your Mac if it ever falls out
of your grasp or you leave it in the
library and/or some drunken fatigue
there is an easy setting that'll let you
find out exactly where you left it it's
a good idea to enable find my Mac like
Find My iPhone the free service lets you
locate your missing Mac from any other
device by default it's disabled so to
turn it on ahead to System Preferences
then iCloud and check the box next to
find my Mac give it permission and
you're good to go
now if you ever need to find your
computer just log into iCloud on another
browser or use the app on another iOS
device once you log in a map will show
up pinpointing the last tracked location
of your Mac okay with that safeguard in
place let's enable a few small but
important features that will make
getting around your Mac a lot easier for
starters enable tap to drag go to
preferences then accessibility settings
then head over to Mouse and trackpad
then trackpad options and enable
dragging you might also want to
customize what shows up on your desktop
for instance you can put your hard drive
directly on your desktop for quick
access to do this go to the finder menu
and choose preferences then to the
general tab and use these checkboxes to
pick the items that will appear on your
top and one more setting you'll be much
more relaxed enabling battery percentage
there is no use trying to figure out how
much battery is left based on this
symbol so instead click the battery
symbol and head down to show percentage
select it and from now on you'll see
exactly how much power you have loved
now if you want to be really productive
on your Mac get to know the gestures
Apple calls the trackpad the Magic
Trackpad for a reason it can do a lot
more than just Mouse around so for
instance you can use two fingers up or
down to scroll on any page to zoom
double tap with two fingers or use the
familiar pinch to zoom to navigate swipe
left or right with two fingers and to
view all open apps swipe down with three
fingers and pinch out with your thumb
and three fingers to reveal the desktop
at any point
finally if you have spaces or full
screen apps open use three fingers to
navigate between them now that you have
those essential tips down you're one
step closer to mastering your Mac
you know I've been using Mac for like
several years now and I didn't even know
about some of those gestures there you
go
yeah all right it's time for a quick
break and when we come back we're going
to show you how to Google search like a
pro
you
welcome back the Internet is an amazing
tool for digging up information for just
about anything but how many times have
you done a search and you've gotten just
way too much irrelevant information or
just not the right thing yeah that
happens to me every single day thank you
seriously what the solution might be
advanced search filters and search
operators especially when you're
searching on Google we got some tips for
you being smart isn't just about
memorizing information it's also about
being able to find the information you
need for most of us that first point of
information retrieval is Google but not
every Google search is created equal
I'm gonna show you some advanced
features of Google search that will help
you pinpoint exactly what you're looking
for the first thing to know is that
Google actually has an advanced search
page that they kind of hide over at
google.com slash advanced underscore
search now using that you can search for
exact phrases you can define subjects
that are gonna be excluded from search
you can even filter the results by
language or region or even filter out
explicit content for example let's say
we're looking for some Star Wars fan
fiction that's written in German and
available as a PDF and doesn't mention
Jar Jar Binks and for the sake of this
video is not pornographic I'll put in
fan fiction as the general search term
and then Star Wars as a specific search
term and I'll say excluding Jar Jar and
I'm gonna filter this by the German
language turn safe search on and then
select PDF as the file type boom it's a
lot of German star wars fan fiction that
doesn't have Jar Jar Binks doing
horrible things the great thing about
searching this way is that you already
have a template for how to structure
your search it's great also if you're
looking for something pretty complicated
and you really want to be able to define
the parameters for your search now you
can perform a pretty similar search
right from the Google homepage if you
use some choice punctuation Google calls
these search operators and there's
dozens of them out there but I'm gonna
talk about the ones that are the most
useful now let's say you're looking for
a specific phrase
put in quotation marks google will
acknowledge the entire phrase instead of
each individual word for example if I
want to search for people who are
talking about the best doughnut they've
ever had I'll type the phrase this is
the best doughnut I've ever had inside
quotation marks and Google will filter
just the results to have those exact
words in that exact order I see results
here from Twitter if I want to filter
those out I can adjust the search by
adding a dash or a minus sign in front
of the word Twitter or let's say I want
my results only from Twitter I could
adjust the search by adding site colon
twitter.com and then I've only got
results with that phrase from Twitter
finally a few quick tips now Google is
not only the most famous search engine
in the world it's also a great
calculator it can even handle scientific
calculations can also handle unit
conversions if you want to know how many
Ounces are in a gallon just type it in
and you got the answer if you want to
define a word you can just type in
define colon and the word you're looking
for and for an easy way to pad your term
paper with some impressive citations you
can go to scholar.google.com and you're
gonna get a searchable index of articles
and abstracts and books all from
academic publishers so that's it that's
how to take your Google search skills up
to the next level the one I use every
single day has got to be quotations
because you can make sure that Google
gets it right quick question for you yes
how many languages do you speak I'll go
with three all right well if you're like
me you only speak one language and you
got some free time between classes
whatever it is you're doing there's an
easy and entertaining way to learn the
basics of a new language it's available
for all of your tech devices plus it's
free there are plenty of tools out there
that can help you learn a new language
but by far my favorite has to be
duolingo duolingo is a free app
available for both Android and iOS
that's effective in increasing your
vocabulary and improve your grammar in a
number of languages such as Spanish
French Italian and German so here's our
works duolingo starts you off with the
basics in this case I'm learning Spanish
and it's asking me to select a boy
it's give me
for pictures to choose from in this case
I'm gonna select the boy which is El
Nino you go and then click check and I
get a nice little chime there confirming
that I got it right and continue and in
this case is asking me to select the
girl Lani Mia there you go
what's great about this is that you can
go through the lessons multiple times
and each time the app is gonna select
different words for you to learn so you
can increase your vocabulary the more
times you go through it the other thing
you're gonna learn with duolingo is how
to translate sentences in this case it's
a very simple sentence for Nino so I
have to do is select a and then boy then
check and I'm correct very easy to do
Illume break okay this is a little bit
more complex for me so la mujer de
l'ombre a the woman and the man alright
that was a long shot for me because I'm
not very good at Spanish but I actually
got it correct
nobody so now is asking me to type in
Spanish so after remember how words are
spelled so I have to think back to the
lessons I previously learned and apply
them in this one so well nobody I can
repeat the audio Oh nobody I can even
slow it down
mmm Oh buddy I'm pretty sure I know how
to spell that
all right yeah yeah so I'm gonna
translate the girl or something to
choose la and then type in Spanish what
girl is the pretty sure it's you yeah
it's correct so the further along you go
on your lessons the more complicated
things get okay this is a little bit
more complex here so now I have to
select the missing word ah it's mujer is
a feminine word so I have to select the
feminine version of ah basically pretty
sure it's not and correct
El Nino La Nina okay in this case it's
going to test my pronunciation of
Spanish which honestly isn't that good
but i'ma try it anyway so I'm gonna tap
to start recording
El Nino La Nina yeah yeah I got it it's
pretty close alright alright cool
you know the last few months I've
learned a lot using duolingo but you
know I'm not fluent in a new language
but that's really not what these apps
are about but they are is a really fun
and entertaining way to help you learn a
new language yeah call me muy bueno
ah yeah that's it for this week's show
