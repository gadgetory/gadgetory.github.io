the best color reproduction possible
typically you would buy a plasma over an
LCD but Sony's newest TV may be an
attractive option I'm Ty Pendlebury from
cnet.com and this is sony's w 900 LCD
this television features a new
technology known as quantum dots or in
Sony's words
triluminos which enhances the pictures
color gamut in the sony's case this is a
thin film that sits over the backlight
and the theory is that when the picture
calls for it this is able to reproduce
more of the colors that are in the
actual source but does it work in my
testing yes it does the colors the w900
producers seem very close to that which
the panasonic st 60 plasma can do but
the downside is that you'll pay for it
the sony is twice the price of the
panasonic and the black levels aren't
quite as good the w900 isn't even as
good as last year's sony HX 8 50 for
contrast but it's better in color so you
win some and you lose some as far as
design the sony does look very elegant
it has a thin blue green strip and a
barstool type stand but it does have
this odd cigarette case logo which looks
removable but it isn't apart from
triluminos you do get more features such
as active 3d a Bluetooth remote 4 HDMI
ports and there are multiple ways to
connect the content on your mobile phone
to the television itself while this is
Sony's best 1080p set for 2013 it's hard
not to be a little disappointed for
while better color is nice a lighter
black level over last year is a step
backwards if I was buying a TV right now
I'd still buy the panasonic st 60 or pay
a bit more for the VT 60 this has been
