few days away so this is really for all
of you who need to know every rumor
every detail just everything that we've
heard about going into Apple's new
MacBook Pro and Mac key notes coming up
on October the 27th this could be one of
those keynotes where we really see a few
surprises because we really don't know
exactly what's coming we do know that
the MacBook Pros they haven't seen a
significant design change in over four
years so that is one thing we know and
out of anything it's the Mac books that
we have the most information about we're
expecting to see a revamp 13-inch &amp;amp;
15-inch MacBook Pros we expect a thinner
design there are rumors that we'll also
have a dedicated touch ID sensor and
they'll include USB C ports and
Thunderbolt 3 as well now I don't know
how you guys feel about this but reports
say that Apple will be ditching their
MagSafe tech you know just the biggest
innovation in power cabling that they've
ever come up with that doesn't sound
good to me but the biggest change that
we expect to see is the all-new oled
touch bar this oled touch bar will be
above the keyboard it pretty much
replaces that row of function keys and
it will be able to adapt and change
depending on the app you use so if
you're using Safari or you're using a
media player the buttons on top will
morph and change to that bloomberg says
Apple is calling this internally the
dynamic function row but that name may
change and also we might see the Polaris
AMD chip expected to come in the
higher-end 15-inch models now let's talk
MacBook Airs and Mac o to car reports
that Apple is going to discontinue
entirely the MacBook Air 11 inch model
but they still expect to keep the 13
inch model in play one of the new
changes and tweaks that we expect to see
is that the MacBook Air 13-inch will now
also come with USB sea ports instead of
the standard USB they used in the past
and Apple's ultra-thin MacBook 12-inch
will still remain in the lineup that
one's really a keeper but if there's
really one thing that I want to see at
this announcement that no one's really
talking about bring back the black
MacBook it doesn't have to be that crazy
shiny jet-black finish on the iPhone but
for those of you that want to go
old-school
I'm telling you bring back the black
MacBook now we haven't really heard any
major news in regards to updates for
other Mac's there has been one nugget
about new iMacs possibly coming with AMD
graphics chips for the new models but if
you talk about the Mac Pro that hasn't
been updated for three years then you
talk about the Mac Mini that hasn't been
updated for two years so well
just have to wait and see if Apple does
anything with those models and for all
of you who have just been asking me when
is Apple going to bring out a brand new
Apple display
well bloomberg reports that Apple and LG
are working together to create a 5k
display that can connect to some of its
computers again this information is very
early so if we see at the keynote this
is the time to show it off Apple's new
Mac keynote happens on Thursday October
the 27th that's at 10 a.m. Pacific time
it will be held on Apple's campus in
Cupertino but that's pretty much
everything we've heard about Apple's new
MacBooks and new Macs before their
official announcement</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
