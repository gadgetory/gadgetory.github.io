distant object ever explored in the
solar system no it's not sure cold and
emotionally standoffish stepmother we're
going to the Kuiper belt but just like
dinner at your stepmothers house it's
volatile frosty and it takes way too
long to get there I'm Claire Railly
welcome to watch this space on the scene
at studios in Sydney this is your weekly
guide to everything on earth you need to
know about space and tonight fuss in
your carpet belts we're going on a ride
that's right on January 1 to celebrate
New Year's Day and NASA is taking us on
a journey to the farthest reaches of the
solar system you just wanted to stay on
the couch and deal with that post New
Year's Eve headache oh my sweet summer
child nASA has other plans
when it came to filling out goals in its
dream journal this year NASA wasn't
interested in starting that new yoga
class it's big new year's resolution was
to travel billions of miles through
space to explore a trans-neptunian
object in the Kuiper belt with the New
Horizons mission that's right New
Horizons no it's not a multi-level
marketing scheme or a New Age cult
though let's not lie those two are often
the same thing it's NASA's combined
effort with the Johns Hopkins Applied
Physics Laboratory to explore further
out in the solar system that we've ever
explored it's worth noting this isn't
the farthest we've ever traveled the
Voyager probes which launched in 1977
passed through the Kuiper belt in the
90s the only problem was we didn't
actually know about the Kuiper belt
until 1992 by that time nASA says
Voyager 2 was deep within the region and
Voyager 1 had almost left it this time
with New Horizons were taking a really
good look but before we do that we need
to make like a 90s fashion magazine and
get back to basics
belt basics the Kuiper belt is a ring of
icy space object out past Neptune's
orbit starting about 30 astronomical
units away from the Sun to give you an
idea that's 30 times the distance
between the Sun and Earth it's where I
store fan noted planet impostor Pluto
hangs out when it's not climbing onto
Neptune's shoulders under a trenchcoat
and trying to get into the planet club
speaking of Pluto New Horizons was the
space probe that did the first ever
flyby past Pluto back in 2015 it brought
us phenomenal images of the former ninth
planet showing scientists the planets
in intricate detail and giving
deviantART users an excuse to make more
terrible space themed wallpapers but the
space probe isn't done yet in the words
of aqua we're just getting started
shortly after its Pluto flyby NASA chose
the next target for New Horizons to
check out a relatively small space rock
known as 2014 mu 69 because 2014 mu 69
sounds like a terrible combination of a
vanity license plate and the worst
tinder message you've ever received NASA
decided to open a public vote to choose
a nickname and somehow avoiding the
pitfalls of public voting contests I'm
looking at you boaty mcboatface they
chose the name Ultima Thule in March
2018 she was great in Kill Bill Ultima
Thule is named after the island of thule
the mythological land on the edge of the
earth in classical myth and cartography
that's right don't let anyone tell you
that watch this space doesn't give you
sweet cartography knowledge but even
though it has a name we still don't know
much about Ultima Thule it's a Kuiper
belt object or KBO that was discovered
by the Hubble Space Telescope in June
2014 it's about a hundred times smaller
than Pluto and it leaves about a billion
miles beyond Pluto or roughly 46
astronomical units from the Sun at its
furthest point and based on observations
made by NASA's new Horizons team mu 69
could actually be two objects plot twist
but NASA wants to know more based on its
calculations NASA reckons Ultimo was
formed 4.5 or 4.6 billion years ago four
billion miles from the Sun and it's been
sitting there in temperatures close to
absolute zero
ever since that's the equivalent of
these seven pounds of cryovac tan that
you bought in bulk at Costco to throw in
the freezer and eat next Christmas NASA
reckons that Ultima or the space ham
could be the best possible sample of the
ancient solar nebula
that's the nebula that birthed our solar
system that we've ever studied New
Horizons will fly three times closer to
Altima than it flew to Pluto in 2015
scientists hope it will tell us about
the composition of Ultima whether it has
an atmosphere and even whether it has
its own moons to do all that New
Horizons is packed with a bunch of
instruments there's Ralph's which
measures visible and infrared light
Alice for ultraviolet imaging and Rex or
the radio science
which will measure atmospheric
composition there's also a telescopic
camera and instruments to measure space
dust and solar wind and of course my
favorite the pluto energetic particle
spectrometer science investigation or
Pepsi which measured plasma escaping
from Pluto New Horizons tastes the
science so there you have it On January
1 while you're washing the confetti off
your face and cleaning the cocktail
umbrellas out of your hair
NASA's new Horizons will be playing
designated Dave and driving humankind
further into the realms of scientific
discovery no need for champagne this New
Year's NASA is happy with Pepsi all
right that's it for this week's edition

news as it happens I'm Claire Reilly for
Cena goodnight and Godspeed
that's a theater warm-up that I learned
from a movie about a cult hey babe 2014
M u69 Kuiper belt hangout Thursday space
is where I'd like you to be I don't know
what people don't want in done I think
and space what's the space where you
come for cartography jokes and topical
hand humor</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
