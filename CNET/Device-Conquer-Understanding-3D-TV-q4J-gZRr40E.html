the next big thing you're not going to
use and along the way to that decision
lies a whole lot of demystification that
has to take place so let's do that and
get some perspective on 3d
there are three things you've got to
think of tangibly when you consider 3d
TV first of course is the television
second the glasses and third content you
need something to watch the first one is
the one that costs the most and looms
the largest that is the TV I've got some
interesting news for you on that front
there's no such thing as a 3d TV not
strictly speaking all 3d TVs are
actually really good 2d TVs that have an
additional ability they can show 3d when
hooked up to a 3d source that's
typically either a 3d compatible blu-ray
deck or a 3d channel on television
usually on cable or satellite or even a
full screen high-def 3d stream over the
internet now if this story is starting
to seem relatively simple you haven't
met the glasses yet active shutter
glasses like these basically have a
little active LCD screen over each eye
these darken to prevent an image from
reaching your I therefore you can
alternate left and right they run from
twenty bucks the very least all the way
up to one hundred and twenty dollars in
some cases now these are passive glasses
no electronics no battery is no wireless
sync no LCD screens in front of your
eyes they use polarizing lenses like on
a pair of sunglasses to discriminate
left and right information to each eye
so it sounds like a no-brainer to go
passive right but it's not that simple
active glasses still offer the best
image quality we think they're available
with LCD and plasma 3d TVs but they can
be kind of pricey and are typically
proprietary the passive glasses show a
few image issues from time to time are
only available with LCD sets but they're
really cheap and universal they should
even work on your neighbors 3d TV well
there's something else you may not have
thought of when it comes to 3d TV when
you have the glasses on of either
technology it gets a little difficult to
use mobile devices partly because of
what the glasses are doing partly
because of the focal length your eyes
are adjusting to while watching the
screen but I would also say that if you
feel the urge to check email or Facebook
while you're watching a 3d movie you
chose the wrong movie also four to ten
percent of people can't perceive the 3d
depth on a 3d television and some number
may report headaches or nausea off
because of how the film was shot or
edited now you've also heard I'm sure
about glasses-free 3d TV we saw this at
the Consumer Electronic Show top of 2012
but the technology is not really mature
yet and the prices certainly don't make
it attainable just yet okay so you get
your new 3d TV home and you're all
excited about it for a few minutes then
you need something good to watch that's
what it's really all about there are two
considerations you have to have their
first of all what is there to watch that
you like most of us our minds go right
away to blockbuster films in 3d either
animated or live action and a
combination of animation right now on
amazon there are maybe 224 blu-ray 3d
discs so the 3d blu-ray pool is really
small now shop for a 3d TV was these
three key criteria in mind first of all
a 3d TV is not a special kind of TV it's
a feature on a really good to DTV
secondly there are glasses involved
active or passive they've got different
benefits and drawbacks and glasses-free
not ready for primetime yet finally
think about content what's your source
going to be and how much is there to
watch now or in the foreseeable future
now none of this means your next TV
won't have 3d ability it probably will
but whether and how much you use that
depends on what kinds of television you
like to watch and your comfort level
with this technology
