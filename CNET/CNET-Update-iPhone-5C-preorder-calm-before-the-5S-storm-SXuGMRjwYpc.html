ready for the lines I'm Bridget Carey
and this is your CNET update this is not
a typical iPhone launch here we have two
types of new iPhones each with a
different set of colors and only one of
these models the cheaper plastic iPhone
5c was available for pre-order now with
previous years if you wanted to
pre-order online and get it delivered to
you on launch day you had to act fast
the initial pre-order stock of last
year's iPhone 5 sold out in less than an
hour but that wasn't the case for these
colorful five sees on Friday afternoon
several hours after pre-orders opened up
it was still easy to order a 5c and get
it in hand on launch day September 20th
maybe Apple had more stock of the
plastic ones this time or maybe it's
just not in high of a demand the first
model to sell out was the unlocked no
sim card yellow model which had just a 5
day shipping delay but there were no
online pre-orders for the high-end
iPhone 5s Apple is making folks stand in
line at stores for this one here's a
little tip instead of waiting in long
lines at a crowded Apple Store it could
be quicker to just go directly to your
local carrier store it's the first time
a new iPhone is launching at all for
major US carriers so there are more
places to pick one up of course Apple
stores will likely have the largest
supply Gould is going to be the hot
color to get and who's to say how many
gold color 5s phones each carrier will
have in stock if you care about the
color that's going to be another stress
because maybe there are only a few
Gold's compared to the gray or silver so
now people will be running and calling
around to stores like Best Buy
RadioShack and Target just to hunt for a
specific color this could become the
most annoying iPhone launch year ever if
you don't mind waiting a few days to get
your hands on it customers can order a
5s online on launch day Friday September
20th at 12:01 a.m. Pacific 3 a.m.
Eastern and you can expect other phones
to come and gold in the future because
of this an image was just posted online
from China that's said to be a new HTC
one with a gold finish
HTC One comes in a few different shades
already including red at Sprint and blue
at Best Buy but gold would be more in
style than any other color at least some
fashion designers think so the gold
iPhone 5s is being featured with models
down the runway at a Burberry Fashion
Show in London but it's not the only
trendy tech the Samsung Galaxy gear
SmartWatch and Galaxy Note 3 have custom
jewelry and accessories that were shown
off at New York's Fashion Week but no
Google glass it was so last year no
really that was that last year's Fashion
Week
that's your tech news update but you can
