oh yeah kind of just want to listen to
that song a little bit like the
background Eve is it going in the
background welcome to a very special
Yuletide episode of the 404 program
where we celebrate the big lebowski i'm
jeff beck alone I'm Justin you I'm spear
I mariela nunez and this is the show
where we're gutter ball we're all gutter
ball gutter program today what better
person to come in and just geeked out
with us about the film The Big Lebowski
than Steve sphere Guttenberg that's it
he's the dude and on the spear so so
before we even get into it you have a
very personal reason personal set of
circumstances that gave you the luxury
of watching this movie over and over and
over and over what happened yes I was a
movie theater projections I knew nothing
about the movie before you know came in
yeah i don't think i read a review right
you sure you didn't even know about this
movie no I just you know was just on the
schedule and I ran it okay brand new and
it didn't do that well you know it took
a while for it to catch on bread I just
kept watching it and I can think it's so
funny I would stand and then when it
started to get a little popular I would
stand in the back of the theater and
watch audiences watch the movie yeah it
was just so did you like it immediately
when you first saw it I didn't grow
because it's just that it's the right
kind of weird yeah you know it's it's
surreal but it doesn't get so out there
that you just just get lost or silly
it's the weirdness is focused on him you
know it all fits within his care what is
it about this movie and I agree with you
the weirdness is perfect what is it
about this movie that it just transcends
every other sort of relationship and
it's so pervasive to like I mean it's no
secret they have these Lebowski Fest
sand all these big parties a couple
times a year what is it about this movie
that just has a cult following like I
don't think there's a feel even you can
make the argument I co star wars on it
but it's different there's something
about lebowski that's just in its own
universe that is so accessible so many
people love this film maybe because he
because you could imagine he people I
guess some part of them want to be the
dude you r everyone you couldn't be
those other people really bright but
it's such a low aspiration yes you you
could but he just imagines gets by and
he loves his life right he's poor they
never say how he makes money either it's
always a mystery right he's just you
have a job sir yeah he's like I'm in
between stuff or what does he say I
don't remember anybody you know like he
just uses coasting he's just coasting
and he's like in his forties yeah and
he's just smoking a lot of parties
bowling only and he's just living the
dream yeah while the rest of the world
is in conflict yeah during this does the
woman struggling about money and just
and he's just just trying to get by you
know doing the things that dude does
yeah and there's something about that
that you're right that everyone was
almost jealous of yeah you know when
they when they saw this movie including
the other the real def Lebowski which
now i don't mean the real real jump with
the rich Lebowski right money right so I
mean I don't want to get obviously you
know reiterate the plot to the film
because if you're listening to this and
you don't know we're talking about
borean lost no wasting your time of it
but I mean I mean you look at the the
cast to and I think for its time don't
forget a lot of people in this film
maybe perhaps had not exploded into Fame
before those it Jeff Bridges was
certainly the most famed chef bridge is
obviously pretty famous but even people
like philip seymour hoffman no no that
was first time I was ever where you know
a john goodman was pretty obviously john
goodman people like tara reid not a no
tara reid was before this may be there
was American people shine that was it
actually only famous because he was in
other coen brothers movie Brea exactly
there's something there there's just
something about it you said before it's
like it's not the perfect movie but man
it just folds up kind of clothes and
even when you say those lines out of
context yeah honey for sure don't forget
fleas in this movie too he don't
Annihilus yeah um I feel like so and
then don't forget Jesus the Jesus the
Jesus mr. John Turturro comes his
bowling balls
I mean and you know it's funny it's like
uh you know bowling was is this when the
first time bowling was in a movie you
know there's a lot of films at bowling
right but it was something about this
that that just made it better I don't
know the make you know what sweet basil
a mirage busy real depth to it first of
all it's extremely well written like a
wasted line in it it's for sure readily
tight but I guess if you're really into
bowling you know there's that shot where
the cameras inside the bowling ball
right and as it's going down the lane
you see what I rounded there what do
they do there and it's like they read
and then there's even scenes of those
machines that are putting the pins yak
in place everything's I'm calling this
is like a religious experience there's a
lot of trivia associated with the film
as well and we'll get into some of those
little sort of easter eggs uh in a
little bit oh and I'd start point out
that if you're a fan of the movie you
may not know this the jeff bridges is a
pretty serious photographer yeah and he
has a lot of pictures that he shot on
the set that show you a completely
different perspective of be seen so
that's really very cool so that's pretty
cool I in you said it might be on his
website i don't i don't know but he has
a book a jeff bridges photography book
and then your pictures of the movie
there there's like weird stats about
this movie the word dude is used 161
times yeah 160 spoken once in text
credits the f word or variation of the f
word is used 292 times which one you
really think about that is excessive
well as Sam Elliott points out you have
to custom yeah exactly the dude says the
word man 147 times maybe nearly one and
a half times a minute okay so he's not
and he's not on on-camera the entire
time uh the dude has a habit of
repeating phrases he hear from other
characters this aggression will not
stand yeah dude does not bide again
trophy wife trophy wife I'm going by
cash machine in the parlance of our
times yeah very very good stuff man oh
man obviously he
uh the character reinvigorated the White
Russian and obviously which is served at
all many times how many thing how many
White Russians is janna he probably has
like 11 and in that movie uh and the
other thing is it's so surreal he's
constantly getting beaten up oh he gets
an honor like four times yeah but I mean
just physically abused in various ways
and yet he's perfectly fine there's
never a mark on him um I feel a lot of
people uh think uh Philip Seymour
Hoffman is the best character I don't
know film as no I wonder subject is y
absolute yeah I actually has the best
lines actually does shomer Shabbos I
sure should don't roll on shabbos I mean
it doesn't get any better I've tried to
show this movie to my parents wait wait
this isn't nam they were rule yeah I try
to show this movie to my parents they
snickered a few times there's something
about I don't know what it is but what I
was I felt this like sense of depression
and and you know failure to achieve
something when they were like oh this
this is it I mean I don't know there's
something really upsetting about that I
can feel your pain you know you know
what I mean I don't know why we couldn't
make that happen but anyway it's not for
everyone it's not for but that's the
thing but I feel like it is I question
people who don't get it though right and
that's in some it's almost like a sniff
test like if you're not a fan of this
movie right you're a narc you know
there's something wrong there like
you're you you you know you're them you
work for the man if you're not a fan of
this movie for sure what uh what else i
know i know you have a bunch and I said
oh yeah that I'm so happy there was
never a sequel yeah yeah or any other
thing just let it be it's perfect the
way it is it's it's close to perfection
as a movie as I and I probably watched
him more than any other there were
rumors a couple years ago that they were
in fact doing it I hope they don't and
yeah I don't think anything ever came to
fruition but it's something that you
know you sort of want to hold on to
forever and it's I don't think it's one
of those movies that could ever be
redone or attempted to be read analysis
it's perfection yeah they kind of broke
the mold at after this one well what
other note I know you you know that was
the only you may notice that you had
about it I know you wanted to talk about
the gutter ball scene again i cant
rember that was the first time or the
second time he gets knocked out him
sequin think it's the second time yeah
so there are these sequences within the
movie that are totally surreal uh-huh
that's sort of a reactor or what happens
when he's knocked out and he has his
fantasies and they're amazing let's uh
let's watch that little some of that
real quick this is the second time it
gets knocked out it's pretty it's like a
music video within yeah
you're not gonna find a better
soundtrack either yeah great now this
song is perfect story oh the dude I
don't that like it's all right it's like
how did they it just feels like this
masterpiece yeah and I remember this
came with this came out in march of 1998
and was I was like 16 men when it came
out first time I saw it I didn't I
enjoyed it but for me personally this is
one of those films that like the second
time you see it yeah something sparks
open and you're like oh my god you know
it unlocks something in you that you're
like all right this is this is one of
the best ever this is a guy an actor who
looks like Saddam Hussein yeah because
the movie takes place during the first
war with Iraq right and the weird thing
is starting in like two thousand one win
with there was the second war with Iraq
and you watch this movie it felt like it
was happening in the present yeah it was
really fenestration the moot the show
that they're obsessed with Branson
musical uh when they go to they go to
that kid who stole the suit with his
father's in the maghreb would get what
the hell is that whole situation it's
just a fake I think it's a fake there's
it's so weird because everything else is
sort of like based off reality you know
in that movie and then that sort of
thing comes in you're like man what is
it about that you know the whole movie
feels like one big dream sequence yeah
it is it always feels like you're kind
of drifting in and out of consciousness
like I great dude yeah for sure exactly
so really weird fun facts the 69 sent
check that the dude right in the su
bracket listen to this now I don't have
a hundred percent confirmation on this
the check he writes at ralphs for the
milk is dated September 11th 1991 which
is ten years before nine eleven oh yeah
he's while he's writing the check george
bush can be heard on the telephone on
the television behind him rallying and
railing against Saddam Hussein I've had
something kind of interesting about this
scene I guess the
actors and the director in the scene
played a prank on jeff bridges and they
all all the girls actually had wigs on
underneath skirts and so no one else
knew that but I mean everyone knew that
but Jeff and so that's why he has his
puzzled look on his face when he
eventually turns over and sees the mops
as good they want to go bowling now yeah
yeah there's something about I don't
know what it is I just needed to bowl
after I saw I liked that little bit of
the guy spraying the shoes the bowling
yeah for sure every little detail it's
like everything has has been thought
through yeah there's no wasted shot
there's no way such as is never a lot of
dialogue that's wasted every single
character even from Lebowski landlord
yeah who does that interpretive play
they all go and watch where he's like
some you know peacock or something like
that it's never a wasted moment yeah um
I know is it's tough to be put on the
spot and even try and name a favorite
scene but do you have a favorite scene
in The Big Lebowski you know that that's
seen near the end where they spread the
Donny's ashes yeah so because it's sort
of like bringing you down at the end of
the movie right and then the ashes like
fly in there because they're standing in
the wrong direction the wind blows
pretty good what Justin do you have a
favorite I think it was the the parking
lot you know the bowling parking lot
scene where Donnie spoiler alert guys he
gets shot here's a shot he has a heart
yeah as our that yeah yeah I think I
really really like that it seems like a
turning point in the movie what was her
song playing not too i don't remember i
remember but i really liked that 1a yeah
that's also when you get to see the
Nilus really come out absolutely got was
really good i think all of his home
invasions are really really good because
he gets to the point where he just
doesn't care anymore he doesn't care
that three grown-ass men yeah broken
into his blazing and they just he
doesn't care he doesn't care the scene
he has in the front of the fireplace
with the real Lebowski uh-huh with Jeff
real about the other
asking where he has this monologue about
you know uh you know grown men do I like
stuff like that I think that's really
really brilliant stuff and I also really
like the the scenes where he he's
talking with Maude I feel like people
kind of overlook that yeah and you know
he he's just you know being himself when
he's in her studio and he's just sort of
like picking around at all her crap
there yeah and drinking a white he's
just drinking a White Russian trying not
to you know he it's funny because he's
kind of having fun with her because
she's talking about how her art is very
vaginal right is like most men have the
proper problem of even hearing the word
vaginal vagina hey now and he's just
like yeah you do your thing man I'm
doing my thing cool that's what it is it
not man it's tough and I do you think
that Jeff Bridges has ever really been
able to escape the dude no he is the
dude but that movie from a few years ago
where he's the country musician yeah
that kind of felt like a reprise what
was that called well yeah he said
playing guitar the old yeah looks like
he's a washed-up one-hit wonder yeah he
kind of has a that drawl yeah um nice
marmot is uh is what is one of Steve's
favorite and I'm eight when they take
the ferret and put it into the bathtub
with them yet you don't see my like is
when he's flipping through all the
records and he comes across that cropped
work rip off album i buy that band auto
bondo that's denial yet as analysis the
banner but that album cover looks
exactly like croft work like a Croft
work album cover and I'm still
wearing the red shirts and the ties and
everything it's on it's perfect for that
German techno genre it's it's funny one
of those dudes from Autobahn so
obviously flea from Red Hot Chili
Peppers out of them and then the other
guy is it is an actor who probably is
most recognizable for his work with with
Volkswagen yeah a creepy like fall saw
that guy you know I'm talking about swag
is kinda middle he was also in
uh arm again yes he's the Russian
cosmonaut yeah that's been left at the
International Space the thruster is he
yeah thrust it's pretty good anyway
anyone have any closing remarks with the
big lebowski we can nerd out on this
film for ages drink a White Russian and
watch it you have you had a why Russia
you haven't I like a lot I've had one
it's not that bad it's not that at all
you know it's kind of tasty it sounds
like a dessert is urging yeah it's milk
right it's when I'm spying for the 69
exactly exactly um yeah it's uh
definitely one of our faves I'm
surprised we haven't even done this yet
yeah cuz this is definitely a film that
everyone cannot can get on me i was
saying area before the Coen brothers
don't really repeat themselves yeah they
make their movies are all pretty
different from me for sure that's uh
that's definitely an amazing feat by
them I don't think I think when they
were making this movie though I know
hindsight's twenty-twenty but there's no
way that they ever could have imagined
what they had on their hands their f1
think of like the amount of cultism and
what happened with this movie there's no
way anybody could forecast what was
gonna happen I mean when you look at the
box office it didn't do well round the
box off yeah it actually I mean by
today's standards are you up no it did
not do well and it's a and you could
never trace it back but it's like how
where did this start happening you know
like how did it start happening where
came went from this flop that only made
five million dollars its opening weekend
and you know eventually went on to be
this amazingly successful coach just
word of mouth thing yeah and maybe you
really have to sort of be you know
intoxicated we watching and you could do
that more eat more easily at home yeah I
guess given the mood I guess I guess I
think it I think the universal appeal is
just that people relate to him yeah
there's some some part of a lot of
people that want to be gentle house um
actually we were saying we were saying
before that you know
dude is not he you know he said man a
hundred and whatever many times and I
said well it's because he's not in every
scene believe it or not he is in every
scene in the movie that well at least
that's what this trivia says yeah
there's even in the scene where the
nihilists are ordering pancakes you can
see the van in which the dude and Walter
are driving this is keeping with the
traditional film noir in which the
protagonist is the narrator and acts as
the audience guide throughout the film I
didn't know that everything every scene
yeah read somewhere that uh this is the
only movie that Jeff Bridges is made
where he has to watch the entire thing
if it just comes on as televisions and I
feel the same way about that there's
very few movies then engage you
constantly like what you're saying is
never a dull scene in that movie every
time it comes on you kind of just like
well i guess i'm watching the big
lebowski now no matter where you are in
the movie and it in it doesn't you know
get weaker yeah just it's funny it gets
funnier and it gets even more meta you
know I mean because you know like I how
many times I've called people carpet
pissers no reason there's like all I'm
is carpet busy right now um John
Goodman's admitted it's his favorite
film um jun uh Julianne Moore has said
this is one of her favorite films that
she's ever worked on it's crazy and
believe it or not um John Turturro was
only on set for like three days cuz he
shot his stuff real quick um but he he
you know the the scope of the film he is
such an integral part of it and even
being only on set for a few days it's uh
it's pretty pretty awesome gotta be an
infinite gift online of him washing his
bowling ball yeah right that's got
existent what are those knees tonguing
that too yeah it's uh it's pretty it's
pretty great stuff if you have a comment
