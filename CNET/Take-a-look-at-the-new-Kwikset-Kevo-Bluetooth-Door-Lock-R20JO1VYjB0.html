with the quick-set kevo smartlock now
I've got a lot of new smart locks coming
out this year and this is the first one
to hit the market and it's a really
exciting product the key bows got
Bluetooth built right into it so it can
detect the presence of your phone that
means if your phones in your pocket and
you tap on the lock it'll automatically
unlock that's really cool also a key fob
you can use if you don't have a
compatible smartphone we've seen a lot
of smart locks that offer smart phone
controls and that have apps and
different ways of controlling it with
home automation systems this is the
first one you can just touch and it
opens up and lets you inside I'll be
totally honest I was a little bit
skeptical of this product because I
didn't know how it would work in terms
of being outside or inside the door it's
a you leave your phone on a table just
inside the door and it's within range of
the lock theoretically if someone walked
up and tapped in the lock it would
detect the phone and think that that
person was you and let them in that's a
big safety hazard kind of a fatal flaw
but quick-set has solved this problem
they have a really good system that
calibrates the phone calibrates the key
fob if you're using that and it can tell
if you're inside or outside it works we
tested it out again and again that lock
never failed us if the phone was ever
inside or even close to inside there was
ever any doubt the lock wouldn't let you
in if you look at this lock maybe the
first thing you'll notice about it is
that it's not that noticeable it's a
pretty boring looking lock it doesn't
say kevo on it it doesn't have any cool
design it looks like a basic quick-set
deadbolt and I love that frankly I think
that's a really wise move this is on the
outside of your house this is bolted to
your door it looked really fancy and
expensive I think that might invite
someone to come up in the middle of
night and rip it off it only looks like
a smart device when you come up close
and tap on it these blue lights will
spin around telling you that it's
thinking about whether or not to let you
in and then it will turn green if it's
unlocked or yellow if it's locked
it's really simple and it just works
it's easy and effortless and elegant you
can rekey it using a little tool they
include so if you wanted to adapt it to
an existing key you can do that without
having to call a locksmith as for the
kibo app it works fine it looks really
nice a little bit easy to get lost in it
and it's not really clear exactly where
everything is located I'm sure you get
used to it as you use it but
you don't need to use it you don't need
to open the app to unlock the door you
just really need the app to set your
lock up and to calibrate the app has a
few other limitations as well
you can't remotely lock and unlock the
door like some other smart locks will
let you do and you also can't send
temporary e keys out and you know these
are keys that would only work for a
certain time of day or that would expire
on a certain date automatically one
other thing to be aware of at the kevo
is that it comes with the phone
authorization for you and one ikki to
give to someone else but after that each
e key is going to cost one dollar and 99
cents which is about the same price as
getting a key made sure but there's no
part through labor here there's no
manufacturing it's just that they can
charge you for because they can another
thing that kind of bug me is that when
you use the lock when you tap on it your
phone will buzz and it will make the
same noises when you get a new email
message I like the buzz I like knowing
that the phone is responding to the lock
but that sound I wish I could have
another option maybe a unique sound or
maybe this turn the sound off altogether
right now you can't do that
now to me the big problem with the kevo
the one ding I can really give it is
that it's not compatible with a whole
lot of devices it's only compatible with
iPhones and iPads and other iOS devices
that have Bluetooth 4.0 Hardware built
into them you can still use it if you're
one of those users you just need to use
the included key fob keep in mind though
the Bluetooth 4.0 might expand to
Android devices in the very near future
and if that happens quicks that's going
to jump on that and make sure that the
lock is compatible with your phone
all in all the kevo left me very
impressed it comes out on Halloween and
I think at a price of $219 it should
make a very good holiday gift item this
season again if you're an Android user
probably a bit depressed watching this
but hang in there I think the 24.0 is
coming your way soon we've seen that I'm
right Chris
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
