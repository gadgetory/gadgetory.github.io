the consumer electronics show the show
floor is ready to greet more than
150,000 attendees today but we got a
sneak peek at some of the hottest
products already at several press
conferences and you know what that means
it's time to get loaded at the end of an
otherwise dull press conference for
Panasonic justin timberlake took the
stage to show he's thinking outside the
box so to speak Timberlake announced get
this myspace TV Timberlake is bringing
myspace back but the social network will
be revamped to work with Panasonic
Stevie's so that members can interact
with and discuss what they are watching
can't say any of us saw that coming
yesterday hopping right along satellite
service Dish Network broke a record
yesterday as the first CES presenter to
bring a live kangaroo on the stage the
adorable stunt was to promote a new
product line of multi room digital video
recorder in high-speed broadband the
hopper is the name of its main tuner
with two terabytes of memory that can
record up to six shows at once it can
record all of prime time on the four
major networks for eight days and
devices called Joey's will connect to
other room televisions to the system the
pricing starts at 7995 a month and is
planned to start this summer and what's
Vegas without a good fight this CES will
be the battle of the 55-inch Oh LED
televisions LG and Samsung both had TVs
on the show floor with the new screen
technology there's no pricing yet but
you can expect it to be around eight
thousand dollars toshiba also has his
own showcase a 3d television that
doesn't require glasses the sensors are
able to follow where the viewer is
sitting and adjust the 3d focus for that
angle and is it a really large phone or
a tablet or a new hybrid category
Samsung is showing off its newest
creation the Galaxy Note it's a 5.3 inch
screen smartphone with a stylus it's big
enough to comfortably browse the web
into work but maybe will feel a little
big if you want to make your phone call
it has a 2-megapixel front-facing camera
an 8 megapixel camera on the back and a
larger battery to help support that
large power-hungry screen and Microsoft
is saying so long

night without much news unveiled but
Ryan Seacrest was brought on to be a
moderator microsoft said it would bring
the xbox 360 accessory the connect to
windows on februari first and that it
sold 18 million units of the motion
sensor device Ballmer also showcased how
kids can interact with Sesame Street
characters using the Kinect it's the
last time Microsoft will be presenting
at the show after 15 years baumler said
the company just doesn't time the
releases of their products around the
show and they'll be better suited doing
their own announcements those are your
headlines for today I'm Bridget Carey
