here with nokia CEO stephen elop Steven
you've got some nice to see you've got
something to show us we do you know 18
months ago we started on this journey of
changing our smartphone strategy with
our partnership with Microsoft you've
seen some big steps along the way and
today is another another big step we're
introducing what we believe to be the
world's most innovative smart phone the
nokia lumia 920 and its mid-range
partner the Nokia Lumia 820 so very
excited about those announcements today
all right well tell me a little bit
about why they're the world's most
innovative phone so a few things that
really really shine on these devices
first of all they are the best devices
to capture photos and images we have
built into the Lumia 920 floating lens
technology that allows you to take
pictures even as your hand may be
shaking a little bit now why is that
important because in very low light
conditions you can take beautiful images
and we looked at some of those just just
before we started here some amazing
low-light capabilities and also if
you're taking a picture in your hand is
moving or on a bicycle which happens to
a lot of us beautiful pictures come out
of it now to support those pictures
obviously a beautiful wxga display
technology that even allows you to
scroll in everything with a fingernail
with your glove or whatever the case may
be it shows up beautifully in bright
sunlight conditions so that's that's a
one principle focus of what we're
describing but with these devices were
formally introducing the nokia city lens
capability which is augmented reality so
here i can hold this up and look at the
scene around me but overlaid on the
buildings around us what i'm seeing our
tags that highlight what those different
buildings are or where my friends might
be or things like that i'm able to click
on those those icons get navigation
directions to them so it's a very
intuitive way to work with the world
around you and then a third key point of
course is that these are windows phone
devices Windows Phone 8 more sharing
with windows 8 on PCs and tablets with
Xbox so all around a great consumer
experience that really addresses some of
the chow you tell you tell windows phone
8 you know it's critically it's gotten a
lot of
name but commercially hasn't seen as
much assess I mean what-what for you is
the biggest hurdle and getting people to
try the Windows Phone device I think a
lot of it is for consumers to understand
and appreciate the new style of user
experience we're very proud that we're
different than when everything else is
being presented so in the stores on the
web as people look at it what we're
seeing is as they become familiar with
this user experience and engage with it
then they fall in love with it now one
of the things that we believe helps a
lot is of course in the fourth quarter
as well windows 8 which shares a common
user experience with the Lumia devices
will be introduced so many many people
will see it on PCs on tablets and so
forth and as that new point of view gets
established I think that will help us a
great deal as it relates to the phone
opportunity now obviously the holiday
season there are a number of other
high-profile phones that are coming out
the iphone being one of them how do you
you know hope to kind of capture the
customers attention when obviously Apple
is kind of hog let's share this did
share the spotlight I think the most
important thing is to have a different
point of view with some incredible
differentiation whether it's that
sunlight experience that we all you know
come across whether it's the ability to
take the best pictures to navigate all
of those capabilities plus the beautiful
design I think people are looking for
something different so this is Lumia and
we think it's time to switch well thank
you Steve my pleasure this has been
