Aya's Akhtar we cover a lot of different
tech here at CNET over in Kentucky we've
got an excellent team of editors faking
things vacuuming things and drinking
coffee all with the goal of testing
appliances for you to your audience
recently I got to collaborate with them
to come up with a top five appliances
for the super rich at number five is a
three thousand dollar coffee maker say
hello to the Wolfe coffee system it cost
three thousand one hundred and ninety
five dollars what it makes of all kinds
of drinks like coffee cappuccinos lattes
macchiato expressos and more the machine
will even steam clean the milk nozzle
for you and deposit any used coffee
grinds into a separate container
oh yeah the system requires professional
installation so we can sit flush in a
wall the best thing about this coffee
system is that it makes the $300
Technovore multi-master look moderately
reasonable by comparison
CNET's Brian Bennett particularly likes
a mocha masters lava lamp like bubble
show visible in the transparent water
reservoir and number four is a $500
KitchenAid toaster let me ask an expert
on what exactly this thing does what
does the KitchenAid Pro Line 4slice
toaster do seen at Andrews peekaboo get
Bart tote this toasters got a lever list
design so bread descends automatically
into it if you forget to pick up your
toast after it's undergone its
transformation from your bread too
crunchy delight this toaster will
actually bring the toes back into the
machine to keep it warm there's only one
problem
let's throw it to you peekaboo the
toasts like a wood so only get this
toaster if you don't really care for
toast or money number three the Haiku
ceiling family sends me this fan is made
by the good people at Big Ass Fans and
it costs one thousand forty five dollars
yes that's the name of the manufacturer
yes that's the price the Haiku would
sense me is actually a smart fan with
heat and humidity sensors Wi-Fi motion
detection and it integrates with a smart
phone app this big ass fan will actually
learn your cooling needs
over time that high price paid for
quality by the way the blades are
individually hand balanced so you're not
going to have any wobbly Fanning
happening oh and the blades are strong
too the company invited seeing it to try
to smash a blade so we tried that was
Phoenix Wright Crist doing his best
Hulk smash impression in a place at
number two the $8,500 links smart Grill
why on earth would a grill retail for
eight thousand four hundred and
ninety-nine dollars because it'll listen
to you smart grill cook scallops
how many burner would you like to use
you can literally tell the link smart
Grill marvel cook a burger then it will
ask you follow-up questions like how
long do you want to cook it and they
will even tell you when to flip it over
the grill is powered by a 1.5 gigahertz
Intel processor because of course it's a
processor in this grill it connects to
Wi-Fi
it has 64 gigabytes of storage we're
still waiting to get our hands on this
grill for testing $14,000 let me say
that again $14,000 that's the price tag
for the Miele dual fuel range introduced
at CES 2015 this range connects to your
home's Wi-Fi of course so you can
control it with an app there's also a
touch panel to let you pick a recipe or
cooking mode meal is actually working
with IBM to bring chef Watson to this
oven now what's chef Watson as a
technology to let you select a meal by
picking ingredients you have lying
around
so with connected internet get you
recipes and then it'll do everything for
you $14,000 and there you have it the
