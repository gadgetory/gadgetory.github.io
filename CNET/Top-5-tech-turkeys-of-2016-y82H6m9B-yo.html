2016 there's been a lot of missteps this
year so let's get to the worst of the
worst and number 5 is Facebook the giant
social network faced a bunch of problems
in 2016
Facebook has been blamed for the
election of Donald Trump to the
presidency because false news spread on
the site very quickly the company also
accidentally declared the Philippines
within the state of war by inverting the
colors on the country's flag red on top
of blue denote that country is at war
otherwise it should be blue above red
and number 4 some Pokemon goal players
the game Pokemon go caught fire but
introduced the world to some people who
just did not understand limits some
Pokemon goal players will enter
memorials dedicated to remembering
victims of tragedies in search of
Pokemon others would play the game and
be careless like the two players who
fell off a 90-foot cliff because they
were not paying attention and number 3
Twitter the company still seems like
it's trying to figure out what it is
this year it picked up some steam and
video streaming with deals to show
football games and the presidential
elections so maybe it's a video site now
maybe but then again twitter did
announce plans to kill a divine mobile
app then they're all the rumors that
twitter is up for sale potential buyers
reportedly included Disney Apple and
alphabet but apparently nobody wanted
Twitter and number 2 Yahoo Yahoo looked
like it was about to be put out of its
misery with Verizon swooping in to
purchase the company then Yahoo told the
world about the biggest hack in history
at least 500 million Yahoo accounts were
compromised then reports circulated that
yahoo may have helped the US government
spy on customers emails at number one is
Samsung Samsung started the year off
pretty well it introduced the Galaxy s7
and s7 edge then there was all the
excitement over the Galaxy Note 7 yea
then things got bad reports were
everywhere that the note 7 was
overheating Samsung wound up recalling
the note 7 not once but twice after the
new improved models were still not safe
oh then stamps on how to recall 2.8
million washing machines due to
excessive vibration and the top shaking
off leading to injuries better luck next
year
but there were way more than five tech
turkeys this year check out our
super-sized list of more than 30 turkeys
