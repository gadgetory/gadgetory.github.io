lenovo a1 tablet this is a seven inch
Android 2.3 tablet it's been priced at
around $250 for a while now but we're
seeing the price drop all the way down
to $199 recently and that's putting it
in the Kindle Fire Territory and when
you compare it against the Kindle Fire
this thing has a lot going for it it has
a 1 gigahertz processor memory expansion
microSD memory expansion front and rear
cameras so you're going to be able to
get a lot of those Android features that
you're expected out of a standard
Android tablet you're also getting the
standard installation of Android 2.3 so
that comes along with things like Gmail
maps and of course the Android
Marketplace so if you're already
invested in a lot of Android apps
through the Android Marketplace you're
gonna be able to get those on this
tablet
whereas with the Kindle Fire you're
gonna have to go through the Amazon App
Store and do that whole deal so the one
big catch for this tablet is that the
screen quality isn't great has one
pretty bad viewing angle so if you're
comparing this against the IPS screen of
the Amazon Kindle Fire you're definitely
gonna notice a difference in screen
quality especially if you're really
heavy into watching movies pictures
things where the screen quality and the
viewing angle really matters Kindle Fire
even the Barnes &amp;amp; Noble Nook Tablet it's
gonna have a better screen quality for
you at this price range so that's the
Lenovo 81 7-inch tablet priced around
$199 is a great deal if you're an
Android fan and you're already invested
in the Android ecosystem if you're
stickler on screen quality though you're
probably gonna be better off with
something like the Amazon Kindle Fire
