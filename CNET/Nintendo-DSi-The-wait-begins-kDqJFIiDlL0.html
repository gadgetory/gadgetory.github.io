nintendo's gamer summit in San Francisco
on October second and i'm joined by
charlie schibetta he is the senior
director of corporate communications for
a nintendo and charlie i am most
interested in hearing about dsi this is
the third iteration of Nintendo's very
popular DS handheld gaming system why
don't you explain what is new with the
dsi sure so Japan last night announced
the dsi is coming out there november
first it's not coming to North America
until next year so we're getting a
little sneak peak of it right now the
d/s light is still selling great for us
we actually just had the most successful
august ever for any video game system
either console or handheld so the
momentum is still strong for deus like
this holiday we got at least one more
holiday in US but when it does come out
next year and when it comes out in Japan
here on November first there's a lot of
exciting things happening with the dsi
it's got a couple of cameras installed
so you can shoot straight ahead or
another camera shoots right back at you
you have memory right in the unit so you
can download songs play songs listen to
them AC format wider screen it's thinner
and so there's a lot of cool things
going on with this I think we're really
going to make it better for gamers but
knowing that it is coming out at some
point in 2009 are people really going to
be motivated to want to continue to buy
the DS lite well they're motivated right
now there we had a record year last year
where 22% ahead this year at this point
through August than we were last year so
people are still buying them and the key
to that is games if there's games to
power any console or handheld people are
going to keep buying it until you've
tapped out creatively on it which I
think we're a long way from people will
still do that and what's interesting
about you know how many people have
bought it in Japan roughly one and two
households has a d/s late already and
whereas an America where just one in
five so we still think we have a little
bit of room to grow now one of the
initial complaints I've heard about the
dsi is that not all of the DS Lite games
are compatible imagine are going to be
new titles to satisfy some people but
what do you have to say about the
complaints that people already have some
of these older games in hand well all
the D snds light games will play on the
dsi what was eliminated was a GBA slot
game boy advance which is a couple
generations ago so that's going away
but you can still play all your GBA
games on your DSN UDS light so it
actually is compatible so I think we're
going to be ok there ok so we do not
have a specific date for the dsi
released in America is that right that's
right there sometime next year sometime
in 09 and what about pricing what is the
structure looking like well we haven't
announced any pricing yet either what if
you look at what Japan announced last
night that's roughly one hundred eighty
dollars here the d/s light right now
sells for 129 so we'll announce pricing
next year when we do a more more
complete rollout of what the unit's all
about and when it's coming out so for a
potential fifty dollar increase and I
know that's not set in stone of course
but for fifty dollars more the customer
will be getting thinner screen dual
cameras well it's a it's a thinner unit
altogether a bigger screen eager screen
yeah and the ability to listen to music
on your on your game machine I think
it's really a compelling argument in
terms of why you want to do it because
if I can do X I can listen to music I
can take photos with it you know both of
the people in myself I can edit those
photos with editing software I have
memory right on there so I can download
games and play them right there without
having to worry about you know inserting
a cartridge so there's a lot of things
going on there i think they are pretty
cool colors everyone wants to know what
colors that come into you know it's one
of the interesting things about the the
DS market is how the colors can just
bring a whole new bunch of people and it
just attracted by the color so there
will be colors obviously when it when it
launches here we don't know what those
colors are yet but that's one of the fun
things about that you know what that's
what's clippings keeps the DS Lite fresh
is that new colors come out and people
want to get that new color the dsi
chromatic yeah really make that your new
ad campaign for us right sounds good fit
in marketing any final tidbits you can
share with our audience just to keep
them keep them waiting keep them
anticipating when the release comes in
09 well what's interesting about it too
is that there's something called the
Nintendo DSi shop so not only can you
buy games at retail but you can download
them right
the internet so with that memory you can
start right there you know when you
download a game and you play a
multiplayer game with somebody once you
turn the machine off it goes away and
you'll have to download a fresh now with
the memory and with that downloading
capability your games will stay there so
anytime you want to play you can just
turn on this like that that's right
there for you now it's an interesting
marketing position you're in you can't
really tell everyone to wait until 09 to
buy the dsi because you still want them
to buy the light but if you consider
dice it is it's a balancing act because
you want to get people excited about it
and they're interested in it because
they're always interested in new
technology but you also have a pretty
compelling offering this holiday and we
do think it is as compelling we had
great games coming out and it's a good
value so we think it's going to be on a
good holiday for us and we did announce
that we're having more quantity of this
year than last year so hopefully if you
go into by when your be able to get one
great thank you very much Charlie
