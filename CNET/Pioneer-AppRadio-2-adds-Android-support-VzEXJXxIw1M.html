Goodwin with cnet.com I'm on the floor
of CES 2012 and pioneers booth taking a
look at the app radio - now what
pioneers done is they've taken the app
radio that they debuted last year with
the iPhone app integration this one
works with iPhone 4 and iPhone s and it
made it a little bit better
those small changes add up to throw a
pretty big new device we've got a bigger
seven inch capacitive touchscreen that's
multi-touch so when you're in your
Google Maps you can actually pinch and
zoom and swipe and scroll that sort of
thing they've also added in this
generation Android connectivity so if
you have an Android phone that has a
micro HDMI or an mlc connection then you
can basically connect to the Android
phone and take it for a little bit right
here in the interface as well so we've
got apps like Pandora and ways for
navigation that you'll be able to use on
the Android device in addition to the
apps that they mentioned last year with
the iPhone 4s we've also got more audio
outputs in the back which should make
this a more compelling device for users
who want to build systems with multiple
lamps there's also a dedicated rear-view
camera input so if you want to add
backup camera you can do all of that
right here it's the MEK free device so
it doesn't have an optical drive you
can't play CDs or DVDs in here but if
you really want to do that they've added
an advanced app mode to their navigation
and DVD receivers so if you want to get
the best of both worlds you can also
take a look at one of those devices
right here I've been into one Goodwin
I'm on the floor CES 2012 is the Pioneer
app radio and I think it's pretty cool
