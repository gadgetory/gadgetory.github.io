Chromebook pixel we have some experts
product testers here and we're gonna
find out if you guys can live in the
cloud Brian Abbey and Herman each of you
will spend two or three days with the
pixel are you familiar with this it's
kind of Google laptop I'm seeing some
reviews and had a chance to look at it a
little bit but curious to see how it
works in the real world and Abbey I know
you're in production how do you feel
about the idea of something is basically
just a browser I'm a little skeptical
about it I'm not sure if it can do
everything that I want it to do but I do
use Google products though alright and
then Herman I'm thinking that you live
on a cloud do you live in the cloud well
I am a cloud so I can't wait to test it
out he has his own weather all right
guys have fun with the Chromebook and
then we'll get back together in a week
or so and we'll report back hi my name
is Abbie Barret Lavoie I'm a
professional filmmaker and producer and
I love to shoot video and read comic
books
i'm brian fisher senior correspondent
for the pac-12 networks and i and i'm
always connected
hey my name is Herman Chan a real estate
broker extraordinaire
the Bay Area native and I went to Cal go
bears my first impression when I see
this packaging is if it were not for
this Google insignia here I would've
thought this was a Mac product the first
thing that I do notice is that the
screen resolution is beautiful but it is
a glass screen and not a matte screen
which I don't like because it has so
much reflection in it so that kind of
takes away from how beautiful the screen
does look you know I like the design I
like the look of it it's a little bit
darker which is a good color and
otherwise you know it's solidly built
and it definitely feels like it's one
piece of machine the Chrome OS is fairly
user friendly I think it's really cool
that I can do this touch screen swiping
and stuff like that and I think that
would be really useful if I were meeting
a client at a presentation but me
sitting in my car or at a open house or
at my desk doing this all day with
ergonomic Lee just kill my shoulder I
mean I think the only limited thing on
this laptop and especially working
outside is probably the battery life I
think that's probably the only negative
I just had shot some footage and it's on
this card here so I wanted to see I'm
pretty sure it's not gonna work but I
just kind of wanted to see if it would
load onto this computer and the first
issue I ran into is there's no firewire
800 so I just can't even pluck his
Pippin so I'm gonna try this one it has
USB so and there it is it looks like you
can actually play it I really I
seriously didn't think it would play it
I would love to tell you more about the
app experience however I can't log on
because apparently I need a Wi-Fi
hotspot to get on the internet so I mean
that's a big downer for me it's a little
bit too big to kind of take it with you
to say a press conference and whatnot
and run up and down and get interviews
but if you're just kind of staying in
one spot you know it's pretty pretty
solid the aspect ratio is a little
different you know it is 4:3 it's not
the sixteen by nine you're really used
to and you know someone who likes to
have Twitter up on the side I'd rather
have that whip I like the idea of having
cloud apps but you know traveling and
doing all that you know you can't want
to make sure you can have that offline
capability so here we are back where we
started with the Chromebook pixel I
can't wait to get you guys as thoughts
so would you think about the Chrome OS
then and the usability of life in the
cloud well I like Chrome I use it all
the time but I also like options so I
was little bombs I couldn't use
or anything else but it was these CDs
yeah so what did you find it easy to use
awesome I would love to live in a cloud
but the things that it's predicated upon
wireless and if you find a wireless then
it's kind of defunct Oh Brian how about
you and these I mean you can use Google
Docs or spreadsheets and all that's
great but kind of do more than that
especially for that price you know I was
looking for some more options and you
just didn't see it on all right
overall for twelve hundred and ninety
nine dollars pixel would you buy it do
not buy do that by what about you hell
no hell no Brian no buddy no chance on
the Chromebook pixel it's really really
pretty
nobody wants it
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
