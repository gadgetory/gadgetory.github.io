the apple core now today we're going to
take a look forward to 2019 to see what
we can expect from Apple based on some
of your feedback let's get started
before we begin I want to thank all of
you for sending in your 2019 Apple wish
list now here's how it's gonna go down
first off I'm gonna read your comments
about what you want to see Apple do in
2019 and then we're gonna do a little
reality check to see how likely we are
to actually get it in the next year
based on the rumors so let's start with
the iPhones that I'm gonna read Erik
Becker's comment who says he wants to
see ol it across the whole lineup no
point in upgrading to a phone with no
better screen for that high of a price
he says and I totally agree with you but
I don't think we're gonna see a change
in next year's lineup at least according
to the most recent rumors which state
that Apple is going to keep with the
same designs in 2019 now along those
same lines Christopher Allen says on
YouTube that he's not buying a phone
with a knotch
ever and that he's gonna hold on to his
old phone forever until that ugly notch
goes away and I'm sorry to tell you
Chris but you're gonna be waiting
another year because it seems that 2019
is not gonna be the year that Apple gets
rid of the notch on the new iPhones
because Apple still needs that true
depth camera array on the top to make
face ID work and it doesn't look like
they're going to be switching to an in
screen fingerprint scanner anytime soon
now a lot of you are requesting the
return of the headphone jack on the
iPhone again I'm sorry to disappoint you
not seeing this one happen what we may
see is iPhone switching to USB see and
that was on Greg guys's wish list he
said he wants the iPhone to switch to
USB see and lower the prices now this
one is a little bit more likely only
because Apple already did this with the
new iPad models in 2018 now regarding
those lower prices which seems to be
number one on everybody's wish list for
next year I again I'm sorry to
disappoint this is definitely not gonna
happen Apple is going to continue with
the same price tear in 2019 at least for
its iPhones and we're not even hearing
any
about a smaller cheaper iPhone se in the
works so we're just gonna have to be
okay with paying a higher premium for
Apple devices now in terms of operating
systems and what you want to see in iOS
it seems that Siri is a pretty big
complaint across the board user Jeff
LeBlanc says that that's the worst thing
about his iPhone 10 now this is one
rumor that we continue to hear year
after year running around WWDC time and
I'm not giving up on Siri because Apple
continues to make improvements on Siri
it's by no means up to par with other
assistants like Google's assistants so
we'll have to wait and see for 2019 it
is a serious possibility that Apple does
a complete overhaul to its digital
assistant the other thing you guys
wanted for iOS was multitasking that
alongside horizontal unlock which are
already on the iPads so I'm hoping that
Apple is going to migrate these features
to the iPhone as well with the next iOS
now it's very likely in the next I Oh s
are more ar features we talked a couple
weeks ago about an AR feature that would
allow you to identify your uber or lyft
driver when he shows up just by pointing
the camera now let's move on to the
Apple watch 2019 Apple watch might get
FaceTime support and face ID support
this would mean the Apple watch would
have to have some kind of camera either
on the band or on the watch face itself
which is pretty promising in the next
year now user st. John Manson says his
wish list for Apple includes epilepsy
monitoring for the Apple watch and given
how much Apple has been focusing on
health features on the Apple watch as of
late I don't think this is too much of a
stretch Apple has also been rumored to
be working on a glucose monitor and a
blood pressure monitor for the Apple
watch but I also know that a lot of
these features need FDA clearance which
means we might have to wait longer than
2019 to see them roll out in the
meantime Apple has started to include
other health features in some of its
other products the company just launched
its first sleep tracking monitor so I
suspect that sleep tracking will become
a larger part of Health kit also it just
took out a new patent for biometric
sensors on the air pods and that leads
- our next matter aside from lowering
the price of the iPhones your number one
wishlist item were air pods and yes in
fact you will be seeing new air pods in
2019 or at least according to the rumors
now the question really is how big of a
refresh are we getting in the next year
there are two likely events one is that
we're only getting a new wireless
charging case now the second includes
all the other rumors about the air pause
that we've been hearing Steve Ryan games
says he wants the air pods - or at least
ones that match your iPhone and this
could be a possibility even if we only
get that wireless charging case as the
Refresh but in the event that we get the
big refresh next year we might be
looking at noise canceling air pods
waterproof air pods and those biometric
sensors but if Apple does launch air
pods - with the wireless charging case
it would only make sense that they also
launch the air power mat which was on
your list and frankly on mine as well it
may be too late for Apple to deliver on
its promise of bringing this charging
mat to consumers in 2018 but that
doesn't mean it's dead we will likely be
getting that charging mat capable of
charging up to three Apple devices at
once in 2019 given its track record
don't hold your breath on to the max now
we just got a brand new batch of laptops
we got a slight refresh to the MacBook
Pro lineup and we got the MacBook Air
sequel that we have been waiting for for
a long time so I'm not expecting to see
new laptops next year from Apple but
that doesn't mean we're not gonna see
other types of Mac's the Mac Pro is one
of those products that's definitely
overdue for a refresh and if Apple wants
to maintain its pro users we might
actually get one in 2019 now this one
wasn't as popular on your wish list but
it's also been rumored to be in the
works that is a cheaper smaller home pod
to compete with the Google home Mini and
the Amazon echo dot Apple is rumored to
be working on this cheaper home pod for
2019 so we can probably expect it right
around WWDC the other one that wasn't
really on your wish list but I had to
mention anyway is
original content as Apple goes
head-to-head in 2019 with the likes of
Netflix Hulu and HBO Apple is rumored to
be spending 1 billion dollars in content
next year and it already has production
deals with Reese Witherspoon Steven
Spielberg and Oprah and I'm personally
curious to see what this Apple branded
content will look like and if it can
still compete in this saturated market
what's not clear is whether or not it's
going to offer it as a standalone
service or as the bundle deal with Apple
music but all these questions are going
to be answered in 2019 and on Mark
Thompson's wish list for 2019 that I get
rid of the laptop for Apple core but
what do you guys think should I get rid
of the laptop should I get rid of the
desk altogether because hey you never
know what I might do next year so hit me
up on the comments section below or on
Twitter and that pretty much does it for
apple core this year but stay tuned next
year because we're going to be coming to
you live from the scene at stage at the
Consumer Electronics Show so until then
Happy New Year's</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
