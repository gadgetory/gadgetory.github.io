Facebook unveiled deep text a text
understanding engine the system can
process several thousands of posts per
second in more than 20 languages
facebook says deep texts reaches near
human accuracy share that's very
interesting but why does this matter at
all to you as an example imagine you are
using facebook Messenger and you needed
a ride you can write I need a ride and
messenger can instantly give you an
option to request a ride if you write I
don't need a ride deep text won't bother
to give you an option if you write I
like to ride donkeys and this is
Facebook's example by the way the
artificial intelligence knows that you
are not asking for the uber of donkeys
deep text also understands that certain
words are related like cab and taxi
Facebook's end goal appears to be
getting you the Facebook user to use all
of its services if you're selling an
item you might just post the text to
chairs $10 each pickup Palo Alto
Facebook deep text will read the
sentence distill it and figure out its a
for sale post this can really change the
way people use Facebook if deep tags can
realize you are looking for movie
tickets or hotel room you might not need
to head to another site at all you can
live your entire life in facebook all
the time that can be great or horrible I
don't really know I'm Maya's actor and
you can keep up with the hottest tech
