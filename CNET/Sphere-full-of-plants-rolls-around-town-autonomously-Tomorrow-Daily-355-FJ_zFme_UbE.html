welcome to tomorrow daily the best
peacock show in the known universe I'm
ashley's together and i'm jeff cannata
let's catch you up with the headlines
Lord cybernetics might bring to mind
terminators at first but what about
something more eco-friendly like this
researchers at University College London
created horsham Makana be a geodesic
sphere with a decidedly green twist it's
filled with plant life and electrodes
allow the sphere to detect how the
plants respond to different environments
the sphere can also move albeit slowly
and awkwardly by using actuators that
shift its weight around so what is the
point of this exactly well the
architecture students behind horton
machina be say they feel plants should
be integrated into modern society in a
way that allows the plants to
autonomously interact with humans and
get around town I really like that they
called it a this is a quote a
speculative urban cyber gardener I was
like the way that they I saw speculative
urban saira gardener at Coachella and
they were amazing sobremesa know this is
a really cool idea i think that there
are we need to figure out a way to
integrate plants more in modern big
cities and then this is this is exactly
the kind of thing we need to be working
yeah i really dig that speaking of
things we need to be working on have you
been working on your duck face well it's
time to abandon your duck face and start
perfecting your trout face or at least
your pet fish can work on their trout
face the Submariner camera is a little
remote-controlled boat with a little
camera onboard and you can record video
of your fish as they swim inside your
aquarium or take simple snapshots of
your underwater family if you want to
record your more nocturnal fish the
Submariner even has anybody headlights
on board oh and here's the best part
obviously you don't want to take
pictures of your fish swimming away so
it has small arm that you can stick fish
food capsules on allowing you to get the
best shots of your prettiest fish what
what would you pay for a fish selfie
device give me an infomercial I'd pay
twenty dollars yeah
now this is gonna be about 90 so uh no I
liked a little like give me a convert to
refresh I know I like the rebates up the
lure bait if I was a fish I would not
trust anything that involved bait or
lures right like if you're a fish that
seems like the worst way to attract of
it yeah that's true I made a pretty lady
fish it looks just like your fish man
like I'm over yeah but someone's dick on
a goldfish that's a good way to get your
fishing come closer so which of these
stories should we talk about I you know
I really like I you you mentioned
something important I think as we make
everything more modern as we make
everything you know we see an urban
sprawl kind of happening I think it's
really important to talk about ways that
we can bring the green and eco-friendly
plant life to cities I think that's a
great story and in order to provide
balance I'll be doing my trout face the
entire time great that sounds good if
you guys want to share a picture of your
best trout face you can all you can
tweet us with a hashtag hey TV yeah
that's how we know that you're talking
at us by shouting us over Twitter and
then we'll be able to check your
comments and incorporate them into our
discussion on Thursday yeah you can all
if you don't want to send your trout
face just tell us what you think of this
lovely Horta machina be you yeah or any
of the stories we've talked about any of
it we're gonna be we're gonna be deep
diving tomorrow yes get out your nose
plugs all right guys it's time for our
second last our penultimate monuments
photogra for the day lu lu
today's phone tog refers Jacob who took
this with a note for Jacob wrote to us
and said hi Jeff nationally my name is
Jacob hursley and of course I get
permission for you to show my pictures
these are from when my best friend and I
went to Israel in December of 2014 I
took them on a note for but now I have
the galaxy s7 edge the top left is
Jerusalem top right are the grottoes
from the north bottom left is also in
the north and the bottom right is the
baha'i gardens and Haifa I'm a huge fan
of show and hope I get featured hopes
granted Jacob featured right now you
know I've never been to Israel but I
don't picture this when I think of it
yeah I mean it's really interesting I
think I picture the upper left picture
but I certainly would not picture the
the top right and the bottom left which
look very sort of tropical yeah like
it's a gorgeous I mean it's all
beautiful looks ridiculously beautiful
and colorful that's always the thing i
love about pictures from all around the
world you guys send these photos into
places that i have in my mind and then
it's sort of almost like seeing a color
picture of something you've previously
seen in black and white like in your
mind i guess i just don't see it as
colorful as it truly is in real life and
so that's so cool that you sometimes
there's been a fun month of monuments
yeah we got a new month kitting us
pretty quick what should we should maze
theme be well may I think it reminds me
of always rising made a first of May was
like then of course I was raised
Catholic so I was think of the the Mary
there's just a big celebration of mother
Mary and all stuff um so I'm gonna say I
think springtime is good it's a flower
yes it's spring is springing so whatever
spring means to you we'd love to see
photography around that theme maybe some
beautiful outdoor shots but maybe spring
means something else maybe an actual
spring I don't fog maybe it's weather or
some kind maybe it's a place that you go
every spring for spring break if it's
you doing jello shots on the beach there
you go we'll take those pictures I'll
take that picture so spring it is that
is our new theme and we'll start on
Monday will remind you guys tomorrow if
you guys want to send in your photogra
fee please send your spring photos to
tomorrow at cnet com yeah make sure you
