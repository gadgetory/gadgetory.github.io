Ford reprogram ease DCP gearboxes and
what are your favorite EQ settings on
your car stereo all that more on this
week's episode of cnet roadside
assistance this is the show where we
take a minute to answer your questions
and read your comments I'm antuan
goodwin alongside Wayne Cunningham with
Mitchell Chang on the controls let's
jump right into it as first question is
pretty interesting it's comes in from
Mason Salt Lake City not the rapper it
says hi guys i have a 2004 350z which I
love it has the factory Bose stereo
system in it and i'm no audiophile so
this works great for me however it's
beginning to come up on about 10 years
old and there's no aux input let alone
bluetooth or other connectivity I've
even tried the adapters with the
cassette on the the end aside from FM
units which our hearts use in the city
is there anything I might not be aware
of that would work last show Nathan Salt
Lake City yeah remember when just just
2005-2006 finding an aux input in a car
was actually a I'm practically a miracle
oh yeah yeah I had a car of about that
same generation my RSX type-s was with a
note for it and they'd had it both just
a minute similar situation here I just
gave up and use tape adapters for
everything that was before I was a car
tech editor that's true this is a
question we get a lot actually is how
can i hook up my ipod or whatever to my
car right and so the interesting thing
about Bose systems with that vintage is
that usually they consist of two parts
you've got your head unit which may have
like a six-disc in-dash changer and a
tape deck your radio and all of that and
that sends a pre amplified signal to an
external amplifier which is underneath
your seat somewhere usually underneath
the passenger seat and maybe in the
driver seat i'm not sure but and then
that amplifies the the audio and before
it sends it ultimately out to the rest
of your speakers in your car so there's
actually a couple of ways that you can
kind of a couple of different places
that you can kind of get in between
those those signals to kind of
interjecting
the easiest way that actually require
zero cutting and in very little rewiring
is instead of using a wireless FM
transmitter use a wired FM modulator
that would actually plug in line between
the cars antenna and the antenna port on
the back ear car stereo so it's a
physical connection it can send a
stronger signal since it's not FCC
regulated and it you can even actually
overpower week radio stations with with
a good FM wired FM modulator so there's
one option that you've got there the
other option are going to be integration
kit that may take take advantage of I'm
not sure if the has a satellite radio
input but the the integration kit
sometimes take advantage of that
basically by piggybacking you're
pretending to be a satellite radio
receiver and allowing you to select
stations or artists as stations that way
that'd be a connection on the back of
the head unit right off ya again and
they might have other yeah connections
back there for maybe a CD changer if
that was a I don't know if that was an
in-dash unit in this car or a you know
one of those cartridge things or
something thank you but you know a teggy
and I'm kind of thinking that it may
have been a fix this in-dash changer if
anything if it is either a single dish
single disc in dash or an index changer
I think bio for most automakers were
ditching the external CD changers and
everything except minivan yeah i just
looked this up actually the amp should
be located in the far left trunk corner
and says so there's actually a lot of
good online stuff about where to find
this than you or to find equipment in
your car even easier to reach yeah i
would think just pop the hatch and pull
up a couple of panels you have to take
your seat out or you know contort
yourself upside down like I did when I
was doing that because that brings us to
the the last way that you could that you
can add all sorts of integration to your
system is actually by interrupting the
signal that comes from the receiver and
then it was between the receiver and the
amplifier so you would use something
like a DSP or a line out converter or
anything basically to you
cut the wires that we come off of the
back of the receiver you in insert this
device in line between it in the amp and
then basically then you'd be able to add
whatever you wanted the one that I'm
thinking of right now is the rockford
fosgate I think it's called the 362 it's
got an interest it's got a weird name
rockford fosgate but basically what this
allows you to do is it does a number of
things first of all it's a DSP it's
actually called the 360 60 is actually a
3 the word 63 it's at eight channel DSP
so it the first thing that it does what
it's designed to do is actually allow
you to tune the audio so it it gets the
signal is coming out of the receiver it
cleans it up and then it allows you to
kind of tweak the found the way that you
want but what's interesting about this
this particular unit is that it also has
the ability to do things like add
auxiliary inputs you can add a bluetooth
module that allows you to do audio
streaming a2dp wireless streaming also
i'm not sure does he was easing i
thought i have ipod he doesn't really
specify what he's looking specify yeah
just want something to connect yeah I
mean I suppose you could put like maybe
an ipod cable or iPod adapter into this
you could yeah you def did you you could
you could go I think you just use the
auxiliary input in that case yeah so
it's actually an interesting way to add
that the problem with this method if
you're not interested in really kind of
getting in and and playing with the 31
band EQ and and plugging your laptop up
to it via USB and really kind of
tweaking the the phase delay between the
channels is that you're paying 700 bucks
to add an auxiliary input and Bluetooth
your car so it's not exactly the most
cost-effective way to do it that most
cost-effective would probably be like a
cheap integration kit yeah basis points
out he's not a lot of audio files so
probably doesn't want our tweak all the
I love maybe could become an audio file
by tweaking all this or you just keep
using the tape adapter until the tape
player dies
we should all inevitably do they all do
so I think I'm easy to change that head
unit on those cars that are probably
well integrated that's just above a
receiver it should pop right out it's
just you know you when she once you pop
the receiver out then you've also got to
pop out the bose amp which I mean most
receivers have integrated amplifiers
anyway that put out a reasonable amount
of power yeah so that that's a couple of
options that I think we've actually
probably discussed on the show before
but it you know your mileage may vary it
just really depends on on how deep into
it you want to get if you just don't
care about audio quality but you want an
easy is you want something that's easy
to install and maybe even easy to yank
out why are deaf in module eight ER is
probably going to be the best thing for
a non audio file right right we've got a
voicemail this actually commented on a
question we answered the last week about
about Reuben sandwich was looking for
new tires for his Kia and we were
wondering why does he needed tires on a
new Kia hey cnet guys I we've been over
here from Boston leaving sandwich I just
use the sandwich because it's more
memorable than Reuben but I'm just
getting back to you guys it is the 2011
kia optima aspects and the reason i
decided to buy new tires even though my
car only has six thousand miles on it
was because a lot of here in
Massachusetts be called an asshole they
tend to ship lanes without directional
and you have to stop short and so long
story short a woman decided to pull that
on me and I break even with electronic
stability control abs and all these
other technologies in the car the car
just slid into the back of burn no
damage was done thanks for the spike
strip in the front of my car which is a
great thing for Kyle parky but uh yeah
that's the biggest reason I had to get
rid of them and so I actually looking
from tons of 97 das NT there and I
actually got them how to take them back
they gave me the wrong tire size and I
wanded up with continental extreme
pws which has the DWS into the tire
itself not on the side walls with actual
tires so as soon as your s disappears
you no longer have a snow traction the W
disappears you no longer have what
traction and if your ID disappeared then
you have no more dry traction look the
show guys thanks for that our last
 on that show thank you bye yeah
so it seems that Reuben was looking for
really grippy tires I guess when I
really need here which is probably why
he went with those bridgestone potenza
at the beginning those are a lot of
people use those for like autocrossing
not that particular one but the
bridgestone potenza brand you see that a
lot of times yeah and I guess the not
only to avoid sliding into the red cars
are all over the road but I guess also
that you know Massachusetts you're
dealing with whether you know yeah and I
mean depending on how the ABS system is
tuned I mean the point of abs is
actually you know it keeps you from
sliding but then it does so by basically
letting go of the brakes every couple of
milliseconds yeah so the idea is that
you know it well I mean adding more grip
may decrease your stopping distances it
may actually not it just really depends
on how short you need to stop but yeah
it's always maintained that tires are
the best upgrades you can make to a car
right of course with one of these as he
describes Massholes if they if they cut
into you so you could too quickly i mean
there's nothing you can do and yeah if
any suggestions literally nothing yes no
note nothing you can do about that I do
think that's interesting the wear
indicator on those tires were I think he
said it's actually imprinted on the
tread of the tire and that if once you
start seeing the letters disappear then
you basically are changing the rating of
the vehicle because the rating of the
wheel the tire because you have less I
guess less the profile of the tread
depth changes yeah and that that's it
that's a great little detail and you
know something they put on a quality
tires opposed I guess something that's
just cranked out to get the lowest price
for right I really missed those tires
that had like a colored strips molded
into
oh yeah and so you did a burnout you
could leave like a nice that's colored I
don't think it did too many burnouts and
I Kia Optima SX it's an sx you might
maybe front tires spinnin radically
exactly haha you could do a burnout in
the yaris you can do a Burnout know
anyway I've never doubt in the arts
anyway bill comes from larry d he says
i'm looking to replace the head unit in
my 2003 toyota sequoia i put a kenwood
unit in my wife 2000 maxima so she can
use hands-free bluetooth the great folks
at Crutchfield set me up and she loves
it back to the sequoia i went hands-free
to but the old us-spec ipod interface
has to go he noticed that kruskal's
website shows a lot of units that are
available for pre-order are these units
that were announced at CES or something
he's not used to pre-order a sort of
thing and he also wonders if we have a
recommendation for under the four
hundred dollar price range bluetooth and
ipod iphone are the only requirements so
it doesn't sound like he wants to
replace the stereo I just kind of sounds
like he wants to add bluetooth and an
iphone or if you technically the ipod
connectivity read an adapter yeah so I
don't like what are your thoughts on the
the pre-orders I think maybe you know
the well the coal car stereo realm is I
mean it may have gotten hit a little bit
by you know some I mean there was the
disasters last year and in Asia maybe
that hit the hit these problems or this
industry a little bit but i don't know i
mean these are very specialty parts so i
don't there was i don't think there was
a ton of new stuff shown at CES they
certainly still have like a lot of stuff
from the previous generation still
available so maybe it was just a glitch
in crutchfield supply yet i don't know i
don't think i don't think there's any
particular reason why you know there's a
lot of stuff that we've seen and it's
it's not available just yet but it will
be soon they
hey sometimes there's like just R&amp;amp;D time
built into it and then the iphone 4s
guys we're still relatively new not in
the tech world but to you know some
company that you know making a kit that
you know they're trying to figure out a
way that as we'll talk in a second make
sure that siri works with it or you know
any any any number of things could be
the reasons why do you think it held up
it may actually just be that um the
sequoia is just not a high priority
vehicle for a lot of these manufacturers
your your Scotia's and your your Metra's
and they just maybe haven't gotten
around to doing it yet the too busy
designing camaro integration kits that
have touchscreens on them so it could be
any number of reasons yeah a lot of the
adapters though are fairly Universal I
mean you know take you talked about the
us-spec iPod adapter all right I'm not
sure which one he's got it I don't know
what his problem with that one is maybe
it's just like I said adapter or
something but some of them have been
pretty good but if he wants to replace
the whole head unit which may be the the
thing I didn't quite get that from his
email but and but I think one thing he
points out here is he had a very easy
time replacing his wife's head unit
mm-hmm so I think he's got that upgrade
bug now and which is a good thing and I
think you know pay more people need to
realize how frankly easy it can be to
upgrade a hen you dint in a car and get
iphone connectivity Bluetooth
connectivity all this stuff for really
fairly cheap hmm um you know I mean
you've seen head units at 150 bucks 200
bucks you get all this you know pretty
advanced stuff that if you optioned it
in a new car it might cost you you know
six hundred thousand dollars right and
yeah the interesting thing is that you
know for a Toyota generation like a the
mounting kits like the actual bracket
that you would use to hold a receiver in
usually about 12 or 15 bucks but I'm
thinking that you know because I don't
know if he's just trying to keep it
under 400 bucks you could get a new
stereo and a kit that has bluetooth and
I've been and I nite by connectivity
that'll probably be better than what's
already in there
the world's your oyster if you're any
good if you want to go single din um you
can't get anything above 400 bucks so
just find something that you like Sony's
got kids that have Bluetooth built into
it they're sort of tune trinkets
pioneers got a couple of them Alpine
does a really good job with their sort
of necklace receivers that'll you'll be
pushing right up on your four hundred
dollar price point there but I think
pretty much any single day and receiver
that I've ever recommended on the show
probably work for that yeah and yeah
there's a lot of options I guess the big
thing you want to consider right now is
would you want to go meh class or not I
mean do you still want to play CDs or
are you over that you just want to bring
in your ipod iphone whatever and hook
that up yeah there's an amazing man I'm
not seeing a lot of stuff that says
pre-order there's certainly a mix of in
stock and out of stock and right what
not on the Crutchfield site which is
just that mean that is the go-to place
for any any of this kind of upgrade and
you want to do and if you just if you
wanted to keep your stock stereo and you
just wanted to add ipod control and add
bluetooth to your vehicle but to keep
the stock stereo the one that have
recommended on a number of occasions at
the dice mediabridge DIC ii their
immediate media bridge for toyota's the
270 280 bucks and it basically plugs
into the satellite radio receiver on the
back of your stereo and gives you ipod
bluetooth you can keep your satellite
radio if you have it by piggy like ice
piggybacking through it and then you
also get an auxiliary inputs pretty much
adds just about you know everything that
you'd want a little bit more and then
the interesting thing about that is that
if you get the right adapter for it i
think can keep your steering wheel
controls for things like volume skip and
if there's a mute button you get that
also nice nice so probably with that
you'd mean you need to do a little
wiring behind the head unit and i just
look plugs in it's like a harness yeah
so it's just like you you take the
dashboard apart plug it in plug it in
and you're good to go right maybe a few
wires underneath the you know the carpet
or whatever to get that the adapter into
this may be the center console if you
want it there or maybe put it in the
glove box which yeah yeah maybe but if
you're going if you're doing
if you do if you're going Wireless you
using bluetooth for everything oh that's
true yeah i mean that that last part is
even optional i always think of plugging
in just because i've got an ipod or
iphone so it's yeah looking in good yeah
definitely good but i mean that's just
like one usually you could kind of drape
that kind of threw the the back of the
glove compartment without having to cut
anything yeah and then just kind of have
that pig tail hanging out that's what I
do we've got another question about a
Toyota Toyota Tundra this is from Renee
be rini rani Renee Renee says good day
gentlemen I recently purchased a 2012
toyota tundra double cab look it for a
good decent backup camera because it's
hard to see directly behind me due to
the truck sighs my chocolate factory
bluetooth aux and USB ports but no large
screen Ted unit so standard radio
display I'm looking in the Magellan 9055
LM with wireless backup camera or a
wired rearview backup system from costco
by rearview safely safety i prefer a
wireless system and also one that's not
going to cost me an arm and a leg and he
much as yes as the droid bionic and it's
curious if there's any way connect the
camera wirelessly to his phone and use
that as a back of you i guess um no you
can't connect your i mean not without
doing some serious serious modding i
don't think there's a like a turnkey
solution for that but your question as
to whether the Magellan is good and the
backup camera is good I actually just
got both of them in this week so I'll be
testing the the Magellan 9055 LMK and
it's wireless backup camera this week
you'll be able to see the full review on
cnet car tech sometime next week so i'll
let you know whether it's worth it and
that's the one that integrates with the
pnd with the right navigation device so
you got your magellan navigation and
then it the camera is actually universal
it on one in there's the camera that it
actually gets its power from 12 volt in
the back of your car thinking that you
can you basically tap into the rear view
lights of your car that's how it knows
you're backing up and then on the other
end you've got the wireless receiver
that basically just has a video out so
you can kind of plug it into anything
whereas so if you decide to upgrade your
head units to like a pioneer or al pie
and you could probably keep the camera
at that point and then take advantage of
the in dash display so it is i like that
they've done that modular lee i'm sure
they would prefer that you buy the
Magellan P&amp;amp;D but I like that they didn't
lock you into that though but just stay
tuned for that I'll let you know whether
that combo is that is worth the money
right now would you recommend wireless
or wired what would be your wires best
but I mean the wireless systems the last
time I test the wireless system was
about two years ago and I ran into an
issue where I was when I was driving
around I would occasionally pick up
video feeds from security cameras
because they used the same wireless
protocol I don't know if the new systems
have fixed that but this is like an old
audiovox system about two years ago and
I could just I could just park my car
around the corner from our offices in
seed security camera from a design firm
that's nearby and then the next alley
over if I parked in that alley I could
watch TV because they had some sort of
like a wireless cable box or something
you know just I could just watch the
Food Network no sound tiny two and a
half inch screen so we'll see if they
fix that Oh a wired system takes a
little bit more effort to wire because
you've got to run the cable through the
body of the vehicle yeah that's the
longest that's the full distance yeah
the better it is like a solid connection
for starters and you only have to do it
once so I think that if you it's worth
the effort but I mean for ease of
installation the wireless is definitely
the way to go and one thing I like to
with this kind of system or one good way
to go here too is you can get these
mirrors rear view mirrors that actually
have a screen small LCD integrated into
the the rearview mirror and so when you
do put the car in the back up that that
screen lights up and suddenly you're
looking that view and you're actually
looking in the same place you would
normally look when you're backing up you
know over your shoulder well that's
that's one place you should be looking
up that I maybe that was screened back
at other ways to do that but
but yeah so that image pops up in your
rear-view mirror so I can just look up
there and get a fuller view behind you
then you would get in the just using the
mirror itself and I assume that Magellan
would work with some of those mirrors
that are out there hey you just have to
like run the connection the it would
just be a matter of installing the the
wireless receiver in the right place and
run into connection the problem with
those is that usually the image is about
two inches diagonally uh this is a big
ol what is this like six inches seven
inches holy crap that's a huge screen on
that looks so stupid on the avails that
so yeah you get like a bigger screen
there and you're in a big old truck and
your windshields pretty far away yeah
having that a little bit of extra real
estate couldn't hurt so now what about a
two DP kit for with it'll work with Siri
so yeah we got an email from Jim he says
I'm looking for a car kit to wirelessly
stream audio for my iphone i will be
using the line in on my car stereo so it
needs a microphone mainly to you Siri of
course it needs to work with theory I
would also like either a line in or
cable connection from my ipod so I could
charge the phone and get a bitter
hardwired connection for log longer
trips what do you guys recommend i
started laughing halfway through that
because i just realized that he fit that
he'll be plugging this into the line in
on a stereo but he needs something that
has a line in i thought that was a
little funny I said wirelessly stream
audio from his phone so the easiest way
to do that uh I got props today alright
so the easiest way to do that would be
this little thing right here and this is
the extreme mac in charge auto BTW now
it looks like a power cable but instead
of a USB port or a 30-pin you've got
this auxiliary connection now there's a
little pinhole mic on the top of it and
there's a button that activates your
iphones voice control so if you get in
your car in series activated and your
bluetooth pair to this device you can
hit that button Syria will come up and
you'll be able to talk to her just like
you normally would it also has a
to amp USB connection on the back of it
and it comes with a 30-pin dock cable so
you can actually plug your phone up to
it to charge while you're doing all of
this for longer trips now of course if
you needed to plug directly into the
stereo you'd have to unplug this but I
mean it's it's it's actually a very
simple way to kind of do that there's
actually a full review of this device up
over on the car tech blog that's the
extreme mac BTW extreme mac in charge
auto BTW okay and for your use is it
probably the simplest way to do that of
course you probably want to you know
also get like a suction cup or something
in mouth your phone where you can see it
because this doesn't have like a display
and it doesn't integrate with the car
stereo or anything it's literally just a
bluetooth the line and input another
option would be something like the
scotia motor mouth too and this
basically is a tiny little microphone
shaped thing that you would plug into
your your your car's auxiliary input
again this would kind of stick out of
the dashboard like a little wart it the
trick is that if the Bluetooth will
allow you to access your phone's voice
controls without its own voice controls
and you can access Siri if it is
something like a parrot kit that has its
own native voice command when you hit
the voice button and it steps in and
does its own thing then you'll need to
have physical access to the phone so you
can hold down the home key right so
those are the two ways to do it these
are very simple kits they don't have
voice command built into them so you hit
the voice button on them they defer to
the phone right and so that that'll
activate your Syria right then right
yeah the only thing is the the Scotia
motormouth has a little bit it's a
actually a lot better microphone but it
doesn't self charge it has a battery in
it you have to charge it up every couple
of days and it also won't charge your
phone that's why I think the extreme max
solution is probably going to be the
best for what you want it to do yeah
that's it is a little bit inconvenient a
pin to take the thing out of your car or
car and charge it up when and it looks
like a power cable so no one's going to
breaking your car steal it you just
leave it
they're all the time right the extreme
mac one yeah definitely looks like good
solution definitely should do what Jim
is looking for here we got another email
from Kevin which follows on a discussion
we had and I was last week or couple
weeks ago he says that we're talking
Kevin writes it we were talking about
the Ford Focus and fiesta cars in the
dual clutch transmission and how
customers thought there was something
wrong with the clunks when you start
moving again from stoplight he says he
purchased 2012 ford focus SE with the
fuel saver packagin and was never
familiar with the DCT unit a dual clutch
transmission unit before this he says
when he took it to the ford dealer here
and tacoma washington asked about the
DCT they told they he told me they test
drove it and reprogram the computer as
to which computer the transmission or
the sink upgrade I wasn't told but the
records online show it was the sink
upgrade in March 2012 he says he noticed
a difference in gas mileage after the
dealer reprogrammed the computer
compared to what they didn't mess with
the garden and I'm not even sure if they
actually did anything at all and just
that they reprogrammed the computer to
make the customer feel satisfied and he
says he doesn't want to trade the car
back in heard they don't want him to
trade the car back in with a little
vague on the ending there but what they
did is I don't think they did any
reprogramming and the transmission I
think they reprogram sync which is an
upgradeable system and he and Kevin you
could have probably done that yourself
even if you didn't want to run to the
dealer yeah I don't think something like
a I mean they can change the software in
that transmission or they can upgrade or
your reprogram the software and the
transmission but it's not something
they're going to do very often and those
cars really just come off the line I
think Ford is probably pretty satisfied
with those right now I haven't heard of
any recalls or anything like that about
getting those those transmissions
reprogrammed it at this point and you
know I assume that that is something
they could actually do that the dealer
but that is a pretty in depth thing
whereas reprogram in sync is fairly easy
and that's something you know we've done
here at the office right there actually
any number of factors could contribute
to your increase in gas mileage season
could have changed yeah you know density
the air is different you may be getting
used to the car and just like your
inputs could be
smoothing out over time that could also
contribute to the the perceived smoother
a sort of clunks it's like if you when
you pull away from a light if you do
something and you get a weird clunk you
may not realize it but your behavior
changes a little bit and so you could
just be getting used to the car or I
mean maybe they did do some some magic
maybe you've just got like Dominic
Toretto from The Fast and the Furious
it's like what's at your dealership and
you just like gave you a little
something extra well performance upgrade
in there yeah it could've been but I've
very seriously doubted I think it's
probably your behavior in your
environment or changing as their as
their want to do and it's just you're
kind of getting a placebo is what you're
feeling yeah I think so I mean something
like reprogramming sink is probably
going to happen maybe or an upgrade to
sink could you know software upgrade
could happen maybe every year or a
couple times a years but a transmission
software upgrade that's more something
it's not going to happen yeah that's
gonna be like more every two or three or
four year thing if it ever happens maybe
I haven't heard anything afford
responding to this but there was a lot
of a lot of hoopla about like those
gearboxes when they first came out so I
mean it it's not completely out of the
realm of realism that maybe for quietly
need something that's really made a big
deal out of it they certainly could have
yeah but it also if it shows on the he
mentions his butt online if you went to
sink my right calm it's not going to
show ya a transmission upgrade it's only
going to show the sink upgrade exactly
so dad I know which website you went to
I'd be willing to bet if to think my
ride website though because that's the
only place I know where those bulletins
for upgrades are posted absolutely got
another email from Ryan fizza regarding
audio settings I notice that on the car
tech videos you guys sometimes have the
bass and treble settings a little higher
than the center position do you have a
go to setting for all those audio
options when you test the car to try and
create the best sound also you guys ever
consider publishing a list or a video
about the best factory not aftermarket
car stereo systems so for me when I get
into a car the first thing I do is that
every
the flat same here right around listen
to that for a while and then if
something doesn't sound right or if I'm
listening to kind of music and I want to
bring out something in that music or I'm
listening to a lot of audio podcasts
then I get in and play with the settings
and try to make it sound better but I
try to at least give everything a couple
of days on flat just a flat with no
balance correction no fader color
correction one of the things that I hate
the most about getting in a car is when
I get in and someone set the fader all
the way to the rear so that's like the
one thing you don't want a car stereo to
do and that that they actually try to
engineer out of cars used to have like
they're there to midranges down by your
feet and then to that fat in the parcel
shelf and though they've been moving
speaker placement and adding tweeters to
the front to kind of bring the sound in
front of you and raise it up to eye
level and the first thing people do I
don't know who dev it but whenever we
get a new car in its always set like
three or four tix to the rear right yeah
when I start listening to music it in
cars start testing the stereo I do the
same thing I immediate look at those
tone settings and equalize it out to
flat just to get I mean that's the
default setting that the engineers audio
engineers at the car company set it at
that's what they tuned it for and so
that's what they think the best sound
should be right and so yeah that's what
we that's sort of our standard testing
procedure here then sometimes you're
like riding around like in the own in
the Wrangler you got it set to flat
you're riding around here listening to a
variety of music sand and then you know
one day you just want to listen to a
bunch dubstep but there's too much space
that's like oh yeah it's almost like
stupid to say this but there's almost
too much bass to listen to bass heavy
music from that Wranglers audio system
it's got an infinity system with a
powered sub and the cabin is basically
just all hard plastic so it's just
really echoey in bumi and that's great
if you've got the top down but are we
riding with the top up you kind of want
to turn the bass down a couple of ticks
so really depend on the vehicle yeah the
same thing with Rockford 5k systems oh
yeah definitely net all the way up those
are notoriously bass heavy and this is
something I t2 after listening to do it
on flat for a while if I notice it's say
either too bassy or two trebly like an
example was the acura
when they rolled out that new Els Els
system I noticed that was really nice
crisp crisp highs but it seemed it was
just it just really seemed it was tuned
for acoustic music and so I wanted to
see well if I had listened to the music
that I generally like to listen to let
me see if I can actually tune it for
that so I changed the settings and did
find it actually did have bass it did
have a richer responsive you could find
in that in that tuning but you did have
to set the tone canoes and some of the
best ones have like they're they're the
preset eq curves yeah like you know like
like pop or country I don't know how
they decide which genres get their own
eq curves but I mean they're you know
like you get a rock setting or if you're
in the 2012 22 yaris you get music and
talk is it yeah there's only two
settings are actually personally I found
my I preference in any Q is to boost the
treble a little bit and boost the base
just a little bit more mm-hmm leave the
center flat and sometimes if there is
those three bands i can even sometimes
lower the center like one or two ticks
and boost the base with one or two tix
leave the treble the same I think it
just depends on what you're listening to
that week and the the nature of that
stereo is there's no like magic magic
magic setting that works for everything
it really depends on if you're like if
I'm if I'm listening to a lot of jazz
then it's maybe not important that the
base over power is actually important in
the base does not overpower or even
different kinds of jazz something with a
lot of double bass you know you kind of
want to maybe bring that to the
forefront so you kind of you know feel
the beat but you know something that's a
little more meandering piano yeah it
doesn't really matter you want something
more balanced let's move on to our last
question here that we can cover today
this is a we were talking about the
Dearman engine earlier and he's our we
don't have a name for this emailer here
but he says that we're talking about
they order mention this is the engine
that it uses two opposing cylinders they
actually have the
bojan between the two cylinders and it
pushes the two cylinders apart and he
says I was talking to right he says he
remembers back in the nineteen fifty 40s
and early 50s a guy made a modification
to a car the same weight as a first gen
Hummer he essentially used a propane
tank in the trunk and humidified air to
help push Pistons inside the engine
without burning is much gasoline giving
it more miles per gallon the guy who
test drove the car with him claimed it
went about 200 miles on a gallon of gas
saying they drained the tank went across
the street to the station only filled
2.5 gallons in the tank of course like
most of these investors they seemed to
disappear or die mysteriously something
to do with oil companies not wanting
this technology to be made this is like
a classic conspiracy here theory here I
remember we have had solar panels since
the 1960s back on NASA's NASA's projects
but it wasn't a big deal for consumers
until the last 15 years or so I keep
good work love the show so what do we
think about this this car that ran on
propane and gasoline and humidified air
I there's it depends on what you bring
into the situation as far as your biases
because I look at situations like this
and I think alright cool here's a very
novel and interesting way to get 200
miles per gallon out of a vehicle the
size of a Hummer okay now shrink that
down and fit it into a civic oh yeah
probably not going to happen solar
panels have been around for years on
NASA's project NASA had unlimited funds
and it's the nearly unlimited funds near
its beginning but solar panels are only
just now starting to get to the point
where they make economical sense for
anybody yeah they were very expensive
and not very efficient either you're
still not very efficient yeah they've
been growing into the fishes I was
actually talking to some guys from
Stanford do work with solar solar cars
actually and they said that fishin see
has grown about one to two percent per
year which is yeah a slow progression
but it's like you cover the roof of a
Prius and only have enough power to run
the electrical immunity the air
conditioner yeah you're not getting a
lot of juice out of those and with this
car that used propane I mean if it
burned a whole tank of propane and only
a gallon of gas yeah i might get 200
miles but propane
whew oh yeah that's cleaver an
energy-efficient propane yeah yeah you
can certainly know there's certainly a
lot of inventions out there I guess the
most current one that I've heard about a
lot is this idea of electrolyzing
hydrogen in your car using the electric
system forcing that hydrogen into the
fuel lines and having so having that
combust in the cylinders along with the
gasoline hmm you know it's a little bit
of a perpetual energy type of thing here
and so then people claim that it
actually gets better fuel economy but I
think there's studies online let's say
now it doesn't really give you anything
significant that's I mean is that like
the equivalent of like putting a turbine
on the front of a boat in saying that it
powers itself right didn't Mythbusters
try to do that I think they'd to try to
do something like that yeah I don't know
it's just seems a little weird friction
comes into play and eventually stopped
moving yeah well i think that's that's
all the time we have here for roadside
assistance if you have more question if
you have questions for us you want to
