which celebrity is being depicted in
samsung's new AR emoji everyone look
away no cheating
I show the face on my phone to SM so it
hasn't done a good job at all here but I
kind of I actually kind of feel that
this is maybe not so much the phone's
fault as it is mine a little bit so here
we go
are you ready for the first one American
I believe is this person a sports star
no you won't you won't see the smiling
is he know that that's not the spots not
him it's Kanye West first point goes
first point goes to Kent's here's here
we're going to do this time okay now
we're going to go and find a face okay
focus that times that's good right away
makeup see
female creating the emoji Oh Oh dear me
oh dear oh dear oh dear okay I mean I
don't think that's particularly
representative or the best hairstyle I
don't know what is
then if none of these seeds are you
ready Judy - yes it's this person in
politics it's aw I mean sauce how is she
between yes she's the queen yes this is
this is queen elizabeth queen of
England's my Manik
I think that's um a game but I think
mother okay look away so you can't see
the face person if it Roger sports ball
for that response well maybe maybe this
do you ready Michael Jordan straight
away means no guesses straight in there
with Michael doesn't this one's a nice
clean portrait so we should be able to
get a good ones nest away
here are your hair color options nothing
natural and then all of a sudden that
that's so that is the best we're going
to get ed sheeran you're just thinking
any any ginger haired man
everyone look away I mean I'm gonna have
to edit hair because I know definitely
that we need them so that's kind of the
nearest right and maybe it maybe clothes
I think the leather okay that's probably
the nearest I reckon we can get this is
personally yes very close no itself no
it's a man it's a man Michael Jackson
yeah Roger Roger is on point in this
game I'm just having a joke there so it
will not accept this one
right that's for nearest we're gonna get
I'll put him in a seat though that's a
bit of a you know what I'm gonna take
him answer that see I think it's gonna
throw people off too much but everyone's
in their belly no great actor he has a
funny name is a good approximation no
obviously not have any of them beaten
there's a name similar to a breakfast
food thank you eggs eggs benedict yeah
we're doing okay which is the last last
one looks okay okay I mean okay looks
about as real as normal pretty good
oh it is so good actually you ready does
look I mean it just is they have his
suit I think Roger is a proud winner and
we've all we've all learned a little bit
something about some things a are emojis</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
