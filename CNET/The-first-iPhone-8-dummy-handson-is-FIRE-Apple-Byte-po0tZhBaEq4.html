welcome to the Apple buy for everything
good and bad inside the world of Apple
and the iPhone eight is still getting
all the hype even though we're about
four months away from any announcement
after iPhone leaker Benjamin Gaskin
posted a quick video of an alleged
iPhone 8 dummy model in hand now it's a
better look at what the next flagship
iPhone might look like and he also
included to really clean pics of it now
new renders by Apple eye designer show
us how clean it may look and again these
are all based on purported schematics
that have leaked out the latest batch of
designs have moved away from the rear
touch ID design that might have been an
option but again none of this is
official but you can bet it's pretty
much going to look just like this now
photos claiming to show the molds of
Apple's 2017 iPhone lineup could give us
a potential look at the relative sizes
of the rumored devices from left to
right you can see the iPhone 7s plus the
8 and then the 7s now the iPhone 8 is
smacked in the middle and is expected
not to be too much bigger than the 7s
due to its bezels design Allah the
Samsung Galaxy s8 now in past years
leaked parts have started showing up in
May but the lack of them could indicate
that the next iPhone will be releasing
later in the year as some reports have
claimed guess what we will see all right
the iPhone 8 isn't even out but if you
want to hear a bunk rumor for the week
some Korean outlets like the investor
are already reporting on the iPhone 9
screen sizes now I won't repeat them but
here let's guess it will probably look a
lot like this so stop you guys you know
what again a bad apple like come on too
early now I think everyone who watches
this show knows that I love the iPad pro
and would InStyle cases for the remember
ten point five inch iPad pro have been
revealed by guess who Benjamin Gaskin
now they feature standard cutouts for
the Lightning port and for speaker
grilles but the microphone is in a new
spot at the top center of the backside
like the current nine point seven inch
iPad pro and the new design trend for
Apple in 2017 a vertically aligned rear
camera guests can also released CAD
images and renderings based on the model
that case manufacturers are receiving
from the factory the rent
and these dummy models still show off a
slight bezel on the edges but at the
shorter top and bottom bezels they could
still accommodate a home button now we
are expecting to see new MacBook Pros
and Mac books at the Worldwide
Developers Conference but we could be
surprised with the announcement of the
new 10.5 inch iPad pro and possibly
Apple's first serie based smart speaker
as well but we all know WWDC is where
Apple software has a chance to shine and
I've been begging for something more
from iOS 11 specifically with the iPad I
know you have to now maybe Apple should
hire frederico of a tici of Macs stories
and Sam Beckett who collaborated to give
us io s 11 with drag-and-drop
functionality the concept i OS 11
features moving pictures from one app to
another by dragging and dropping it also
incorporates a shelf that holds onto
things you've copied like you can access
them later and add to other documents or
apps you can move text from one document
and then drag it directly on to your
reminders app and what about a Finder
interface to navigate and handle files
like this would be an iOS like no other
and that's a good thing now we'll see
what Apple can come up with and I'm
always hopeful for WWDC but they're also
going to have to compete with this the
new surface pro for 2017 now the new
high-end model with KB Lake processors
is 1.7 times faster than Apple's current
a 9 X chip but that could change soon
and the new surface pro brings 35% more
battery life with thirteen point five
hours of juice the new surface pen has
been improved as well to support tilt
like the Apple pencil already has so I'm
personally invested and a way team to
see what Apple can do to really amp up
the iPad pro don't let us down because I
don't want any sad apples alright in
tech coming to Apple in the future
Thunderbolt has been on Apple devices
from the beginning thanks to an Intel
Apple partnership now Intel is pushing
for mainstream adoption by releasing the
protocol specification to the industry
under a non-exclusive royalty-free
license Intel plans to integrate
Thunderbolt 3 into future CPUs and that
new all-in-one design will take up less
space on a Mac or pcs logic board and
reduce power consumption since you won't
need a dedicated Thunderbolt controller
now there's no set timeline when the
will happen yet but the new design will
help extend battery life while having a
standard that supports power USB
DisplayPort HDMI and VGA in a single
connection and I know what you're
thinking
dongle Vail I'll write a new report from
digit times claims Apple is already set
for a trial production of the next
generation of display technology it's
micro LED now micro LED is a microscopic
version of standard LEDs that's even
brighter and more power efficient than
current OLED displays they claim Apple
is making a small volume of micro LED
devices this year we probably won't see
them in the Apple watch but the Apple
watch is expected to be the first device
in Apple's lineup that will eventually
make the switch to micro LED all right
let's get to our winners from our
injustice two game codes giveaway I
