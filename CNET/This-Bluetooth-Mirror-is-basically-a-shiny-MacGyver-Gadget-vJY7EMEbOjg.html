perfect spot for added smarts we're
talking voice assistance touchscreens
maybe even personalized beauty tips okay
we're not there yet but this $400 vo
vezo bluetooth mirror takes a step in
that direction
the vezo is a 24 by 32 inch mirror that
includes a border light for makeup work
an anti fog feature for when things get
steamy and a Bluetooth button for
connecting your phone you can even take
calls on it thanks to this small
microphone on the back you just have to
tap one of the three touch sensitive
buttons on the face of the mirror to
activate the three main features the
problem is for $400 this mirror feels a
little like a polished MacGyver gadget
all the features are decent but they
don't cohere in any particularly
compelling or creative way for instance
why include a speaker and a microphone
but no Wi-Fi for a digital assistant
like Alexa or even to Spotify streaming
you might be thinking I shouldn't knock
the vezo for not being a product it's
not trying to be but the potential for
smart mirrors it is inescapable you
don't spend morning's listening to
mirrors you spend morning's looking at
them without something like a
touchscreen or even just visualized
weather traffic updates the whole device
feels just a little underwhelming Plus
even if you're not looking for a mirror
with some impressive IQ the fact is a
hanging mirror like this works best for
a half bathroom where steam isn't an
issue where you probably won't be
applying tons of makeup where you
probably won't be spending tons of time
listening to audiobooks plus if the main
appeal is the speaker you can get way
better sound quality from this $100
bluetooth speaker if you have need of
LED lighting and anti-fog features on a
hanging mirror the vezo isn't a bad deal
but if you're looking for a truly smart
mirror hold off until something comes
along that can really revolutionize your
bathroom</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
