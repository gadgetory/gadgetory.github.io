hammer but how would you like if I told
you this is actually made from Kate buck
and printed with a 3d printer this is
the m4 arm the world's first desktop
full-color 3d printer and it can print a
variety of different objects that look
almost like everyday life they are very
hefty very sturdy even though they are
made out of paper so they're actually a
couple of different components to this
3d printer inside is a traditional 2d
inkjet printer what happens is you feed
in a roll of paper then it is printed
all the color onto the paper surface it
is then cut out a particular shade of
needs to be formed an adhesive layer is
applied and then a heap sight comes down
to press the layer of paper into the one
below in order to start forming the
shape the company claims it is four
times faster than an industrial printer
that they have and you can recycle the
waste plus the printer is using
water-based adhesives and inks this also
means that there are no toxic fumes or
powders released the arc prints at half
an inch per hour which is comparable to
other printers like the MakerBot but it
is not the fastest 3d printer on the
market you can get a couple of
customizable skins for the printer
including a wood carbon fiber finish
a steel brushed finish as well the m4
arc will be available for 5995 pounds or
eight thousand nine hundred and ninety
five US dollars available in q2 of this
year for more on 3d printing and
everything else cool at CES 2016
