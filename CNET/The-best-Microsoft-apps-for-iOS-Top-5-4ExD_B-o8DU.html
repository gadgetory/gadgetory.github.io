did you know that Microsoft is behind
over 70 apps in the Apple App Store it's
true today we're looking at the top 5
Microsoft apps for iOS at number 5
OneNote if you want a place for all your
notes and you're not satisfied with
apples offerings
OneNote is pretty damn good any thought
you have you could put it here written
notes audio notes photos and even making
to do us a number for office lens to put
it simply Microsoft's office lens make
your phone into a pocket scanner it has
several presets including business card
document and whiteboard the app corrects
for any prospective weirdness business
cards can then be added to Microsoft
OneNote documents can be exported as a
word which you can then edit as long as
you're signed in to office 365 at number
3 Skype Microsoft purchased Skype way
back in 2011 Skype is still one of the
best ways to have video and audio chats
with people on any platform it doesn't
matter if you're trying to talk to
someone on Android iOS Windows or Mac
Skype will work on everything from
everything at number two it's a
three-way tie Word Excel and PowerPoint
let's face it every single productivity
suite is trying to be as good as
Microsoft Office Microsoft's three
versions of Word Excel and PowerPoint
for iOS seem at home on iOS devices
especially Apple's iPad pro line and the
number one app made by Microsoft for iOS
is outlook because outlook is awesome it
does email better than Apple and Google
yeah I said it outlook is really several
apps in one because it combines email
with calendar and your contacts email
management is really clean outlook and
easily handled multiple accounts and
supports gestures to put away he master
the calendar part is excellent and it's
kind of like sunrise which makes a lot
of sense since Microsoft bought sunrise
if you're not using outlook you should
really try it out you want more top
fives check out top 5 to Netcom we'll
see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
