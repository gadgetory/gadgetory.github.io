Casey Patterson aren't losing sleep over
the Rio Olympics instead they're
tracking it with tech we're using it to
to get the best performance we can in
Rio with a wearable called whoop
the Olympians enter activities and
training for the day and then see what
it takes to recover gives me the
opportunity to know my maximum amount of
sleep needed to perform at my peak the
next day's kind of breaks down your
sleep and how much light sleep you're
getting how much deep sleep you're
getting how much RAM you know you can
see with you if you're recovering at
night members of the US Olympic swim
team including Ryan Lochte and Michael
Phelps used whoomp leading up to the
games
Phelps as longtime trainer tracks sleep
latency which is how fast you fall
asleep we started to put in some of the
training correlations so volume
intensity their subjective rate of
perceived exertion and we achieved great
ideal success before a lot of these
devices came out I would say like the
way that it's changed it just gives us a
little bit deeper look into the athlete
in the athlete's body and how they
respond to it the US Olympic women's
volleyball team hopes to get the jump on
the competition with a device called
vert which tracks the number and height
of jumps for the US track cycling team
the focus has been on smart eyewear
called solos which look like Google
glass a small heads up display puts
training metrics in real-time in the
writers field of view they also get
audio coaching cues all of the sensors
that are currently being used to track
these metrics like speed power and
cadence are being sent to the smart
phone that aggregates all of this
information and then sends it to the
eyewear in a way that is customizable by
the user
soon they hope they'll be wearing gold
medals in San Francisco Lexus Avedis
