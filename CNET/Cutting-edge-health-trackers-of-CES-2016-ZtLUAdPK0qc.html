cnet's live coverage from CES 2016 I'm
Sheamus burn the editor down at cnet
Australia now health tech is absolutely
one of the big trends at CES and there
are a lot of products on show they can
help you live a healthier life not just
your standard fitness trackers but also
some stuff that's going to a lot more
detail and we have a few folks here from
three companies on our scene that stage
we're going to share a little bit about
what they're working on so please make
welcome mark peluso CEO of cardio we
abducted joe anderson clinical science
at level and zach bombs to the CTO and
co-founder at allit thank you cheers now
I think we'll have a bit of a look at
each of you in turn so you can kind of
do your initial d round people get a
sense of what's going on with each of
you I think your market will start with
you I think kardia seems like they have
a really complete package but we're
talking about very sort of detailed
health analytics that go a long way
beyond some of the stuff that people
might just be wearing on their wrist at
the moment yeah I mean one way to
describe what queria does is we make
medical devices that don't look like a
medical devices and that people actually
like to use and so we focus specifically
on the heart and the heart dealt and so
we have three products when it's called
cuarto arm it is a blood pressure
monitor the second one is called party
obeys and is a body weight and body
analyzer and the third one is called
cardio core and is a wearable ECG
monitor no cardio arming for the visit
on the market quarter poor will be on
the market after we get left year proven
later this year so when you show us
their the cheap products you got in
front of us here this is a quarter on
it's a believe it or not a blood
pressure monitor so you'll never guess
it's a blood pressure monitor it's
something that if you have on your desk
in the office or on your coffee table in
the living room people will never guess
what it is and when is it time to use it
you simply open it like so and it goes
on your upper arm which is what the
doctor likes for you to take a
measurement
there you go simple as that and we have
app for iphone android and kindle and
all you have to do you get a very large
start button and you press the button
and it starts the measurement after a
few seconds so the street at how squeeze
anything yeah is doing a measurement
right now now ideally you're not
supposed to talk throughout the
measurement we focus really on creating
features that makes it easy and
convenient for everybody to measure the
blood pressure kind of here doing its
thing they're just from here yeah so how
long does a typical measurement take
with this sort of a device it's about 40
seconds 55 seconds see with me talking
with you really have to make a miracle
what you get is something that looks
like this you see the volume that around
the other way maybe in might be able to
get a good shot okay
so you can see on a table whether your
measurement is online is healthy or not
and as a number of features like friends
and family so for example if my father
is connected to me I can see every
measurement he takes so from far away I
can keep an eye on him and make sure
that is measuring is blood pressure as
often as it should cool and let's have a
quick look at the base as well animals
Olivia but the other guys show what's
sure they've brought it this is the
newest thing in your range right yes
this is this a came on the market only a
few months ago this is quite a base so
as a nice design makes it look like it's
floating on on the floor that makes it
to the ball it's a scary you don't have
to hide inside the closet or behind the
buff up and as a the two ways to
interact so like any other scale it will
display your way number and as well as
you are fat and body composition so
muscle water and bone mass but also in
smart feedback mode will give you
feedback with smiles so depending on
whether you are on on target or not with
your weight it will give a different
smile and will also vibrate under your
50 differently so that eliminate the
judgment moment in the morning when you
walk into the bathroom and I have people
focus more on on what they are doing
with their lifestyle whether they are
progressing towards their weight goals
or not yeah cool so yeah joe I it'll be
great you've got to cut a whole
different thing what most people might
be used to it when we think about health
tracking because it's actually taking a
breath sample to analyze something
completely unexpected that's true what
we what we have though really is a way
to change the conversation about weight
and weight loss instead of looking at
the scale which is typically used for
weight loss looking at fat water bone
mass of muscle mass we want to focus in
on looking at fat metabolism how much
fatter you burning the idea is if the
scale is not moving is it because you're
not losing fat or is it simply because
you're building up more muscle and
increasing water weight so the way we do
that is we take a breath and in your
breath you have a chemical called
acetone and acetone increases with
increasing fat burn or fat metabolism
the more fat you're burning the more
acetone you're producing the more it
shows up in your breath so the great
thing about this as well as there's a
bunch of clinical science that's been
done over the last 20 to 30 years that
relates how much acetone is correlated
with the amount of fat you burn per day
per week so I asked that's like nail
polish remover right that's certified
you get you get that a lot certainly
yeah but your breath won't actually
smell like that it's yeah this can smell
that on your break right so this is
going to detect acetone at parts per
million levels very very low levels we
all have about one part per million on
our breath in terms of acetone as you
elevate you get up to two parts per
million and higher so how many times a
day would are you kind of need to be
using this this particular product we
are recommending once a day maybe twice
a day because it takes about three to
seven days this is the clinical science
to increase your fat metabolism to
change your fat burn however the sad
thing is the opposite is true the
opposite is greater if you come off fat
metabolism maybe have a lot of beer you
go out with your friends it can be 24 to
36 hours that you come down so it takes
it takes the course of days to kind of
elevate yeah right cool so and I can
essentially yeah I'll do it quick quick
demonstration but here's the level
device it has a breath pod here that you
that you blow into what you do is you
take a deeper breath you hold it for
about five seconds you exhale into the
pot for about five seconds and then you
place it back into the level device and
you close it up and I think you can see
that it that it's spending here the the
front should be spending and provide a
value and it gives you this what we call
a level score thats related to the
actual concentration of acetone so here
we have a three and we then have an app
that shows not only your level score but
if you push the number here you're also
get you
our parts per million but more
importantly the thing we like most about
it is it tells you how many pounds of
fat your predicted to lose per day per
week if you keep the value that your
breath asked and level at that value
cool yeah that's really good do you see
that well we're getting some detail
shortly and well yeah jump over to
outlet here and talk about I guess you
know we're talking a very specific niche
where there's I guess very specific
problems for parents but you've come up
with a really clever way to to track
this right yes so you know what we've
done is we've taken this amazing
Hospital technology called pulse
oximetry night we all know that is the
little red clip the little little excuse
me a little red light that they put on
your finger at the hospital to get heart
rate in oxygen what we've done it outlet
is we've focused on taking this
technology and miniaturizing it but more
importantly making it appropriate for
monitoring in the home as a parent
myself money of many of our founders and
the company parents we know the stress
is that new parents are going through
right we you come home from the hospital
with this with this newborn and there's
no instruction manual and you're given a
list of all the things to watch for
right it's just it's just it's it's it's
a very very intense time in your life
and so we as the founders really
understood the pain that we're trying to
address here and by taking this this
technology and addressing that market to
deliver the peace of mind that hey I
just want to know is my baby okay so
what we do is we as I mentioned we've
taken this technology and we shrunk it
down into a miniature little baby sock
they slipped right right over the toes
of the baby and then using this
technology we using non-invasive light
we're transmitting red and infrared
light through the skin we can we can
detect the baby's heart rate and their
oxygen levels will then stream that
information to the base station the base
station is the primary alert unit for
the parents the we've tried to simplify
the design as much as possible we don't
want parents over sesang so over
obsessing over the numbers we want them
to be able to look at the base station
and know immediately if everything's
okay or if baby needs attention so once
that information is is sent over to the
base station it's then sent up to the
cloud where a parent can
assess that information from their smart
device again our our focus here is we
want to be in the background we don't
want parents over obsessing over that
data we want to be in the background and
we want to let them know confidently
that hey we're here when it means to
when it matters most but if you're not
hearing from us don't be thinking of us
right will lurch if something's wrong so
if they if they do like to obsess and
they open up that app like would they'd
see like real-time data coming from
there yes yes so we you know we do
provide those those vital signs right
there on the phone so they can see the
vitals in real time we've got a lot of
parents that have you know found ways to
figure out when babies really sleeping
hey I found if my heart if my baby's
heart rate is below 110 I can put them
down and they're not going to wake up
again you know so so there are little
ways that parents have found little
little niche ways to start using the
product but no the main goal here is
peace of mind and letting parents know
babies okay look what I think the first
thing I wanted to sort of digging on in
a general sense across you guys is I'm
wondering if it's like really the
hardware that's been you know that kind
of first difficult step with this stuff
or is it actually a you know a software
and an analytics problem to to really
create something like this that's
helpful to people you know I imagine on
Oak Rd with your sort of chess system
you're talking about replacing a far
more complicated system that would need
to be attached to somebody's chest yeah
is it that sort of research that has to
go first into exactly where you're
putting sensors and how you maintain
skin contact or you know like what was
that first big challenge you had to
solve the way we look at it is they are
part of the same thing really and so you
can really do one without doing the
other in fact for us there is a third
element as well which is the services
that we are in the cloud so also the
connectivity side of the equation is
very important so you really have to
conceive and develop all these elements
together and in parallel so that you
have a solution that works for everybody
how about you guys with outlet again I
think I certainly one of you guys
earlier about the fact that you've kind
of redesigned where it's even placed on
on the baby's body yes
one of the challenges you know pulse
oximetry is is is usually placed by
someone in the medical industry that's
that's skilled and they know where to
place of where they're going to get the
right sensor contact so one of our
design challenges was how do we make a
mom get this sensor in the right spot
the first time and that's that's hard
when you've got an infant's foot that
will quadruple in size the first year so
a big emphasis was on you know designing
the sock designing the way that the
sensor module interfaces so that we can
we can ensure the parents are getting
those sensors placed right now
additionally being being wireless helps
us right because we don't have to worry
about that tether point that's that's
moving those sensors around that but
yeah that's that's that's one of the
challenges our readers only is only as
good as where that sensor is getting the
reading from and so a lot of emphasis
put on the design there to ensure that
that the sensor placement is correct
cool and enjoy with you guys obviously
you talked about something that's a
clinical technology over a long time but
how do you try to make sure you still
getting the data right but you're able
to scale it into something that might
you know sit in somebody's bathroom yeah
beside the sink absolutely there's
there's two pieces here number one was
the sensor technology and getting that
to a spot where you can make this into a
consumer device and sell it for a price
point that consumers are going to
appreciate and be able to scale it the
other side was really a challenge in the
thought process a lot of people think
when you measure this chemical in your
breath it should be used for a clinical
diagnostic and the great thing about the
founder was he thought very differently
he thought this can be used for health
and wellness we can use a sort of
measurement of acetone eda breath or
health and wellness as opposed to just
simply a very clinical tool for disease
monitoring cool and now he's the other
kind of big one I think is if we're
talking about technologies here that
really can deliver very detailed
information reams and reams of data
points to somebody un ultimately you
want to make it useful to somebody you
know the average person doesn't know how
to you know go through a spreadsheet of
you know their heart history or you know
something else so how important is is
that and again I think this scale is an
interesting concept you know when did
you decide actually maybe it may be just
a little bit of a smiley face is all we
need to do to give someone feedback from
the issue that people find in taking
care of themselves is actually sticking
to their commitments or adherence to
whatever prescription they got from the
doctors and so on so creating products
that they make it easier for people to
to do that it's very important and so
that it's something to do with design
with the detailed research and the user
experience user interface side and
creating interfaces like smart feedback
interface with a smile is exactly the
kind of thing that kind of makes it
makes the the prodigal lot more
approachable for people and so what
exactly is that feedback point when you
see the smile like is this based on have
you set that up somewhere else saying I
want I have a target in mind or or I
just want you to keep an eye on a
trained in my weight like what exactly
is it trying to deliver through that so
in the the typical consumer journeys you
decide to for example lose weight and
then you will have some days that you
lose weight some days that a bit weight
goes a bit a bit up or you go to the gym
and you work at a lock and you build up
muscle mass which is actually heavier so
you get leaner but your weight goes up
and so all these kind of things create
negative feedback for people even when
they are doing well and so with the
smile you and we eliminate all of that
and forms people on what's working for
them and so the smile is a that you get
is a function of what train you're on
for the last several days right and so
the daily fluctuation get get out of the
equation and and the scale actually
recognizes for example that you have
more lean mass and so even if your
weight goes out you still get a smile
excellent yeah and now again the whole
idea of level is a simple number based
on something I guess most people might
even understand this when they first see
it and think they might buy it but just
making it really simple and that
absolutely is the biggest challenge that
we had for the level device was you have
this number that's a concentration of a
chemical that no one's ever heard of
right so the messaging is absolutely
critical and that
really general for I think every sort of
device that you're trying to take from a
medical equipment side into the
consumers hands is trying to get them
educated relatively rapidly without
making them a physician right so a lot
of our messaging is simply around that
to say hey look what we're really trying
to help you out with is to measure fat
metabolism the chemical is beside the
point or whatever the metric is the
physical measurement is really beside
the point we're going to help you
measure fat metabolism and we're going
to get this done and let us tell you
what that means and so when you get that
level score and whether it's your lower
your high you will know hey I'm doing
things right and if it's if it's low if
it's too or less then we will provide
you some general guidelines and here's
here's a second piece is once you have
those general guidelines then you get to
figure out about your body and I think
we're all trying to some some way to do
that what's going on inside our own body
that's different than someone else's
body or your body or my body so all
those pieces so we're about to wrap up
so like maybe a one quick line from each
you what do you what do you think people
you know when they're caring about
health take now what should they try to
focus on I guess rather than just
numbers or whatever it might be just you
know one quick line from each of you
actually actionable data actionable
information yeah something the user can
understand and go forward with and
connectivity so you get the information
in the hands of the people that can make
the most value out of it maybe your
family or friend your doctor</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
