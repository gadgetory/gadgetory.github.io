today we're taking a first look at
armored 39 no Armour 39 isn't the last
weapon in some Alien Shooter it's
actually a fitness tracker from athlete
apparel maker Under Armour its Under
Armour's first foray to the red-hot
Fitness gadget market so it in everybody
invites comparisons to Nikes Fuel band
but ARMA 39 is a different product I
suspect is going after a different kind
of gym rat one that's a bit more
hardcore for one I'm route 39 as a strap
that goes around your chest or slightly
below sorry ladies I won't be modeling
this one for you today on one side of
the strap are the sensors to monitor
your heart rate on the other side what
an arm were called it's bug which acts
is the brain of the tracker the boat
takes all the data uses bluetooth to
transmit the information to your phone
the bug could be removed so you can wash
the rest of the strap which trust me
gets dirty pretty quickly armor 39
measures a few key metrics heart rate
intensity calories burned in time but
what sets armor 39 apart from other
fitness trackers is that it takes the
data and calculates each workout into a
willpower score that ranges between 1
and 10 yes willpower is one of those
made up metrics like Nike Fuel points
but unlike Nike which has a score that
constantly accumulates willpower acts
more like an assessment of each workout
session I worked out with Armour 39 half
a dozen times and I realized I'm not
particularly intense or have a whole lot
of willpower in fact fingers got
gradually worse at the two weeks or so
went on for better worse I'm not as
hardcore about working out and the stats
definitely showed the readings as you
can imagine are more accurate than the
Fitbit or FuelBand which uses
accelerometers to track your progress by
capturing your heartrate you get a
better read of how well or how poorly
you're performing
I like the app interface which was clean
and simple but it was a little limited
on what it could do I was hoping for a
website version with more detailed stats
as well as the ability to share with
your friends Armour 39 only works with
iOS devices right now
Under Armour also introduced a watch
that can sync with this heart monitor
negating the need for an iOS device but
it's not yet available for consumers
overall Armour 39 takes accurate
measurements and is a decent although
somewhat limited way of measuring the
progress of your workouts but I'm not
sure I want to carry around a strap to
the gym it's just another thing I have
to remember
armored 39 is definitely for the intense
gym rat for cnet.com I'm Roger Chang and
this has been a first look at armor 39</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
