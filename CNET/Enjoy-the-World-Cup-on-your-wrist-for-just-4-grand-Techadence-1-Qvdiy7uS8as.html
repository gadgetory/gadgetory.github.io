football World Cup is arguably one of
the most anticipated and highly viewed
sporting events in the entire world so
what's the best way of actually keeping
up to date with all of the scores sure
you could track all the way over to
Russia and watch all the games in person
in amongst the screaming crowds but I
think I found a whole heap more
civilized and dare I say decadent way of
keeping up to date with the scores
there's this the Oh blow World Cup 2018
SmartWatch welcome to decadence so I'll
get this out of the way now the full
official name for this watch is the you
blow Big Bang referee 2018 World Cup
Russia SmartWatch it's a big flashy name
but then this is a big flashy watch take
a close look and you'll see these strong
lines and this almost industrial look
cut not from everyday run-of-the-mill
stainless steel but from titanium which
of course is much cooler it's 49 milk
ace makes it quite large and that's
great it's not a slender watch that
hides away under your suit jacket it's a
big beast that stands out making a real
statement and that statement is
undeniably I love football
not only is Oh blow the official
timekeeper for the World Cup but this
watch will actually be on the wrists of
the referees on the pitchers now it's an
Android wear SmartWatch with a digital
face of course and it will give referees
instant goal-line information about
whether that goal really did go in or if
it was just a cunning trick of the light
but if you're not actually a
professional referees standing on the
pitch in the stadium what do you get
from the watch there
in short a wealth of information about
the whole World Cup it'll notify you 15
minutes before the start of every match
letting you always know who's about to
play it pings you right as kickoff
starts and throughout the game you'll be
among the first to know when a team
scores which player scored it when a red
or yellow card is given or who's being
substituted you can customize it to
choosing a watch face with your
country's flag to show your support to
the team which of course you can change
to a more successful team once your
country gets knocked out
maybe Brazil oh that's a mess it means
you can keep your eye on the competition
still but keeping far away from the
general hustle and bustle and noise and
chaos of the football world instead of
getting vitriolic at home screaming and
shouting in my own TV about a bad
decision the refs made I get to recline
here in the meridian hotels Terrace bar
in the heart of London Piccadilly with a
gin and tonic in my hands made of course
with only the best of London's gym I can
get comfy
safe and the knowledge that I'm not
gonna miss even a single kick of the
World Cup now being honest for a moment
I am no lover of football while I can
tell you the names of both of Taylor
Swift's cats dr. Meredith Grey and
detective Olivia Benson I can't name a
single player on the England squad but
thanks to the information given to me by
this watch when I leave here and I'm
inevitably asked did you see the game
last night
I can probably bluff my way for a
conversation about sport instead of
simply ignoring the question and turning
the conversation onto the topic of cake
with only 2018 of these watches being
made it's certainly an exclusive
timepiece and with the price of 4,300
pounds it doesn't come cheap now if
you're interested for that money you
could get a hundred and seven tickets
thorn of the opening games of the
competition or two until you get
yourself a massive TV for your living
room with plenty of money left over for
beer and snacks or perhaps get a good
trainer for your kid in the hope that
one day they'll make a World Cup team
and can just take you along for the ride
but the Watchers crew
short match info it's different watch
faces to celebrate your country's team
and its Stark titanium design makes this
the way to keep track of every kick
every header every goal of the 2018
World Cup in a much more comfortable and
civilized manner that suits me just fine
we're gonna need another one of these
nice so what do you make of the you blow
Big Bang referee World Cup 2018
SmartWatch is 4,300 pounds simply too
much money to keep track of all the
goals of the World Cup let us know in
