to rumor has it I'm cream levy and I'm
Emily Dreyfuss and this is the show
where we round up the week's hottest
tech rumors and then we bet on them to
see who understands the rumour mill
better turns out it's not usually me but
if you will take a look at the
whiteboard of shame somebody's winning
where it counts for one more one do we
have it is there a sound of clapping for
clapping because she felt sorry for me
and we took to sucker bets one was that
Apple came out or they had their
education event yes we were they
literally the the invitation was like we
are having an education event next week
and then we bet on whether it would be
about books that about whether or not i
would have to do with the ibook software
and I against everything in my heart but
said of course it will be said maybe not
I mean the invitation said I basically
said this is gonna be my books like
without actually saying that because
what else would be about an Emily was a
gracious gentlemen and was just like I'm
gonna say no that's not what it's about
the thing is what you guys are about to
discover is that I am a very gracious
winner and I am a very sore loser right
yes I am you're about to see me just
sitting here stealing in my angry juices
you should move then Emily's like well
this is what I should do for humiliation
day I'll play a video game I'm like
great doesn't think that's embarrassing
that's embarrassing you guys haven't
seen me play a video game it's horrible
I am terrible at it I die all the time
but if we're videotaping you do that in
the your own house how is that
embarrassing we show it on the show I
walked around in a banana suit I mean
and lay it in public yeah I think I
should go out in public and like pretend
to be Mario or something to jump around
yeah maybe challenge people like I am
like a hustler I could challenge the how
do you gave a little banishing I think
that's a little better like we'll go to
the video down cake gamespot yeah yeah I
would be like boys watch here to be
challenged you see I was saying I was
thinking to a video arcade at like the
movie theater where it's a bunch of 12
year olds and you just come with a roll
of quarters and be like all right who
wants to play and then just like pit you
know we could whatever just give them a
quarter to I mean that's cool that would
be totally fine by me or we could go to
the bowling alley where they have your
kid and then they have dance dance
revolution dove em okay at Dance Dance
Revolution I still look like a fool but
I managed to pass levels but that's
pretty embarrassing anyway just jammed
Anton's revolution in public is kind of
originating that I kind of like it so
let's let's let's see that maybe on
Sunday we'll go to the video arcade
right and take care take care of a
little humiliation lots of movies i want
to c 2 is it for next week is it next
week is humiliation day or the weekend
so next week is the last show of this
month okay so it's it's fine by me if we
do it then like I don't need to do it
the first offender it depends on when we
can get ourselves to a video arcade if
that's in fact what we decide to do okay
yeah if you give us all any better ideas
for how you want me to embarrass myself
leo sore loser I also know what I'll do
it does anybody use or lose me I I am
such a sore loser that literally my
family will not play Scrabble with me
because I i think i'm gonna be okay
about it I'm like it'll be fine even if
I lose it's no big deal it's like just a
game I'm not gonna take it to heart
ain't no thing and then the moment that
someone in my family begins to win like
my mind just shuts down i get so angry
it's like I can't deal with it I need to
go to like rage therapy um about losing
I one time was playing Scrabble and my
friend at the time was always always won
every single time we play it and what
time I could not handle it we were at a
coffee shop playing cuz that's what you
did in college huh I started crying I'll
optional Rajan's
wasn't even losing by that bad and I do
it well and I think it's particularly
difficult for us because we're copy
editors and writers this all type of
lousy people expect us to win and then
when we don't win they gloat about it's
like oh look at you Emily you're the
writer and you didn't even know that key
was a word do because this is why I
don't like about competitive Scrabble
players can I just get this off my chest
those two letter words that you just
only know about because of Scrabble
should be disallowed Qi Shuai Shuai I
play that on words with friends all the
time ridiculous I know I don't like it I
agree I agree because i feel like if
that should be allowed than qua Tyrion
let's just have proper names and high
wit big nouns like yeah and Latin in
Spanish I will have vosotros por favor
okay okay sorry all right shall we get
to our first rumour yes please sorry
scrabbles I have Scrabble players
everywhere I know you love it I not to
cry next time I pay um I'm losing really
bad on words with friends with everybody
I'm playing right now so you should play
key more um okay ready see you have the
first luma the first rumour is could
Instagram come to Windows Phone before
it comes to android so this rumor comes
to us from our very very best friend
frontline Andrew yeah you let him at CES
it was so fun we gave him a t-shirt it
was so nice to see that chat room right
now yes in the chatroom line it was so
great to have you there in the audience
with us in vegas probably here to make
sure i don't f up the rumor that he
submitted to us he's like I'm very
interesting take on that so anyway so a
source recently left the impression I
don't know what that means so the story
comes from Fast Company dot-com recently
left the impression that the Windows
Phone team has possibly been working
with the people from Instagram why would
instagram come to an OS with such a low
market share because it's sexy and I
think that with integrated handles
images so one bones are really great at
nokia has good you know yeah cameras &amp;amp;
under windows phone 7 s new design
approach however devices have to live up
to a certain standard and that works for
Instagram as well because all the phones
that they use that they have there oh
whatever app on has a good camera and
that is the iphone so yeah and that is
the solitary only phone that they have
their app on is the iphone which kind of
flows with the windows fun thing you
know has a nice design the OS is really
sleek yeah um it's about usability not
about customization exactly and not
about power really it's more about the
hardware they don't want to deal with
slow hardware and cheap cameras like
they wanted you know high-end kind of
stuff and unfortunately you'll never
come to the iPad exactly so um also
designing an app for Windows Phone 7
means Instagram wouldn't be dealing with
the fragmentation that comes with dozens
of models of Android SAT phones which i
think is true because then with an
android phone you have a lot of crappy
cameras a lot of slow inside parts and a
lot of old like i would if and if
instagram came to android i would want
it but i'm running like the oldest
version of android that there is yeah
and it wouldn't be optimized for it be
optimized the camera is only mediocre
and you know and it was like a 10 second
lag exactly and so I think Instagram is
really really wants to maintain a level
of awesomeness and to do that they'll
have to you know stick with iphone and
maybe go to windows and not that android
phones aren't good because they are and
the ones are great and they're fast and
whatever but you know that story just
came out that android is like now the
new developers uh OS of choice exactly
but because they have a lot of low-end
phones on the market i think then it's
hard to for instagram to like pick and
choose like it can't just go to the you
know droid razr or whatever the ass bone
it has to go to all of them I mean
unless they just say it's only
compatible with like ice cream sandwich
which would be a way for them to only
get on the top of the line phone I mean
I think they will like Instagram is
gonna come to Ice Cream Sandwich I think
this rumors are saying it'll come to
Windows Phone are absolutely I think so
which means that google
got burnt because that I was saying
something in if those eight people over
at Instagram that's apparently their
whole company they're just like eight or
nine people are like the eight or nine
richest people like geniuses over there
are really killing it and so they're
like you know what I think we're going
to go with the underdog here we're going
to go to Windows next and so everybody
involved in this rumors really
tight-lipped Instagram CEO Kevin Systrom
was like I don't know I don't want to
say anything which is super obvious
because he doesn't want to really burn
google out loud yet you know you don't
want to mess with you don't as i said
and i like the mob because because then
google is going to come out with
instagram plus and make you join it if
you want to have a gmail account and
then buy instagram against instagrams
will yeah and then by and by blackberry
and then just be like well in order to
use anything you have to use our version
of Instagram plus a circle also you have
to have google plus yeah in order to use
any of this also who use gmail and
download google chrome I mean I feel
like they're crazy so God I gotta say
instagram has replaced my addiction for
words with friends I'll use it all the
time costly and I feel sorry for android
users that you don't have it yet but how
does it do the same thing as words with
friends no I mean I'm addicted it's an
actual yeah it's icy it's like the best
parts of Twitter and Facebook like
combine like the pictures from facebook
and like little comments or whatever and
hashtags and at replies or whatever from
Twitter combined and you can upload to
Twitter and Facebook from Instagram the
same time I'll just cool mean I gotta
say I'm not generally that jealous of
you who have iphones like I don't as you
guys know I don't care about Siri I
don't care about a lot of the things the
iphone i don't think it's screen is like
prettier than mine i love the screen on
my phone but not being able to use
Instagram makes me so sad I mean it's
the apps it really was like I had um an
android phone I had black well I had a
blackberry phone and then I was like
okay I needed to get an android because
I'm so jealous of all these apps and
then I had android and I got all these
like hipstamatic replacements that like
his word and I'll of somatic and then
finally I got my iphone I was like
that's it like I'm never gonna get
another phone and it's not because of
the phone itself I could care less it's
because of the apps it and will
I have hipstamatic or like not hip
somatic I have the the retro camera for
android because Instamatic is not for
Android and what's so annoying about it
is that when i send the pictures from
that app to twitter they show up as tiny
thumbnails unless people are mm like
sign up for that out oh and then it has
like the all that but really all these
ads and when we were at CES I was
tweeting like what I thought were so my
artistic shots of the back lot of CES
and I kept getting all these tweets from
people being like that looks like a tiny
thumbnail could you please enlarge
you're doing something wrong I have a
couple apps that are a little bit better
than that that aren't as hipstamatic II
but that can you can do some like old
old timey they need that yeah the actual
camera sucks i want to play with it yeah
totally and I after getting Instagram I
don't even use hipstamatic and the cool
thing about Instagram is you can use
hipstamatic and then upload the photo
you know another jelly so you can like I
mean there's all sorts of possibilities
so it's super cool you can see what your
friends are posting it's like a stream
of pictures which is really funny um so
I don't know that this would be we did
do a story on Android Atlas recently
that they are working on it for Android
it just I guess Windows Phone just gonna
beat up to yeah which in I mean which is
just a big snap if you exactly yes yes
oh yeah so this would be a huge boon for
Microsoft which is my new favorite
company because the xbox now I love I
just want to put that out there that I
love Microsoft because of the xbox 360
that I just got one minute ago but the
pig is the biggest problem that people
have with Windows Phone is that there
aren't enough apps for it and so if
there aren't enough phones running well
right there aren't enough anything for
ya but if like one of the biggest apps
goes to Windows Phone first that's going
to be a huge Venable so you know I need
a new phone and I would go to Windows
Phone in a second just because I don't
want to be an iphone user I never have
wanted to be one if it had obviously
needs Pandora which I can get our he has
in need I need Instagram with a movie
zap from fluh from no not Netflix but
from rotten tomatoes where it's like you
can see what's on and you can see what
um what their scores are and I need Yelp
and I need facebook and near times and
that's about it so I then I'll go
and I think most of those are on I don't
know i just i imagine i don't know
what's on there if there's not a
facebook or twitter one and that's
ridiculous but i'm sure there is i'm
sure there is too i don't know about the
new york times one but i don't know i
think like if you had iphone for just a
month you think i would love it i think
i would never want I think it's just the
most like a user-friendly easiest if if
if you don't want to do very much with
your phone if you just want it to work
yes but I wanted to work for phone calls
is the it does is it good yeah they're
fine all right it's really fine I think
it was just I think it was like I got
brownie i have AT&amp;amp;T you know I and I
ever eyes eyes but I had so many friends
who had the iphone on ATT and I could
never hear what they were saying yeah
and then i would call them and they'd
and that called him like four times and
then they'd call me days later and say
you never called me that day and like
their phone would literally not even
register a mask on I think that was an
AT&amp;amp;T thing not an iphone thing because
I've knock on wood never had a problem
with my verizon phone except the other
day when it just bricked for no reason
and then I had good and then I was like
I don't know what to do and i went to
jason parker and i was like he was like
let me read the deadpan on your face
takes an emergency i was like doing that
thing where you press both but whatever
and he did it and it worked yeah so he
picks my ipad 12 thanks Jason okay shall
we get to the next aroma yes please okie
dokie this one is a valve a new luma
actually it's an older and recombine
with the new thing the new thing is the
iBooks to which was released last week
Apple the thing that is making me lose
this spot is Oscar bed this month um I
books to was released by apple as you
know because they're trying to reinvent
the textbook and I have a lot of
feelings about it because even though it
seems really awesome I think the semi
hubris of assuming that American
classrooms are gonna be able to
integrate iPads into every classroom
when we're in such a budget crunch is a
little bit ridiculous so unless they get
a really good deal from Apple but Apple
didn't announce any sort of education
discount so it's kind of ridiculous like
I was expecting in that announcement
that they would announce
yeah discount 11 ipad for every student
kind of thing like the wop or like if
you if you are a public education system
you can get it at cost or something like
that yeah they didn't say anything about
that which has led some people to
believe that this gives extra fodder to
the ipad 3 rumor that that the ipad 3
will come in two configurations a
cheaper and a better version and then
the cheaper version would be what would
be sent to schools to be integrated in
the classroom ok so that brings us to
this rumor which is that I books to code
reveals HD images possibly indicating
that the ipad 3 will in fact have a
Retina display which we've talked about
before we talked about to be judged by
the time yes so but this is like actual
more solid evidence evidence exactly and
I mean it could just be an easter egg it
could just be a red herring buried in
the code but what they found our images
labeled within the code the the
supporting files of ibooks to and iTunes
you labeled to X dot PNG and then when
you look when you compare those images
when you actually take them out of the
code and look at the image they are huge
and what the people over at mac rumors
macrumors no no 9to5 mac said of them is
that it seems as though they are the
exact right size to support a device
that would be 2048 x 1536 pixel
resolution which is way bigger than
1080p which is the current HD and so
that is the retina display like that is
what a retina retina display of the size
of an ipad would be so it's kind of
interesting there's also what i think is
sort of interesting bout this room or
two is that it doesn't involve any
unnamed sources are aiming for one for
once it's just the obsessive it's
because they didn't go through digit
times could've it's like money
laundering they should have sent this
rumor through digitized add together got
bullied to get a couple unnamed sources
in there um but actually it was just the
dudes over at 95 mac who are obsessed
and who had found images like this in
iOS 5 when it first came out
and said oh my god this indicates that
the iPhone 5 is going to come out and
have this and then at that time this was
like a year ago Apple then responded to
that and said that was just a row
graphic designer yeah the future well
and that engages exactly and that's what
they say that they do that in the code
they oh they put like a million
different things and then the minute
that a new OS or a new something comes
out a new program or new app that all
these like crazy developer people who
know how to read code go in there and
like I found this yaks GP you know jpg
oh my god it's gonna be a microwave yeah
and so they fight you know and and Apple
probably puts like you said a lot of red
herrings and yeah weird they're just
like whatever put it and see what the
response is maybe our see if it's
possible and I mean I think with the
with the retina display in particular
there's so much a rat surrounding that
rumor to say that it's true i mean we've
had it reports from manufacturers in
China who are working on it and we've
had specific reports from unnamed
sources about the progress that they're
making of getting it done and who's
making it and is it LG making it or is
it going to be a sharp screen or what's
gonna or how many cores of LEDs will it
have like there's so many specific
rumors I think we are going to have a
Retina display I mean yeah and I think
that that obvious it's almost obvious
yeah why wouldn't that you know if they
have the you know the technology to do
it to have a thinner whatever or even a
little bit thicker I remember that's one
of the reasons that might be a little
thicker remember the retina display
Samson's reading the chat room but is
that reminded me I was from Samsung I
was wondering we need to go back and
look at what Sam's I'm release it say
yes to see if anything happened with the
return adduce plea that was so like
episode 8i think and we tried to
sensationalize that headline by saying
samsung is releasing the rich unity to
see um but yeah I don't know I think
that this means it's gonna have the ipad
that it's gonna have the retina display
on the ipad 3 I don't know what it says
about whether or not there's gonna be
iPad Mini or just a regular old ipad 3
that has everything one commenter on
this story wrote if the ipad 3 has a
retina display a better camera Siri and
quad-core it'll be the best tablet ever
I was like we already know
and the thing is yeah it's already the
best time whatever without any ways like
and if they can drop it to 199 yeah it's
gonna be unbeatable and it'll be
unbeatable like it's ready and party is
and then it's still 600 all so I think
thanks for your advice to grant all
right things I think thanks guy I really
i don't know i like the idea of a
smaller cheaper version of it for four
um first not even yeah for sure for me
yeah i mean i think it's i just think
that apple has to do that i know that
apple is not one to ever introduced a
discount product or a cheaper product
but it rubbed me the wrong way that they
announced this initiative for children
that is amazing but we live in a stratus
stratified the world where some people
have a lot and some people don't and if
you are going to say we need to educate
our kids and here's this technology that
will make it better and only the people
who can afford to spend six hundred
dollars for their kids ipad brain I mean
and then a lot of people I talked about
this on Twitter and a lot of people
wrote back to me and said well I'm in
college or I'm in graduate school and
I'm studying foreign economics and my
textbooks cost six hundred dollars in a
semester so for me it would be right
it's economical anyway is economical but
it's not for a fourth grader right
especially when you're in a school where
they actually just give you the textbook
so you don't even have to buy them you
know you just have to wrap them in a
brown paper bag to get touched up and
you just have to promise not to write in
the margins which everyone does but and
the problem with that Apple is right the
problem with when you just give people
the text books that you've always had is
those textbooks or 15 years old and now
yeah and now they can go is not a planet
right nigga be updated well they could
be updated every year for maybe you know
for way cheaper than it would be to buy
a whole new set of textbooks they would
be magic and fun and kids would like to
like yeah crowd around them and watch it
I'm all for it I just think they may
offer subsidies yeah they need to make
they need to be responsible about
recognizing that you don't want to
separate people so much right well and
you know maybe it'll start out as it
because when i saw the event or whatever
and i know that they were showing like
and like a kid's astronomy book and like
touching whatever but like when i was
thinking about it i really was thinking
about college and grad school yeah this
is like a perfect thing
for college and grad students and maybe
by micheal earley and maybe that's like
their first like you know we're really
pushing it for college and grad students
and if it takes off in it and if people
use it and if people are writing books
for it then maybe later they'll offer
subsidies to schools or maybe you know
they'll get rid of football and the arts
to get an ipad in the classroom you know
get rid of all the sports programs and I
might have an iPad that would be the day
that American no wonder is so I don't
know or maybe you know they can get used
ipads or so right i think there's a lot
of people who can apply for like school
boards can apply for to get ipad and
tech enthusiasts i think those who said
it in the UM in the chat room earlier
was like no iPad left behind so
yesterday seen I did a story that
they've already sold 350,000 textbooks
in three days yeah I saw that it means
be really clean up like they announce
anything and it gets crazy attention and
I mean kids are already using their
parents iPads like I think we've talked
about this on the show before but when
you put an iPad in the child's hand it
changes everything kids love it yeah and
and they respond so great to it so I
imagine if those people who bought those
textbooks are parents who own iPads and
they were like oh I'm gonna go ahead and
get my kid that one about geography like
I actually think I don't know if you
people who own iPads out there one of my
favorite things to do the ipad sometimes
I look at it and I'm like what do I do
with you what are you what should I be
doing with you right now what am I
absolutely everything to do with it at a
time like that is to use google earth
yeah well I'm just obsessed with it and
so I'm from Idaho and I haven't been
there in a long time and I was sad
because I didn't get to go home for
Christmas so I have this is so pathetic
but on my on Google Earth I have
perfected the ability to from zoomed out
in space in one move of my fingers one
pit long pinch out without adjusting it
all zoom directly in on my house in
Idaho that's pretty awesome there was a
there's a another app that this is like
now we're totally off the point actually
somewhat beat master in the chat room
set
how come you don't think of ipad 1st
generation the lower price wouldn't you
know the ipad 3 gets released will make
it more kid compatible I'm just true but
then he then or he or she I'm not sure
later says you know but what about oh no
somebody else said well I don't know how
to read the chat room but anyway well
will they last and what I books even
work on oh that was cousin of job well I
will the ipad 1b support side works too
I'm not sure about that I don't remember
what they said about that my only thing
that I would say about that is that
generally when a new generation ipad
comes out the next gen doesn't get that
much of a discount I mean it's race
that's true it's naughty but it's like
ninety nine dollars in which totally I
mean I i don't i don't see that helping
inner-city schools get iPads oh but then
people are saying that the textbooks
don't even work on the first gen i have
a first gen i hope they come out with
the cheaper thing I can't i I don't
remember what they said about that but I
wouldn't be surprised if it didn't work
on the first day I know I mean just to
get me to go buy them yeah exactly
they're like Kareem upgrade there is a
really cool app have to say real quick
it's like an astronomy app and you hold
your ipad into the sky and then you it
shows you like what stars ya know really
cool and like I don't answer in phones
to somebody has a nap except for that
it's way cooler on the iPad totally so
um alright let's move on to how I have
an itch let's move on to our next rumor
which is about casio what about me
anybody put casaya yeah I know cuz when
you think of Casa go you think of little
likes or you think of um dick how
exactly the the synthesizers only a good
keyboard that's this big with the keys
that big I had one of those and the
little calculator watches yeah huh so
that's cool anyway um a droid life
tipster who claims to have spent time oh
I didn't even say what the rumor was
kassius is said to be prepping a
quad-core handset so casio is really
well known for like their ravine 2 which
is kind of ugly but can be submerged in
50 feet of water yeah and then there's
the other one which is like the l the
elds own or g'zone
zone I can never know it's goes own or
is it on that's stupid ' in it that's
all military grade ugly but yeah they
work really well and you can like put
them in antifreeze or like stomp on them
they can be in an avalanche you and you
can call your mom be like mom I'm in an
avalanche yeah commenters in the story
really we're like I don't think they're
ugly I think that they work and I could
drop him from my up here and they'll
won't break I'm I understand if I was
someone who worked outside and had
strength and was in the elements i would
hella have totally if you were in danger
of being in an avalanche sony show a
droid life tipster who claims to have
spent time in a Casio focus group
because they have focus groups advises
that the hardware makers readying a
number of new Android products among
them is sweet it which is an unnamed
device referred to as big boy it said to
future hey boy super amoled yes Amal amo
amo Olivia movie display in Oh them
there's a typo in this okay I gotta go
back in there and fix it later I'm super
amoled display in the range of four and
a half inches or larger the handset has
a quad huge loss assessor and eight
megapixel camera a huge battery 4G LTE
connectivity front-facing 2-megapixel
camera and fhm micro NFC capabilities
sorry micro SD card expansion slot and a
curve design much like the Galaxy Nexus
so this person also saw all these other
things that day during the focus group
will call him a he I don't know he saw a
white big what a big white phone some
clamshell phones he's all big white oh
my G a G zone phone and then they asked
him if lake the warranties should be
longer like this guy went into this
focus group with a mission he is by
mission was to remember everything he
was like the girl with the dragon tattoo
is memorizing he's like what is that
likely listen if he had on one of those
contact lenses that had a camera
seriously it Blake was this guy taking
notes like he left there and knew
everything there was and it's also
probably
an agreement that said that he would not
do exactly what he's at me and I bet
when he left that day he was like I'm
gonna make millions because when
somebody leaks something about the
iphone they make millions and selecting
kishimoto i make money it'll god I know
this guy leaves this thing and he's like
guys I have all this news about casio
and everybody's like the guy is a
synthesizer pieces you're gonna make a
new piano I'm awake and so I don't know
it's not apple buddy the thing is those
features sound like the best they make
it sound like the best moment the best
friend of all time and if it can be
dropped for you know into antifreeze and
like it yeah 50 meters of water and stay
submerged like who wouldn't want this
would want like why what I don't
understand is like then it would be ten
bazillion dollars because those phones
are expensive yeah they're so rugged and
other phones are expensive because they
have a quad-core chip and Lake have lge
and whatever and a like dual
front-facing camera and all those done I
have a great display this has all of
that so this camera this phone will be
two thousand dollars but professional
Mountaineers who want to climb Everest
yeah and it's for people in the military
and be exactly hopefully they'll get
idea subsidy doing today will and the
ipad won't don't let this little leaker
discourage you from making this this
thing i once watched a cnet focus group
when we were redesigning the homepage
and we had people in to see like how
they liked the homepage this was years
ago not even this most recent redesign
and it was so awesome because it was
like I was in an interrogation room and
it like one-way mirror or a one-way
window you know where they couldn't see
me but I could see them and they had
like we had this tech that sees where
their eyes are looking on the page it's
like what are you looking at what are
you looking at and they were always
looking at ad ad ad ad ad but it was
really great hair like I don't know how
to use this imagine if that person had
left there and been like hey San
Francisco Chronicle cnet is planning a
redesign I know and he has big red ball
to the lip of one pixel I used to work
at at a university and we used to do
focus groups I worked in the marketing
department we used to do focus groups
for like oh can you get to the page
where you I don't know what
I called the view book page or like to
sign from oh whatever but it was like
for parents and they would like click on
anything and we're and then they were
like trying to click and it was up open
to PDF but it didn't tell you that it
was a PDF and so then they were trying
to click around the PDF and it was so
that's it sounds horrible it was I mean
we did it on purpose to see like who
actually so now I'm like a PD like PDF
marking not see like you have to write
that it's a PDF where people get
confused yeah it's very scary scary I
mean a lot of people don't understand
about browsers like my mom she's all
over the internet but when I say to her
mom go to your browser and go to a web
page she's like what does that mean is
that what happens when I open my
computer and the thing opens right yeah
so you have to use the right terminology
I like when people were like googling
Facebook and then got to that annual
story oh yeah there's a story that
people like it was a new story about
Facebook and all the timeread right wet
readwrite Radley heart of the comments
on that story about Facebook were like
hey Facebook's would you do with a Gy
jewelry design I can't log into Facebook
because they thought that that was
facebook because that's how they get
into Facebook me I'm going the SEO of
that story was so high that when you
googled facebook that story came up
first above facebook then they went to
that they went to the top link like
they'd always done for all those years
and it was a read/write web story about
how Facebook was doing something stupid
and people will go to the bottom and
comment and say I'm just trying to get
into facebook give me my password and
then I do you know my password ee
confusing because read white reb god i
can't read lying web um had a facebook
connect button at the bottom oh you
could sign in to their website using
your facebook so I'm we're hitting that
for and then weren't they were still
just on readwriteweb and that they
commented like we just don't get it they
were there was like 300 comments on this
poor oh my god I think there were
thousands actually and the the moderator
of the site wrote like guys this is a
news article this is not Facebook you
need to go to HTTP colon slash slash WWF
ace book calm and they were like we
don't want to do
and then nobody was even reading that
part like they put that in the story so
anyway so let's talk let's move on to
our next uh rumah I'm like what is that
word the next thing ya the thing that I
chose on will do a really quick eon this
one won't give it the duck timer but
it'll be as though there's a duck time
okay ready Netflix oh oh Netflix is set
and that's what the headline music Oh
Netflix is set for an even worse 2012
according to our favorite people in the
world analysts love you analyze a tune
for analysts corner which is we're going
to figure that out netflix says its
international expansion is central to
its growth growth but analysts are
concerned that the companies overseas
exploits could deliver a bundle of
financial hurt Wedbush Wedbush led bush
analyst Michael Pachter who we've we
talked about my all time it's definitely
going in our analyst corner totally we
love Michael Packer because he always
talks about Netflix and he talks crap
about them because he hates them Oh
George why do you hate them so much
Michael I just think he's finishing the
dirt I just think that I just think that
he thinks that their business model is
terrible it is a well-known did it he's
a well-known digital entertainment
analyst he criticized what he sees that
Netflix's growth at all costs business
model in a note adding that its desire
to expand internationally will only
cause it to incur losses for years and
years and years and back in November
this guy Pachter argued that the company
should be getting its financial house in
order before it starts to acquiring more
subscribers overseas for little or no
gain so basically here in America the
company is going crazy trying to do this
quick stir thing losing all these
audition now marketing but that this
back yeah you know trying to losing all
its shares losing money losing all
subscribers losing all of its
subscribers and then they're like mmm
you know what's a good idea right now
we're gonna go to Europe late this is
like what happens when you can't play
for the NBA anymore so you go overseas
and play play fan be over there or like
when you're like a be lit rate actor you
used to be on top and now you're not but
you can still do commercials in Latvia
right but it's because
that you like have lost all ability the
reason you can't do movies in America
anymore is because you've like lost all
ability to act and talk because you got
a little fat and we here in America yeah
and what about that exactly and so it's
like you know rather than lose some
weight and learn how to act they're just
going to a different market you know
what I mean and so I don't know Pachter
has so much financial influence so that
after he made this little prediction
yesterday Netflix's shares closed down
more than six percent like I mean so
people are really i don't doubt one
thing i'm confused about is why exactly
does he think it's going to lead to a
loss is because they can't because he
doesn't understand why they're expanding
without fixing all the problems that
they have here so they are continuing to
expand this broken business model into
other countries without actually fixing
what's wrong okay so it's just going to
be the same problems there there exactly
and so they're really spent you know and
so so that's why says growth at all
costs business model I don't think he
means like financial growth necessarily
but growth actual reach each which is
like what Starbucks did when starbucks
was like we want to be on every corner
actually want to on every corner and
then they were like actually this was a
bad idea and now we're gonna close like
three years ago they close yeah they
close the whole bunch of em and so now
you don't have to stand on a corner in
downtown New York and c3 Starbucks's
from where you're standing late in June
enmeshed in that movie Best in Show and
she's like um I met my husband in this
starbucks and he was in the starbucks
across the street oh wait prophecy and
he wasn't an i ordered a double tall
monkey on so anyway so I mean that's
like it's true yeah so I think that what
he's saying is is that how dare Netflix
just continue to go out into the wild
like trying to get market share when
their market your home is really bad I
really think it's just cuz their tails
between their legs and they want to go
abroad and have people be nice to them
yeah except they it's not like they
can't hear what's happening over here
they heard about quick sir no they know
what you did yeah so I don't know
Netflix listen to me who's listening to
Michael Pachter his name yeah actor he
might know what he's gonna be matched
her but I would imagine it's packed her
I don't know give us a call man yeah let
us know factor how to pronounce your
name
no I am now our final final oh okay so
our final rumor is a little bit out of
our comfort zone in that I don't
completely understand it and it scares
me and it's scary thing about this next
topic freaks me out so put your adult
diapers on so that you and pamphlets and
dance off and a drink and show yourself
up for this terrifying rumor which you
probably have already heard which is
that a video claiming to be made by
anonymous the hacktivist group is
claiming that it will attack facebook on
january twenty odd their debate they
made this claim though that they're
gonna do this november seventh can go
down well and they and anonymous came
out on november seventh and said that
was not us that was someone
impersonating us for which they've said
again this time i wonder if it's because
they've failed and then they're like oh
look at this is scary you know they're
like oh that's is worthy of us it wasn't
hate it the time has come and online war
has begun between anonymous the people
and the government is nice freak well so
mean people out yeah I'm Congress this
although he has very nice cheekbones and
a little smirk for those underwear only
oh my god it's that me that gives me
goosebumps is so scary basically this
was uploaded onto a YouTube channel that
has had prior videos that were
associated with anonymous on it but
there's no guarantee that it is
anonymous and as you know the group
Anonymous is anonymous um but it's made
up of hundreds or possibly thousands of
people who work together to hack
different groups that they decide upon
they like hacked some banks and stole
some money to give to charity over
Christmas and then those charities were
like please don't give us that money
because then we'll have to give it back
and pay a fine so please don't do that
but you've all heard about anonymous
last week they went on a semi hacking
rampage it was the largest attack they
said ever on the internet in one day and
they took down justice gov a bunch of
government websites FBI gov they took
down CBS com a pair
over the weekend and and that was all in
the name of retaliation against the
FBI's arrests or issuing warrants and
arrests for the mega people who run
megaupload which was a which is a site
where you can load content in stream con
they take all those sites down or they
just like takes I think they did take
them down to you yeah but so they're
very mad anonymous is very mad about
that because they believe in freedom on
the internet and they're very mad about
soap on people rightfully I mean those
and and those bills have now been
postponed which generally when that
happens in Congress that means they're
dead well that's not allowed to say
they're dead yet because they're not or
not done yet but beat master in the
chatroom said it was the perfect setup
to get the comp to get Congress to back
to SOPA PIPA so yeah you know it
happened right at the right time it did
I mean and I mean I don't think there's
any denying that anonymous so their
attacks pretty much helped because when
the representatives in the house were
giving their reasons for why they had
postponed SOPA they said due to recent
events which I was I mean recent
protests and there were there were some
physical protests on the street and
people signed a lot of petitions I
signed a petition you guys all signed it
but also anonymous ducked down a bunch
of government websites and it got a huge
amount of rest well and also Wikipedia
blacked out panting legal blacked out
the bad day yeah or the black yard yeah
and then you could link to information
about it yeah so big a very big deal but
so now anonymous this video saying that
it will attack Facebook and if we
continue watching the video what it says
is though Facebook has 60,000 at least
60,000 servers it can still be taken
down which i think is kind of ridiculous
a little I mean I because Facebook has
enough servers to allow millions of
people to linger on its site at once
right and so what the way that anonymous
have this is the part where I don't
completely understand this but the way
that anonymous had been attacking people
is by overwhelming their servers with
DDoS attacks which is like basically the
equivalent of smothering a website
server so that it can't it's not like
they hacked into their password got the
code and uploaded something from this
it's just like they overwhelmed the site
so that it couldn't load and so you
can't really do that to Facebook because
Facebook is prepared for millions of
people to be on it whereas justice gov
is not right because how many millions
of people are lingering on that site
yeah checking there why would anyone
yeah there's no farmville on justice
just getting like update update is
something interesting update um so any
other reason why it doesn't seem that
likely that they would attack Facebook
is that Facebook is against SOPA they
came out a little Mark Zuckerberg came
out a little late against it but he came
out the day that everyone was protesting
the Wikipedia blackout in the Google
blacked out he came out saying he's
completely not in support of it and it
had nothing to do with megaupload so I
don't really understand but maybe it's
because Facebook and I think this is
like the problem with that people have
with Facebook anyway is that it's like
has all your information and it's trying
to sell you stuff constantly and it's
like ads ads ads ads ads yeah I mean it
so it's not necessarily a sober related
thing but it's like how Facebook is
taking over your I mean and maybe
they're just mad about there are a
million reasons to hate Facebook shall
we enumerate them they track you across
the web they sell your information they
sell what you do across the web to
stores so that they can tell you what
you like they tell people what kind of
cat videos you watch and how long you
watch them when they change their
settings so often that when you think
you have set yourself to private you
suddenly have it because it defaults
back and you have to be constantly
checking it every time they do a reason
they also rolled out timeline which
everybody hates and it's about
everyone's about to be forced to take it
even if you haven't upgraded to it I
like it I like it other than the fact
that I find it incredibly slow and I
want to do a poll to see if it's if it's
slow for other people I can't find any
buddies post on there I go and like try
to look for something someone posted I
can't find it well i know and i think
there's nothing weird about its design
because it it it asks you to use both
sides of the screen like both there's
posts on this side and then there's that
little tiny thin line and then there's
posts on the other side but that is
where you're used to seeing ads so my
eye has like a blind you'll get really
used to it though like cuz i have
timeline like i signed up as a developer
got timeline back when they announced it
and by and it's not slow for you because
this is my problem is it like when I
scroll down and then it's like show more
posts for 2011 it's like loading loading
and then if I go to update my status
from within my timeline rather than from
within the main page of facebook it's so
slow that like my cursor flashes and
it's behind my typing huh it's like over
it's not on its on both of my computers
that's interesting yeah but then I just
talked to Bridget Carey about it or I
asked her boss talked about in Bridget
said she hasn't seen that so I don't
know i don't know maybe have to maybe we
have to shift refresh shooters in the
world um but so i have a source who may
or may not be a hacker who may or may
not sometimes work with anonymous who
our own anonymous our own anonymous
source and I ran this rumor by this
person oh yeah we need to drink for our
own anonymous source cheese I know we
still tried to get this person to go on
the record and they were like absolutely
not who do you think I am um but I ran
this anonymous rumor by them to see if
Facebook is going to be attacked because
I would be so sad and this person did
not believe that that was like part of
anonymous's plan this person hangs out
on the anonymous's forums you know which
is where they all make their decisions I
guess um but he this person did send me
some links that were like clues to what
anonymous was maybe going to attack next
and I don't understand them at all haha
paste man this was like like a string of
code about what if you need to attack
you would need to like put into your
computer bulb la to attack justice gov
or usa.gov and I don't understand yes it
I mean it's a lot I think it is and I
like I even got flak on Twitter because
the other day when they took down FBI
gov I was like snap fbi.gov got
penetrated by anonymous and then my
Twitter followers were like they didn't
penetrate anything they smothered it and
were so angry they'd used the wrong
nomenclature but i don't i'm not a hell
right i didn't understand why would
little Emily know she doesn't know what
the words mean Oh says them
like the I have two experiences with
hacking once when I guess my mom's
password to get into her amazon account
to see what she was getting me for
Christmas which is like hard NASA hardly
aha it was just a guest name and then
too I saw the movie hackers with
Angelina oh I see everyone thought it
was so good and I have two bits of
information about this one is that
yesterday when i was in safeway at the
grocery store i saw that angelina is
pregnant again what you just hacked and
then to in that movie what I learned
about hacking is that all you have to do
to hack is be super hot and be a really
fast typist it's true that was that
movie hackers that's all it was was hot
people typing and now I am a very fast
typist wait comment on that you have to
say things like triangulate the whatever
see that's what I don't know so what I
need is someone if you want me to be a
hacker if I'm ever in a situation where
I'm called wanda like hack a bank or
whatever someone's dying someone's going
to die unless i am able to hack some
dead they should call you busy refers
I'm a fast typist but what I then need
is an ear piece with a hacking genius
Cyrano de Bergerac who can give me all
the things on Swiss dis we get the girl
from the Dragon Tattoo to whisper
politely in your ear all the code maybe
we should just get the girl with the
dragon tattoo period yeah totally be
awesome alright so we are running out of
time okay and we're gonna ask oh well
should we just ask who it anon this is
gonna tack next during the betting round
yes or will it will an attack Facebook
and who do we think it will attack next
let's not bet on who we think at all but
oh well then let's just ask that right
now before we knew it we think anonymous
will attack next please tweet us yeah
send us a note send us an email and
maybe we will read it on the next room
absolutely and do you have an idea do
you think that they will attack someone
next um I don't know I kind of like the
idea of them attacking facebook that's
because you abandoned facebook to use
Twitter both of you i know i hate i hate
facebook now um let's move on to the
bedding all right okay ready do we have
oh yeah right
alright so Emily do you think a CEO will
get a quad core phone yes yes I say no
is the next iPad going to have a Retina
display yes I say yes is Instagram going
to come to windows before it comes to
android yes I say yes um let's make it
interesting I say no his netflix gonna
shoot itself in the foot and have a
really bad 2012 because it's going into
the European and abroad I think it's
gonna have a bad 2012 yes um I say yes
to will a not anonymous attack Facebook
next no I say no but I want them to I
just got that and that is one quiz way
to get your your account deleting yeah
no but this is actually how anonymous
gets their orders it's actually through
Carini I'm like Julie is like Facebook
next boys through it or girls all right
should we play our voicemails do we have
time for smells I got a minute we can do
this okay we've got two voicemails over
the last couple weeks and the first one
comes to us from kale from South
Carolina who says he knows how to make a
chrome OS tablet hey guys this is kale
from South Carolina I wish I just want
to say that I'm a huge name in the chef
in a secret for your you guys are so
hilarious ah love Jesus because it's my
little name is from Jim 13 you're
talking about the Chrome OS tablet I
have a quick three set guide on how to
make a chrome tablet and it works with
any Android or iOS Pavel even benign
intern dollar HP TouchPad so first
number one get a tablet with internet
browser wants every single brother step
3 never close in a network there you go
romola that's a Chromebook similar to
the Cremona thanks guys absolutely love
the show hi no also nice thank you doing
all right let's play let's play this
next one okay the mall gasps next one
set it up so remember how we said we
were going to have is this the analyst
one yeah remember we said we were going
to have analysts corner that's because
we are best friends with all the
analysts so much so in fact that they
call us on the phone yeah so as you know
I called analyst Gene Munster of Piper
Jaffray who likes to talk about apple a
tall drink of water because he's super
handsome he is super handsome and he's
super knowledgeable and then he called
us hi this is gene munster calling from
piper jaffray calling for crane and
emily i understand i was invited to call
you for personal reasons I've been
trying to call numerous times and I use
the number i was given there's no way to
afford a message see or talk to you
personally I must say don't like to be
teased and that would have talked to you
if I could have unfortunately the number
i have is a voicemail and that your
personal number this is it goodbye said
we had said piper jean monsters a tall
drink of water caller we didn't even say
that no no we did we went call us just
like that oh maybe we did look I thought
we rolled back the tape and it turned
out that we never said that anyway so we
called this guy back yeah so we were
like is that possibly actually Jean
monetary so Molly's manada do you want
to be on the show so we called him back
exactly and we got a church so and she
had no idea she I know the lady had no
idea who Gene Munster was unfortunately
because he's so amped and I can we talk
to gene gene munster and the woman was
like you've reached the first map like
Baptist Church of Iowa yeah so monsters
not here don't mess with us gene munster
because we have yeah we have caller ID
yeah man we broke our 69 um so don't
play with our emotions don't exactly you
stop teasing us
16 miles of people in the jet in the in
the chat room or ask gene monsters
religious I mean what we really think is
it that that was not gene Watson yeah we
got a prank call from address Frankel
and we thought gene munster loved us but
really gene munster does not watch her
has it much to my chagrin and much much
too much yeah exactly my big surprise
gene munster does not watch the show as
he should because I all we do is throw
him compliments left and right yeah and
also I mean I think he could get some
good advice from us we're like this is
how we think the iPads gonna go this is
what we think yeah gene munster
generally were citing him yeah so I
think I think we really should work on
or some i think it was Sparkman somebody
in the chat room said that we should to
analyst hot or not i think that's a good
way for us to get fire we should do an
analyst corner definitely are maybe we
can like add like a little subhead about
whether they're attractive or not and we
are gonna track whether or not they get
it right and we're gonna revisit them
what they're saying and we're gonna have
to know them a little bit so we're gonna
work on because we have these two
analyst that we talk about all the time
Michael Pachter and gene munster yeah so
maybe the others fight between them are
there others there are definite spike
says it was me I don't know spice cake
was it will have to do some voice
recognition software call us and then
we'll compare alright guys thank you so
much for watching work overtime crave is
coming up next I'm sure they're like
banging on the door we will see you next
week bye and have a great week see you
