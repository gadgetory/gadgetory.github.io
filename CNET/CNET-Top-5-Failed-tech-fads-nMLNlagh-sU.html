endured the test of time the laptop
computer has been around for 33 years
the cellphone has been around for 30
years email 20 years but other tech
trends come and go faster than you can
save parachute pants this year
especially we're looking at a long list
of overhyped fads that may fall flat
smartwatches Google glass bitcoins robin
thicke so to keep things in perspective
today I'm counting down my list of the
top 5 tech fads of the past 15 years
starting off at number 5 QR codes I feel
like this was the year that everyone
finally came to their senses and stopped
putting these on things we'll still have
to explain the past 5 years to our
children and why we felt compelled to
put QR codes on everything from
billboards to breakfast cereal
I'll admit that it was kind of cute at
first a secret code that only nerds with
smartphones could unlock maybe it would
take you to a movie trailer or a
discount on your coffee but more often
than not it just was a way to get you
from one add to another eventually
people stopped taking the bait and
advertisers moved on to spamming you
directly on Facebook
I'm number 4 netbooks
who needs laptops when a crushingly
small underpowered netbook can take you
to the same web for just three hundred
dollars that logic helped to sell a lot
of Belle minis and a soos a pcs the
netbook trend was a wake-up call to
manufacturers signaling the decline of
the traditional laptop people wanted
something different they wanted
something simple and something much less
expensive and then they got that in 2010
when Apple unveiled the iPad the netbook
was a nice placeholder but when the
tablet market took off it killed the
netbook and really put the squeeze on
laptops coming in at number three second
life at a time that was post myspace but
not yet consumed by Facebook and Twitter
the cool people were all running their
avatars around Second Life and getting
molested by the virtual equivalent of a
Burning Man peyote vision not to be left
out big brands like Dell Reebok an
American Apparel were all setting up
virtual stores staffed by virtual
employees and
real Economist's to wonder what it all
meant the GDP of Second Life was larger
than most small nations but then like a
cat to a laser pen we all found other
ways to distract ourselves online right
now there's a mohawk stripper with a
skunk tail dancing for no one in an
abandoned steampunk strip club where's
her economic recovery or his I don't
know it's hard to tell
back to reality for our number two tech
fad that was more hype than substance
the 3d TV well really 3d in general if
you think about it after avatar became
the first movie to gross over two
billion dollars we tried to put 3d in
everything
3d tablets 3d phones 3d laptops the
Nintendo 3ds but it was TVs that really
held tight to that 3d fad after all of
3d was going to be the future for
Hollywood that everyone would need a way
to watch that content at home too right
well it turns out that the 3d fad was
like reheated hype stuffed into new hype
it was like a turducken of BS slide from
James Cameron no one really wanted to
make 3d movies audiences didn't really
want to pay more to see 3d movies and
they certainly didn't want to buy a
whole new TV just to get migraines at
home now to be fair most new TVs come
with 3d compatibility but that's not
what sells the TV if you could save a
hundred bucks by not having 3d you'd
probably not hesitate to dump it all
right and now for the number one tech
fad that choked on its own hype a
groceries yes I'm reaching all the way
back to the Webvan days for this one in
the late 90s at the height of the
dot-com boom seemed that the internet
was going to overturn every traditional
brick-and-mortar business and none
seemed more ripe for disruption than the
local grocery store web van and others
secured millions of dollars to quickly
establish themselves as key players they
built warehouses bought fleets of
delivery trucks and hired thousands of
workers bracing themselves for the
insane demand of a public unshackled
from having to waste their time pushing
wobbly wheeled carts around big-box
grocery stores and then
nothing not so much turns out that old
habits die hard
putting aside the insane cost of all the
infrastructure involved people just
didn't really want to shop for groceries
online what they want is for the
groceries to magically appear in their
kitchen so until the Star Trek food
replicator becomes a reality the
supermarket is going to be just fine
so there you have it five of the biggest
lamest fads in recent tech history
though I'm starting to think we'll have
a few more to add to the list before the
years through more top 5 videos head
over to top-5 dot cnn.com where you can
leave me a comment with your own failed
tech fad nominations until then i'm
