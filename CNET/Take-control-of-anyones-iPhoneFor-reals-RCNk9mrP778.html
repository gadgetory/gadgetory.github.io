all right well welcome to apple pie for
all the good and bad inside the world of
Apple let's get to the stories now we
all love our phone and so much of our
personal information and contacts are
stored on them for some people it's
their best friend but we here at the
apple byte think of you as our friends
so we want to educate you about a
security issue with iOS 4.1 on your
iphone 3g 3gs and for have you ever
wanted to know everything about that
special someone well you can with the
iphone running iOS 4.1 on someone's
lockscreen just go to the emergency call
mode then dial a number and immediately
press the hold switch and look you'll
have access to their entire call history
their voicemails and their address book
want to hear the latest music on their
phone you can do that share a contact
with your friends hey you don't even
need facebook get access to someone's
photo library you can do that too and to
that stalkers creepy guys and jealous
boyfriends say thanks Apple Wow and to
that we're throwing out a really really
bad apple now we hope by the time you
watch this it'll be fixed they fixed the
facetime bug but this issue is bigger
than that it's a huge deal and it
requires a software update for everyone
so Apple you guys need to get on this
now in happier gadget news the big a has
evolved into a mobile gaming platform
and Sony and Nintendo are finally taking
notice engadget recently released
pictures of the potential PSP phone
which combines their gaming handheld
with a phone and is set the interwebs on
fire now Sony execs would not confirm or
deny the rumors which pretty much this
means it's real the prototype device is
expected to be released in 2011 it's an
android-based touchscreen slider with
PSP controls like shoulder buttons and a
d-pad and it will have its own apps or
to distribute games and daddy likes now
Sony's not the only one that realizes
apples always connected devices are
dangerous Nintendo of America's
president also called Apple
his threat and added do I think in the
near term they can hurt us more than
Microsoft absolutely last quarter
Apple's iOS devices outsole Sony
Nintendo's mobile hardware combined and
clearly they don't want to just roll
over unless you're playing in ten dogs
which is really cute oh you are so cute
I could hug you like a blah marshmallows
no no don't now the macbook air is the
latest cat's meow and you're probably
curious how it matches up to the macbook
pro 13-inch line macworld broke it down
in the new 13-inch air with a 1.8
gigahertz processor just edges out the
current macbook pro 2.4 gigahertz model
based on their speed mark tests and the
new air doubles the performance from the
previous macbook air so yeah these
laptops can hang and since we've been
looking out for you in this show don't
wait for the white iphone 4 apple is now
delayed its release to get this Spring
of 2011 it's been removed from the
online store there were rumors about
color matching issues or light leaking
from its backlight but spring is just
too late new iPhones released around
june or july so just get the next-gen
iphone instead of waiting for the great
white hope or you could do it yourself
with whiteout all right to the quick
bites the macbook air doesn't have an
anti-glare option but check out the
fellas at tech restore who currently
offer the only solution for 249 which
includes a 24 hour turnaround time
shipping and the service and if you're
in the Halloween spirit or just want a
cheap laugh check out this costume from
skoo Pertino called eyewear yep you too
can be Steve now the costume isn't real
but come on guys it sure looks good and
the ipad iOS 4.2 beta revealed apples
plans to make the screen lock switch a
mute switch now and as user I'm
completely against this Steve Jobs
confirm that in an email so they're now
taking away a feature we're used to and
they aren't giving us an option to
switch it for ourselves because that's
how steve wants you to do it i love the
product but that's a bunch of crap
