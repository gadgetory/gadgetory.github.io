Dreyfuss and welcome to rumor has it the
show where we round up the week's
biggest tech rumors and then we bet on
which one sounds legit and which one
seem like they are never going to happen
this week we have a new feature where
you can vote on all of the rumors so
keep your eye out for the pull in the
interactive a player if you're watching
on CNN our first rumor is about the
13-inch macbook pro it could be getting
a Retina Display makeover the sep tember
just like it's 15 inch big brother
according to an analyst with KGI
securities based in thailand in his note
ming-chi kuo advises potential investors
that apple will definitely upgrade the
mid-size pro of course quo is somewhat
of an overzealous optimist concluding
that will also see a new iphone in
September a new ipad mini and a new ipod
maybe i'm also an overzealous optimist
because i think that this is going to
happen because i think it's inevitable i
actually agree with you i think that
that computer is going to get a Retina
display but i think that it would have
gotten one with its 15 inch big brother
if they had the technology ready so I
bet there's a delay and we won't see it
in September our next rumor is that the
Financial Times is reporting that
Nokia's in talks with European carriers
to sign exclusive partnerships for its
next Windows Phone 8 based device and
will offer carriers part of the revenue
what's really interesting about this is
the innovative pay model yeah if the
carriers are going to make more money
for every nokia phone that they sell as
opposed to other phones and they have a
huge incentive to pimp out nokia above
all else which actually would be a
win-win for everyone if they could
somehow save Nokia's sagging bottom line
and fill their own pockets with money
speaking of sagging bottom line do you
remember rim of course the company that
just laid off people okay but do you
remember the BlackBerry PlayBook fairly
the tablet no one wanted so let's break
it down the PlayBook is a 7-inch tablet
and you can get a 32 gig version for two
hundred fifty dollars now according to a
document from canadian carrier bell we
may be releasing a 4g version of the
same tablet for five hundred and fifty
dollars does that seem strange that's
because it is the first playbook didn't
do very well so now they're doubling the
price and hoping people like it better
now for iphone 5 rumor watch
threat level orange the terror of it has
our producer Sarah quietly sobbing in
the corner in frustration the new phone
will have a smaller 19 PennDOT connector
says Reuters now current iPods and
iPhones have 30 pin connectors so this
would be a problem for using accessories
like speakers or car systems though
there may be hope the site I'm or says
Apple will offer an adapter to make your
old stuff work with the new phone
changing the pin sounds like a horrible
terrible idea and the worst part is that
it's probably going to happen because
they do this all the time a lot of dock
connectors aren't backward compatible
and it's super frustrating and I'm just
frustrated walking about it you want to
be even more frustrated I bet that if it
happens and there's an adapter that
thing will cost you 70 bucks oh my god
see I don't know I think it might cost
thirty dollars which isn't even that
much less yeah thanks a lot Apple for
making me spend 30 extra dollars um okay
well what do you guys think do you think
that the pin will be changed do you
think that if they have an adapter it'll
cost a lot of money we are going to go
out on the streets of San Francisco and
see what they think will you vote
do you think that apple would do that to
us yeah I think they can and yeah I
think I could see them doing that yeah
it seems like something out but would do
it's gonna be a major pain frankly you
release hardware that changes over time
and we buy the new hardware and we do
with it because we love Apple it's
probably going to be an upgrade better
technology but it's gonna suck because I
mean every ipod accessory I own probably
has to get upgraded if I get a new phone
how much do you think they're gonna sell
the adapter for I would guess that it's
1999 Apple I was with you when you
switch to USB now you're gonna pull this
stuff on us I think it's pretty likely
they'll do that um I think it'll be 2599
the adapter probably like 50 bucks 29
ish I mean that's a safe bet for every
little adapter they have if not 50 like
50 bucks Oh at least 50 bucks I don't
know 15 bucks I could be wrong it could
be 50 and I think people would still buy
it well people on the street really seem
to think apple is gonna do this to us
and they think that an adapter is gonna
cost about fifty bucks let's go inside
and to the cnet council thinks the cnet
council is composed of five editors who
cast their votes anonymously their
opinions are not an endorsement by Cena
or CBS interactive obviously because
these are rumors folks and the council's
verdict is unanimous five out of five of
our editors believe that Apple is likely
going to have a smaller dock on the next
iPhone price why is however they
differed if there is going to be an
adapter some people thought it was going
to be thirty dollars one person thought
it was going to be ten dollars and one
person thought that it would come free
in the box oh my god that's adorable
they're so naive well if you want to
argue with our cnet council in person
about anything they've said you might be
able to because we're throwing a rumor
has it launched party at cnet
headquarters if you want to be invited
all you need to do is tweet tew/cnet
