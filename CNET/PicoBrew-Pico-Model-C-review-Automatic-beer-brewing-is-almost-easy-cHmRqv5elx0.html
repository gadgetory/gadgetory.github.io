brewing robot and right now the $400
peekaboo Pico model C is the closest
approximation we have to that dream like
most dreams harsh realities get in the
way of perfection so I'm not going to
recommend the model C to most beer
lovers or home brewers but let's start
with the good stuff so this is stargazer
IPA from rooftop brewing in Seattle and
it's delicious it's an example of pika
brew at its best because I wouldn't
normally have access to that beer around
me in Kentucky but through pika brews
website I order these things called Pico
packs there are 25 30 bucks they brew up
5 litres of beer and pico brew offers
them from breweries all over the country
and all over the world for home brewers
one thing to keep in mind is that you're
not actually brewing you hit a button so
this machine won't even teach you to
homebrew after the via cooks for a
couple of hours you let it sit overnight
to cool then add yeast then you need to
let it sit for a few days while your
beer ferments then again while it
carbonates lots of things can go wrong
during that time so this is a saison we
made in the Pico brew and it's flat the
saison under the carbonation issue is
fine but Pico brew for the most part
leaves you on your own for fermentation
and carbonation what went wrong here is
the second time we've used the serving
keg and the seal didn't hold properly
and so when you wait a couple of weeks
for a beer and it isn't very good
that's pretty disappointing especially
because Pico packs cost $25 that's like
14 bottles of beer so you're not
actually saving that much money from
batch to batch so the model see is the
best fit for avid beer lovers who want
to try beers from small local outfits
from all over the world I do recommend
it if that sounds appealing but one last
reality to keep in mind you still have
to do a lot of careful cleaning and
sanitizing to get the beer right finally
this is a Mexican dark lager
and it's bad like it's straight-up bad
something went wrong in the brewing
process and the thing is it might have
been my fault I might not have properly
sanitized something that caused the beer
to get infected but that just shows that
peekaboo
while it's better now and while it's
easier to use is still not fully
foolproof so I don't generally recommend
the model C for home brewers or casual
beer drinkers or folks looking for
something as simple as a curing for beer
on the plus side it's a more genuine
process than doing something like
brewing from concentrate but on the
downside it requires more know-how and
attention to detail to get things right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
