it's no secret that BMW is at the top of
the stack when it comes to in-car
connectivity apps support and basically
putting Cee on four wheels let me show
you what's new in I Drive four point to
the newest version and some other
connected technologies that go with it
all right now the basic I Drive
interface is not changed you recognize
this one from the recent couple of years
that'll be the same but you're going to
see they say much finer rendering thanks
to new graphics horsepower they're
putting in here
more harddrive space things of that
nature so evolutionary upgrades on top
of that I've told you before but not yet
showing you this guy this is the 4G
adapter it docks here in a smartphone
cradle that is in the console and what
this does with a carrier yet-to-be-named
by the way so I can't tell you who it is
it's got a sim card here you set up an
account for this device in particular
now it's taking advantage of Shore power
in the car to run as well as hooking up
to an external Sailor antenna to get
better reception in and then it turns
that 4g into a hotspot here in the car
to power things like your iPad on this
pretty slick BMW mount here behind the
seat they've also adopted four new apps
that are now supported inside of BMWs
iDrive system glimpse for location
sharing audible for audiobooks Rhapsody
a well known subscription music service
and tuning which is also a music service
but not about music cuts it's about
radio stations there's already been web
radio in BMWs iDrive system for a few
years this will now be a parallel system
when you enter the car with tuned in
it'll automatically transfer its
connectivity and playback into the head
unit as you enter the vehicle so a
seamless experience with tuning in and
out of the car and one last thing coming
in I Drive for point two that you'll see
in the newer BMWs is the cheaters
nightmare the ability to pair two phones
at once so you and your wife's phone can
be paired at the same time and it merges
the phone book so your contacts are all
there together in one scroll but you can
see where that could go left for some
people now new voice command power is
coming as well in the new I drive in
fact it's already started in a few of
their models it lets you do much more
natural language so when you want to
navigate somewhere you can just say
navigate me to or something like that as
a
opposed to the exact phrase you have to
use in the earlier systems you can still
blurt out the address in one phrase 350
Hudson Avenue New York City New York
there's also a much more sophisticated
dictation ability in partnership with
your smartphone you can dictate more
advanced emails or text even edit them
by voice because they're using dragon
voice technology that is partly cloud
based to actually make sense of what
you're saying but native commands on the
iDrive systems are still processed and
handled onboard in the car so you don't
need a connection to make that stuff
work not really part of I drive but
related because it's LCD technology is a
coming option it's in Europe now that
would allow you to option up an all LCD
instrument panel that's pretty slick
because it allows you to change the
kinds of information you've got and the
way it's presented you can emphasize one
gauge over the other it might change
colors in sport mode it might drop a
gauge or two out of there that aren't
essential at the moment so that'll be
coming as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
