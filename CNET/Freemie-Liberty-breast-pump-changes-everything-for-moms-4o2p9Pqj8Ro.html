pumping is not glamorous it's messy
there are wires it's noisy but here
comes a new product that could change
all that so the free me Liberty it's a
breast pump
that's very discreet and quiet and
mobile you could just clip it on your
belt put it under your bra and walk
around hands-free you can even take in
math while pumping because this thing
has a sleep timer you can take a little
catnap required minutes 20 minutes and
it'll just keep pumping and auto shut
off when the timer's done and the way
that they designed it is that you don't
need bags you need anything extra in
this thing's what it'll hold eight
ounces and you can just pour it out into
another container when you're done
overall as someone who has done this
before it's not fun to do and this
sounds like a great solution because one
of the big headaches of breast pumping
is that it is noisy and you have to go
to the room to do it and you can't do it
while walking around and your hands are
occupied sometimes and you just find a
nice chair here they've actually made it
mobile and quiet that maybe I could be
on a phone call and you won't hear the
pump going off that's a big deal it's
pretty simple to take apart and it has
different attachments for different cup
sizes this isn't the first breast pump
we've seen last year at CES a company
called willow made one that also got a
lot of it
but as far as the free me Liberty it's
$300 Sully now at companies like bye-bye
a baby or babies or us or Amazon and I
guess you could say it gives moms the
Liberty to do their pumping but sleep on
the job if they want for see that I'm
