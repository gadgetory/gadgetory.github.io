and today we're going to take a look at
the onkyo TX and our six one six this is
a mid-range AV receiver from Akio and
it's currently selling for four hundred
and ten dollars and that makes it one of
the best AV receiver values on the
market now the design is nothing special
on the Akio this is a big bulky AV
receiver and the front panel doesn't
look quite as refined as models from say
Denon or Marantz the included remote is
decent although the buttons are pretty
small and it's a little more cluttered
than it needs to be around back you'll
see why this receiver is such a good
value including the front panel input
there are eight total HDMI inputs which
is two more than any other receiver at
this price the only catch is that
there's not enough input buttons to
access all of the inputs directly from
the remote so you'll need to navigate
the on-screen interface to get at that
eighth input the front panel HDMI input
is also MHL compatible so it'll work
with phones that support that new
connection type there's also an Ethernet
port on the back and that gives you
access to all of ACOs built-in streaming
audio services there's Spotify Pandora
Rhapsody slacker Last FM internet radio
and DLNA streaming which is a better
selection that you'll get on most
competitors you'll notice that there's
no built-in airplay support although
with the onkyo is low price you can
easily add an Apple TV which is going to
give you a lot more functionality than
just airplay and if you don't have a
thern ette in your living room
Anki offers a small Wi-Fi dongle for
around 25 bucks which is a lot less than
other receivers wireless solutions
these are interface for all these
services is decent compared to other
receivers but it looks a little
out-of-date compared to something like
an Apple TV or an Xbox 360 luckily you
can skip the on-screen interface and use
on Kiyo's smart phone app instead which
actually works pretty well although it
can be a little buggy at times we had
seen its resident golden ear steve
guttenberg take a listen to the onkyo
sound quality it wasn't quite up to the
level of last year's den on AVR 1912 but
it was still a solid performer overall
Blu ray concert disk sounded great as
well as blu-ray movies although the
Denon is slightly better especially with
movies really the only thing that gives
us pause about the onkyo are some early
complaints about firmware
we didn't run into any major problems
with our review sample with the latest
firmware loaded up but some buyers have
definitely had issues but that doesn't
hold us back from thinking lianca was
still a tremendous value overall with
tons of HDMI inputs a cheap Wi-Fi
adapter and lots of streaming media
services if you're looking to buy an AV
receiver this model or one of octave
step-down models that should be on your
shortlist I'm Matthew Muscovy ak and
this is the onkyo TX and our six one six</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
