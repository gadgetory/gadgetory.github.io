next to me is a 55 inch member of Vizio
Z series there's a lot of different size
and videos each series from 24 inches
all up to 70 this review will apply to
the 39 to 70 inch sizes those are the
ones that have videos local dimming
feature I'll get to that in a little bit
first quick look at the e-series styling
around the edge here you can see a
really thin bezel very minimalist look
the TV sits nice and low atop the stand
the stand does not swivel but all told
it's a relatively generic but also
unassuming look that'll pretty much fit
into any decor from the side you can see
this set is a little bit thicker than
some of the edgelet LED models out there
that's because it has a direct LED
backlight instead so it is a little
thick and the speaker's do face
backwards so the sound isn't that great
but again it's fine for a flat panel TV
in terms of styling not a big fan of
vizio is remote it's the same as it's
been since 2011 and buttons are really
closely spaced there's no backlighting
and all told a little bit difficult to
navigate the menus have improved however
this year Vizio did integrate the same
menus found in its step-up models from
last year into this inexpensive ease
series the set also has the new Smart TV
system from last year it's a really
simple design along the bottom of the
screen you get a bunch of icons that you
can scroll around you can also take away
and add icons of course the icons lead
to different apps including Netflix Hulu
Plus a few audio apps and the selection
apps is very good although you don't get
HBO go of course that's an exclusive to
Samsung this year one exclusive vizio
has is a Rhapsody app so if you
subscribe or you might appreciate having
the audio come out of the TV for that a
couple other things worth mentioning on
the TV this inexpensive you get built-in
Wi-Fi and the set can also use DLNA to
reach out and stream files from your
local network around back there's a
single USB port for streaming local
media as well as a number of HDMI inputs
that varies with the size of the TV the
larger TVs get more and the smaller TVs
get as little as two on the other side
you also get a component video input
composite video and an Ethernet jack
moving on to the picture quality that's
where the e-series really shines for
such an inexpensive TV this set has
simply phenomenal picture quality that's
a lot to do with the local dimming on
this TV which allows the LEDs to dim
individually depending on whether the
content itself is bright or dark so the
end result is excellent
contrast and local dimming just simply
isn't found at this price level the set
also has pretty accurate color and
decent video processing as well as a
nice matte screen for bright rooms
another bonus for the direct LED scheme
is excellent uniformity so I didn't
notice too many bright splotches on this
TV as we've seen on some other edgelet
LEDs all told the picture quality is
excellent on the Vizio e-series combine
that with its affordable price it's one
of the most recommendable TVs so far in
2014 that's a quick look at the Vizio
e-series again the 39 inch and larger
models I'm David Katz meier cocina</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
