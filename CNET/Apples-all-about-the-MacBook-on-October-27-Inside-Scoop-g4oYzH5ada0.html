second major event for full of 2016 seen
at senior a Teixeira Tipton is here with
the inside scoop on what to expect now
Shara macbook pro is long overdue for a
refresh what are some of the rumors
pointing to in what we might expect yeah
so we're expecting new macbook pros for
the first time in about four years
they've kind of updated them along the
way with new processors better screens
but no major update in a really long
time what we're looking for is a
redesign you know making it thinner and
lighter we're also thinking that there's
going to be a sort of touchscreen on the
keyboard so instead of the function keys
and be more programmable there could be
a touch ID so you could log into your
computer with your thumb prints some of
these other features that kind of just
modernize the device this sounds a lot
like the desktop and the phone lines are
kind of converging in a little bit of a
way especially we saw mac OS Sierra with
some Syria in Tacoma in two what's the
likelihood that will see Apple kind of
making more moves in kind of integrating
both product lines together I think for
Apple it's really important that their
devices talk together and you know
communicate really easily they've always
said that they want to keep them
distinct so that they're going to have
their max and then they're going to have
all their iOS devices we'll have to see
what these new computers if they get
even closer together but for right now
they're still saying distinct and apples
earnings is on Tuesday that is two days
before the actual event what are we
expecting to see in terms of any kind of
hints about how the iphone has performed
perhaps yeah so this will be the first
sign we get of what iphone sales have
been like there's just a few days of
iphone sales included in this quarter so
what people are really going to be
focused on is the guidance for the next
quarter that's going to be their first
full quarter of iphone 7 sales so people
are going to be seeing you know are
these stronger than they thought is it
not selling as well as people thought
that's what's going to be really key for
them sharra thank you so much and make
sure to stay tuned to seen it for all of
the information on the apple event on
October 27
