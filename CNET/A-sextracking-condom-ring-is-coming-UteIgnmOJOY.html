now a sex tracking wearable gadget it's
called the icon and it's marketed as the
world's first smart condom but it's not
actually a condom at all it's a ring
that sits at the base of the condom like
a Fitbit for your man bits but instead
of tracking your calories burned during
a walk it's tracking calories burned
during sex
how you ask well there is plenty of data
this doohickey is gathering such as the
speed and quantity of thrusts the
velocity of thrusts average skin
temperature and girth measurement and
best of all you can share all of this
data with friends or compare it to the
world so now we live in a universe where
there are app leaderboards for thrust
velocity but thankfully we can count on
the Internet to share varying positions
on the matter like reminding us how this
gives partners precise scientific data
to point out how disappointing you are
the company behind this tech is British
condoms and it took three years to bang
this out certainly not a quickie
endeavor it has eight hours of endurance
before it runs out of juice and needs a
recharge it's available for pre-order
for 60 pounds which is about 74 US
dollars no word on when it will come out
this year but the company will not
charge you until it has a firm release
there is no photos of what it actually
looks like and the company didn't
respond to our story for a comment but
it's not the first company to dip into
the space last year there was a failed
crowdfunding campaign for a wearable sex
toy called lovely but it didn't track
stats so until we live in a world where
you can get analytical data of your
pelvic performance you could ask your
partner what makes them happy
