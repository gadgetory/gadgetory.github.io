del Conte and it's time to get loaded we
have some pricing for Microsoft Kinect
and the new xbox the new xbox discussed
last week at e3 will cost 299 but it
looks like there will be two other
versions for $249 and $149 bolt with
less built-in storage if you buy them
bundled with Kinect add one hundred
dollars to those price tags but if you
buy kinect alone it will cost you one
hundred and fifty dollars and the amazon
kindle got a pretty significant price
cut its now 189 dollars as opposed to
two hundred fifty nine dollars this
happened on Monday the same day that
Barnes &amp;amp; Noble cut the price of the nook
these are both one-trick pony so it does
make sense that they would lower their
prices to reflect that given the state
of the industry and best buy has a new
digital alarm clock that looks like the
sony dash it's this insignia info cast
internet media display it runs chumby
apps just like the dash it has an image
display as well as built-in microphone
so perhaps you could speak to your alarm
clock although in my experience
voice-activated alarm clocks are more
trouble than they're worth it costs 170
dollars though which is thirty dollars
more than the dash and a lot of dough
for a bedside computer and google
continues to get in trouble for
collecting Wi-Fi information when it's
Street View truck scrawled neighborhoods
around the world at least 30 states are
investigating this data and trying to
figure out what to do about it the state
of Connecticut is leading this brigade
more specifically Attorney General
Richard Blumenthal they will be seeking
additional information from google and
trying to determine if any laws were
broken that's your news for now thank
you for watching i'm natali del conte
with Cena TV and you've just been loaded
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
