this year's WWDC and now Apple's getting
it out just under the wire for 2017 the
pro aspect of the system is pretty much
all on the inside where Apple has put as
high-end parts as it could without
worrying about it bursting into flame
it's got an Intel Xeon w series
workstation processor with options for
between 8 and 18 core configurations AMD
Radeon Pro Vega 56 or 64 graphics and up
to 128 gigabytes of ECC memory the 8 and
10 core versions will be available now
while you can pre-order the higher core
models for late January ship via a new
in-house t2 chip it also beefed up a
hardware level security which was
necessary for many workstation uses and
one of the things I was most wondering
about I'm sure Apple has very good
reasons for sticking with essentially
the same chassis as the old iMac and it
seems to handle the heat decently and
quietly at least for the lower core
versions but the company really missed
the opportunity to update the look or
correct drawbacks of the current design
like the inability to raise and lower
the display or putting the SD card slot
in a better location the memory access
panel was replaced by a vent but memory
can still be upgraded to be a service
center and it does have some extra
Thunderbolt USBC ports which is nice
given the up-to-date high-level
components it's not surprising that is
probably faster than any Mac to date but
I really feel that unless you've got a
pent-up need for an iMac on steroids I'd
wait and see what the new Mac Pro looks
like as well as to see if Apple decides
to finally redesign its all-in-one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
