what this is I'll bet not it's a whole
new idea for Jeep they're moving into
the subcompact crossovers going after
cars like Kia Soul and Nissan Juke sorry
different for them with this the 2015
renegade now if you look at this and
sneer and say oh what a cute little
urban vehicle
simmer down for a second this is gonna
be available in full on trail rated
version with a very advanced
four-wheel-drive system it can send 100%
of power to anyone wheel but normally
the rear ends gonna freewheel for fuel
economy but kick back in instantaneously
when you need four-wheel drive on demand
the underpinnings are loosely based on
the Fiat 500l this vehicles actually
made in a plant in Melfi Italy they just
spent 1.3 billion dollars bringing
online this is telling you that this is
a major push by Chrysler Fiat and on
global scale two engines a 1.4 liter
inline 4 turbo that I did tested on the
Dodge Dart 168 horsepower or a 2.4 liter
inline-4 doing 184 horsepower 6-speed
manual now inside the new renegade it's
a combination of improved technology and
wash it out with a hose rugged it's kind
of a weird mixed message but that's the
Jeep thing and you also find you've got
a pretty good sized instrument panel LCD
between a couple of analog gauges here's
a you connect head unit that's of course
pretty premium stuff in the Chrysler
world and these guys always done a very
good job of having all the mainstream
digital media sources in their vehicle
that's been a Christman strong point now
over heads interesting you might see
what you think our dual Sun roofs or a
panoramic sunroof these are dual pop-out
roof panels I'm not sure if that's gonna
fly as being a differentiator or just a
pain in the ass now this goes on sale
fall of 2014 as I mentioned a lot of
markets around the world it's more than
it's a global effort in terms of volume
it's also interesting mix up urban size
and style with serious off-road cred
should you equip it properly I don't
think anyone's have really done that
combination before should be interesting
to see how it does
