chromecast a video device designed to
take the pain out of streaming video to
your TV now in 2015 it's trying to do
the same thing for your stereo with the
new chromecast Audio at the same price
of $35 the chromecast Audio is
ridiculously small and yet very powerful
it offers ease of use and is also very
flexible it's designed to be hooked up
by the included cable to an auxilary put
on any speaker or with a separate
adapter to a stereo RCA while it has a
decent sounding digital analog converter
onboard the unit also has an optical
output this means you can hook it up to
your receiver or a high-end processor if
you like this is something no other
dongle under $100 currently does while
it's not yet functional the audio will
soon get multi room streaming which will
enable you to group speakers together in
your house so now said better look out
you can use the chromecast Audio in a
variety of ways with an Android device
iOS device or a chromecast extension in
the Chrome browser the number of apps
that support it natively though is
growing with the biggest one now being
Spotify to use it simply hit the cast
button and pick the adapter you want to
send it to and it just works if you have
an Android device you can also press the
hamburger button in the chromecast app
and press cast audio video and that will
unable to send all the audio from your
device straight to your speakers sadly
google tells us Apple devices probably
won't ever get this option as a result
the chromecast Audio makes the most
sense for Android fans they can also use
it in almost the same way as Bluetooth
but with much better sound quality and
it offers the ability to play in several
rooms at once for the money it will be a
long while if ever before there's
anything this simple or this good this
