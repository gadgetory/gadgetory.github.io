brand one company thinks yes we're
taking a look at the first two Mobile's
from wily phox a new brand that's
positioning itself as a feisty upstart
is promising good hardware some
interesting software tweaks and low low
prices so let's start off by taking a
look at the actual hardware and we'll
begin with the Swift which is the
smaller of the two phones so this is a
5-inch display it's got 4G onboard
that's a 13 megapixel camera around the
back and on the front that's a 5
megapixel snapper the Swift has 16
gigabytes of storage which you can
backup with a micro SD card now the
storm doesn't look too different but it
does have slightly more fancy hardware
so that's a 5.5 inch display instead of
5-inch there's got a 20 megapixel camera
8 megapixel camera on the front and it's
got 32 gigabytes of on-board storage you
can also bulk that up with a microSD
card if it's not enough so let's move on
to the software because that's where
both of these phones gets a little more
interesting they're running cyanogen
12.1 which is based on android but does
offer a few extra tweaks for instance
there are some interesting security
features you can do things like
permanently blocked numbers these phones
will supposedly identify spam callers
you can also scramble your passcode lock
so the numbers always appear in a
different randomized place to foil
people looking over your shoulder and
you get very very detailed control over
what information every different app can
access the cameras have slow motion
video which is quite interesting and one
thing I really like is that you can
customize these navigation buttons along
the bottom also you get a bunch of EQ
presets if you want to tinker with the
built-in sound so let's get onto that
all-important price now the Swift is
going to cost 129 pounds when it goes on
sale in September and the storm is going
to cost 199 pounds when it goes on sale
a little bit later in October one bit of
bad news is that it looks like there's
no US release date for now so these
things are only going to be on sale in
the UK and around Europe so would you
buy a phone that wasn't from a major
smartphone manufacturer do you like the
look of these wily phox mobiles let me
know and stay tuned to see net</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
