to charge you to play a DVD Oh No
I'm Bridget Carey this is your CNET
update there are some things in life you
shouldn't have to pay a fee to use and
plain a DVD movie on your computer's DVD
drive is one of those things
Windows 10 users are in a bit of a tizzy
right now because the operating system
upgrade last week was free but for some
people it didn't come with any program
to let you watch a DVD in your
computer's DVD Drive that's right no
Windows Media Center I know the concept
of using a DVD to watch a movie must
seem archaic in this streaming age but
hey if you have the DVD drive on your
computer you should be able to use it to
watch DVDs so these people who can't
play DVDs are going to the Windows app
store to find a solution and behold
there's the Windows DVD player program
to download listed for $15 but before
you pay a movie ticket price to watch
the movies you already own be aware
there are free programs out there that
do the same thing you don't have to pay
one of the most popular free programs is
VLC media player and it plays a variety
of media formats now some people out
there don't have this issue the Windows
DVD player program comes free if you are
upgrading from a version of Windows that
came with the media center program such
as Windows 7 home premium professional
and ultimate along with Windows 8 and
8.1 with media center for those folks
it'll arrive as an automatic software
update moving on from playing video to a
streaming video Facebook is mimicking
the success of periscope and meerkat and
created its own app for broadcasting
live video feeds but there's a catch
only celebrities can use it the feature
is simply called live and it lists
public figures and celebrities broadcast
live video from their phone to their fan
base some of the first to use it we're a
professional skier Lindsey Vonn and
country star Luke Bryan and actor Dwayne
the rock Johnson is also in the mix the
people broadcasting see a real-time
stream of comments and how many people
are watching live but what makes it
different from Twitter's periscope is
that the videos don't disappear after a
day they live on in
Facebook page until the person deletes
it no word from Facebook if it'll expand
this feature to all users but you think
they would with how serious Facebook is
getting into becoming a video hub live
works for the public figures to
communicate to followers but there's
another change Facebook is making to
help businesses better communicate to
customers you may start to see the
option to talk to a company on Facebook
through the messenger chat app you can
think of it as a way to directly reach
customer service but it's in the same
map that you chat with your friends
that's it for this tech news update you
can always get more at cnet.com from our
studios in New York I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
