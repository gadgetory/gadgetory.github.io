in your car everyday or soon will number
five is infotainment seems pretty low
for something which includes navigation
mobile devices satellite radio and apps
and more but I put infotainment
electronics rather low because it still
lags well behind our phones in terms of
scope and elegance and until that
changes it stays down here in the cellar
number four is lighting yes General
Motors rolled out smart lighting like
our tronic eye some 60 years ago but it
was like something out of a Flash Gordon
movie wonky today Auto lighting
electronics are solid you may switch
your new cars lights to automatic the
first night you own it and not touch
them again for months and soon smart
beam shaping lights will arrive that
will utterly transform the way your car
lights the road not just when it does
number three keys and security it used
to be that when your car was getting
boosted all I could do is sound an alarm
that nobody cared about today security
electronics actually try to stop the
theft not annoy neighbours immobilizing
the car's ignition unless an electronic
smart key is present and that same key
is rarely handled today thanks to
electronics just leave it in your pocket
and the car's door handles and ignition
recognize you even other settings may
follow based on the keys presence it's
ironic that a key we barely have to
touch anymore
seems to be getting bigger and heavier
all the time number two is Road sensing
this is a big one it rolls up infrared
radar laser camera and ultrasound to
read the road detect cars around you and
even find and get into parking spaces
alongside you it's moving us fast from a
current world of driver assist to an
imminent world of self-driving cars the
other side of the coin are the sensors
that drive things like ABS airbags and
stability control those are the big
three that have made huge reductions in
many kinds of injuries and fatalities on
the road before I get to number one I
can tell you it won't be climate control
in spite of having a lot of electronics
behind it it just doesn't seem to have
made that much of a difference tell me
you don't still fiddle endlessly with
the heat and cooling
as you drive the number one way
electronics is revolutionized cars
lately is in the powertrain today's
engines and transmissions are run by
computers instead of past technologies
like carburetor adjustments or vacuum
timing contraptions and voodoo
transmission tweaks Electronics have
made car power trains more powerful less
fuel consuming much cleaner and with
ages between many service intervals this
is also the main reason your car starts
and runs the same every time
unimaginable a few decades ago and
whether you drive a minivan or an m3
that appliance light quality is the
electronic benefit you enjoy the most
