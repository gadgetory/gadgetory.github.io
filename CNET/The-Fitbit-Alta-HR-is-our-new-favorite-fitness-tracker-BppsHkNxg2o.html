new favorite fitness tracker and
according to Fitbit it's also the
world's slimmest fitness tracker with
continuous heartrate but despite that
sensor the battery will still last seven
days which is pretty damn impressive
given its small size the Alta HR is also
the first Fitbit to get a new sleep
feature instead of simply tracking how
long you slept it will now measure when
you're in light deep and REM sleep
cycles but this feature will also be
coming to the charge - and blaze later
this month now aside from the heart rate
sensor this is essentially the same Alta
tracker we reviewed a year ago
it has swappable bands and contract
steps distance calories burned active
minutes and sleep it will also display
notifications for incoming calls text
messages and calendar alerts but like I
said with the original Alta the screen
is small and these notifications can be
hard to read and while the tracker can
automatically detect various activities
like running and biking
you can't manually start a workout like
you can on the charge - nor does it have
guided breathing sessions but that's not
a huge trade-off overall I think this is
the Fitbit tracker most people should
get it slim has great battery life and
not a complete eyesore like the charge -
can be plus it still has a heart rate
sensor for more accurate tracking really
the only downside is that's not swim
proof like the Flex - the Alta HR is
available now for $149 that's the same
price the charge - so really unless you
care about the stopwatch and workout
modes the Alta HR is the Fitbit to get
