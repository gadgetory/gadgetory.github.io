rugged but that's a good thing this
fairly average budget Android phone is
designed to take a beating and it's
waterproof
I'm a we've seen it today we're taking a
look at a device that could be a good
fit if your little accident-prone it's
available on t-mobile for just 150 bucks
but you can find it fairly cheaper
elsewhere the Hydra wave isn't all that
much to write home about the 5-inch
display is a fairly low 960 by 540 pixel
resolution which means it's not going to
be an ideal option if you want to stream
high quality HD videos or showoff photos
but even in spite of that low resolution
it isn't a terrible display the viewing
angles are generous so you can see
things clearly even when you hold the
phone in an odd angle the phone is
powered by a 1.2 gigahertz Qualcomm
Snapdragon processor there's 4 gigs of
available storage space for you to work
with and a lot of that is taken up by
pre-loaded junk but you can't move
you're going to want to pick up a
microSD card it can support up to 32
gigs you can get to the card slot by
prying off the back cover the battery
isn't removable but I've seen an average
of about 8 hours and 40 minutes thus far
an hour video playback battery drain
test I still got some testing to do
there though the phone is also impact
resistant dust proof and can survive and
up to three meters of water for up to 30
minutes I had 150 dollars the Kyocera
hydro wave isn't really gonna blow
anyone away but that's fairly
inexpensive and it could come in handy
if you find yourself dropping your phone
to puddles a lot
I'm Nate Ralph be sure to check out our
full review on CNET to see how it stacks
up to the rest of the budget smart
phones out there thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
