it's kind of like the Home Shopping
Network I'm Bridget Carey this is your
scene that update Amazon has a brand-new
30-minute live daily show and it's just
to talk about fashion things that you
can buy on Amazon it's as if they mix
the Home Shopping Network with YouTube
makeup tutorials and are hosting it with
hip young quasi famous ish people it's
called style code live and it streams on
amazon.com at 9 p.m. Eastern 6:00
Pacific Monday through Friday it's
hosted by Lindsey Rodriguez who has been
on MTV's Total Request Live and there's
rachel smith a correspondent at Good
Morning America and frankie grande a
Broadway performer who was on Big
Brother and is also the big brother to
singer ariana grande and these three
will tell you about hot style trends
with celebrity guests and you'll see
links to buy the stuff that's featured
Amazon had made some pushes before into
selling apparel with the Amazon fashion
page and this is another way to get a
younger generation to think about buying
clothes and makeup from Amazon and maybe
next will be shopping on Amazon inside
virtual reality because Amazon is
looking to hire a senior software
development manager for virtual reality
that's according to a new job posting
spotted on the site glass door
this person will lead a team to build
quote the virtual reality experience
with an Amazon video and in other new
ways to spend your money Apple pay has
expanded mobile payments to mobile gas
stations well I should say Exxon Mobil
the new Exxon Mobil speed pass plus app
lets you pay for gas with your phone but
you do not have to tap the phone to
anything on the pump you don't even need
to get out of your car to pay you just
need to have location turned on with GPS
the app tells which station you're at
and then you just tell it what pump
number you're at like pump number 8 and
use your fingerprint to approve the
transaction then the pump is unlocked
and you have 45 seconds to get out and
start filling up this launched Tuesday
at six thousand Exxon and Mobil stations
across the US and it's going to be at
all locations by the end of the year
mobile payments are slowly expanding
across the globe just
this week square became available in
Australia and square is that little card
reader that you can put on a phone or
tablet to make a payment it's pretty
popular with small business owners
Australia is only the fourth country to
get square following the US Canada and
Japan that's it for this tech news
