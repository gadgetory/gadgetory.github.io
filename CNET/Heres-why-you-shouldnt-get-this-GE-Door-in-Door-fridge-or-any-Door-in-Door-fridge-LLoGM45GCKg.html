open the front panel of your
refrigerator exposing the indoor shelves
without actually opening the door itself
LG and Samsung were the first to
popularize the feature now ge wants into
this refrigerator the gfd 2 8 GE LDS is
one of GES new door in door fridges and
at a retail price of $3,100 the door and
door compartment is really its only
feature of note you won't get an
auto-fill water dispenser or an auto
filling water pitcher like another ge
fridges and it can't make you a cup of
coffee either there's no temperature
adjustable drawer no smart home
integrations and not even any drawers or
shelves that slide in and fold up out of
the way hope you love that door indoor
compartment because it's really all
you're getting and here's the thing door
and door is a terrible feature it's
pitched as a convenience but it's purely
a gimmick I mean you're still opening a
door and grabbing your groceries there's
no difference doesn't make a difference
in performance either it's not gonna
help your fridge hold the cold any
better in fact almost every door indoor
compartment that I've ever tested has
run warm and this one as you can see is
no different now GE seems aware of this
because this refrigerator uses ten
percent more energy than an identical GE
refrigerator that doesn't have a door
indoor compartment in other words ge
cranked up the cooling power and still
couldn't get that compartment cold
enough in the meantime you're spending
more on your power bill for a feature
that again offers little to no practical
benefit that wasn't my only performance
problem with this fridge when we cranked
it down to its coldest setting of 34
degrees three degrees less than the
default setting the average temperatures
only fell by a single degree it's some
of the weakest performance I've seen
from a high-end fridge at its coldest
setting now whenever we run a 72 hour
test of a fridge we open the doors twice
a day for five minutes in order to
simulate real usage
with this fridge we ran the coldest
setting test a second time but we
replace those normal fridge door
openings with door and door compartment
openings to see if that would make the
performance any better in the end it
didn't make a difference opening the
door indoor compartment allowed just as
much hot air inside as when I opened the
fridge itself after 72 hours average
temperatures were only 0.16 degrees
lower and again that's if you're using
the door indoor compartment exclusive
and never opening the fridge at all now
design wise I do want to give GE a
little bit of credit for adding in a
special shelf into that door indoor
compartment that rotates out of the
fridge kind of like a lazy susan it's
extremely sturdy thanks to that thick
metal plate that it sits on and that's
nice
it also helps this fridge set itself
apart from other door and door fridges
like it still it's more of a cosmetic
feature than anything else if you can't
tell by now I don't recommend this
fridge or really any other door indoor
fridge it's just a very poor reason to
spend more on a refrigerator especially
a refrigerator like this one that
doesn't offer anything else along with
it hard to fault the team at GE for
trying to keep up with LG and Samsung
who continue to gobble up more and more
of the market but this was probably a
trend they should have avoided</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
