narrowed down the choice between a smart
phone or feature phone and now you have
three or four that you're seriously
considering let's take a look at some
key features that will help you make a
decision if you're shopping for a
smartphone one of the big concerns is
compatibility is it going to work with
the software and services you rely on
calendars email and documents if you're
already committed to Apple services like
iTunes and iCloud your choice is already
narrowed down for you but Google fans
don't have to commit to an Android
device to take advantage of services
like Gmail or Google Docs another big
one for smartphones is network speed
does it run on the latest 4G data
network technology which phone will
retrieve your email and connect you to
the web the fastest don't forget that
faster speeds might mean more data usage
make sure to watch your plan limits
camera quality is a big concern now that
people are retiring their point and
shoot cameras for their cellphones
higher megapixels aren't always better
so give it a test drive also notice if
it has a flash for taking photos in
low-light and while you're at it think
about storage capacity if this thing is
your new camera you'll want to know how
many photos and videos it can hold and
how to transfer those over to your
computer assuming that you're actually
going to use your phone for making calls
what's the call quality like how loud is
the speaker phone is the address book
easy to use also take a moment to
evaluate the screen quality now that
these phones are fifty percent screen
this is a big deal is one phone easier
to read than the other if the keyboard
is on the screen test it out and see if
you can type on it accurately give the
other physical controls a spin to if
this thing's ringing in your pocket how
long is going to take you to find the
answer button think about battery life
can you buy a spare battery for the
phone is the charging cable easy to
replace if you lose it and finally apps
most phones have some kind of built-in
store where you can purchase software
and games which one is a better
selection of the stuff you want maybe
you've already purchased apps for a
phone or tablet and you want something
that's compatible all of these are
criteria that you can use to help cut
down your options until you get to the
perfect phone and we have even more for
you over at cnet cell phone buying guide
