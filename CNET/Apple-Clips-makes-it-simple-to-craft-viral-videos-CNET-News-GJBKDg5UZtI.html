videos to share on social media the
company has a brand new app it's called
clips and it's coming out in April for
iPhones and iPads
it has a very Instagram and snapchat Eve
I've about it you stitch together photos
and videos add captions and filters to
give it different special effects slap
on some emojis speech bubbles and arrows
to flow it on top but here's where Apple
clips stands apart it automatically
transcribes what you say to put captions
on the video timed to when you actually
send the words so if you slowly deliver
a line it's going to show up slowly and
splash across the screen why well
because so many of us are now watching
video with the volume off on networks
like Facebook but for those of you with
the volume up well you can splice in
soundtracks there are several dozen
soundtracks that layer in automatically
to fit the length of your clip there's
even tracks from artists you know like
composer Hans Zimmer and in the end your
video is gonna be cropped to a square
making it phone friendly for those that
take vertical videos you're then
prompted to share and export it to other
apps like Facebook YouTube and Instagram
or you can share it with friends such as
the friends in your video because the
app can recognize the faces of people in
your video if those people happen to be
tagged in your Photos app and if the
audio picks up you mentioning the name
of someone on your iPhone contacts it's
gonna suggest that you share the video
with those people so in the end you can
think of it as a light video editing
tool like an iMovie jr. but with some
social media flavor crystals sprinkled
throughout I'm Bridget Carey and for
