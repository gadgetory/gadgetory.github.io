Microsoft's the anniversary update to
Windows 10 coming this summer for free
to all of our Windows 10 customers this
is this is so easy I'm on a device right
now to roll my fingerprint all I'm gonna
do is just touch log on with Windows
hello and now it's asking me to touch my
fingerprint and just like this it logs
in it's that fast it's easy it's safe
its secure we are pumped about it now
let's talk about more personal computing
and getting a little bit productive here
right Terry mentioned a new experience
is going to put ink front and center
our goal with Windows ink is to really
combine the the naturalness and the
speed of pen and paper with the power of
a PC I'm gonna push this pin button
check this out this is the ink workspace
all things ink are here these are the
three tasks people do most I'm gonna
jump in on that in a second but look at
this my most recently used pen apps I
can get right back in and do what I was
doing also down here tips and tricks so
users are gonna know what to do with
this pen we're gonna walk you through
that but another thing I want to call
out to you folks this right here
suggested apps this is one place where
if I touch this I'm gonna go to a
dedicated section of the store that just
is amazing apps that support pen all
right so we're gonna light that up for
folks they're gonna know what to do with
the pen we're putting it right front and
center 3m sells 50-billion sticky notes
a year all right today on Windows 10 we
have 8 million monthly active users of
sticky notes and 3 million daily active
users so of course we're gonna make this
better I can get to my sticky notes
right here check this out but watch what
happens when I write tomorrow okay look
first of all look how easy and and
smooth this ink is flowing but watch
what happens next I wrote the word
tomorrow and because we're combining the
power the pen in the PC you see it
turned blue that's cuz we're smart
enough to know that was handwriting to
know that it was a day so if I touch it
my homie who rocks it reminders for
tannaz easily able to come up and
actually set that reminder for me okay
and beyond just set reminders of Cortana
Bing is integrated we'll be able to
recognize places you know maps all kind
of cool stuff check this out
the sketch pad I already wrote some
stuff here for you so maybe these lines
were not as cool as I wanted them to be
look how I'm easily able to come in and
rotate this I can come in and get my
line super straight I can come in and do
this
you like it cool and of course the last
thing this is about them if I don't do
it y'all remember back in grade school
the first thing you learn is that
whenever you have a heart you got put
the arrow and you got to do that ok and
now because this is the power of the PC
yes that person was excited about the
heart I wrote that heart for my person
so I'm not gonna lose this whiteboard
cuz I have the power of a PC and you
know what just so y'all can have this
for later I'm gonna go ahead and tweet</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
