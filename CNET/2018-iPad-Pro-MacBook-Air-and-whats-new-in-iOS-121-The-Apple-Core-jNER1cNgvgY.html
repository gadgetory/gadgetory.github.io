at this latest Apple event and all the
new features from iOS 12.1 let's get
right to the core of this week's Apple
news and rumors
Apple announced three new products at
its latest launch event in Brooklyn New
York and there were really no surprises
here because we pretty much expected all
of it based on the rumors iPad pros
MacBook Air and Mac Mini well I guess in
this case it would be five products
because there's two iPad pros and we
also got an Apple pencil but then you'd
have to count the keyboard so let's just
call it three for now now what was kind
of surprising or at least disappointing
on my end was that there was no mention
of that air power mat now something must
have gone terribly wrong with this
product because it's very unlike Apple
to wait over a year to take a product to
market that they had already announced
now let's talk about the products that
we did end up with starting with those
new iPad pros now we have an 11 inch
display and a 12 point 9 inch display
but that 12 point 9 inch display will
have a much smaller footprint than the
previous 12 point 9 inch iPad pro that's
because it now has an edge to edge
display which we kind of already knew
about as well it doesn't have a home
button and it does have face ID but it
doesn't have a notch which is great the
other important thing to point out about
the display it's that it's LCD and not
OLED like some of the rumors were
speculating and it has those rounded
edges the frame of the iPad itself has
also changed aside from being slimmer
it's kind of flat so it's reminiscent of
the iPhone 5s which is good for some
people some people don't like it I'm ok
with it I guess now this is gonna be a
very very powerful iPad it's running an
a 12 X Bionic chip so that means you can
run a full version of Photoshop like was
noted in the keynote now the other thing
that could be perceived as good or bad
is that Apple has eliminated the
lightning port and now changed it for a
USBC connector so this is good because
it gives the iPad more flexibility to
connect to other devices transmitted
video to other displays and even connect
other Apple products the downside is you
will have to switch up your cables
now the smart connector is located right
above the USBC port which is different
than the iPads previously but also had
been noted in some of the rumors but
probably the worst news for a lot of
people is the fact that it doesn't have
a headphone jack that means they're
forcing you to buy one of these and
spend nine dollars on a dongle because
it's not included in the box apple also
announced a new Apple pencil for these
iPads which now has controls on the
sides and it now snaps magnetically to
the top of the iPad and charges
wirelessly which is kind of brilliant
because at least you don't have to do
this but the downside is it's $30 more
expensive than the original Apple pencil
which was already priced at $99 that and
it's only compatible with the new iPads
which aren't cheap the cheapest model of
the iPad is the 11 inch with 64 gigs of
storage which runs at 799 dollars but
you can spend up to $1,900 for the
largest model with one terabyte of
storage that's not even counting the
Apple pencil and the keyboard and the
other product they announced much like
what the rumors had predicted was a
MacBook Air and it had been over four
years since Apple had updated this
laptop and ten years since launch so it
was a desperate need of a refresh now a
lot of it lines up with what we had
heard of before so a 13 inch Retina
screen with slimmer bezels it has touch
ID on the keyboard but all the design
changes are kind of in line with what we
had been seeing from the other macbook
so it's great but it's not necessarily
new now they did get rid of a lot of the
ports but it now has two Thunderbolt
three ports on one side and luckily a
headphone jack on the other side and
another cool thing is that it's a GPU
compatible which means you can have an
even more powerful computer now what
makes me kind of sad is that the Apple
on these devices and the new
it doesn't light up the other sad thing
is that it no longer starts below $1,000
the new price port for this one at least
the cheapest model is 1199 dollars and
you can spend up to $2,600 if you want
all the bells and whistles the other
notable product that doesn't get enough
airtime is the new Mac Mini in this case
a refresh Mac Mini which we were also
expecting and all of the upgrades were
in line with the rumor is so better
processor more storage space and plenty
of ports it also has a t2 security tip
which brings data encryption to the Mac
Mini which is also a plus now this one
also got a price hike in it now costs
seven hundred and ninety nine dollars
next up in 2019 thanks to Tim Cook
teasing it is the Mac Pro Update which
is also in desperate need of a refresh
now this week Apple also released its
latest software updates for TV OS Mac OS
watch OS and iOS now let's talk about
iOS for its mobile devices in this case
12.1 which springs your general bug
fixes and some new emojis redheads
kangaroos mangoes among others you can
go check them out now but the most
important thing here is that it finally
allows group FaceTime it's a feature
we've been waiting for since the iOS 12
update but it got delayed this means you
can video chat with 32 of your closest
friends if you have that many friends
honestly I don't know why you would want
a video chat with 32 people but the
options there
now if you've just purchased an iPhone
10 are 10s or 10 Macs you now have live
control of the blur in portrait mode
which is kind of cool and it also comes
with the dual SIM support that Apple had
promised for these newer devices now the
watch was 5.1 update didn't go so well
that's because maybe 12 hours after it
was released
Apple had to take it back that's because
users complained on Twitter and reddit
that the update was actually rendering
their series 4 completely useless so it
was breaking their device now if you
already updated to watch iOS 5.1 and
your device is still running then you're
probably good but if this happened to
you you might want to consider
contacting Apple care at least that's
what Apple said
just now the biggest update to watch OS
5.1 had to do with fault detection once
the Apple watch detects a fall it will
not only be able to alert emergency
services but now it will actually play a
recorded message telling them that
you've fallen and giving them your exact
coordinates which is pretty important
that does it for this show but we will
soon be publishing the full review of
all these Apple products so come back to
cnet.com for that and also I haven't
said this in a while but if you like the
