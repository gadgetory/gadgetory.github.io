systems as the Professional d5 as well
as a high sensitivity twenty point nine
megapixel CMOS sensor a large tilting
touchscreen and 4k video the $2000 Nikon
d5 hundred almost hits the bull's eye
for a modern DSLR for shooting action
the cameras fast with continuous
shooting that tests out as high as ten
point seven frames per second with fast
and accurate autofocus and auto exposure
and the buffers big enough that I can't
tell the difference between shooting
JPEG and raw plus JPEG in bursts at
maximum quality settings you will get
noticeably better performance using an x
QD card over the SD and high numbers
apply to the d5 hundreds iso sensitivity
as well you probably don't want to shoot
a lot at its maximum 1 million 640,000
setting though the fact that it can even
produce recognizable photos at that
setting is impressive the photos general
your excellent reasonably clean up
through ISO 6400 and usable even higher
it has great white balance and color
accuracy with a good dynamic range for
an aps-c sensor the 4k video is sharp
too that you do see some noise at higher
sensitivities overall there are a few
artifacts the dust and weather sealed
body has the typical streamlined nikon
pro SLR design and tons of customization
options only a couple of flaws knock the
D 500 off course though the D 500 adds
bluetooth for persistent wireless
connections the company's app for remote
shooting is really weak and Nikon has
perpetually lagged in that area so I
don't have high hopes for improvement
the other disappointment is LiveView
performance it's not bad it's just not
as fast as it should be for the money
and the autofocus isn't great for video
