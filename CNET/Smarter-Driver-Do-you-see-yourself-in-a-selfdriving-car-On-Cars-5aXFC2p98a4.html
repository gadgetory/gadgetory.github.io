good at it and we don't really trust
computers those three things are the
main hurdles that stand between a lot of
people and buying into the self-driving
future the autonomous car that's coming
that's not gonna stop it from getting
here but along the way it will behoove
regulators car makers and just about all
of us to pay attention to those who
maybe need to be brought along a little
more researchers Michael sivak and
Brandon shut lis at University of
Michigan have some early answers they
surveyed 505 adult us drivers in June
2015 to take their temp on vehicle
autonomy or attitudes bubbled up
autonomy itself the most drivers
especially women want no self-driving
followed by almost as many who are open
to partial self-driving and under 16%
interested in fully automated cars at
this point the biggest naysayers to full
automation where drivers 60 and older
just 11% of them liked the idea a big
problem for policy makers who think
autonomy is going to allow older drivers
to keep doing so safely longer control
we can't get imagine the steering wheel
and pedals going away over 96% of the
drivers said keep those century-old
controls even if a car is fully
self-driving interestingly there was
little difference in this response
between age groups or gender interface
here an almost even split between those
who want to tell their self-driving car
where to take them by a voice command
versus via a touchscreen have these
folks tried automotive voice commands
only 8% of drivers want to use their
phone for this task and a quaint 3%
thought a keyboard and mouse might work
best
finally notification for decades we're
going to have partial self-driving cars
that we'll need to hand it back to us on
occasion and clearly we don't want to be
surprised
over 59% of us want to be alerted by a
sound and visuals and something
vibrating about a fifth said they can do
without the vibration part maybe they've
tried one of those Cadillacs that
already has an odd vibrating alert seat
so it all adds up to a reality check and
it will pay for car makers and
regulators to double check their
assumptions about our attitudes around
self-driving in some of the details of
how we expect it to work rather than
assume that we're all going to embrace
it from some homogenous fashion more
