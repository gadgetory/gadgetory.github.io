and this is the show where we cover the
hottest apps in the mobile space now
casual games might not be enough for you
and you're really looking for something
that uses your brain so I've collected
some of the standout word games that
will keep your mind sharp and expand
your vocabulary now everyone knows about
words with friends it's free and it's
available for iOS and Android with its
Scrabble style word games and triple
letter scores now you can also play
against your Facebook friends but I'm
kind of getting tired of someone beating
me using the word za so what other word
games are out there one of the coolest
is a game called welder where you start
with a game board with letter tiles
randomly arranged you're given a limited
number of swaps to create four letter
words or larger now you can swap tiles
directly next to each other or
diagonally when words are created new
tiles come into play and then different
tiles have different attributes and even
when you end up creating words that
you've never heard of you can touch them
to find out what they mean it's 399 and
it's a little higher price but it will
challenge your mind and it's a real
thinking game now another game that's a
completely different kind of word game
is scribblenauts remix you might
recognize this one from the team at 5th
cell on the Nintendo DS but it's here on
iOS for 499 with exclusive levels you'll
be presented with different challenges
and it's up to you to write down items
that will appear in the game that you'll
need to solve the problem at hand so if
we're trying to get a night across this
lake with a shark well i'll create a
stun gun to shock the water then make
myself a boat while I give the night a
jetpack to get across see it's really up
to your own imagination to figure out
what works and what doesn't but this is
another awesome game so there you have
it 3 word games to increase your
loquacious pneus now if you guys have
any other apps you'd like to show us
post on our cnet facebook page and we'll
try to include them in future shows i'm
brian Tong thanks for watching and we'll
see you guys next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
