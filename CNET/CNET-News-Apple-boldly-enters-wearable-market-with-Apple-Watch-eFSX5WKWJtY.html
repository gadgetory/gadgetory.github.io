great products and we believe this
product will redefine what people expect
from its category I am so excited and I
am so proud to share it with you this
morning it is the next chapter in
Apple's story and here it is
Apple watch is the most personal device
we've ever created we set out to make
the best watch in the world one that is
precise it's synchronized with a
universal time standard and it's
accurate within plus or minus 50
milliseconds it's incredibly
customizable so you can find one that
reflects your personal style and taste
because you wear it we invented new
intimate ways to connect and communicate
directly from your wrist and it works
seamlessly with iPhone and it's also a
comprehensive health and fitness device
we placed extra functionality in a
mechanism that's been on the watch for
decades it's this dial it's called a
crown and on the Apple watch it's called
the digital crown the digital crown
includes infrared LEDs and photo diodes
that translate rotary movement into
digital data now you don't need to
understand all of that but but it's a
very simple and elegant and amazing
input and navigation device let me give
you an example here's back to the mound
when you turn the digital crown it zooms
in and out when you have a list you can
scroll through the list and you can do
all of this without blocking the strange
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
