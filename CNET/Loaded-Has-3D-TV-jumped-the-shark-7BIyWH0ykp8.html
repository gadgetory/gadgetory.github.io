Conte and it's time to get loaded sony
has dropped the price of the PSP go from
$249 to 199 dollars this price drop
happens in Japan and the US although the
PSP Go was never a big game changer in
portable gaming so I'm not sure it will
make much of a difference but it's just
about the holiday time so cheaper price
may move some models another device
getting a price drop the Kobo e-reader
the device which accesses borders
electronic book store went from one
hundred twenty-nine dollars to
ninety-nine dollars this week border
says that this is only for the holiday
season although I would be surprised if
the price did go back up considering
it's hardly selling like gangbusters and
Samsung's Galaxy Tab will launch on
November 14th on sprint the device will
cost 399 with a two-year contract it
comes in a two gig and five gig model
with messaging plans ranging from thirty
to sixty dollars per month last week we
learned that Verizon would also carry
the galaxy tab as well but they will not
require a contract and this may be a
sign that 3d TV has jumped the shark the
Rachael Ray Show is doing a 3d halloween
special that lets viewers see the show
