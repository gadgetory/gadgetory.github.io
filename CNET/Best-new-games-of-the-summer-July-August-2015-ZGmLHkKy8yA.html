your summer is off to a fantastic start
historically summertime is not a very
plentiful time of the year when it comes
to compelling game releases but I've
done my homework I've gone through the
calendar to bring you the very best of
the new titles that will hit over the
next two months July and August so here
are the game releases to keep an eye on
for the next two months will start
things off on July fourteenth when God
of War 3 remastered will hit the ps4 I
kind of wish we got all the god of war
games here but nevertheless we'll take
what we can get also on the 14th is Rory
McIlroy PGA Tour you notice how they
took Tiger Woods's name off the game and
I'll let you draw your own conclusions
Sui EA did that right so that does it
for July like I said not a whole lot
coming out but in August we get a brand
new game from rare that was just
announced at e3 2015 on August fourth
rare replay will hit which is an
anthology game that includes 13 games
from the rare archives that's pretty
cool everybody's gone to the rapture is
a story-driven open world title where
six characters each tell their own story
of the apocalypse pretty interesting
stuff keep an eye out for that on august
25th xbox one owners will be able to
re-experience the original Gears of War
when the Ultimate Edition ships with
five unreleased chapters and of course
years of war for beta access also on
August 25th marks the annual release of
madden 16 which is likely going to be
the last year ps3 and xbox 360 owners
will get a version of the game finally
also on the 25th is until dawn the
cinematic survival horror game for the
ps4 that follows a group of friends who
rent a cabin that is attacked by a
serial killer your decisions affect the
way the story is played out which in
theory sounds good on paper so
it might be worth checking that one out
as well that'll do it for me things
definitely start to heat up again in
September so join me then for the new
games you must have on your radar but in
mention your most anticipated game for
july and august make sure to hit me up
on twitter that will do it for me thanks
so much for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
