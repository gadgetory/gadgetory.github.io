the first year after Windows 10 is
available we will be making available a
free upgrade to Windows 10 to all
devices running Windows 8.1 and we will
also be making available a free upgrade
to Windows 10 to all devices running
Windows Phone 8.1 and last but not least
we will be making available a free
upgrade to all of our customers still
running windows 7 and continuum is about
enabling a two in one device like this
you'll see I've got a bunch of windows
open in various positions on the screen
I can move those around use my mouse and
keyboard but when I remove the mouse and
keyboard you'll see we get a little pop
up here do you want to enter tablet mode
I'll choose that and now my windows are
full screen and I can use this in a very
natural way like a tablet I can left
swipe in to get task switching and then
switch between full screen apps if I
touch the start button there you'll see
it's now automatically the full screen
start menu which I can use touch
gestures to navigate around and then
when I'm done using it like a tablet I
snap the keyboard back in I get a prompt
I can exit tablet mode and now I'm right
back to where I was and the whole point
is a device like this elegantly
transforms from one mode to another
Cortana we're excited to welcome you to
the PC hey Cortana hey Joe what have you
been up to lately well this morning I
said a reminder for you the Cortana home
page shows up and you'll see helpful
things that she's providing to you
proactively you can see here she's
tracking a flight that my wife is going
to be on tonight here's some stock
information sports news obviously I'm
interested in news about the super bowl
and so on and so on and so on this is a
Lumia 1520 running a recent build of
windows 10 and i'm going to show you
first i'm going to focus just on the co
or experience and give you a sense of
how it aligns with the pc how it'll be a
great companion to the pc so let me
unlock and the first thing you'll notice
the start experience is quite familiar
to people who've been using Windows
Phone in the past but if you look there
you can see in the background I've got a
full bleed customized background image a
nice personalization feature that a lot
of our users have been asking for I can
now use the review tab that I use all
the time on the PC to move from change
to change except to change reject to
change add comments read the comments do
my collaboration while I'm on the go and
with a device like this you get a nearly
no compromises experience in terms of
completeness fidelity and richness as
you're trying to create documents or
collaborate with people on documents we
think this will be a great benefit to
everybody trying to be productive on
their phones today I'm excited to
introduce you to code name project
Spartan our new web browsing experience
for Windows 10 it fits in with the
design language of Windows 10 and you
can see the focus is on the content on
the page I'm going to switch into my
reading mode right here and you'll see
we discover ibly make available a
standardized format way for you to read
stuff on the web and you can personalize
this to your liking the third thing that
we tried to do was to give you a
personal assistant so we're building
Cortana right into Spartan i'm here to
announce that with windows 10 we will
enable streaming of xbox one games to
any Windows 10 PC or tablet in your home
later this year this is an ad for a
murky display with integrated compute it
has built-in sensors that actually
detected me when I came to the screen it
has built-in cameras speakers Mike's
Wi-Fi Bluetooth NFC is got it all nows
Lorraine finishes building the first leg
of the quadcopter she's going to have to
create three more and notice how easy it
is for her to mirror and then copy it
okay let's get that bright yellow again
here we go for this piece
I'm getting a good area 51 vibe this is
a 3d print we made earlier of Lorraine's
creation and Lorraine's quadcopter this
was made entirely in Hollis to do</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
