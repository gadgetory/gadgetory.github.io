beautiful to look at has a lot of
connections and almost as many OST
features as professional monitors have
so why am I not more excited about it hi
I'm Eric Franklin and today I'll take a
first look at the Samsung sync master
t27 be 750 the TV 750 looks a lot like
the ta 950 from last year except the 750
is mostly white and more curvaceous the
screen tilts back but there's no swivel
pivot or height adjustment the OSD array
is well it's right here okay I confess I
didn't use the OSD array to navigate
that much I want to use it more but the
included remote control was just a
little too tempting the OSD has typical
picture adjustments Samsung's magic
angle feature and color temperature
presets there are two HDMI inputs one
for connecting to a PC and the other for
using the monitor as a television when
connected as a TV you get new presets
and additional color options other
connections include component composite
a headphone jack digital audio Ethernet
and MH l connection and a couple of USB
ports the monitor has Smart Hub
Samsung's video streaming and app
interface seen on most Samsung TVs movie
performance is typical not to compare it
to this stellar movie performance of
last year's models that said it's still
good especially under the PC video
connection the picture is sharp colors
are fairly vibrant but just don't have
that pop in high contrast look I prefer
on glossy screens also the picture looks
kind of greenish I recommend running
movies in the entertain preset with
contrast at 88 color temperature set to
standard an HDMI black level at low
those settings worked even better for
games the colors and contrast seem to
pop more even games like Dragon Age 2
which I would never describe as
colourful
is pretty colorful here so what's the
rub well a pure PC connection like DVI
DisplayPort would have been great and
although its performance is good it's
not as good as last year's model at five
hundred bucks for a 27-inch monitor with
tons of features I expected better
performance
once again this is Eric Franklin this
has been a first look at the Samsung
sync master key 27 B 750 okay I confess
I didn't use the OSD array to navigate
that much I would have used it more but
the included remote control is
upside-down okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
