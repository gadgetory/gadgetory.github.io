of the lexus second generation is
chassis the rest of the lines moved on
to the third generation platform now
what makes the ISF special it's part
sport sedan parked japanese muscle and
all grins I'm behind the wheel let's go
over and see what's under the hood and
check the tech now the ISF is no mere
body kit and styling upgrade like the F
Sport package that you'll get on a
standard is this is F model is
practically a completely different
vehicle its body is wider it sits lower
on a suspension it sits on 19-inch
wheels that are of a staggered fit so
the Front's are a little bit narrower
the backs are a little bit wider so you
get better grip at the rear end where
all the power is going and if you ever
need to spot one of these things going
down the road one of the first things
you look for are these fake brake ducts
right here they're a cosmetic choice not
a performance upgrade but they do kind
of help push the body out a little bit
more and complete the look of the
appearance and of course you've got F
Sport badges all over the damn thing now
in case you hadn't forgotten that this
is a special car even the engine cover
has a carbon-fiber look and underneath
that it's going to be Lexus's 5 litre v8
engine now that's going to use a
combination of direct and port injection
to get you 416 horsepower and 371
pound-feet of torque now with an engine
this big you're gonna use a lot of fuel
even when you're idling so it's got
about 16 miles per gallon in the city 23
miles per gallon on the highway I've
been averaging about 10 fuel economy is
not the number you're really interested
in when you're looking at a vehicle like
this though you want to know those
performance numbers this thing does 0 to
60 and 4.6 seconds and goes on to a top
speed of 170 miles per hour you're not
going to do that anywhere away from a
track
here's about the point where you'd
expect me to complain about Lexus only
having an automatic transmission on
their sports sedan but this is a really
good automatic transmission if that
eight forward speak and that's from a
five or six year old gearbox most
automakers are only getting around
putting out fibbin in their most
efficient vehicles we've got eight in
the sports car and that transmission
also uses Lexuses direct shift
technology which locks up the gearbox it
locks up the torque converter and gears
two through eight so you lose a little
bit of the slot that you would normally
have in a torque converted automatic
transmission but then you still get the
smooth shifts when you need them now day
to day it's a little rough to deal with
the suspension is firm and it's gonna
bump you around a lot over bums those
brakes are gonna squeal when they're
cold but you do that getting into this
you drop down your money on a Lexus IS F
you knew that you're getting something
that's just a little bit more hard edged
than your typical is so I'm willing to
deal with that for the grin that this
car supplies it man are there plenty of
grin to be had
now the interior and cabin tech of this
2014 is f is top-notch for 2008 when
this car was debuted it haven't changed
a lot so we do have some cool things
here push-button starter as standard
we've got these really nice sport seats
that are leather and alcantara and they
really hold you knife in the corners
there's not a lot of hard plastic but
the dashboards covered with this weird
soft rubbery stuff I like to call this
Godzilla skin because it looks like the
big monster from the Japanese movies the
dashboard tech is mostly optional this
is going to be our hard drive based
Lexus navigation system it's uh uses a
touchscreen as opposed to the remote
touch controller that a lot of newer
lexus is use and it does feel dated but
it definitely gets the job done it has
been updated with Lexus's in four maps
so if you want to use Pandora Bing for
searching looking up Yelp reviews and
whatnot you can do all of that here once
you've connected to a smartphone that's
running the in-form app we've also got
Bluetooth hands-free as standard as well
as audio streaming and USB connectivity
for your iPod and mass storage devices
the interesting thing about the system
is that although it is dated and it uses
the touchscreen and the graphics look a
little bit old in its own way it is
better than what Lexus is doing right
now with that remote touch controller
there's not a lot of fiddling 'us it's
really simple and it's really easy to
use and I'd like to see Lexus getting
back to doing more with less instead of
complicating the control scheme now the
audio from this non-branded 13 speaker
Lexus audio system is really good this
really strong bass and fills the cabin
up and 13 speakers in a small sedan is a
lot and it actually sounds really good
depending on which audio source you give
it we've got the affer mentioned USB and
Bluetooth connectivity we've also got HD
radio for those of you who like
terrestrial we've got satellite radio
also and then you've got a couple of
digital audio streaming sources when you
use the inform apps upgrading to the
navigation camera also takes the
advantage of the large screen with a
reverse camera and it doesn't have
trajectory lines or denseness markers
but it is remarkably clear big and
bright I really like that for 500 or 600
more dollars you get front and rear
different sensors so they'll let you
know with an audible beep when you're
getting close to something at the front
and rear of the vehicle and of course
it's going to take a lot of practice to
get
this wide-body close to the curb without
scuffing up those 19-inch BBS wheels
okay so let's price this 2014 lexus is-f
the last of the second generation IH
bodies it's going to start at sixty
three thousand three hundred and fifty
dollars fully optioned up with
navigation and parking sensors and floor
mats you're going to come to sixty seven
thousand four hundred and nineteen bucks
all in now compared to a mercedes-benz
c63 AMG or BMW m3 maybe that's not the
best deal but a car like this isn't a
logical decision it's an emotional
decision nobody buys a big v8 because it
makes sense that if your emotions are
pointing you to this one of the last of
the great Lexus sports sedan well
perhaps that's worth the second look</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
