buzz report this week violent video
games myspace karaoke and Bulgarian Idol
but first the gadget of the week is back
the gadget of the week is the sony
ericsson k850i this is one of the rare
sony cybershot phones to be released
here in the US it's got a 5 megapixel
camera built-in with four separate
resolutions all these manual adjustments
like ISO and white balance settings and
a camcorder plus it has a built-in
accelerometer so you can play this like
marble madness game where you actually
tilt the phone back and forth to keep a
marble in the thing you know and you can
do this on the bus and then other people
could use their sony ericsson k850i to
take a video of you and put it on
YouTube trade-offs people trade-offs and
now for the news this week an incredibly
violent video game was released it's a
game in which you race around a virtual
world in a variety of different vehicles
completing missions that involve
eliminating rivals using a twisted
exhaustive arsenal of weaponry yes there
are interesting new visuals and their
incredible multiplayer features but this
game is just sick I am sorry to report
that there are even vicious assaults on
babies I am of course talking about
mario kart for wii
if you're looking for a less violent
alternative I hear that grand theft auto
4 was also released this week see they
leave the babies out of it in Microsoft
news I seriously did not want to have to
talk about anything having to do with
Microsoft until they proved that they
are so disorganized and flaky that they
not only let their yahoo deadline march
by without any action or comment
whatsoever they also biffed the releases
of windows XP sp3 and vista sp1 so
completely that they had to delay the
updates altogether why because they
discovered at literally the last
nanosecond that the updates were
incompatible with their own software for
managing retail chains come on Microsoft
get it together I do not want to have to
do this I prefer to make fun of Apple in
other news i wish i didn't have to
report this week myspace is launching a
karaoke service users can just record
themselves singing along to songs in the
myspace catalog and then they can upload
them to their profiles for sharing
and
don't mean on me
no don't share just don't share the news
follows a report last week that guitar
hero is planning to add more instruments
and vocals to its game to counter the
popularity of rock band which also lets
people sing because apparently people
really want to sing in public no matter
how much I personally do not want them
to speaking of singing let's have a look
at what's clogging the tubes shall we as
American Idol heats up in the US I
thought we should check out what we're
missing over on Bulgarian Idol they spy
on FSN America d candy don't know no
entiendes ok to save me no yo home
please azuma leave where honkies azusa
button and let Romo Kelly
a two-level debo de Ojo
I can't
the liver table down to Kelly
Kelly made you more demonic Acuff is
equation thankies I don't know what the
big deal is I've been singing that song
that way for years in private I'm Molly
Wood and this has been the buzz report
