today we're going to take a look at the
affinia h series H 479 3d printer so of
the three 3d printers I reviewed so far
this one is my favorite it's not
necessarily perfect but it's fast it's
easy to use and overall it's generally
more reliable than the others i've
tested so the h 479 sells for about
sixteen hundred bucks it's still
probably in the hobbyist category it's
not quite as powerful as some other
printers out there but it is still
expensive so you really have to kind of
be committed to the idea of
experimenting with 3d printing in order
to buy this thing now like most of the
3d printers it uses what's called ABS
plastic that's a kind of material here
it's a plastic filament runs down
through a heated extruder head here and
a deposits material down to this build
platform and forms it up into a model
that you sent to it from either a
Windows PC or Mac now if you look
closely you might see some parts in this
printer that look a little janky the
cover here is a plastic clip on the back
and the support arm for the spool of
filament are all made from 3d printed
plastic it might look a little cheap but
there's no problems with functionality
now the printer ships with ABS plastic
which is a kind of material used for 3d
printing and also can support PLA as
well as some experimental stuff if
you're willing to try it now affinia
suggest you don't use spools from other
vendors but we had no problem testing
spools for MakerBot as well as a couple
other places now you see the build
platform isn't all that big compared to
some other 3d printers likes a MakerBot
replicator this one lets you print
models about 5 inches cubed which is a
decent size but there probably will be
some things you'll find that just won't
fit on the platform now you might also
notice the binder clips on this platform
which seem kind of cheap we agree but
they also kind of hold the secret to
this printer and why we like it so much
so if you take the binder clips off we
can then lift off this plate which is
called a perf board now the idea behind
the perf board is that it makes it much
easier for prints to actually stick to
the build platform when it's printing
with the perf board it's not a perfect
solution you still have to do some post
processing notre to really get a good
print but with it you have no doubt that
your print is going to stick to the
platform and stay in place while it's
printing they come out a little bumpy do
the pork board because there's holes
here and then when you print the plastic
kind of sticks
in there so really have to kind of work
to dislodge the object and then clean it
up after you take it off the platform
now I have a few objects here you can
see look a little rough but they all
more or less look as intended also there
accurately printed and they work and
kind of move as I expected them to
what's also nice is that affinia gives
you the tools you need to pry it off the
platform and give it a rough cleanup you
can still do some more finishing to
really get it looking nice now lastly
I'll talk about it Phineas software
which strikes a nice balance between
ease of use and deep configurability
it's not quite as granular some of the
really deep settings you get them
certain printers but overall it gives
you nice control over objects in terms
of their quality the amount of material
you want to use in the inside but in
general it lets you use a printer with a
good degree of control of an output but
without giving you sort of the depth and
craziness of engineering level software
so the H 479 is not as powerful as some
other printers out there that cost two
or three thousand dollars that only
prints one color it has a relatively
small build platform but overall it's
easy to use and it's fast you have to
give your objects a little bit of TLC
after they print but overall they look
as intended now this is still expensive
enough that you really have to want to
be involved in 3d printing to buy this
thing but it strikes a nice balance
between usability and output quality
that it's really easy to recommend so
