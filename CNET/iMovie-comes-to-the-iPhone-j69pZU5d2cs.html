right on your phone edit it right on
your phone and then with a few taps
email it send it in an MMS send it to
mobile me send it to YouTube
it's pretty remarkable but we're going
even further than that because what
we've done is we've written an
application ourselves and rather tell
you about this i I want to show to you
and to show to you it's my great
pleasure to invite Randy you Bulow's
he's one of our incredible engineers our
chief he's the chief architect for all
our video apps I'd like Brandi to come
up and show this to you himself Randy
thanks very much you know I've been
working on video editing software for a
long time on some pretty groundbreaking
products 15 years ago Final Cut Pro 3
years ago it was the new iMovie this
year I had the opportunity to work on
another one iMovie for iPhone and it's
one of the most exciting things I've
ever worked on you can now record HD
video edit with beautiful theme
transitions and titles and share your
finish movies all on the device that you
carry in your pocket every day it's
really amazing let me show it to you go
ahead and bring this up and you can see
the icon there I'll go ahead and tap on
that so once we bring up the application
you get a list of all the projects that
you have and I'm going to go ahead and
just tap on this project and now I get
my editing environment I can see the
clips that I have edited into this
project down here along the bottom I'm
gonna go ahead and rotate the phone over
so we go to landscape you see I got the
same view here and let's go ahead and do
a little bit of editing on this I can
record directly into the timeline if I
want or I can choose from existing clips
and photos
on the device I'm gonna go to my video
being here and I'll just scroll down
let's pick this clip and put this in and
I can pinch and change the scale of the
timeline down here and we'll go ahead
and select this clip and now I can just
grab the pin and drag this to trim the
beginning portion of the clip to set the
length to be whatever I'd like I can
zoom that in a little bit if I like now
let's go ahead and add a photo so what
I'm gonna do is go back to my bin go to
my photos then I'll scroll down here a
little bit and we got this weekend an SF
event I've got a nice picture here
that's got the whole group so I'll go
ahead and choose that now once I've got
that in there I can tap on it and photos
automatically get a Ken Burns effect on
them so I can go ahead and adjust that
I'll go back to the beginning and I can
pan around I can zoom in and you'll see
that we as we go from the beginning to
the end I'll get a nice Ken Burns effect
on that I can also use theme transitions
so I'm going to go ahead to this title
and I'm going to switch it from across
dissolve to a theme transition and when
I do that I get this nice theme
transition that'll come across on here
we can go ahead and put a title on the
first clip I'll just double tap on it
I'll select title and I'll choose an
opening title I'll just go ahead and tap
and I'll give a nice title here so I'll
go ahead and just type in our California
vacation and once I put that in there
one of the things you'll notice is that
it's put San Francisco on there the
camera records geolocation information
into the video that's been recorded and
we pick that up automatically and it
gets put into the theme as you see there
on the screen now I'm gonna go ahead and
add some music so I'll go ahead and I'll
bring up the audio bin I could bring in
music from my iTunes library or we also
have some theme music that comes with
the product so I'll go ahead and choose
this playful track now let's go ahead
and just play this back
I'm going to show you a version of this
project that was exported out at 720p HD
and what you're going to see was
produced entirely on the phone recorded
edited rendered all completely on the
phone show you that
that's
that's iMovie for iPhone 4 thanks very
much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
