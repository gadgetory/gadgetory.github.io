california-based startup icon wants to
make that dream a reality with the a5
it's a light-sport plane that the
company believes will kick off a new
motor sport take the logical progression
from jet ski to a TV to motor boats to
this I had a chance to ride and at times
pilot the a5 it's exhilarating crazy a
little scary and above all loads of fun
but it's also crazy-expensive the 85
costs a hundred eighty nine thousand
dollars but there's already a huge
backlog of orders if you put down a
deposit today you'll get your planes
sometime in 2019 why the demand icon is
pushing this as a plane that virtually
anyone could fly its wings fold up so
it's portable enough to store at home
and haul of the car doesn't need a
proper airport you just need a long
strip of land or sea to take off from
how does the fly the control stick is
responsive and it didn't take long for
me to pick up on how everything worked
my co-pilot a former Navy pilot and
icons director of flight training did
most of the flying and rass through a
few tight turns hops and skips across
the water and some formation flying with
a sister a five so is it worth it if
you've got tons of cash spare an
addiction to excitement you might want
to get in line now this is Roger Cheng
