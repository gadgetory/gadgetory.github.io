New York City with Roger Cheng and Ben
Fox Rubin it is the 359 podcast episode
92 how the hell have we made it this far
you got me yeah mystery all right well
super excited welcome yours happy
tuesday it is Tuesday yeah it's like
it's much longer than that for some
reason uh we're we're gonna be talking
about all apple today lots of rumors
iphone 7 Apple watch to MacBook Pro you
know we've got an event coming up it's
really just a month away pretty much
yeah yeah getting closer to the holiday
season so they might have started Andrew
burning their new stuff the rumors are
heating up so we'll be we'll be talking
about those three items as always if you
have any questions leave them in the
comments section or producer Brian will
pick out the best and we will try our
best to answer them right an icy net is
not against the answering Samsung
question us yes if you have samsung
questions we're really not we're not
gonna just keep ya and after this equal
opportunity questions Tim Cook you can
send me a check payable blah blah blah
you just confirmed the rumors of course
yeah of course well done well done
alright but let's get the podcast
started okay audio is rolling send us
your questions will be back in exactly
three minutes and 59 seconds starting
three two welcome to the 359 we would
talk about the top detectors of the day
and all the other crap we want to throw
in I'm Roger Cheng I'm then Fox ribbon
well it's unavoidable we're about a
month away from Apple unveiling a new
iphone and the rumors are heating up
Bloomberg essentially reconfirmed
chatter that the iphone love a
pressure-sensitive button dual camera
set up and lose the audio jack
importantly there are no significant
design changes is this this big misstep
for apple or we think it's kind of um i
almost feel like they should just call
it the iphone 6s s or something like a
super plus ultra 6s II whatever I'm I
was it there's already an SE that is
known over the six se well needless to
say I don't know how they're actually
going to get up on stage and present
this as this is this is different or
it's really significant or special right
whatever but also more colors a parent
I look at that blue and space black just
like the Apple watch ooh Apple fanboys
are going to get really excited about
some of these small tweaks but they
really are just small tweaks i I don't I
don't really see that there's all that
much there too I've been jump out and
get a new one I've been covering the
phone business for a while so I still
remember the the motorola razr which was
a huge hit the original one the flip
phone yeah mega hit you could tell when
the company started running an idea is
when they started offering the razor in
multiple colors like that was their big
innovation was you can get in pink and
get it in and blue and also it kinda
reminds me of this i mean you know we've
got we have rose gold already we've got
but now we've got rumored bellies maybe
two more colors blue and black and I
mean look we may have reached peak
iphone with the iphone 6 which was like
serious blockbuster phone right um it
sounds like next year's model is gonna
be really significant yeah and I hope it
is you know it is like the phone
business really could use some shaking
up so was like I mean just sort of
drilling down on some of those features
to do you think the addition of a dual
lens camera would will actually you know
get people interested no no no all right
decking moving on to the Apple watch so
they're going to be two new Apple
watches and one of them is going to be
called the Apple watch two very
creatively named yeah the big difference
is going to be that it's going to have
better gps and a better battery for
anybody that's really excited about
smartwatches you might want to wait
until next year again yeah because
they're expected to add LTE
functionality which means you aren't
going to have to pair it to write with
your I've idea is that it can work
independently it has its own dedicated
connection and it makes sense like LTE
modules right now are probably a little
bit on the bulky side they're probably
waiting for it to get a little bit
smaller so it could fit into an Apple
watch physically there are other LTE
watches out of the market Samsung makes
a couple the LG does as well those
watches are pretty bulky and that's
that's probably part of the reason and
also better life is concerned right look
but I I think it goes back to the same
issue with the iphone is is are they
going to have enough features to really
get you off your butt off the couch
and buy a new phone or buy a new watch
and I would argue probably now let's
interesting question about buying you
watch because folks who spent you know
whatever 500 plus ten thousand dollars
on an Apple watch the first time around
are they gonna pony up for a second one
no no it hasn't but I'm just gonna be
sitting around feeling bad because they
don't happen you this and cuz what Apple
is good at making you feel bad so last
we also wanted to touch on the laptop
yep so there's going to be a major
upgrade for the macbook pro expected
sometime soon sometime this year
actually and this actually sounds kind
of cool they're planning on adding an
oled touch bar above the keyboard which
I guess would maybe change around a bit
yeah I think on what the function I dia
is it yeah the keys would be
context-sensitive right you can't leave
a Spotify app it'll have like the
play/pause fast-forward menu and so yeah
that's cool in a couple years since they
refresh the macbook pro so I'm glad
they're actually gonna do it yeah y know
more about these stories check us out on
cnet I'm Roger Cheng I'm Ben Fox Rubin
thanks for listening and now we'll take
some questions from the audience and we
have some good ones all right yeah an
apple day or Samsung yeah no no Samsung
yet but dan the man wants to know are
you think the iphone 7 55 Pro will have
a 2k display 5 wait the 55 pro what I
don't know the 5.5 inch pro yes the
rumored problem uh I woodside highly
doubt it to ks play I don't think that's
in the cards yeah I really doubt that
yeah I would say that the screen is
marginally improved over last year's but
ya still standard HD but nothing special
yeah when do you think that might be on
their their wish list like that that
seems like they're kind of behind the
curve on there are so many things on the
wish list there are a lot of people that
are actually hoping that you could
actually open up the back to just add a
story that will never happen that will
never happen but it would be a great
thing for customers and they wouldn't
have to cough up a lot of extra money
just for a little bit more so Ardis
Apple do you think for do things for its
customers no I don't know probably never
all right the demon that has an
interesting proposal he says make it a
bundle hmm baleen pay a lump sum and get
a laptop watch and phone all in one
batch
that's kind of an interesting thought um
you know what this I would number one
know a lot of money well yeah expensive
bundle but I mean you'd probably you're
probably going to see it with next
year's Apple watch I'm willing to bet
you go to verizon AT&amp;amp;T store buy an
iPhone get an Apple watch 24 whatever
two hundred dollars off or something
like you'll you'll definitely get that
because if it's an LTE connected watch
that means there's an account linked to
it which means 18t and fries charge you
extra for that look at you mr phone guy
breaking it down I would probably argue
though that maybe maybe Apple wouldn't
want to bundle directly just because and
let the retailer do it yeah because they
don't want to sully their brand with any
sort of like reductions in prices Pro
concepts are bundling they always try to
present themselves as a luxury brand I
mean when was the last time you went
into like I don't know what's a luxury
store I never go to them but like they
don't the if they are going to do a sale
they're gonna do the if ya prod is gonna
do a seller gonna do they're gonna do it
like very you know yeah why Utley or
whatever so I just thought that was an
interesting concept that's never really
I've never seen that before yeah you
know they have education discount to
have I think back to school discount
yeah yeah yeah but they're not bundles I
think they're real I mean it might be a
bundle with like accessories but I
haven't seen something like an iphone
plus a macbook pro that's not some
pretty big commitment not being from
experience being that have been out of
school for far too long but I bet that
if you went back to high school now they
they do get deals on like batches of
imax and batches of did they just yeah
yeah yeah for sure mark wants them to
focus more on the lens they think that
they're spending too much time he thinks
that they're spending too much time
marketing the colors and the flash yeah
rather than the the actual decent new
feature of the phone which is that dual
lens yes so that the whole point is lens
I me if the rumors are to be believed
the two different lenses take capture
two different sets of colors mm-hmm and
software will be used sort of blend the
photo together the idea is you better
you'd be able to better shoot photos in
low-light settings which is always a
problem with phones things have gotten a
little better I feel like some of the
newest Samsung and LG phones actually
have some decent it's also
it's argued to that um you would get
slightly improved pictures when you zoom
in yeah well yeah one can be the zoom
lens LG actually the LG g5 has this
camera it's two lenses one is the zoom
lens and one is the regular lens and
even when you actually come zoom in it
switches from one to the other yeah i
mean my frustration is is that i have
the iphone 6 and i would never buy the
plus it just doesn't fit in my pocket so
i don't really like is that I pants with
bigger pockets yeah just by cargo shorts
or something yeah way we can't do that
anymore right exactly so but to me it's
like ok they're they're trying to upsell
you on the phone that's a hundred
dollars more expensive but what if I
just don't want a phone that size that's
just a little annoying because like
maybe a guy like me would want the dual
camera I take a lot of photos with my
can know they're they're definitely
putting them so putting customers in
difficult position really if you
choosing the bigger phone if you want
all the bells and whistles and so I mean
I have a plus I don't find it that you
know distracting oh that it's kind of
jut out of my pocket I'm a little wear
that when I'm walking around town yeah
yeah you look like an idiot it's good
thing you don't go skinny jeans well
it's kind of skinny I just really fat so
it doesn't really look right but
expanding on the thought of the the
different models George wants to know a
little more detail about the models will
there be to a plus and a 4.7 inch or
three plus pro and 4.7 inch you know we
were we were having just are having this
morning we don't know for sure look
Apple hasn't talked to us there was you
don't have a rumor they don't ever talk
to me but there was a rumor about three
different versions whether the regular
of the plus or pro I believe evleaks
Evan blast actually squashed that rumor
is that there would only be two versions
and he's got a pretty good track record
and frack I personally hoping there are
three because like to pay up an
additional two hundred dollars just for
that third tier just seems like they're
just they're just so can people they're
just right and how different would the
actual screen size be as compared to the
smallest I iPad I don't think that
they're there that many rumors about
screen size changes especially with the
supply
we'd have we would have heard more about
a much bigger display phone yeah earlier
on I do want to mention this that so the
headphone jack rumor is the one that's
that's been the most persistent and yeah
that we've been hearing about the most
often one of the so apparently it's
supposed to help make the phone a little
bit thinner and it's also supposed to
give room to create a second set of like
create a second speaker yeah yeah
problem that I have with that is is that
how often are you actually using the
speaker to listen to music I guess maybe
if you're using speakerphone that would
be a yes that a lotta man the speaker's
of general being kind of a week rather
like a kind of tinny yeah so like I
don't like it a lot of them talk to all
the jerks on the train this morning
right with the headphones yeah yeah so
we're just gonna make them more jerky
you know i mean the bigger issue i have
put that in samsung during scouts you
know southern presentation last week
made sure to note that nope we're
keeping the headphone jack it's gonna be
a big point contention a lot of people
have sophisticated headphones and
they've invested money and you know
equipment that all right one is
incompatible how many beats headphones
are out in the market right now with a
headphone jack right you know like Cyrus
opening I'm hoping they each iphone
comes with the converter yeah like Jack
adopt adapter in addition to headphones
with that with that with the Lightning
attachment but if not they're charging
you money for that that's just let's
just don't worry Apple to me but that
sound like Apple right that's that's
pretty much what happened when they went
from the 30-pin to lightning right they
started selling adapters for people just
to like that to keep up with it yeah so
one interesting point too is that me and
stephen shankland wrote a couple months
ago about the Lightning jack yeah
stephen shankland and I yea sorry I
always mess that up so what's
interesting is that apple owns that
technology so any third party that
creates something with the Lightning
jack Apple ends up getting royalties or
some sort of kick back for it so that
would mean that any sort of third-party
headphones Apple would then be getting
some sort of cash for it
because it would have to be connected to
the lightning right right unless his
bluetooth connected of course yeah so I
mean I think that might be the focus
it's not just lightning but but
bluetooth wireless headphones and sort
of the the real solution they've always
wanted to go wireless with that right
yeah I would wonder if some of the
third-party manufacturers like people
who make headphones would kind of fall
in line with this out of obligation or
sense because I'm sure they will we saw
we saw Apple kind of rewrite the music
industry where you had the iTunes model
and suddenly singles are the more
relevant thing they're an album will
headphones start to manufacture
lightning models absolutely you think so
oh yeah I think so it's an important or
there's yeah it's a billion-dollar
market like those accessories and
there's no other single product that
sells these accessories like the iphone
right like there's Samsung there's LG
there's just a myriad of other like
Android phones out there but there's a
like one consistent right but here's the
problem is is that what if you want to
use the same headphones on your laptop
which I do plenty you don't have a lady
jackets your laptop yeah exactly thank
you again Apple god I should just
abandon the apple ecosystem I'd be
getting more and more frustrated guys
we're talking just get angry and anger I
love it i'd be interested for us to get
our audio guys like car noise or steve
guttenberg in here to talk about if
there's any actual merit to the
Lightning port as far as audio fidelity
goes with headphones that would be very
interesting I don't know yeah top my
head I can't imagine there'd be that
much of a leap forward but it's an
interesting thought to consider I'm sure
though that'll come up during the
presentation like yes yeah let's talk
about design George speculates he thinks
there's a conspiracy that there's going
to be a fresh brand-new design of the
seven after all and I'm diggin I'm
diggin I'm diggin I lost track of it Oh
Abraham said I heard the iphone 7 will
have the same glass and metal design
like iphone 4 but thinner and taller
what are the rumors what do you think
about the actual systemics mean
aesthetics I think it's essentially
going to be the same thing
it's going to look I'm sorry for all
your conspiracy theories out there who
believe that there's gonna be a new
design there won't be for this phone I
mean it's been pretty much Telegraph
through most the mainstream press now
that that the iphone 7 isn't going to
change significantly it will be a little
bit thinner I think like you made the
point that move from audio jack to
lightning does allow to be a little bit
thinner it'll probably be a hair thinner
and there they'll probably talk about
how great that whatever point zero zero
one millimeter no it's the species
iphone ever yeah yeah we did we've seen
there are bin pictures that have been
circulating for money the antenna lines
right instead of going through the phone
will go around the phone so it'll be a
cleaner look that's it though I don't
think we're you should prepare for an
iphone 7 that looks a lot like the
success in the six yeah there will
probably still be giant lines outside
the fifth avenue store sure york for
sure he's it gonna be the same as the
iPhone 6 I really doubt it yeah well
here's the thing iphone 6 was two years
ago people's contracts and people serve
are trained to upgrade after two years
so we're at that two-year refresh cycles
so even if there isn't a huge amount of
excitement for this new phone I think
they're going to be enough people who
are upgrade eligible that I'm gonna make
the jump yeah we have a that makes sense
we have a few people on the stream who
want you to get personal give us your
top one two three things wish list
things it's like what the hell Apple
where's this feature each of you oh yeah
well big one stylist no yeah god no um
with the pencil yeah definitely the
pencil uh might I think I have two big
ones that's a wireless charging I wonder
wireless are go to a long long time and
they have an Apple watch is a wireless
charging device so they've used the
technology they could throw it into an
iPhone very easily everyone else does at
this point and waterproof I'd love it to
be yahoo just don't mind sorry that's
okay yeah I'd like to be able to just
drop my phone my toilet yeah not
actually purposefully but accidentally
drops but Phil have a phone that i can
use so i would probably say two things
would be
movable storage so that I could upgrade
it independently that would just be nice
as like money's ever happening I know
but like I wouldn't notice the
difference because my iphone is in a
case yeah so wouldn't really make a
difference to me from a design
perspective if I could remove the back
of head rom the other one oh no I forgot
oh well I give up okay uh breaking the
stream of thought here for just a hot
second Peter wants to know if the Batman
phone has sold out the samsung one yes
ah a little bit edition if you can't get
it I imagine is sold out by now I
believe cnet's got one maybe if you
asked Jessica real nice mm-hmm oh
Jessica don't forgot one I think
Jessica's well we have a review unit why
did she not share I just like Batman I
could care less about the phone that's
true wait a minute I just remember that
the home button thing if I could
actually integrate the home button into
the screen oh that's a good one yeah
moving the home button that's fine I
rose up that ladder that's in the
pipeline but yeah it's not going to be
coming I'm 1 i'm willing to bed twice 17
that might be a thing that would be
really significant to some part of the
problem with that by the way is that the
fingerprint sensor we haven't gone to
technology has an advanced to the point
where it's accurate enough to get a
fingerprint sensor embedded in the
screen itself like i've talked to the
guy that like synaptics they've been
working on this for years that sort of
like the holy grail and it's still like
a year to out even they say that so i
imagine like that could happen in 2017
maybe 2018 getting rid of the home
button but that's the fingerprint i
think is one of the biggest right
stumbling blocks when I'm but with the
same size phone you would get a much
bigger screen doing that oh you could
even see more phone this is an you would
get an even this is the issue that i
have with the the plus that that i'm
seeing now with the note 7th note 7 is
so much smaller mmm significantly
smaller butt has a bigger display so it
just yeah like I stacked the to update
each other I'm like a yeah the plus is
like really it's a really little too
bulky yeah so ultimately it does sound
like there are a number of things that
they can improve with the iphone but
we're probably not going to see a lot of
thumb until 2017 yeah if we're scraping
the bottom of the barrel here they're
they're trying to stagger these things
out so they can keep saying like this
new this because they're running out
no yeah well they had raised you know
they had been staggering since the
beginning yeah this is the first time
that they're actually breaking away from
that you know one every other year
upgrade and they're actually extending
it they're not they're not doing a
significant upgrade after now three
years that's yeah that is where the
upgrade cycle is headed so I think that
they're realizing that maybe yeah well
squeeze a couple more in here before we
gotta call it quits because we are
running out of time yeah a number of
people are saying like yeah we've
already gone bluetooth this is old news
who cares but Dan brought up an
interesting question do you think the
new lightning headphone adapter will be
more susceptible to breaking just seeing
it breaking due to the port in your
pocket under tension which on his side I
have broken so many headphones in my
pocket and the regular quarter inch at
or agency Jack question I haven't broken
any I mean I've my lightning power
cables do end up fraying and breaking so
I don't know there that's that's
legitimate concern I don't know that's
that I'm not sure we will get people
complaining about it on lightning gate
yes saying there'll be there'll be some
sort of controversy I'm sure mm-hmm
that's a good point though I hadn't
considered a good point Dan very good
point um we're going back and forth and
back and forth between the note 7 and
the iphone 7 go figure yes what's our
idea about price point coming out on
these any any word on that I can't
imagine there anything too early yeah
well no it's also they hover around the
same they're predictable it's gonna be a
650 for the basics 50 for the base model
and a hundred dollars for every step up
and then the plus will be a hundred
dollars more right the question is is
the base language still going to be 16
gigs are they going to upgrade that yeah
two gigs it's what you're getting for
your money the price the price chart
doesn't change though they haven't
changed that thing in well very long
time ever wouldn't really I wouldn't be
surprised if there's no way that they
change it during right this is off year
although people aya they do kind of have
an opening because the galaxy note 7
came out and it's like 850 880 like
crazy expensive the note are the the 6s
plus starts at seven fifty a hundred
bucks blast so you know there's this
chance that maybe Apple can check the
prices up with the gigs on that though
that's a thing
it comes with 64 gigs starts at 60 was
only one model home see four gig model
right that's not bad that's actually a
pretty good deal okay yeah with any luck
the only thing I can see coming out of
the the Lightning port conversion the
best part is the reduction of perhaps
heat because be flan is asking why the
iPhone gets really hot a lot of that is
because of the way that the internals
are structured and yeah being that there
is an essentially an exhaust port in
that quarter inch it collect dust and
that causes other complications and
that's why I phone gets warm in your
pocket the metal body doesn't help you
there truth yeah yep um that's not just
it's not just Apple i have a galaxy s6
edge and that thing heats up like crazy
like much hotter than anything the
iphone can accomplish but that's a large
part of the reasoning that they're
trying to present of why we're getting
rid of the headphone port it's not just
them being like we're gonna do it better
it there is kind of like an actual
scientific reason behind it well it
still will probably overheat though it's
really well because we use these things
entirely too much i know mine starts to
melt when I pokemon for more than an
hour right right but with any luck we
can actually see a positive outcome yeah
from this one thing even though there's
a lot of negative to it as well sure is
trying to be unbiased okay yeah iono me
appreciate your imbalanced sure that
exists we had some really fantastic
interactions today but we are running
out of time oh yeah we're this way way
late let's do this again as we get
closer to Apple day thanks so much for
all the questions will do this every day
no but thank you for your questions or
comments that's awesome we'll see you
