un60f8000 it's a 65 inch 4k LCD TV with
a brand new name that samsung reserves
for only its most expensive 2015 sets s
UHD the S doesn't stand for super or
even Samsung instead it's just a denote
a premium product according to Samsung
sort of like its Galaxy S phones s UHD
TVs use futuristic sounding nano
crystals to help make color and are
compatible with newfangled HDR or high
dynamic range content I was excited to
check out how those new extras effected
picture quality but in this case they
didn't seem to make much of a difference
the TV's design and features are superb
however it's Faceman is metallic and
very slim and if your wall mounting
you'll appreciate the fact that it's
flat rather than curved like most of
samsung's other expensive TVs if you're
not while mounting the slick stand makes
the TV seem to hover over the table
another extra on this set is the one
connect box which is an external little
device that you plug all the HDMI inputs
into in the future Samsung says you can
buy new one connect box to upgrade
features and connectivity the redesign
remote and smart TV system have their
pluses and minuses the new clicker is
even simpler and as fewer buttons motion
control and a nice tiny size but it can
be confusing to move between its two
main cursor controls smart TV now
powered by Samsung's Tizen operating
system is less overwhelming to use than
before and offers plenty of apps as well
as a decent web browser on the downside
it also has a prominent ad that you
can't disable in terms of picture
quality the TV is very good but some
other less expensive TVs I've tested are
better Samsung's black levels don't get
quite as deep despite its local dimming
and those nano crystals don't really
improve color with today's 4k and HD
sources the early HDR I checked out from
Amazon for example also suffered from
those lighter black levels maybe future
HDR and wide color gamut sources will
take advantage of those su HD extras but
for now the J s 8500 isn't as superior
as the S implies that's a look at the
Samsung J s 8500 su HD LED LCD TV I'm
