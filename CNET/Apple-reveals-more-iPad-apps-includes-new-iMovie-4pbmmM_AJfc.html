updated as well GarageBand has a new
version it adds some great new features
smart strings join smart guitars smart
keyboards and smart drum so you can have
your own string orchestra accompanying
your music it has a note editor so after
you've created your song you can go back

I call to make sure you have your your
songs that you created on all your
devices and there's great new ways to
share the songs you create with friends

call jam session so now up to 4 iOS
devices running GarageBand can all play
together and at the same time create a
new song over Wi-Fi or Bluetooth it's
really cool one of the best things about
the new garage band is the instruments

GarageBand I movie also a new update
with an amazing new feature now not only
you can create a movie but you can also
create a movie trailer as well this is
something we had brought to the mac and
customers have loved it because it is so
fun to be scripted right through how to
create an amazing quick and easy video
piece so all you do in the ipad is you
select from a bunch of different styles
and templates and you're presented with
a simple interface for creating your
movie trailer there's never been video
editing like this you fill out your
outline for example what your movie
studio name is going to be and who's the
director and then you tap on the
storyboard and you have a visual story
board of the piece you're creating we're
tells you exactly what shot you need
like a closeup an action shot a group
shot but for the first time ever you
have a device where you can outline and
storyboard your video use the 1080p
camera to record the video then play it
back on that high resolution display it
is truly a transformative way to do
video editing I movie it's 499

has it and it's also available today in
the app store so GarageBand in iMovie to
