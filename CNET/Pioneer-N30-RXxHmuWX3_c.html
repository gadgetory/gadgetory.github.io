review of the pioneer n 30 media player
when it comes to buying and listening to
music we're at a crossroads right now
CDs and LPS is still selling but the
Apple Store is the biggest music
retailer on the planet then you have
services like Spotify introducing an end
to physical collections players like the
Pioneer n30 are designed as an upgrade
to the iPod dock no more leaning over
the iPod like you're trying to summon
Alec Guinness the pioneer n30 uses a
remote control or iPhone app to sort
through your music
the n30 is one of a new breed of hi-fi
streamers that reads high-resolution
formats and also looks quite nice next
to the DVD player it supports net radio
but unlike the competition doesn't have
streaming services like Pandora or
Spotify however it does have Apple's
AirPlay so you can use these on your
phone instead and stream it to the
Pioneer sound quality is good and the
iPhone app is sensibly arranged even if
it can only show you four titles at once
and then have to buffer if you don't
choose to use the iPhone and opt for the
remote control one of the main problems
is this screen at 2.5 inches it's
smaller than most mobile phone screens
and yet is supposed to be read across a
room the Logitech Squeezebox Touch is
almost half the price but has twice the
screen size of the n30
and also does streaming one other issue
is that it doesn't come with Wireless
you need to pay an extra 150 bucks to
get this proprietary adapter if you're
serious about your streaming media
you'll have to stump up some cash the
n30 is four hundred and ninety nine
dollars but we'd say either buy the
Logitech and an Apple TV or pay more for
the marantz n/a 704 or the Cambridge
audio NP 30 I'm ty Pendlebury and this
has been a review of the Pioneer n 30</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
