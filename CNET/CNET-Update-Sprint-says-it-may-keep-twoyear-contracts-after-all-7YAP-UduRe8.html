contracts after all I'm Bridget Carey
this is your scene that update
the classic two-year phone contract may
not be dead just yet but it is on life
support Sprint is now clarifying that
contrary to previous reports it has not
made any official decision to stop
offering two-year contracts to customers
by the end of the year in the last
episode of cnet update I talked about
the imminent death of the two-year phone
contract it's an offering where you get
a new phone for a discounted price if
you sign up for a two-year service
agreement now both verizon and t-mobile
are no longer offering those kinds of
deals and they moved to a monthly
payment plan option where you lease the
phone and you pay for service separately
The Wall Street Journal and CNBC
reported that sprint was also doing away
with two year contracts at the end of
the year citing interviews with sprint
CEO Marcelo Claure a but I spoke to a
sprint spokesman who says that's not
necessarily the case rather if the
trends show that customers don't want
contracts Sprint will ditch them but if
customers do want contracts they make
keep the option alive it's all a bit up
in the air apparently but sprint
salespeople are pushing customers to go
with their monthly leasing option and so
are eighteen t employees but both sprint
AT&amp;amp;T they still offer the option of a
classic contract if you still want it
switching gears google unveiled a new
product that it began selling this week
but it's not a phone or a tablet or
anything you wear it's a Wi-Fi router
now Wi-Fi routers aren't exactly a sexy
tech product category they are a
headache to set up and you usually try
to hide the ugly box somewhere behind
the furniture which you shouldn't do
because that weakens the signal but this
google router called on hub is designed
to be easier to use and it's not a box
it has a cylindrical shape so maybe you
won't mind displaying it out in the open
for two hundred dollars this router has
some high-tech perks you can manage it
with a nap either iphones or android
phones and that app will tell you how
much bandwidth each of your devices are
using you can also tell the router which
device you want to have the most
bandwidth so that Roku will get the best
connection for all your netflix
streaming of course google wants your
internet service to be spiffy so you
keep streaming up all that content but
it also has another motivation behind
solving Wi-Fi woes Google now
smart home products under its company
nest it makes smart home thermostats and
home monitoring cameras and the more
products we need to talk to our Wi-Fi
we're going to need a central hub to
manage it all in a reliable way like a
control center for all your gadgets to
communicate with one another amazon is
also heading in this direction with its
echo smart speaker and apple requires
you to use the Apple TV as a hub for the
full smart home theory experience that's
it for this tech news update and you can
