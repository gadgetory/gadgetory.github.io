socket 1500 power like it from a Stoller
now this one is my favorite so pay
attention I like it for four reasons
number one is a design now this one he
has the regular snap in three-prong
design you can plug into the wall
directly quite conveniently but take a
look at this pass-through socket that's
right
you can plug something on top of it and
this means you can use this adapter here
at the place of your house where the
only one outlet now you plug into a
socket and then plug a power strip on
this one here and it can add more device
to the same socket remember powerline
adapter need to be plugged directly into
the wall to work well the second is the
performance in my testing the two of
them here has sustained real world speed
of some four hundred five megabit per
second that's half of a true gigabit
connection now the spirit is very
important because the idea paralyzed
that you don't have to run the actual
network cable instead you plug one of
these here into the existing network
such as your router and the second one
here to a far device such as a computer
a printer or a Wi-Fi access point now
they've been telling the power wiring in
between them into network cable and
extend your network further that way now
obviously running the actual network
cable is always the fastest but that's
not convenient and sometimes not even
possible but with this kit it's
convenient it's also fast and finally
the price h's $90 for a kid of two units
this land socket 300 here is a lot
cheaper than other computing kids I
don't know that the adapter is quite
typical over here it has this sync
button pressing on this we create a
private that between the two of them and
that is useful only if you live in a
multi home building such as a condo that
prevent other from accessing your
network by using their own adapter over
here it has a gigabit network port and
on top it has a few indicator light to
show the status the light emitter here
will change color to show the strength
of the parallax signal which is very
handy if you in the fight out what
socket is the best to block it aim for
more on this one and check out my full
review as cnet.com
basically if you're going to look for a
fast way to extend your white network
without worrying about tripping on the
cables this is the kid to have oh by the
way the fourth reason why I like it
because wealth
it's like thing into each other
really who don't I can do this all day
and that's because I'm done going this
has been the first look at the land
socket 1500 power adapter kit from ASCO</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
