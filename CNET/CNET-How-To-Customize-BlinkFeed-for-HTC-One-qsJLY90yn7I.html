have with me here a very cool new
android phone the HTC one now when you
pick this thing up one of the first
features you'll notice is that HTC has
set the homescreen to display their news
feed widget blinkfeed you can think of
it like having Flipboard baked right
into your phone and it's a great way to
glance at daily news and stories that
might interest you
but if HTC has you pegged wrong here's
an easy way to adjust all the kinds of
stories that you're gonna see in
blinkfeed
tap the home button and make sure you're
at the top of the feed then pull down
slightly and you'll reveal a tiny little
menu bar from here you can use the drop
down menu to filter down to just the
specific feeds you want or tap the dots
on the right and select topics and
services from here you can check on or
off the sites that you want to regularly
pop into your news feed like CNET swipe
to the left and you'll see additional
categories to choose from swipe to the
right all the way and you'll find
different services like Facebook or
Flickr or Twitter that you can also dump
into your feed now once you're happy hit
the back button and the feed will
automatically refresh now as much as I
like blink feed I'm not too thrilled
that HTC has pinned it down to my home
screen by default changing that setting
isn't obvious so here's what to do hit
the home button again to make sure
you're at the top of the blink feed and
then again pull down and tap that little
trio of dots this time select Customize
homescreen and you'll see little
versions of your different panels up
here at the top the little home plate
icon over here on the left is what calls
out the blink feed panel as the home
page to change that tap and hold the
panel you want to designate as your new
home page and drag it up to the set as
home tab up at the top now when you
press the home button they'll go to your
page instead but you can always swipe
back over to the blink feed when you
want it so that's how to customize blink
feed for HTC One for more how-to like
this head over to how-to cnet.com i'm
donald bell thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
