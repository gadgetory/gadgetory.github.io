battery power for your phone on a
beautiful day when you're out with your
friends well AT&amp;amp;T has come up with a
temporary solution called the ATT street
charge station these are going up around
New York City to give you a little juice
when you're out whether it's your phone
or the camera you have whatever kind of
mobile device there are different
charging ports that you can connect to
plugging your phone into one of these
outlets is no different than plugging it
into the outlet of your home so it could
take a while if you're completely empty
on battery and you might want to hover
around to make sure nothing happens to
your phone this is the first unit put up
here in Riverside Park in New York and
this is a completely standalone device
it's not hooked up to any power source
from the ground it's completely run on
solar energy and if it's completely
empty it takes about four hours in
direct sunlight to charge up the
batteries inside and they can hold their
charge for several days so you can plug
in at night they're about 25 different
units like this that are rotating around
the parks in New York and 18t is going
to be seen how people react to them well
AT&amp;amp;T is doing this to learn how folks
react to public free charging they do on
their own in an unlocked environment to
see how people can use them to charge up
their phones to keep going on their day
but also to see how how the community
reacts to having something like this in
their parks
so if ATT finds that lots of people are
loving these solar powered stations you
might just see these at a park near your
town frissina I'm Bridget Carey thanks
for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
