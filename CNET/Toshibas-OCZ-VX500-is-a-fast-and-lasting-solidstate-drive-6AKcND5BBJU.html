solid-state drive or SSD from toshiba
now this is a standard SSD meter you can
fit in all computers that have a
standard SATA port almost all of them do
that's two things about the strike first
it's fast in my testing it has to
sustain real one copy speed up close to
450 megabyte per second that's really
fast and that's great the second thing
which is not so great is the price it's
very expensive now this Drive of 512
gigabyte here has a suggested retail
price of 153 dolls the drives also
available in 128 pika PI to a 56
gigabyte and one Tara by now toshiba
does say that the street price will
likely be lower so keep that in mind at
the makeup of the high cost the v8 500
here has a very cool warranty five years
and ring this time in case of defect the
ship i will ship you a new drive first
before we have to ship back the old
drive plus it pay for the shipping costs
now that's nice also the drive time with
this shiny aluminum casing here making
me feel like it was actual dollars when
you first take it out the park now make
sure you take some 40 because after that
it put the drive inside a computer and
might never see it again and the dry
also include a lesson of acronis true
image HD 4dr cloning in case you want to
you this one as an upgrade for your
computer that still run on a regular
hard drive like this one or this one
that would make it very convenient and
by the way the new v8 500 drive has very
high and doing rating meaning you can
write a lot to it before it become
unreliable for example this fire and 12
gigabyte capacity here if you write
fifty gigabyte per day and every day
will take you 16 years before you wear
off if you get the one tab by virgin
you'll take you 30 years and by the way
up cause i have one table right here so
check back with me in throw to you to
see how I wet hammer
I'll just take my word for a faster
that's because i'm dumb oh and this is
the ocz v8 five hundred sons to drive
from toshiba</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
