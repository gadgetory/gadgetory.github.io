folks were grumbling that requiring seat
belts in cars was commie socialist stuff
today that commie label is applied to
decidedly more high-tech innovations
I'm Brian Cooley with the top 5 ways the
man is changing your car number 5
autonomous cars you know self-driving
Nevada and California recently forced
the issue by making these legal now the
feds are playing catch-up likely to
issue national rules by 2016 that's
going to signal it's time to open the
floodgates of investment in cars that
take over 80% of the driving that you
don't really want to do anyway number 4
distracted driving regulations the
National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration has been floating these
tortured proposals for limiting in-car
distraction like saying that a text
display should have no more than 30
characters at a time or any screen based
tasks and take no more than two seconds
they clearly haven't used an Android
phone have that whatever the specifics
this federal push will be what moves
distracted driving to the same level of
stigma as DUI number three rear cameras
this rule has been delayed more times
than BlackBerry's comeback but the feds
are close to requiring a backup camera
and all new vehicles perhaps by late
2014 the car makers say it's gonna jack
up the price of a car too much but most
likely they don't want to lose the
ability to make the rear camera a
desirable option instead of a standard
feature number two are black box data
recorders they're already in 90 plus
percent of late-model cars probably
yours that you didn't know that but the
feds will soon require them in all new
cars sold the gripe here is that the
feds are gonna require the black boxes
but the state's control access to the
data and barely more than a dozen of
them even have laws that address it the
number one way that regulations will
change cars tomorrow is the new 50
four-and-a-half mpg fuel economy
standard that's the level that must be
met by the
average of all cars sold by any maker as
of 2025 it's this incredibly complicated
formula they use to figure it out but
still a huge bump from today's 29.7
fleet average and not that many years
away that means we're going to see three
cylinder engines turbos and almost
everything
hybrids galore cars that shut themselves
off at a stop sign or red light and
electric cars on showroom Lots even if
nobody wants to buy one and it's
estimated to add some $3,000 to the
average MSRP by 2025 no federal rule
will change cars or the cost of them as
much as this one to stay on top of all
the new innovations happening in cars
the one you have today and the one
you'll buy tomorrow check out our show
