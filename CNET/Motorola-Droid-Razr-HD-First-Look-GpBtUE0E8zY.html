editor here at scenic today were take a
person look at the motorola droid razr
HD now this device came out with a droid
razr maxx HD at the same time the
devices are very similar except of
course the max like the original RAZR
MAXX has a much longer battery so it
means it lasts much longer but overall I
do like the design a lot it is a little
heavy but it has a really nice solid and
sturdy feel in the hand so it is a 4.7
inch display so it's going to be a
little larger than you may be used to
like I said it's a little heavy so you
definitely notice it when you're
carrying it around it does have a Kevlar
backing so it is going to hopefully
going to be strong if you drop it at
least that's what Motorola's promising
also this gorilla glass covering the
display so you should be protected there
as well now I asked Motorola ok this is
a razor what makes it a razor what makes
a phone eraser that goes back to the
original razr v3 horse which is the
original thin phone they sent a couple
things they said thin design well it
certainly has that they said a lot of
power it does have that as a 1.5
gigahertz processor that's dual core has
LTE and it just brings something high
end to the table and I think this phone
in both its design and its features does
do all of those things now the phone
right now is ice cream sandwich no
that's a little disappointing
considering jelly bean has been out for
a while motorola says we'll upgrade to
jellybean by the end of the year it's
not a long time to wait but hopefully
what happens sooner rather than later
like a lot android phones you could
personalize the display with all the
icons you want with folders with widgets
you can go through different home
screens one thing i like is that if you
go over to this side you can get the
access to the quick settings right there
one thing at motorola added now this is
really an android skin so you're not
gonna have to sift through a lot of
things is the circles right up here in
the front so it's nice you can see the
time you can see the weather you can see
the battery life if you flip on them it
will go between different clock styles
right here I've weather for San
Francisco but if I flip it I can get
Washington DC of course I program those
things if you want you can flip it again
you can add more cities you could flip
the battery as well to go directly to
settings or to see the battery life so
like that it shows the percentage and I
like that icon the circle you notice it
gets smaller so it just gives you an
idea motorola says will be up to 16
hours talk time and up to maybe 20 / 20
hours of multi-use time so that means
you're going through you're going to
maybe watching this short video you're
going through abs you're typing you're
looking the browser of course you have
the big display on if it's up to us a
brighter setting if you're using a lot
of GPS you keep using that dual core
processor will run down but there's a
very promising battery life certainly
not as long as a razr maxx but certainly
more than a lot of phones we've seen it
does have an eight megapixel camera of
course like I said it as LTE it has all
the things you might expect from an
android phone and a smartphone Wi-Fi
with bluetooth with organizer features
one thing that's interesting is the
phone of course has a browser but you'll
see that it's labeled directly as chrome
so it's not that it's something other
kind of browser just have some chrome
touches the chrome browser just bring a
couple of options brings tabbed browsing
you wish you could sync it with other
devices we've signed in using your
chrome ID so that's a nice touch few
more elements to tell you about the
design there's a bet there's a volume
rocker on this side there's a power
control right above over on this side
you'll see the micro USB port so that's
force data syncing and also for the
charger and below that is an HDMI out
port one thing that's important about
this phone is the battery is not user
removable so you can't take it out you
can't swap it out if it goes bad you
will have to send it in but the
trade-off of not having to use a
removable battery is just that little
bit of a finger the droid razr HD is 199
with a contract the droid razr maxx is
going to be 2 99 so you interested in a
little bit of a more budget device
probably i'm ken German he were the
first look at the motorola droid razr HD
