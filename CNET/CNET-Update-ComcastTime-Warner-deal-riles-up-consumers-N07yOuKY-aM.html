companies I'm Bridget Carey and this is
your cnet update comcast and time warner
cable America's two largest cable
companies agreed to merge forming the
ultimate mega evil cable company okay
I'm just joking but people sure do hate
their cable companies because after the
news broke Twitter was filled with
people making fun of how horrible life
will be for customers under the merger
some cry out how it'll raise internet
and television costs for consumers and
it'll make it harder for rivals to come
in and challenge the cable behemoth and
by being so large it won't have
incentive to do right by customers and
improve but these two cable giants of
course argue the opposite that this
marriage would be good for consumers by
saving money and it will improve the
tech offerings to better compete against
new players like Google Fiber bottom
line is that it's not approved yet
nothing is changing for a while and
you'll still feel grumpy about the
quality of your customer service in
other giant tech company news Verizon
Wireless changed up its data plans to be
more competitive there's a new more
everything planned that promises more
data 25 gigs of cloud storage and
unlimited international messaging and
for those that are paying for their
phone in full to upgrade early with the
edge monthly installment plan you'll
finally get a break on your service bill
which is what the other carriers already
offer if you own an xbox one you may
soon be able to control it with a new
Xbox one remote Amazon's Canadian
storefront temporarily published a
pre-order page for an item called the
Xbox one media remote and before it was
taken down screenshots showed that it
would go for around twenty-five dollars
when it launches on march forth
Microsoft has yet to announce such a
product but Microsoft is selling a new
xbox headset in March and that's not the
only Microsoft leaked this image posted
on Twitter shows Microsoft is trying to
make it easier on app developers with
something called universal store it
would let programmers create a single
app that works for both
windows vil and the Windows desktop on
