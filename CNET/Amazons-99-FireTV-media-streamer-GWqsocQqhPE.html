com and i'm here with Amazon's new fire
TV this is a $99 streaming media box it
does music video and games amazon has
talked about how this is an open
ecosystem so it not only has amazon
video on it but it also has netflix and
a host of other partners and it does
have some games as well you can buy an
optional 3999 game controller it's
designed to work with Amazon's Kindle
Fire Games if you can purchase a game on
a Kindle Fire for instance and use it on
this on this box or you can just buy it
separately on this box it taps right
into your amazon account so the day you
set this up all your content those
movies you might have downloaded or
music will appear on this box and
obviously does Amazon Instant Video and
Prime members will have a lot of free
content to choose from in terms of
connectivity around back you'll find an
HDMI connection there's also a USB port
that's for future expansion is just
there and there's also an Ethernet
connection if you don't want to go
wireless this is a wireless box just
like Apple TV it has wireless and in it
in terms of specs amazon is town in fact
this is three times faster than
competing products out there from Roku
Apple and that google chromecast so it's
got a quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon
processor it also comes with two
gigabytes of internal ram all that
processing power does make the interface
very smooth and zippy so performance is
really good the other big differentiator
is the voice search the remote that
comes with this box as a microphone
built into it and you can search using
your voice you can search in a number of
different categories including title
actor and genre so it does away with all
these sort of typing in letters that you
have to do with a little remote all I've
been impressed what I've seen so far
this does seem like a big leap forward
from what apple TV is today and at $99
it's obviously designed to compete with
that we will have a full review
in the coming days so tune back for that
