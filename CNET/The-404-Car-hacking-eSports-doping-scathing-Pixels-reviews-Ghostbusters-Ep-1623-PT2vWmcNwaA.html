northern so dove the 404 show on this
friday july twenty four twenty fifteen
my name is jeff bakalar across the table
from me mr. russ fresh dick how are you
sir why hello there going on now you
know you're still engaged still engage
shockingly I've got the ring resized so
for a week she wasn't wearing the ring
that was my chance to get out still
engaged so uh I screwed that up to the
ring resized even though I like I asked
they see you know and I and I even
remember putting that like multi ring
you know starting thing on her yeah she
probably should have known at that point
that you're gonna propose oh please she
knew she knew right away um so i thought
i had the sizing correct turns out nope
didn't get it correct here uh so she
wore the ring on her opposite hand that
was a little meteor really i don't know
weird yeah my right hand is definitively
meteor than my left Alex just wart on
her middle finger ins ah the old a few
engagement exactly she appreciated
fucking people the bird um but yeah I
got resized it was it was fine there is
apparently in the heat your fingers get
stubbier yes as well that's true you
collect more water or some stuff okay
Norte I think it's retaining well good
you on the other hand are actually
reverting back to single life but with
an added bonus of having a small life to
take care of yeah I want to see if I
could like complicate the matter or any
way shape or form so this is gonna be my
first weekend watching Dylan up by my
lonesome completely alone oh it's just
gonna be me the dog and Dylan right and
this is a big deal for me because well
I'll be honest between you and all the
listeners I haven't been paying
attention this whole three months ago by
and I've just been like this amazing
innocent bystander this has been like
make sure you don't scald him with the
mill yeah yeah nah nothing happens I've
been playing rocket League a I'm just
not really watching what she's doing
sure so I'm understandably nervous for
this coming weekend and it's not just
like the weekend it's
tonight Saturday night Sunday night and
like maybe sunday afternoon up Monday
afternoon really before she gets home
from the thing so are you taking monday
off no no he's gonna go to I'm gonna
bring him to daycare on Monday no it's a
lot that's a lot like if any we got any
single parents out there you people are
ya Saints you are magician Saints yeah
that's that does not seem like fun oh
I'm just I'm the he's I don't know if I
said this before but we're very lucky he
turned out to be a relatively low
maintenance baby but it sounds like
Stacy has taken the brunt of the
unfortunate moments that you've had with
him so far whether it's covered in poop
or like I'm kidding around like I've
been paying attention you know like I've
been is it is there gonna be duct tape
when you try to put a diaper on him
maybe he'll do down the diaper massive
there's everything that I've been held
responsible for its constant change
diaper master i think that's like a
fetish that people are into yeah you
know I'm um I'm all up in that up to my
I'm up to my elbows in there uh in the
first she didn't change diaper for the
first three weeks of his life really
yeah okay so you did have that down yeah
so that's the least of my brain you've
got the breastfeeding down yeah you know
it's weird it takes a while sure he
latches on shirts odd you know it's like
that scene in family guy guys doing the
hair out but uh no it's gonna be a good
time i'm just saying i have no proof
that will be yeah i would be super
stressed but I mean you've been stressed
you were stressed about the baby's
arrival this is just enough next layer a
new level of stress that you're feeling
this I mean I'm not then what would it
take for you to call like a parental
figure and be like save me from this oh
my god that would it have to be like
cash really bad yeah really bad because
it would basically say that you are a
child and cannot take care of another
child it would get to that that point
where yeah and I can't see it getting
there sure you know the dog in Peter Pan
uh Anna I believe the dog's name is
maybe they leave the dog to babysit and
that's why the kids get kidnapped by
Peter Pan is cuz the dog is out there
barking and that's it and like they put
like a hat on the dog and that's it so
like worse comes to worse if you have to
like go out and get a pizza
yeah just leave Marty there so it's fine
so here's where I probably said
something out loud to stay so that made
her nervous oh no where I said to her I
was like all right well in the morning
if he's like if he's not up yet yeah I
could walk Marty right and just leave
him by himself right bright and she's
like no and I was like well why but you
can't you just can't do that why like
you can leave the room tour and like
maybe if he's in the crib let's say
there's a crib I guess yeah we got
wonders if he's in the crib and let's
say it's like 6am and he's sleeping what
I mean he cries for 10 minutes what's
the big deal am I gonna get arrested so
I think that's only cool at night when
he went in during his server instead of
waking up from it what happens if you
don't between you and me yeah I'm sure
he'd be fine I feel like you that you
just develop like tendency is where it's
like oh I cry then people are gonna come
and fix my problem yeah and you get used
to them that's not like the first child
syndrome well so here's the deal at
night Marty peas 15 seconds comes back
in sure so that's what I'll do because I
have no choice really in the matter
aside from like patty you are gonna say
you're gonna leave the bait your child
your single boy yeah alone while your
dog pees outside for literally 45 second
okay which aisle which I will leave him
in his room for way longer periods of
time when I'm in the living room in the
outside what happens when you thing a
shower yeah right like a showers longer
than a walk yeah but but at least I'm
like close enough to him okay where you
could like run out yeah he's Billy uh
what was that but then he'd be scarred
by your naked body believe me he's
already been traumatized by some of the
things I've been doing in front of Omar
on yeah it's not that bad um but anyway
I I will take this as a good luck Jeff
well wishes to your weekend of doom yeah
I I have no
real insight whatsoever the causes that
I've come is to taking my one year old
niece on a train which was moderately
traumatic but you know good luck I think
my brother's gonna come by on Sunday
we'll go out to lunch okay I gotta bring
the kids yeah you gotta like fill the
weekend yeah I I'm gonna do stuff my god
tomorrow morning you know he slept like
11 hours last night so I'm hoping he
does something similar where like
tonight he sleeps forever and I'll wake
up fresh and rested yeah and me him and
uh I'm already we'll go out to the park
and maybe maybe I take the wedding ring
off oh yeah you know maybe goes babies
man and dogs maybe I can for you baby I
got a key dog and he just looked like
really forlorn yeah you know maybe put
on saw ck one yeah something like that
you know oh my god oh I'm running right
yeah maybe do my hair dress nice and
then take her out to a movie with the
baby at like an r-rated movie by 10pm
just saying I think there's a lot of
good things I think all the stars and
planets are lining up for something
special Age of Aquarius I think it's
kepler-452b right in line with Mars
indeed it's gonna be a good one cool
well wish me luck best of luck sir if
you see me in town just say hi and yeah
and offer a comforting hand I will uh ok
lata a lot of interesting developments
in the world this week man crazy stuff
that you don't really think about but
then when it happens you're like ok
course perfect set course this is going
to be a problem I for I think the last
year or so have been whenever anyone
asked me about self-driving cars i'm
like it's great you don't have people
driving drunk you can go wild you could
like chill out do a crossword whatever i
think you know self-driving cars are the
future i still think that they 100 0 100
percent are is definitely 20 years from
now I think we're gonna have all
self-driving cars and like regular cars
will be like driving go-karts people
will like get a throw from it but it's
not going to be the way you get around
that said there was this great article
I'm wired this past week about a jeep
one of their reporters drove a jeep
and the Jeep was hijacked by a pair of
hackers using a very intricate as the
way they got into the system to the
radio and essentially we're able to take
control of the entire Jeep now I mean
this is a plan this is player they
weren't brand of hackers cuz that would
be really awesome ok can I wired right
about this story so I will say this a
news outlet that will remain nameless ok
obviously not CBS sure reached out to me
about this story ok and the producer was
basically because like every now and
then I help this person writes shark
questions for their talent cuz I'm you
know so I alright consult a little bit
ok they thought they thought yeah they
had not read this clearly they thought
that the cult like they did this to a
random per share and I'm like are you
kidding oh but that's where the fear
amateur and that's the argument is that
you could theoretically do this to a
random person it would require a little
bit of work but you could I erotically
do this to a random person so can you
explain how they got in i'm not really
cuz i'm not a scientist i'm not a
hacker's i did as i understand it they
essentially went through a loophole that
has to do with the radio entertainment
system right we're not a certain brand
of that right and it connects through
the cloud you log into something or
other so if you got that someone's
password they get in through that and
from there they start by like jamming up
the volume all the way yeah and like
making all sorts of crazy like you know
changing the radio station and stuff
like that and that's very distracting
and eventually they basically use all
sorts of extra add-on loopholes to shut
the entire car down like literally he's
on the highway and the car rolls to a
stop that's terrifying crazy is that
crazy they even said you could take
control of the steering right now only
when people are going in Reverse can you
take control of the steering so is that
you think that's like I think it's
probably tied to the auto parking
mechanism would be my guess and it's
just an exploit they found right but
like
legitimately do serious harm to someone
if you wanted to write so me and you
would require it would require a level
of like James Bond dedications like dig
into this person and really make their
life there are easier ways to screw or
so totally but but it was enough to for
them to do a recall on the cars right
because there is a vulnerability now the
thing that freaks me out a little bit is
when you think of the technology inside
of cars like for the most part I I
consider all that like in the same
category as like ATM software and the
same category as like you know kiosks
and like really primitive shit sure
there I'm sorry some cars like yeah
Tesla Assad yeah um what what else I've
heard of Mercedes has very sophisticated
computer system inside their cars sure
they're getting better and Microsoft had
their whole like sink right thankful
from what I understand he did write it
was a lower saved I've been in a link in
that head sink in there and it was dog
shit like I think you know yeah I had I
was not happy with that nevertheless you
know these are not like the bastion of
like high-tech you know infrastructure
and that might be part of the problem
that's what I'm saying right it's so
simple I mean granted the as you said
like especially with tehsil and stuff
like that they are getting more complex
but still you're not playing whatever a
doom for on these things like they're
very basic right and because of their
you know basic full of cum probably a
design powerful is like a phone like a
mobile phone I think that's eyes less
yeah I would say less for most cars okay
um you know I be with that comes a less
sophisticated security system and sort
of protection yeah and that's what
freaks me out where like you have the
vast vast vast majority of cars on the
road with these vulnerable sort of
systems in place yes it is not like you
know throwing uh you know a rock at upon
and just like yeah I can just you know
nail anyone I want right it is way
tougher to single someone out the these
guys how to create this sophisticated
choreographs that you
nation where they could hack the Jeep
and take it over yeah but it's still
something to think about it might be a
problem yeah I can definitely say N and
again like if you have self-driving cars
the cars obviously have to connect to a
GPS through the cloud etc and the second
you're connecting to the web in some way
there is going to be exploits um which
just freaks me out yeah man you could
like force everyone to drive to one spot
and like have a killer concert just have
like a rager lock the doors and like
you're coming to my ass nigga man that's
creepy there was actually did you watch
that episode of was it Silicon Valley so
much yeah he gets stuck in the
self-driving car and it drives like an
island did you know it drives to like a
seaport a seaport and the but the boat
takes into like a private eye that could
happen man this is the world were
limited this is the paying the price
this scenario is painting yeah okay deal
with it the future is about to knock you
on your ass yep Iraq but as much as this
is so obviously this is a big sort of
you know scoop / feature for um for
Wired it's it's being turned into this
fear mongering story sure we're like you
know everyone who's covering this from
from a mainstream sort of casual
technologist point of view is like oh my
god this could happen to me time to like
you know drive uh time to ride a bike
right because that's the one thing not
gonna be able to hack and that's the
funny thing about this story is like I'd
buy there are stories of like oh you
know some hackers tried to get into
NORAD or something like that and those
stores do not get the same attention as
like a jeep shut road experiment yeah
yeah I'd be much more worried about like
someone getting into the new codes and
starting some truffle but ok so let this
is more ground it like it's more
grounded more practical share a regular
uh uh you know John Doe now here's the
thing do you think we'll ever get to the
point where we just won't be able to
protect cars and like they'll need to
sort of be you know air-gapped away from
the internet yes you do I think every
computer given enough time
be effectively cracked given after two
if it's connected to an hour sure so so
that's why george RR martin types on a
you know get air gap computer right
because he doesn't want you know the
zombie blood and I plan now do you think
this is gonna now so how does this play
uh in with driverless cars um watch out
Oh obviously watch out is gonna be a lot
of security I think it's there are
probably ways to air gap probably not
like the entertainment system because
that's gonna be a big internet driven
thing yeah but they'll probably get to a
point I don't know man like there's to
me to me there's gotta be a way be
connects to your I don't know but do you
understand what I'm saying the obvious
like the great system thing set up were
like the engine like how is it that the
design Jeep yeah has it so that the car
can be taken over her like how is there
not a physical gap in the surc and there
needs to be some sort of kill switch
which obviously one of these
self-driving cars will have the options
like take control yourself that needs to
but like a lot of these jeeps are not
putting that function Elian because who
would ever think that they would get
hijacked so they would need to be an
element of like Oh something weird is
going on diagnostics going off saying oh
I'm not doing what I should do in the
way that like if my credit card gets
stolen the bank knows i'm at
automatically because someone just
bought right 15 i keys there needs to be
the car needs to know Oh something
weirds going on I'm gonna not let the
cloud control what I'm doing but who
knows like again this technology is so
new that five ten years from now I think
driving cars going to be vastly
different than it is today so it's hard
to say like what's going to be
controlled by the cloud who I just want
to like kick back and like play some
game boy and just let the car do just
let the car do is to go over jumps I
don't care go mudding right yeah see we
took we talked about this like a month
ago and it's it's kind of like I don't
think we're prepared for like the there
will be a little bit of like culture
shock trauma when we move to a
driverless it's like horse to car yep
I'm sayin it's like what okay the
example I've been using a lot in
conversation this is always like what my
bar conversations devolved to sure where
it's like there will be you know the
first death by robotic all right that
the the car made the choice to like
sacrifice it's no list the car me they
chose to sacrifice it has messenger
because it saw that a bus of school kids
sure was ahead and like if he didn't
vert out you'd have 19 dead you know
kindergartner right and chances are it
would be the other way around which is
to say chances are if the car is
programs is to prioritize the safety of
its driver over all else and then like
you have a guy who like hacks that and
says like oh I'm just unlike a
juggernaut car and now yeah you can have
like a murder cut like a computerized
murder car like in dual where
essentially it's it has no feeling or
emotion it's just driving around just
demolishing people and the guys like I'm
sorry yeah I just programmed it you know
yeah well that's a drag so that is super
so like yeah that's yeah the first time
that happens it's gonna be a problem but
I think about it think about like a
futuristic like tale where you have like
you know these guys figured out how to
hack the cars near the only ones really
driving cars and everyone else is like
stuck on the mag rail you know ya like
like that's the that's sort of like a
road warrior imagination yeah for ya
hack the presidential motorcade yeah
right oh man those always writing this
movie those will always be human
operated yes president never lets a
robot drive them unless it's a robot
president ah could happen it's like
future army in our lifetime that's
creepy stuff kids suck on that this
weekend speaking of cars that drive that
practically drive themselves uber I
don't have you been taking note and I
and I know people are like oh ooh BRR is
such a New York only such it really
isn't it is not uber is everywhere if
anything I would say uber for me at
least has impacted Los Angeles way more
than I've ever used it in New York
because every time I should go to LA I'm
usually staying downtown for e3
and I can never get a cab but uber is
literally everywhere it cost $15 to take
an uber from downtown to the airport if
you use uber share it's super crazy
cheap and it's totally like changed the
way I travel it's a shame that the
company is run by moderate scumbags but
sure no one's going to really argue that
like people seem to not buddy code but
their technology seems to be pretty on
point but it has obviously created a lot
of strife with all these different
governments New York City included and
that's the one that's like that that's
the super hot issue right now is uber
and New York City and I don't want to
spend too much time on this but uber was
on the defense with New York was sort of
going after uber specifically the mayor
de Blasio was basically proposing a one
percent cap growth on uber expansion in
the city now if you don't know why that
would be an issue so there's about
13,000 yellow cabs in the city and now
there's approaching 18 to 20,000 uber
drivers in Manhattan so there's more
uber cars in Manhattan than there are
cabs and you know proponents of the
taxicab industry say this is causing
great deals of traffic and the average
speed in New York City for a car has
slowed down by a mile an hour over the
last year there's a lot of yeah stuff to
unpack here there's a lot going on but
on Wednesday the the city of New York
decided to pull out on its campaign to
cap uber growth in Manhattan and I'm
just like you know I kind of understood
where New York City was coming from
because they do I guess have the right
to do that all right uh the the city is
as well as I mean hindsight's
twenty-twenty the city does feel more
traffic than it's ever been yeah is that
Uber's fault you can't really point
fingers I mean I'm sure it's an impact
uh you know you have all those feet all
these people that couldn't make money
before can now just like get an uber
license I mean it got to the point
regionally locally here in New York
where there
running propagandas yeah our stuff on TV
at Hoover was paying for uh as pretty
got pretty well cuz it's line so much
money for them like Tony's market right
if they get booted out of New York City
where Sir again this is wasn't them
talking about getting booted but they
it's just so much money for them and
obviously new york city doesn't I mean
part of it is like new york city doesn't
want to lose that income and the other
part is like traffic congestion is a
serious problem and you know a cities
like London have imposed like crazy
strict traffic limitations that will
probably have to come to New York
eventually yeah so something is going to
have to bend or break um so the way it's
shaking out right now we'll move on
after this the way shaken out right now
is that the mayor and uber did strike a
deal they're going to take four months
and sort of study with a lot of data
transparency between the city and uber
because apparently that was like a
closed-off situation where the city just
did not have access to the amazing
amounts of functional data that uber
generates just by operating as a service
they're gonna work with the department
transportation like sort of figure out
just what the hell is happening now that
uber is such a an unbreakable pervasive
force in Manhattan yeah and they'll
reassess that after four months there's
no cap so uber can ed 30,000 cars
tomorrow um and we'll see how chicks out
this is very interested is very
interesting I'm I don't know I here's
what I'm gonna say is if you're visiting
New York City take the subway it's
really nice and easy to get around well
it's not nice but it's nice when you say
nice do you mean like nicer than a
puddle of crap alright that's I know
it's safe is what I would say yes as
long as you're using it in normal hours
right like not it to am in a really bad
neighborhood maybe not the most safe
thing but it's pretty say if you're
going from like Midtown to Soho take it
take a subway it'll take way less time
and you know give a little back to the
people and i'll i'll give you this free
advice as well if you're traveling only
within the island of Manhattan cabs
probably still going to be cheaper then
then
uber yeah you're probably right because
of the surgery it may not be as
pleasurable of an experience also surges
pretty regularly in Manhattan yes yeah
so so so beware if you're visiting our
great city yes all right we're gonna
take a break when we come back we've got
a story about doping is good this is a
thing now it is plus you're not gonna
believe some of these reviews of the
movie pixels that have been coming out
let's just say uh people are opinionated
they are that's hands this new Adam

eSport okay you're gonna laughing like
well you know obviously this is an issue
in hmm how would you differentiate
eSports and sports well one doesn't
involve a computer in any way right
you're not sitting the whole time
eSports his video games right playing
video games sports we're talking league
legends counter-strike this ilk there's
street there was a big street fighter
competition over the weekend against a
las vegas the evo tournament yeah so the
eSports are big deal a big big deal
lotta meal there was $250,000 tournament
recently in Poland and there is this
issue there has been this issue that the
one of the teams at this tournament was
for counter-strike admitted that they
were using adderall which is a
methamphetamine don't you take it I
think it's just maybe just an
amphetamine I think it's a
methamphetamine I do take it yes I do
text I was really called so I have been
diagnosed for a TD not ADHD but the not
think I knew that you know the
difference between the tomb I have a
little class right now is one like adult
now so ADHD is hyperactive hyperactive
mph oh that's the na dhih dhih is just
straight up so a DD for me at least sort
of surfaced when i was in middle school
high school where I would literally just
like be in the middle class and like
fall asleep or like tap on the desk and
just like constantly distracted not
really paying attention ignoring school
work etc oh you mean like every like
literally everyone you mean like the
difference is I medicated and fix the
problem so waited but but yeah I'm not
gonna get into like that whole miss
Shore knows there is it there's there's
drama to I mean whatever I went to a
doctor yeah I took a test like they
literally tested me with like a bunch of
questions and you didn't finish and then
there and I literally I'm not even
joking literally fell asleep during test
so you were straight of falling us
leap I mean it wasn't like narcolepsy
but I was like well this is a lot to
take in and I can't really so I just I
mean it was like a three-hour test and I
fell asleep during the middle of it huh
so that was a pretty conclusive and what
year was that that your dishes like
ninety seven or eight maybe so so fair
so I've been taking it for a while so
you've been taking adderall for 18 years
yes so I don't take it on weekends um or
when I'm like not doing work but if I'm
it's a work day like I took it this
morning not a huge amount i take ten
milligrams you do notice a difference
there's a serial serial difference I do
sort of want I don't drink coffee and I
do sort of wonder like if I just drank
coffee every morning so there I do the
same thing tomorrow morning sure on your
non adder all day yeah have coffee I
don't like coffee you're gonna learn to
love it uh no I love at all oh noes you
just filter out our way through hot
water what's good is that like I don't
really it is potentially very addictive
I don't have an urge to take it when I'm
not taking it but it is obviously a very
dangerous drug it is an amphetamine
which is very illegal if you don't have
a prescription and in large amounts a
lot of people you'll go to jail etc etc
they've been using these college kids
especially I've been using these for
like study like oh my test is tomorrow
I'm gonna study all night um I
definitely feel more it's weird I feel
much more productive after I take it it
helps you focus it house focus a lot of
people say that they clean their entire
barman on adderall okay is it like speed
it well yeah and so far as the damn feta
mean so it's an upper yeah uh it was
originally created for diet loss like as
a diet pill Oh weight loss weight loss
yeah thank you title anyway that's sort
of a long circuitous story which is to
say I'm familiar with the drug and it's
interesting here because so the team was
using it now within my counter strike so
they were using it for the sole purpose
of concentration in chemistry presumably
that's sort of the question is like okay
arguably if everyone on the team has a
prescription I don't even know how
prescriptions work in like Poland sure
Europe maybe it's different system but
if everyone had the bridge had a
can you make that illegal now obviously
in sports like bicycling they had to
make some drugs illegal because they
were a huge advantage and they were
essentially testosterone and human
growth hormones stimulate whatever
there's plenty of sports wear shirts all
that stuff's not cool but some of these
drugs are potentially legal for people
that have prescriptions so where do you
draw the line right and what counts as
an advantage if someone there are people
that like cannot I can obviously
function without adderall there are
people that literally cannot like
function I can't get up and do stuff in
the day which is obviously sad but like
if one of those people was competing in
this tournament how do you draw that
line yeah how do you say uh you know I
realize you need this to be to be
regular right and that your regular is
enhanced yeah well and that's the
question is is it enhance so they I
don't think they've really done Studies
on how much of an improvement someone
with pet that has taken adderall would
be at a video game and I think that's
the issue they haven't actually
announced a policy for this or anything
like that they've said they're working
on a policy the group that runs the
tournament this ESL electronic sports
league is working on a policy to solve
the problem but without real data to say
I took adderall and I was thirty percent
better at this game or even five percent
better it's very difficult to enforce
especially if you have those
prescriptions especially if you have the
prescription but it's also $250,000 and
if anyone feels like they have an
advantage what do you do about and then
do we get into the prescription dr. Nick
people right it's like you want that
prescription no problem right so the
easy advantage the easy solution would
just be to ban it but then you know then
you're discounting people who need it
who want to play and what other drugs
could you like if someone took excedrin
in the morning that yeah off it's not
gonna be an easy solution to this so
it's it is interesting though like it
never really occurred to me I actually
I've heard that people who have a.d.d
actually I wouldn't say better but it's
definitely more inclined for video games
because there's so much stimulation that
like you're constantly being bombarded
buy things yeah like if when i play
borderlands there's like 10,000 guns
flying at me and i love comparing all
the stats and all that stuff and you
would think that would require a lot of
focus but it's so diffused there were so
many different things that it almost
works for my brain better it yeah it
almost plays into you like right are we
saying are we like gonna discover like
oh my god video games really just help
people with these conditions well I
don't know if they help but they
certainly they play into the right
arguably if you could make a lesson plan
that used video games as sort of a like
a baseline like oh let's use these
tactics they use in these games to teach
actual things yeah which have actually
started happening you might see a lot
more success that way so it's pretty
cool it's cool but it's tough man it's
really tough it's very difficult to
study and you know I think we're gonna
see a lot of advancement with this stuff
in the coming years as like video games
like people enter Congress that play
video games a lot like there are not
very many people that do that right now
maybe they play snake on their flip
phone but as people you know enter
public service and government I think
we're going to start seeing more of this
stuff coming into play and being like oh
let's use some of these tactics that
people who design video games to teach
kids other things it's going to move I'm
waiting for the first presidential
candidate who has like a recognizable
handle I mean like oh my god is that
notorious yeah oh man I used to playing
rock Utley no but you got to imagine
it's gonna be a few years from now so
it's gonna be like X X underscore
notorious yeah we're the one right
because that generation will be the
first to get the call we are holding on
to these user names for all time or past
my username down through the ages isn't
that wacky it's weird is her it's a very
weird someone was trying to argue with
me that the generation after us which is
I guess people born in the 90s have seen
more and I would argue that was that
means team well we'll see more but I
think there or what more of a jumps are
more yeah that was
had a contact we'll see more of a change
in humanity oh so here's what I argue I
argue that the fact that we lived on
both sides of that digital divide sure
where it was way more of our life has
been spent on on the internet the shot
but we we saw that enough and we're old
enough to remember yeah like I remember
using rotary phone yeah I remember using
shit like that like I remember
legitimately playing in television like
this is what the what we have yeah so I
you know I had to go to a library yes
study course and like threw a book
report or whatever yeah uh yeah I can't
imagine it's possible that it'll happen
whatever in 50 years there's going to be
the equivalent of the internet I have
note there's no way for me to fathom of
course something that huge and that
impactful in the entire world I I don't
know what that would be so so instead of
load of like aliens landing exactly
instead of debating who has the more
impressive generation ours right just
because you're biased yes I think it's
cool that we are one of the only ones
that can say that we sort of saw both
sides of that yeah i agree i think about
that all we're like my kids not gonna
have any idea of what it was like to
send the fax no they're just gonna know
oh i've i've never used the ipad eight
but i've used the ipad not exactly and
that'll ipad sucks right that's all the
work is going to be um yeah it's crazy
it's really crazy stuff okay speaking of
nostalgia you know we've we've talked
about this movie for a little bit we
talked about pixels and you adam-san
away film that comes out today yeah ah
the idea of the movie is that back in
the day when we sort of sent out a SETI
uh you know throw capsule probe we put
in some 70s and 80s gaming uh you know
sort of and probably like a bee gees
album but like there was like arcade
games we should we like through donkey
kong and packmans in there um an alien
race discovers this probe sees it as an
act of war yeah and believes that they
must emulate that to take us on yeah
anyway good good use of the word emulate
thank you it's also funny because it's
emulating the literal plot of a futurama
episode mmm directly like it's literally
the same key right so aside from how you
feel about that plot sure um the movie
has been open to reviewers for a few
days yeah and my oh my yeah it's not
pretty people people don't seem very
fond of it as it's actually I checked it
a couple days ago on rotten tomatoes and
it was at zero percent which is fifteen
percent there was 15 reviews and it was
at zero percent on rotten tomatoes it is
up to twenty percent around is actually
higher than I was expecting but the
universal agreed-upon claim is that the
movie is a steaming pile of horseshit
I've heard some amazing someone said it
was an unmitigated god-awful piece of
dog shit yeah is what's one reviewer
said yet that my favorite critical quote
that I've heard for anything was of a
Styx album where it was called a parking
lot full of a whale vomit hahaha but
some of the reviews for four pixels have
come close to that so there's this guy
he calls himself movie Bob and he's a
ranter yeah he gets off not unlike zero
punctuation yeah probably not as um he
doesn't quite sound as stayed calm as
your punctuation days old zero
punctuation he's a million british maybe
british australian he has a sense of
decorum sure you know to his delivery
movie bob is much more direct movie Bob
Bob doesn't really hold anything back
and you know maybe I'm not in love with
his delivery and I'm not in love with
like some of the adjectives in the
colorful language uses in which to
describe this movie but for what it's
worth he does back up every yep tirade
with logically laid out uh excuse ins
and and and evidence as to how truly got
off of this film yeah I'd yeah he
released this video is definitely worth
searching out we'll post a link in the
in the post but essentially going point
by point on all the things they screwed
up in the movie
out of it is like plot and logic base
were like certain things act one way
we're pac-man's evil in one scene and
good another scene I it's sad because I
like video games and whenever anything
video game related has announced for the
film community it's almost always really
really garbage and this is just another
iteration of that and it makes me sad
because it was probably someone
somewhere in the production of this
movie that really in his heart of hearts
loves video games and loves how they
made him feel in the 80s I really
believe somewhere it wasn't Chris
Columbus who's like 93 right now yeah uh
and it probably wasn't Adam Sandler but
somewheres maybe a PA was like playing
clash of clans on his phone was like
yeah I I hope this movie is good and it
is just terrible and it's embarrassing
and Peter Dinklage I hope that boat is
nice peter yeah right there's really no
other explanation for it some payment
was due i'm sure this movie is making
people various yeah uh what this guy
movie Bob described it saying this film
will make you hate the things you love
and to me that is and it's like the
worst type of criticism you could give
something and I don't know I mean we've
talked shit on this movie for a while
just because of the absurd premise to
the whole thing I mean is this really
that surprising now can we just maybe
like let things like this happen no uh
with like we can't I mean I sort of i
mean like yeah and here's the issue is
that the people that come in on the
internet people that have Twitter
accounts people have YouTube are a lot
of them are like tech savvy people in
all of them are gamers so this stuff not
only can't pass it can't pass without
anyone commenting on it because it's all
like directly attacking the things that
they love right it is a form of
blasphemous yes it's a and and I get
that but it's like you can also go a
little overkill on berating a film too
i'm not defending anyone know i know
that there are in watch it be held
accountable you're right in watching his
video like there is a lot in that video
that's like he's obsessing about
like wait but why did she get a certain
character do this at this given moment
sure and in 10 minutes in you gotta
realize no logic is being pushed to any
of this I'm not excusing that but you
sort of just need to be like oh this is
garbage and move on like you don't need
to dissect every horrible piece of crap
right unless that's your job which
apparently movie Bob's job is to do the
same and without the only culprit like
there's no plenty of guys doing the same
exact thing that he the you know yes
guys goes it across the board doesn't
Matt people universally yeah are all up
on this yeah and uh I just hope it tanks
like please just hang and that's the
only thing you can really hope for yeah
and and people who like go on you know
you know drives me a little crazy too is
like some of some of like Hollywood
people get none Twitter and being like
shame on you a lot of people made this
movie and a lot of people make a lot of
movies and I don't want them to lose
their jobs right and they didn't they
got right and then no one's not gonna
hire a like oh he worked on pixels I'm
not gonna hire you as my gaffer oh yeah
come on exactly they're gonna be fine
yeah and you know what if freaking Adam
Sandler isn't fine after this well guess
what he freakin deserved it and and he
can take that hit right okay I'd be fine
with that if Adam Sandler doesn't make
any more movies I'd really be okay with
I i just cannot stand this like sense of
like oh we're we're Holly we can't be
criticized yeah like you're all buddy
but up no this movie apparently is
terrible Grandma's Boy not the worst
video game movie if we're gonna talk
about Adam Sandler look like you guys
about that that is a huge guilty
pleasure of mine LT well and it like
does a lot of things with us of some
level of respect some of us jokey and
stupid but like does sort of treat the
video game industry with some level
knowledge so if you do want an Adam
Sandler hit I don't know if he's
actually in the movie but he does not
it's a happy medicine jabya it's like
video game adjacent and not totally
merits the funny thing about grandmas
boy is that it came out when like xbox
360 was oh yeah and put everything in
the moon
he was like very very dated yeah well
them the game that they used in the
movie actually got canceled molly was an
actual game it was called whatever they
call the something with addy ternal
death Slayer no it was something with
addy was an actual name yeah and it was
an actual game that was gonna come out i
think THQ or some mullah and it got
canceled wow that is the only French
that a missing Chris but I did not know
that yeah so there you have it mom just
I guess all we can say is we're not
surprised no not not noise oh sad days
all right but let's maybe get a little
more positive okay anh anh de Paz on the
potential of new movie franchises well
not new movie franchises but you know
playing off on 80s nostalgia that really
worked and maybe not exploiting it okay
and I'm starting to turn the corner on
the new goes bust I don't know why you
haven't been around this corner for a
while I've ever do hater I've never and
I will the only time that I was a hater
was unlike Ackroyd was gonna make it and
it was like the DS a ghost yeah and like
it sounded terrible yes if you don't
know there was like this very strange
and brief period in time where
ghostbusters 3 was in quote unquote
pre-production and it was about them
going to hell right that was a part of
it to something they a half of them died
or something bill murray was a ghost or
something like that reason they went to
hell and they fought demons and it
sounded just awful and then obviously
when everyone heard that oh my god they
were they were gonna reboot ghostbusters
like beetlejuice go to Hawaii that was
originally beetlejuice I guess the
equivalent of that right which I think
everyone wrong with but now that we you
know have seen a lot of the UH not I
guess production still share movie yeah
arm and and the detail and like the
homage that they're paying to the
original yeah it's not and it and we're
not gonna get into like the female
versus mething cuz that hopeful so we
can talk about it you can but like it
pissed me off the people were just like
yeah people are idiots testo that people
are idiots first of all here's the thing
Paul Feig who's the director of this
movie I you know directed bridesmaids
very funny movie starring a lot of women
and everyone says spy is amazed by
supposed to be amazing even all the ads
made it look like Paul Bart yeah like
with the spy right um no so he's very
talented and very funny and tonally it
looks like as you said in all the
production stills there's like this from
penis to the movie then seems very
honest to Ghostbusters which is to say
like none of them really want to be
there except for maybe one of them right
none of their awesome oh right there all
just sort of like like mechanics that
happen to be like in in the neighborhood
and I don't know I've really high hopes
and I think if they like stay true to
the like I mean at its core it's not an
adventure movie it's a comedy it meets
the people one another sonic comedy and
Paul Feig has shown that he can do that
and the best part pretty excited the
best part is that now that you've seen
like what the proton pack looks like
yeah you know it's like I saw that thing
I was like oh this is awesome I was like
I took that no like it what was it about
the proton pack was at the the the
height of it that name is just like the
this sort of like DIY pneus of oil we're
like it wasn't this you know molded sort
of and their suit that jumpsuits they
wear just like frumpy like yeah they're
like each other I'm like you know what
like I think they're gonna do it I think
they're gonna be able to the ecto-1 is a
hearse yeah like they're gonna do it
they seem to really be on the right
track and then and this is why I believe
this movie is gonna work it's being made
by people who love ghostbusters yeah and
very funny people too and very funny
people Kristen Wiig is very very funny
anyway and I understand like the initial
knee-jerk reaction from a lot of people
specifically mail people in their 20s
melodies who has these these white men's
activists but like this so hard I white
and male the worst people like losing
their mind I was gonna be all female and
like to me that was like oh no I'm not
upset it's all female that's fine right
you do whatever you want oh yeah it was
more just like oh no you're just like
touching a child
memory yeah you're making in the engines
for which was a calamity totally so I we
didn't want that but the fact that they
you know seem to be very true to it and
they have the right cast and there's and
they're not like like if they brought in
a Chris Columbus it'd be a disaster
right but they brought in a comedy
director and actor isn't awkward
executing he might be involved in it
which does easy to you already it
actually the brief side note apparently
in pixels there's a scene where sorry
spoiler dan Aykroyd shows up okay and in
a following scene they're actually
drinking crystal skull vodka dan Aykroyd
vodka to give you an idea of the like
glad heading that's going on I have
heard that Aykroyd might have a cameo in
the movie the only thing that could
possibly ruin this is like cute little
nods like I'd be cool with seeing oh no
they're gonna do that I that needs to be
a very small I don't think someone's
gonna they're gonna bring up a Twinkie
okay maybe or like that needs to not
take over the entire thing or they're
gonna be like don't look at the track
here's the only day of the trip the only
reference I can stand is if winston
zeddemore is the mayor of New York City
because that would be fantastic he's the
mayor of New York City and then I think
they need to say something like if
someone asks if you're a god you say yes
no they can't quote nothing they knit
the Cajun they can't do it they can't Oh
would what do you think there's a chance
to film worries in it do you think
there's any you think he is I i think as
years and years he said he would never
do but he's also like Warren the outfit
in public the last ten years yeah that's
true I don't think he's he's turned his
back on that's true I don't think he's
upset no no uh and he loves to be loved
and he loves to be loved and he is the
most loved person arguably in the world
yet in terms of celebrities uh I think I
would not I would not be surprised if he
shows up yeah I can see it I'm excited
I'm sorry haters when's it coming out my
god next year said I don't know when
it's coming out I think it's it I feel
they be falling zakappa be real quick
you know yeah well it doesn't I mean
yeah it's not like a Avengers where they
spend a year doing post-production right
I'm excited yeah it's gonna be good I'm
excited is there gonna be a ghost oral
sex scene you think oh there is one you
gotta do like the flesh I that I'd be
fine with to you
I think you got it better if you're
really honoring the past chore you gotta
bring that that supernatural sex yep
seen into the future right I don't see
why not ghost dude's got to give it up
to theirs is it just looks like they
have that cam penis I think it'll be
good I'm very encouraged I'm not worried
now i'm ok i'm up now now i guess the
big thing for me and what we could leave
it at this if you want to move on for me
the thing they have to do is get the
ghosts right yeah they need to look kind
of shitty they have to look kind of shit
yeah you can't throw a movie magic at it
and because there's no way to do a
Ghostbuster style ghost and have it look
good right like there's got to be like
torn rag right like there's got to be
like maybe someones real slimer have to
be in it I don't know man I guess that
that does love pizza he does he just
loves to eat and stuff and have a go
right through him I feel like there's a
lot to there's still a lot that we don't
know like does this take place in the
same universe because it's the same logo
right so like this it the same um
firehouse of this from the heart house I
don't know so exists in York City you
can business try might get married there
really no but I would love to I
suggested it now it was like yes funeral
every-down wait no it's a real fun i

xiong current you just brought all your
prize i'm gonna kick you off yeah it'll
just be me complaining just 70 and now
my elbow hurts and I don't know if I OBO
does hurt does it ok so quick I want to
talk about you and how you bought animo
yo do you know okay so real quick
amiibos you may or may not know Nintendo
started producing these little like
three inch tall action figure looking
guys from all their characters and for
the last two years I've been like who
needs this thing it's like a hunk of
plastic sits on your desk I don't care
and they barely do anything and they
barely do anything like people are not
buying them for the interactivity they
have with your wii u they just like I
want to like the characters and they
want
have him out what you do is there
evidence of that I've spoken a lot of
people like people that are obsessed
with the toys and I'm like why do you
buy it is it because you like using the
wii u stuff and they're like absolutely
not I've never once used it it's just
people that want these toys there are
well made toys are they yeah I mean for
what they're not whatever 12 inch tall
Marty McFly's with the individual
zippers and shit but that's why I'm
that's why I want to bring this out okay
so I've been like rolling my eyes at
these things for a while i was at e3 the
big gaming show and i saw in a glass
case a yoshi made out of yarn it's a
yarn handmade looking little yoshi it's
absolutely adorable google it if you
want to check it out just google like
yarn Yoshi little see it instantly also
the game that's coming because again
that's coming out where he's made if you
aren't and I was like that is the cutest
thing I've ever seen I just want that
for my desk and this is I make funny all
the time for your action figures are
like Joker with the mirror and like
Marty McFly all that stuff this is where
ma that kicks in for me it's like weird
cute things from my childhood that I
just want all my desk there you so same
exact thing but yours are all like emo
it's like the Joker's looking to a
mirror and thinking about the time he
paralyzed Oracle oh they're so they're
all so serious and mine are just like oh
here's a cute like Jigglypuff it's a
cute Jigglypuff alright so you bought it
I bought its cut it hasn't actually
arrived yet it's coming I'm on pre-order
so it's not for sale in the US i
actually ordered an import from europe
to pay a little premium for that I mean
it'll probably go insane us for twenty
dollars i paved 34 the which really
isn't that bad is it softer yet sauce
off the covering no it's oh I don't know
I really held it but at the outside is
cloth it's not like plastic I gotta get
my hands on one it's adorable maybe I
feel like Nintendo is gonna send one
with the day you want they probably will
there is actually gonna be a bundle with
it but who knows these amiibo sell out
like they're so awesome popular yeah
it's crazy uh last week we talked about
color blend yeah I'm on huge revelation
but notice that no one sent me four
hundred our coal mine glasses like and
that was a noticeable omission during
the wee big mistake
listeners let's see if we can remedy
remedy that has freaked ok then the
expensive glasses so I guess now now
what prompted this I don't know I spent
a lot of time on unread at six plane
like I'm five subreddit because I really
dig it and I think it's interesting and
someone had posted the simple question
what do blind people see and I fit by in
my default brain I'm like always they
see black they see just like black right
and that's I feel like the default for
people that can see that's what they
would imagine when people see is just
darkness right turning off the lights
which is just so yeah it's weird and
rice Lee said to it is unless I said so
so the post went up and a blind person
presumably a blind person with a sense
of humor with a sense of humor posted
first blind person here responding and
wrote a bunch of gibberish we're just
funny she's amazing and then responded
below that with an online link to
another site called nada will dot us an
article Oh Nautilus the UH and basically
here's the quote from the article it
says the try to understand what might be
uh might be like to be blind think about
how it looks behind your head oh my god
think about that how it look what you
see behind your head and and what they
they say is do this experiment where you
hold your hands out to the sides your
head and then push them back until you
can't see them anymore and what color
are your hands then when you can't see
them anymore what that and that's what
why people say is not cool at all it
kind of melts your brain right yeah and
I had never really thought of it that
way but that is kind of a perfect
example where you just can't comprehend
presumably it's different for people
that had sight and lost it but you don't
can't comprehend what that is it's just
like nothing it's out of your view right
so flow instead you're comprehending
sound and you know daredevil stuff right
so it's not so much that it's black no
because you probably do see stuff right
right it's not black it's not black it's
just like
you don't see it it's just like MA right
it's just Guiche and that seems like a
good I don't know I thought that was a
really good way to explain how blind
people see that that is so I mean if
you're born with it that's one thing
sure it might be different for people
that have seen and can't anymore because
obviously it's usually gradual where you
lose vision in his vision we used to
have a blind listener chime in a bunch
yeah it was very insightful in a way
that seemed super human almost yeah like
he was such a he was so grounded with it
and was like that for me is my biggest
is like where my heart really like
yearns for them where it's like people
who are not only blind but they're like
oh they're like they're making it work
and they're like a very optimistic not
that they shouldn't be sure thing like
they're just they're just so functional
and there is something about the human
condition that's just like obviously
it's a lot easier if you were born with
it because that's all you've known so
I'm like there's no alternative but for
people that lose sight like a lot of
people say like it's really obviously
very tough at the beginning but the way
humans think about things like you sort
of eventually go back to your base line
of like what you are as a person right
whether you're an optimistic person
downtrodden person would have you and so
people eventually just normalize and
they devote you know you have to live
your life and deal with it they
persevere and it's very impressive but
that sort of gave me a little bit of a
kind of kind of a cool insight into
something that I've never really
understood definitely interesting so
thank you for explaining like I'm five
and there's been some unbelievable
advancements in that realm yeah as well
there's been some like crazy like
obviously like cochlear implants are
equivalent to that and some I like
there's like a cyber I were like you see
like digital pixels yeah there someone
was able to do like a like a very low
res reproduction about people seeing and
connect it to someone's it's like a
google glass that you wear and then it
like translates amended and you can see
a screenshot of what they're saying is
even cooler because you see ya you see
the the feed yeah and it and it looks
like like almost like
black and white version of what the
termination is right yeah I got with the
readouts but just like a very low low
resolution pixelated but like enough
that you can make stuff I mean wait 20
years Oh it'll be outrageous yeah yes
pretty great um okay before we hit the
reddit portion of the show I guess maybe
we should have used the pixels
discussion to parlay into that was a
good segue that would have been a good
segue but that's not how we play things
here in this program we jump all over
the place not at the point yet obviously
my son is only three months old you're
about he's probably about 14 weeks old
right now um but I have noticed that he
is already looking at the TV a hundred
percent like he just sees it he doesn't
realize obviously he can't comprehend
what the hell it is maybe you can I saw
that movie he was talking a lot about
the things he saw he did right right
Bruce boss except for exactly you know I
don't know uh he's drawn to it because
its a bright colorful thing or it's
moving and it's moving it's now it's
more entertaining than the ceiling fans
like his big thing for the first real
it's a pretty dope fan so he's looking
at so I'm and it got me thinking like oh
man you know we're gonna is he you know
obviously this was not something I was
not thinking about for a while uh
leading up to me becoming a father but
like yeah he's gonna play games yeah in
and maybe a couple years right yeah sure
that's that's a huge deal so how do I
approach this and I guess the biggest
thing is will he think I show him the
original mario brothers sure is he gonna
be like dad is garbage what the what am
I looking at here you know yeah now we
had a big conversation about this
yesterday on the because we were talking
about like your nostalgia from your
childhood sure you have an inflated
sense of it being way better than it
maybe was yes arm but maybe that doesn't
translate to movies as much because
there's movies from the 60s and 70s that
hold up in our job as good as they did
games are a different thing because they
rely heavily on technology they do and
you know there's an advancements in
design
stuff like that right sure this nascent
category where we where's it gonna be
Mike is he just gonna look at these
games and be like wow dad this is truly
pathetic you know I woulda said I think
probably five or six years ago I would
have said yes definitely but each day
I'm seeing more games that have like
Barry loaf I look pixelated like retro
inspired games right but there are using
that aesthetic to talk to us sure but i
think if you grow up and a lot of the
like games around on the mobile app
store whatever are those games that's
sort of like you're in road to that
right like it'll basically be like uh
you know if you're a band comes out that
mu like like when amy winehouse sure was
hit in the seen her style was a style
born out of 50 years prior yes so you
know it may be there was a sort of you
know double-headed connection where you
had people of an older generation saying
like oh man that sounds like a you know
like the do op sort of era and then the
newcomers being like oh my god this
woman has an amazing soulful old you
know sort of voice i think you're right
i think there will be sort of like a
stereo minded approach to that but
that's only with the graphics now the
the issue is with gameplay gameplay
evolves and gets better right so while a
game like mario i think is somewhat
timeless a game like ghosts and goblins
i think if you handed that to a kid
today if anyone's ever pointed it's an
arcade game you're a knight you run to
the side but the controllers are like
very stilted megaman that style game
very difficult and very like stiff and i
don't think those games will work for
this younger generation because they're
used to like this smooth like accurate
controls and I think that's frustrating
yeah it'll be I so I think the number of
games that will cross over I think a
game like super mario brothers or super
mario world is somewhat timeless like I
think it's an amazing game and doesn't
feel unfair and is incredibly well
designed and probably is what makes them
so good right you know a lot of the
Zelda games kind of feel time was too
but you know it's going to be very
selective and
just like all art forms you know the
second that 10 years has passed a very
limited number of those movies that you
loved will actually stand the test of
time you know i love the first batman i
don't think it's age that well you don't
think the 1989 batman is age too well i
think the second one has aged better i
think the first one sick really rough
yeah the fight scenes in that movie
there's a lot of pretty big eared put it
next to it when was last time you
watched it I like of four or five years
ago hmm he's not doing that well no I
was not yeah I see if it's in pieces of
it there's a lot of like miniatures in
it too said that yeah kind of takes you
out or like look at Lord of the Rings 10
years for my god lord of the rings even
now no Lord of the Rings looks like shit
now looks like garbage and that's what
I'm saying is like it looked amazing it
was the top of the line see I pic i
maintain yeah that I pointed my finger
at the movie theater screen yeah and
said this is not that good looking yeah
I'm serious also there's gonna be a
black president one year no I didn't
sell did you predict I didn't say the
Jurassic Park but I also said it during
the first spider-man yeah first buzzing
park hold up it still holds up because
it's this brilliant mix of CG and
puppets right that really but even the
Velociraptor the Stampede Sharon looks
yeah it looks good there's something
there's magic yeah the scenes where he
is running along the rooftops and
spider-man one yep it looks like and I
think to a lot of that comes from the
green screen resolution of moviemaking
which was just like everything like the
sky captain World of Tomorrow like
introduced this method of just making
the entire movie on green screen
Jurassic Park wasn't made mostly on
greens when it was shot in Hawaii so
there is a level of groundedness to it
um and obviously Lord of the Rings was
shot and wherever that his magical land
is a new zealand magical land of new
zealand but you know also kind of like
maybe a little too ambitious with the
number of people and and what they were
trying to do i it just does not age
super well don't get me wrong there's
plenty of a maid
filmmaking done in that trilogy but the
CJ does not aid the CG in return of the
king yeah specifically when Legolas
takes down that like gigantic elephant
looking thing yeah and Ollie font man
that is Ned bed he looks like this
prancing yeah he looks like the was it
the bendy fight from matrix too yes
thank you for bringing that up yeah then
barb early this the burly fight the
Smith fight yeah looks like a joke it's
like a comic joke but it looked bad when
you saw yeah and it didn't matter i'm
saying like that was noticeably bad when
we got to see it because i think people
were chewing off a little bit more than
the hue ambitious i think there's like
you're gonna look back and there's going
to be this like cinematic a blunder era
where it's like 2001 to like 06 yeah
we're like any high budget cg movie that
came out during that time yeah look
shitty then and man does it look
shitting yeah yeah and we're gonna toss
is really I get totally you're with me
and and that crazy and the flip side of
that is is star wars which is obviously
you know they are have made it very
clear that like the focus is going to be
on like traditional effects and puppets
and and that's gonna make it bed the new
Star Wars gonna be better i think i do
too um as much as i love to make fun of
JJ abrams i do think he does that stuff
kind of well yeah um man i'm sure
there's totally like a dozen more of
those films in that era that just
probably looks so stupid yeah i'm trying
to think of them if you can remember
send it over to us finally we'll take
maybe just one from the subreddit today
oh and everyone's very happy that you've
joined the show sucks i actually popped
into subreddit so if you have any
questions for me i'm happy to answer
them but people have been very kind
thanks they have been thank you for that
oh so one of the comments this week was
about rocket League which we've got
which we touched on you know anecdotally
in the show today it's it's free if you
have playstation plus on ps4 it's on
steam go play it for me it's the best
online multiplayer game I've played in a
very long time mmm three other it's it's
it's sounds like Socrates yeah it's
pretty mom it is tremendous and and if
you don't really want to play the
but you want to experience it for
yourself google rocket League gifts
because there's tons of amazing like
saves and plays that people have
captured and it's just like even before
I started playing the game I was like in
all yeah of people like being really
good at this game the game remarkably
captures like the chaotic pneus and you
know frenetic action in soccer and even
stuff like hockey where it's just like
deflections and hazy saying it's just
people chasing an orange so much is
really a lot of fun Oh be one shinobi
says are you guys watching mr. robot and
what do you think um so here's the deal
we have talked about it i think maybe
before you started yeah have you seen it
i have not watched it yet but I've heard
very very very good things yeah it's
pretty good so I enjoy it I saw the
pilot I'm actually working on getting
the creator of that show into the office
and to talk with him a little bit so
here's the deal I really do like it and
I'm going to continue watching it and I
thought the fourth episode was was
really good there was a few in between
that I was sort of like all right what's
going on there seemed for me right now
there is this one potential plot point
that I feel like they're not hiding very
well that I've figured out okay sure and
I can't tell if they're like if they
want me to figure this and they're gonna
like Pola and then they're gonna twist
it or they're just doing a terrible job
so i'm not sure where that's at right
now there's an episode two nights ago
that i gotta catch up on ok either way
it's a great pilot yeah pilots gonna
suck in uh watch the show ok it's it's
very there's there's if it look it's
shot like a fight club sort of you know
you this guy has this like angsty sort
of feeling about the internet and the
world is a hat it's for it's a lot of
fun yeah and it's totally out of USA
network's wheelhouse tier which is like
but arguably the most the best part
about it was just like previously on
blue blood
on that note and then they're like you
know drugs and hackers and as like more
FX yeah totally totally I I do I did
notice i was looking at on my my guide
on my cable guide and i did notice the
episode titles are actually file name
file names but i really like it's pretty
great a touch pretty great stuff there's
and there's a lot of like hidden little
easter eggs in there it's a lot of fun
if you're even in the least bit
interested in the underworld of hacking
and computer espionage watch this
program it's it's it's shot very well as
well and the performances are pretty
good all right there you have it oh
another one in the books 866 404 seen it
is the number i think there was a block
on the voicemails i fixed that of course
right us in the 404 at cnet com or if

almost guaranteed to be touched upon in
