for tuning in to the 404 show live or
on-demand on Sina TV I'm Jeff Bakalar
I'm Bridget Carey and I'm Justin you and
this is the show where look what you did
you little jerk very good really channel
Kevin mcalister's uncle really well man
oh man oh man like an 80's and 90's
movie binge lately yeah what did the
original home alone come out I was like
early night I think it was nineteen
ninety want to say or 89 may be right I
don't even know but forward to hope wait
there's already a home alone for right I
believe yeah unfortunately I was a fair
was yeah I know separate kid than what
home alone no home three was definitely
a separate kid right then McCauley cold
homeland for was a new kid it was just
some guy yeah I guess this is like a
straight to video movie there's plenty
more 80's and 90's movie talk coming on
today's program bridget carey joins us
Thank You Bridget for being here excited
as ever how are you good yeah what's new
and they'll in the land of Bridget well
um you went to South by Southwest I did
I just got back from that and you
survived the sickness yeah what'd you do
yeah I was sick during it all too yeah I
promise to keep all my coffee too
laughter so you won't I'll mask no good
have you ever been to Austin before no I
was your experience like um you know I
guess I only got to be there for a
little while and be being kind of a head
cold I was just kind of like this is
crazy yeah these people are just really
enthusiastic yeah they talk about their
big dreams and then I have a start-up
everyone's gotta start yeah you know
what is thought that was funny was that
everyone always talked about oh there's
always a big app that gets talked about
things and it was these people finding
apps these apps like highlight that let
you know who's near you hmm it was so
silly i downloaded all them i would get
alerts like hey Steve Case of AOL Fame
you know with is next to you and you
both like the killers and on my uh I
think I shall start a conversation now
you don't decide what it's going for
that maybe you should go thank people
when you're in such a big event like
that no you get told ever
ones near because they're all using it
and it doesn't really become helpful but
some people said you know we talked to
people they're like oh actually you know
networked with the guy who was in my
hotel room and I did get messages from
people who are like I haven't seen you
in a while I just don't answer that's
funny when you're that connected to
people around you it's basically just
telling you there are people that exist
you're living around you you might want
to have a conversation someday with them
that's money that is so there's like a
false sense of closeness I feel like I
South by Southwest mm-hmm right it's
just sort of like a fake existence yeah
look at that little microcosm everyone
just kind of pumps up their own egos
yeah so was there a standout app this
year I mean Twitter was obviously the
big big thing that launched yeah myself
highlight that was it but I think it
flopped I think at the end we started
talking people they were like um yeah I
downloaded it and then I deleted it yeah
um I don't know if I or ask when are you
gonna use it again later I don't really
know probably not as soon as I leave
Texas yeah delete it off the phone yeah
we did run into johnny Knoxville oh yeah
we tried ask him about apps and he's
like I have like lots of apps I used to
okay thanks Johnny thanks Johnny little
too many a few too many shots at the
head maybe talk about this story that is
definitely a worrisome headline perilee
companies are beginning to ask for your
facebook passwords for future employees
this is just like like one that really
is being reported on I wouldn't say it's
a big trend but it's horrible and it's a
violation i think to get that yours nasa
t well i mean actually there are legal
laws i mean when you are going in
interview they can't ask you certain
things so this is their way of possibly
judging you whether or not you have a
kid or not or what or how old you are
what can we hang out with that's and and
they said oh well no one you know who's
applied has actually denied it that we
we don't you know they can deny it if
they want but i think it's a good judge
of character no we're in a recession and
people need a job and they're really the
kind of sacrifice that I think it's
different though if they friends you and
you can control what's being said that's
another story yeah I also think it's
different if you already are hired and
the company has a policy about how much
you can put online because you represent
the company right then it's just a
matter of okay you represent seen it or
whatever
it is then just keep it private and you
know don't be idiot right it's sort of
like uh and I have a few friends who are
teachers and it's sort of like they have
a very strict code of conduct when it
comes to Facebook right all my friends
or teachers don't even have facebook
profiles because it's just too dangerous
but the story that is going on in this
article from The Telegraph talks about
this guy who had just gone on interview
and was answering character questions
this is in the interview for a
consultancy job at a lobbying firm the
interviewer turned her computer to
search for his Facebook page but when
she could not pull up his private
profile she turned back and ask him to
hand over his login information do you
spit at that person like that my
knee-jerk reaction would have been to
tell her to go efforts oh yeah Bridget
brings up a good point if it if it's
means that you won't get the job and I'm
not working they're not working that's
not worth it it's not about adding the
HR person as a friend and letting them
sit through your public / like Bridget
said then you give him like super
limited access or whatever it is it's
the same thing that you represent
yourself in public you know represent
yourself on your profile that way I'm
sure a select group of people probably
see a lot more than like I have like 10
people who can see everything you know
yeah but exactly and you that's the
thing and I still to this day think
Facebook is does not make it easy enough
to control that no headache I know the
the privacy settings are there but it
it's not as intuitive as it should be
yeah and it at times it feels like they
are deliberately vague with their
privacy let me take a different stance
on this I think that the people in this
room right now if I look through your
facebook profile you got your access
information really yeah i was gonna say
i don't think that is really shattered
do you really own yeah i don't think
that i could pull up anything on your
personal profiles all that but we're
smarter about it cuz we're we're so
ingrained in that friday like if
somebody offered me a hundred fifty
thousand dollars right now to look at my
facebook profile from the inside out
i'll give it to him the only nothing
there i keep all that junk i would do
anything four hundred not saying that i
don't have stuff online about my
yeah there is a reasonable expectation
that you can go party and there's
something wrong with having a party
picture you just wonder why are they
judging you not to have a job because of
that oh yeah then it becomes like
legally weird you're absolutely right
you know we don't we don't even take a
step back and be like okay so you want
the axis well what are you hoping to
find yeah well what are you scared you
might find they said in the story oh
it's in case they have inappropriate
child images or or your friends with
mine while we leave that up to Facebook
right then patron police that situation
I mean I don't know and who in their
right mind goes on on an interview
knowing when all this terrible
information is is out on the Internet
yeah I feel like the only people that
would be worried about sifting through a
profile would be underage minors
drinking that have photos of themselves
drinking on facebook exactly don't do
anything that you wouldn't want to be
profiled oh so you don't get hired at
the snack bar at the pool club exactly
what's gonna happen just go to gap like
the rest of us didn't we use that were
you work yeah I did you worked at the
gap well worked in the stock room at the
gap yeah what's worse rather you really
interact nothing sweaters yeah exactly I
mean come on I was running Jean folding
seminars all day mom all jobs are the
best though cuz then you go hang on the
food court I worked at the mall one
weird looks jazz gig like books are fun
yeah gap us but you always had to be on
those rambunctious teens put in the you
know the naughty books by the Curious
George section that's Rosie it was
around the Kama Sutra stuff but always
being oh and guys what you want to do
tonight oh I don't know we could do
anything but you wanted we should go to
Walden boats air horn next to the
Curious George novels are they still in
business sadly no that said yeah the
Dalton I think it's going to the bees
Alton's gone and what was the other one
there was no more Barnes &amp;amp; Noble they're
pretty much on their way out too huh uh
yeah that said I'm trapped where did you
ever work in a mall I always like
hearing about people's moja no i didn't
i worked as a custodian in high school
at an elementary
that's not what I expected you guys are
photos of that on facebook there's
photos on Facebook ok it was a good job
for high school yeah interesting it's
like when the kindergarten kids yak yeah
that's a clean up a lot of Yonkers a lot
of puke did you know I guess it could be
worth there's an elementary school yeah
Elementary okay I did wow I didn't know
that Oh what were you how'd you get a
good school yeah he was after school you
go after school and clean up the
appearance kids which is crap and puke
all over the river that about Layla yeah
yeah sounds about right I worked at a
pharmacy growing up in high school this
is all very revealing yeah yeah but it
does say about us a pharmacy I mean it's
not like when you know just why had
access I didn't have access to drugs or
anything like that but you did it super
illegal that's like a felony right I
don't access to a lot of naughty stuff
lottery the lottery machines the you
know all these cigarettes rightness
danger danger zone there right I know
when I enter and pharmaceuticals were
you saying but when I had to check out
people who were buying playboys I was I
was not 18 yet I was 17 but um I was
supposed to let a manager come over
there like yeah it's okay you know yeah
and then these burly men who are clearly
45 and 50 wearing biker gear I'm like
can I see your ID I was always so like
and the major Blake listen you know you
don't have to be such a nurse you don't
have to be such a nerd let the biker
have his playboy it's kind of a tame
pornography for a biker though yeah
whatever maybe I'm just like everybody
remember that's pretty funny creepy
learn a lot about people's rights or
yeah yeah mmm let's move on talk about
samsung and rim in the news apparently
they're being sued for infringing on
emoticon patents I didn't even then we
talked about this last week how it was
like impossible to copyright right
modicon but apparently that is actually
happening this is the quote from the
from the
in the infringement lawsuit emoticon
input method and apparatus yet so this
isn't actually the emoticons themselves
right asleep didn't yeah right like I
guess people were complaining that it's
a really difficult to type in a
semicolon and then a parenthesis for a
little too much work so yeah basically
this company back in two thousand seven
I believe they made a patent for the
menu that comes up you know like on your
iPhone your Android right and you can
just select whatever smiley face you
want right kissy face yeah or whatever
erotic on you want right now the
plaintiff company is very a holdings and
they claim they own the concept right of
allowing users to choose emoticons from
a menu of options like I said rather
than typing them out manually yeah you
it's really ironic about this story
though is that Samsung tried to pull
this same patent lawsuit on Apple last
year but it got thrown out this was in
October of twenty levin we actually
talked about on the show back and listen
to the salmon and that got thrown out
it's like it's very cyclical how these
companies keep doing it and why would
this company think that things would
change this time around is really
strange question sumall man to everyone
so freaking sooo happy lately yeah you
know it's enough god forbid you come up
with the you know your own better idea
yeah and that's how you been on the
battlefield we need to start making our
own patents for what I don't know you
just want to like have you know the
foresight to invent penza me we should
patent the idea of or we should
copyright the idea of reversing the
names and locations of our voicemail
calls right because that's something
that's very intrinsic to our show I mean
and finally one day we'll really be able
to cash in on that yeah because there's
value that yet asked Apple back in the
damn she can happen seriously watch they
somehow turn it into the next I betters
on the enzyme Lou okay interesting story
uh off of MSNBC ya know a little wacky
stories to talk about wait I would
expect nothing less he wanted to talk
about that too I'm Lucas in the rundown
but I wasn't sure if you wanted to
actually broach the subject yeah based
on Bridget I cleared it with Bridget did
you really I did yea what did he really
I did I gave it the leading lady the
lady like nod
so please humorous Justin talking uh sir
geoff linked me to this really
interesting story this morning I don't
know what while he found it but uh
there's been reports that more and more
women are finding themselves
experiencing sexual pleasure at the gym
what yeah they're not hi Jenna you got
your Bridget sugar it's not my gym not
my Savior I just got a gym membership I
like to know what I know I just wallow
in the morning bridgen will have what
they're having yeah what kind of lifted
cold machine are they on yeah this is
funny so ya know I read a little bit of
it because it did pique my curiosity of
course why wouldn't ya ya Indiana
University just add it online survey
drag I'm when the people actually
responded yes I'm quite embarrassed very
small sample size this is 246 man but a
good portion of them did experience
certain things let me run down this list
is really funny so about forty five
percent said uh their first orgasm at
the gym was due to an abdominal exercise
um that like an abdominal crunch
basically right and this is over
multiple sessions this isn't like one
crunch does it for you you know this is
over like a half hour something it's
just amazing yeah yeah percentage of
these 246 women yeah so nineteen percent
linked it to biking you know like the
spinning suddenly the engine my wife
because she's been going to the gym oh
hot lately yeah you're not shoes Mitch
you're just working out she's cheating
on me with a bicycle nine point three
percent linked it to climbing poles or
ropes hey guys yeah okay go ahead that
again nine point three percent linked it
to climbing poles or ropes people get
this online survey and laughing and
recycle i think that is are just a lot
of pole polishing going on there's not
there's nothing to infer there no I mean
it's as plain as day right it's wait
what does that mean there's like poll
extra seat from those first three I
would assume that may be the direct
contact of like the seat or the pole or
maybe like you know mean like whatever
partner using to hold your feet while
you're doing ab crunches you know like I
was gonna say that but then there
other segments that says seven percent
link their orgasms to running really
running man maybe there's no contact you
know woman sounds awesome because
apparently it is the meridians are just
was that a confirmation a verbal conical
being no but I really am surprised that
as to hell let's leave it at this
vulnerable to pleasure you know you know
you know it's mimoun are wired like
crazy people yeah okay yeah so I could
have told you that yeah yeah so and
that's common knowledge she don't even
understand you know like just half the
things that right right so so there you
go so free so hey this should come as no
surprise then but this is the weirdest
thing there's like the women's survey
that said they did have orgasms at the
gym said they were not experiencing any
kind of sexual fantasy or even thinking
about someone they were attracted to so
they didn't have sex on the brain when
it happened it was just an involuntary
physical reaction I mean it sounds like
them it's amazing yeah sounds amazing to
me what I also don't understand is how
uh it just like sort of have like has
happened I know where yeah and I
remember watching some sort of program
it wasn't like a Jerry Springer it was
something legit energy and they were
interviewing these women who combining
do it on command yeah maybe like just
have one right I was like but why and
that's not always a good thing to their
I remember seeing one interview with a
woman that would just have 40 50 orgasms
a day yet involved she's like I'm a
judge yeah it just worked out for me
yeah just ruins my day every day
something like that right I'm a janitor
yes nothing yeah it's unbelievable I
take one look at Richard it's over right
happen to me when I was a jam with the
mob Richard Richard King you can
you still oh dear oh dear oh I'm curious
to know if this could happen to a man
and do you think it's possible because
it doesn't the study makes no mention of
men having Spontini no I think women are
many SS that's here they're blessed with
this amazing sensitivity that I think
it's very few women but oh yeah but the
such a small sample size and I've heard
of people when they when they have such
a powerful dream I don't know how true
that stuff no that's you know definitely
happened no no but I'm saying it's in
your mind for sure you know yeah I guess
huh we gotta get to the bottom of this
no but it didn't but it is we really
need to figure out what let's go to the
gym after this Indian I would like women
to call our show yeah and I for get all
12 of you that listen yeah call us up if
you go to the gym let us know be honest
about the world adults here we can talk
about this yeah we can giggle we can
giggle at pol happen exercises really I
think that that made the article yeah
all right we'll take a break rule that's
why couples should maybe exercise
together you know it'd be a good growth
experience or surely you learn a lot
about yourself when you're in the gym
apparently we'll take a break when we
come back much more with Bridget Carey
on this very now interesting episode of
the 404 we'll be right back this is the
404 Mr effers the show where we all sing
songs you swim and rush are you swimming
in all this water huh he's swearing
little buddy
you
welcome back to the 404 that's that's
the doggy paddle right the doggy voice
right like no woman can resist doing
that voice yeah I see a dog like no man
either know how you talked to a dog man
check out the video today in our break
adorable pets I mean I'm sorry right
dogs just do it for me they do we're
going through a very wide range of
emotions on the other day right I'm
disgusted I'm learning things about you
guys Lance spin around very aroused
right now a little bit of everything a
little bit for everybody Oh angry you're
angry we can pissed well I'm angry too
and I'll tell you why yeah yesterday we
talked about Michael Bay's evil plot to
destroy everyone's childhood memory
known as the Teenage Mutant Ninja
Turtles um and you know I just I I was
really surprised to hear the internet
went crazy yesterday over this news yeah
we actually also got a call regarding
the etymology the origin getting our
facts straight about teenage mutant
ninja turtles and then our buddy Jamie
who everyone knows when they hear when
we do calls in the public road us in and
said hey dude you guys were right it
truly is the quote raping of your
childhood because former Teenage Mutant
Ninja Turtles actor is accusing the guy
who did Michelangelo right the voice
actor from the cartoon robbie rist who
voiced michelangelo correct Bridget says
quote this is crazy because he's really
upset he's really upset about this all
right he claims that Michael Bay is
quote sodomizing the franchise with his
upcoming movie he says and then everyone
knows Michael Bay's plan is to have the
ninja turtles come from a space aliens
mr. wrist says quote I know believing in
mutated talking Turtles is kind of silly
to begin with but am I supposed to
believe that via that there are ninjas
from another planet that is a little
crazy mean come on let's suspend our
disbelief only so much
and he says quote the rape of our
childhood memories continues he wrote
this letter he wrote a letter to michael
bay saying all of this you know i was
amazing i would actually believe uh the
fact that you know turtles from japan
that were taught kung fu yeah and then
mutated into real life to let's at least
sort of believable but why would aliens
come down and take the form of ninjas
from japan and then also learn to talk
look like turtles at the same time
there's lizza make sense literally all
four names in TMNT teenage ok that's an
american thing because that's like earth
I think that's exclusive to earth right
because we have a certain like a housing
system right there be all jury on okay
you kidding mutant right because they
touch the ooze in the sewer right ninja
because that's also an oriental you it's
an earth thing we got a ninja's here and
then turtles another great geological
life collusive to earth may put most
likely yeah my heart rate is actually
getting up I'm a really big Ninja Turtle
fan I mean Michelangelo came to my six
year old birthday party hell yeah he did
just so you know yes you know time out
of his busy nunchuck wielding schedule
that make an appearance exactly it
really is ridiculous and we have a call
I want to play regarding and we talked
about Ninja Turtle or yesterday and how
you know Michael Bay wants to completely
just turn it upside down but let's get
our facts straight before we go any
further here okay this is a new york
city new york from justin's kind my
first call anyway yesterday you guys
were talking about the turtles and your
kind getting mixed up on some of the
fine details of the origin this is a
huge thing in the turtles community I'm
a very much a younger fan but even I've
done my homework the original 1984
Eastman and Laird teenage mutant ninja
turtles cartoon had the origin of the
turtles as being mutated by the ooze and
there Master Splinter being the pet of a
martial arts master hamato yoshi and the
shredder was his arch-nemesis because
Yoshi killed his brother no that's why
he followed him to New York in America
and murdered him and then splintered was
mutated and became more intelligent and
taught the turtles martial arts now the
big deal with the animated series was
the
version of the turtles that mainstream
fans got to know was that they changed
the origin story to make combine the
characters of splinter and Yoshi into
one person who is a man who got turned
into a man-sized rat but a bigger deal
with the cartoon was the cartoon in
order to make it suitable for children
was heavily changed in the origin to the
original comic book turtles were
nitty-gritty dark and very very violent
back in the first issue they killed the
shredder in a better mood away there are
a lot of people don't like the cartoon
because it was so kid-friendly but
you're right the first issue date right
over the first has is brutal there is a
very minor character that's like Batman
get rid of Joker right in the now as you
know me time yeah well that's amazing I
I knew that I knew that the turtle and I
think that came across a little more in
the movie that won that first movie is
not necessarily a kids movie yeah it's
pretty dark well yeah they Democrats in
the second one too with uh Casey Jones
right yeah although that was a first
yeah memory they get to present they go
to that country home yeah they feel so
much badical yes like we're you know
then they take mushrooms do you have
that weird Siberia better than fire or
they see splitter in the fire yeah they
trip at the cabin trip balls in the
movie did okay so let's let's let's make
sure of one thing so the night so the
movie sounds like it takes the comic
book much closer to reality right right
so it sounds like that's what the with
the cases so I think we got our facts
straight now I kind of want Michael Bay
to do more of that those make the ninja
turtle is a really dark movie ain't
gonna happen it really I would what so
they're aliens and now they're all emo
understand I'll stick about this to it
the concept of aliens isn't foreign to
the turtles Laurie they're right like
praying and all the neutrinos in the
cartoon all came from outer space okay
right there is a space elevator yeah
yeah watch it's the best movie ever yeah
there's no way no don't call a ninja
turtle at transformers yeah look at it
exactly just hurting you just hurt my
heart you are it's yeah you have a stake
true to the core if you want to have a
little fun have a little fun
personalities right and bring bebop and
Rocksteady back know that token raised
our bull crap I remind those guys yeah
those were supposed to sort of be bebop
and
yes you know to me yeah they worry about
that to a tease yeah yeah pink mohawk
he'd like a fast if I came from a kid in
play concert it was a little ridiculous
yeah speaking of our childhood once
again being pushed in the corner and
just being beaten up merciless it's
terrible yeah Jurassic Park is coming
back and in 3d arm III mean I don't know
how to bridge it how do you feel about
doing this stuff too it's like almost 20
years ago Jurassic Park is was made so
basically they don't want to just make
more money off the same movie but charge
you twice the ticket price for the same
movie yeah which is crazy to this is and
now don't forget if we're taking this to
heart Jurassic Park 3d will be hitting
theaters July 19 2013 that's like that's
almost a year and a half from now yeah I
mean Star Wars I'm used to that
happening cuz the camry releasing it
before and i write it again and right
now it's like okay is this something you
would want to go see though I just it's
not something that I want to but I will
you're gonna get one I'll of Jurassic
Park too and I do think you know just
thinking about it from memory there are
a bunch of scenes that would really work
well in three days isn't he did this to
at 3d and beauty and the beast and these
cartoons that were any idea but I think
it's always meant you know I think it's
easier to convert cartoons into 3d and
post they're gonna have to go frame by
frame scene by scene in jurassic park
and turn that into 3d i'm not sure it's
cool i guess the only seen worth seen is
that objects in mirror are closer than
they there you go that's like the
ultimate sort of yeah iconic scene that
her generally go see it i mean i just
don't know if kids today would be as
afraid of it as they were as i was about
their new years old you know scaring
away it's scary because it uh because it
everything's puppets you know i mean
like there's very only a few scenes
where its computer generate right um and
I think that's why that movie works so
well I'm so realistic right I mean when
they even when that first scene when
they see the sick Triceratops right and
it's clearly just like an animatronic
you know little thing there right
there's something about it that just
really blows you
yeah and then John Hammond does really I
was really upset with that guy he look
like Santa Claus and he got it the end
he did sort of resemble the colonel yeah
but you know who serve God uh what else
is I I just want to watch Jeff Goldblum
I'll be honest anything that comes out
of his mouth well skullbuster yeah must
go faster hahaha really well played uh
let's get to some calls from the public
proper before we head out time to show
the love a jig 6404 scenic alright first
call from the public on bridge you could
definitely speak to this talking about
mass effect 3 the controversy over the
ending and whether or not Bioware is
actually considering changing the ending
hey what's up for for Atlanta from in
doral um someone talk about mass effect
3 4 2nd I was one of the few people who
thought that anything just sucked
compared to the other two games but I
didn't like the facebook page and irie
don't care violent change their ending
but I do feel that fans have a right to
protest if they they want in and change
them as if I were dozens le cool but
whatever I don't know man I mean I'm
okay with uh what Andrew said about you
know he's okay with it even though he
doesn't like it but it's like well I
mean get a life guys they had that
charity that was to raise money just to
get Bioware's attention to they may
change it ending seventy thousand
dollars um has been raised it continues
to go up that was a pretty grand it was
like 76 this morning I mean guys
seriously get some real freakin problems
in your life you know what he means yeah
there are kids in Uganda had to kill her
it's just like I know and now what like
the official statement from Mass Effect
3 on their Facebook pages we're taking
it all in very we're taking it seriously
and you divide dinner and we have it man
I was gonna say we haven't made an
official decision yet no no they just
I'm sure they'll find another way to
take all these fans money
if you want do use the money to fund a
DLC project but don't change the ending
don't let a bunch of angry nerds with
money in their pockets right forth like
people protesting the end of the dark
knight and going to christopher nolan
being like all all change the batman and
a i can't sleep at night gets over get a
life and get some real effing problems
yeah i can't protest the matrix yeah
maybe we should go back and do that if
the Wachowski brother or brother and
sister one of you know go back and
revisit the ending to the matrix trilogy
right do that because that sucks I'll
just redo the entire trilogy or how
about pave so that no one will ever
remember revolutions in Revelation how
come no one's protesting 3d Phantom
Menace right now thank you that's a no
let's take the 70 grand in s Steven
Spielberg not to do 3d Jurassic Park the
70 Delta the grand is going to a charity
guys don't go your butt's going to check
take it away one chair you want charity
we're giving I'm telling you man yeah
it's too much I just started playing
mass effect one yeah and that's I want
to protest on how hard that stupid rover
is tender getting that didn't see oh man
man mass effect one leaves a bad taste
in your mouth a bad initial impressions
I'm like oh the bending so bad I can't
just give up right now yeah take the 70
grand away from the charity and go back
and fix the opening scene to Mass Effect
one about that buckets or protest as
long as we're on the protesting binge ah
here is tony from Nevada speaking about
the FAA's decision to revisit
electronics hey guys it's Nevada from
Tony calling regarding using devices on
airplanes I really find it laughable
that they make you turn off your devices
when their plane is next to the airport
there's thousands of people using these
very conceivable device in there but the
plane is able to back up and get into
the air being in in near those buildings
and then as you take off
you get into the air that I to makes a
good point it's like okay you're on the
runway especially know what are you yang
about now I'm just ended there might be
room for like a smaller electromagnetic
field ablaze directly I'm just
speculating yeah and the ghosts of
airport s we're gonna interrupt I don't
know how long cellular signals effect
get Rebecca he's really not a big enough
risk because if there was they would not
allow anyone in an airport to have a
phone you're claiming laziness on behalf
of the end i figure i think it's just as
a sense of control a false sense of
control that they sort of want over the
passengers maybe they want you to pay
attention to your right instructions
they give for the for sure measures in
the beginning that's gotta be a
significant element to the whole
equation right I'm I'm okay with
shutting off the cell phone it makes you
feel a little bit better about it I mean
yeah I I can see if you're liking that
seat really close to the cockpit and
then you gotta make the exception for
everyone all the way back right you're
you're hundreds and right if some you
know bozo in row 1 1st class is yappin
on his phone and the freaking pilot can
hear through those doors and you're like
also if our I come in row 1 why how come
people in row 6 can use their phone
you're right that's what it is it's just
a sort of blanket you know ruling across
the entire plane where it's like look
none of you morons are going to be able
to talk on your phone for the first 15
minutes until we get this sucker about
30,000 yeah you have iPads in the
cockpit anyway that's your and they're
using them so that everyone does to
everyone just pretend that they're
plugging their headphones into the jack
on the side arm rest is that we actually
have an ipod hit in her thigh that their
plugins are sure i could see it everyone
does that the dude sitting next to me on
the way to dominican yeah did not turn
off his thing the whole time yeah i
didn't care because it wasn't bothering
anybody but you do have a civic duty to
police yourselves on the plane you
didn't say anything you were like
internet gravel know his ipod shuffle is
not taking this plane down yeah it's a
total myth and the Mythbusters I believe
did have an episode where they put this
theory into practice and proved it and
DN debunked it and it's just nonsense
stop thinking about the electronic
implications
ramifications just think about it as a
as a means of common courtesy to get
this plane safely off the ground right
and I have anyone being yelling and
yapping on their phones but yep yep Bob
we're flying right now we're going up we
just took off Thomas easily be well I'm
gonna lose you I'm gonna lose you I'm
gonna lose you lose you know it's just
ridiculous what would I think what got
me was it the FAA said listen if we're
going to allow an ipad we gotta test
every single version of every single
product made in a soul in a flight
without passengers on it and that's
expensive nothing don't they have some
controlled area where they're testing
like the avionics you know and all the
equipment that they could just do that
without having to set of pulling up
every time yes you're right no no isn't
there some sort of simulation center
actly where they can you know practices
