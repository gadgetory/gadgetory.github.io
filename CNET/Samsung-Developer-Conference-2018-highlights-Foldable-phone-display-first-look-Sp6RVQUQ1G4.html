and CEO head of IT and mobile
communications DJ comb
morning today we stand at the beginning
of a new era of discovery and invention
a time not just of connected thinking
but of connected living a time when
intelligent services connect people to
the tools they need and experiences they
desire during the past year we built the
world's most comprehensive open IOT
platform we delivered AI innovations
that are redefining connectivity to tell
you more it is my pleasure to introduce
my colleague yes John
if you were here last year you heard us
talk about how bigsby helped you get
things done quickly with fewer tabs
swipes and steps and today our vision
and ambition for Bixby is much bigger we
believe it is much more than a simple
voice assistant and that is why we are
deeply committed to AI working
continuously to advance our AI vision
and technology amoled edge and infinity
display our breakthroughs have set the
tone for the industry and not only that
they've led to entirely new ways of how
folks are using their smartphone we've
turned the industry upside down in the
past and we're about to do it again
today I'm so excited about our next
breakthrough the foldable display and to
tell you more about it here's Justin
Dennison
it makes me proud when I think of all
the industry-leading displays we've
brought to market each one was an
important improvement on what's come
before and this helped people all around
the world experience something entirely
new well today we're taking our
innovation and mobile to the next level
and I'm honored to share with you our
vision for a new generation of smart
phones ladies and gentlemen I give you
the future of mobile display technology
the infinity flex display
Wow today is a big milestone and I'm
sure you're all wondering what it looks
like in real life and how it works well
wonder no more it's finally here when
it's open it's a tablet offering a
big-screen experience thank you it's
gorgeous when closed it's a phone that
fits neatly inside your pocket thank you
now of course I'd get in trouble if I
showed you everything today so we've
disguised the elements of the design but
trust me there's a device inside here
and it is stunning the Infinity flex
display represents an entirely new
mobile platform to help you browse watch
connect and multitask like never before
the Infinity flex display is the
foundation for the smartphone of
tomorrow to build it we had to invent
new materials throw out old assumptions
and reimagine the display from the
ground up and the Samsung when we say
reimagine what we mean actually
designing something new we rethought the
anatomy of a smartphone display
including the underlying display
components as well as the cover window
which is the top layer of solid glass
and you know glass is the popular choice
for the cover window because it protects
the rest of the display and it looks
beautiful but it's inherently inflexible
so we had to replace it with something
that has the same benefits yet achieved
something new we had to invent a new
protective layer in this case an
advanced composite polymer that's both
flexible and tough the next challenge we
faced was that until now displays have
been static meaning once we combine all
the component layers they never had to
move now that's all changed as the
Infinity flex display has been designed
to be folded and unfolded repeatedly
without any degradation to do this we
had to find a new kind of malleable
adhesive that allows us to laminate the
display layers together securely while
enabling them to flex well we did it
making this new display flexible and
durable enough to be folded hundreds of
thousands of times
then we hit our final and perhaps
biggest challenge
because for this display to be foldable
we had to make it thinner than any other
mobile display we've ever made in this
case we have the opportunity to reduce
the thickness of the polarizer which is
an essential layer that filters external
light reducing glare so that you can
read the display and to solve this we
created a new polarizer
that's 45% thinner and we're not
stopping there
our innovation pipeline includes new
technologies such as rollable and even
stretchable displays what you're seeing
today is the result of the most talented
engineers and designers in the world
making incredible breakthroughs to
create something amazing for you and
this isn't just a concept the
breakthroughs we've made and display
materials have been matched by
breakthroughs in manufacturing as a
result we'll be ready to start mass
production in the coming months thank
you thank you
and what's even more exciting is how
this technology will empower our
developers and consumers to do amazing
things it's a blank canvas for us to
create something beautiful together one
UI works through two displays when the
device is closed you have all the
benefits of a normal smartphone the
cover display is a fully functioning
touch stream that allows you to use your
apps without opening the device and if
you want a bigger screen you simply
unfold it to reveal the full 7.3 inch
display and with app continuity the app
you were using when the device was
closed is right there waiting for you
when it's open it's an intuitive
continuous experience between the cover
display and the main display in addition
we're giving people the ability to run
up to three apps simultaneously no
swapping between apps no closing one app
to get to another just multitasking as
it was meant to be we call it multi
active window thank you it's what you've
seen today has covered new display
technologies new form factors new
platforms and totally new ways of using
a mobile device as developers and
creators we hope that this has sparked
your imagination about how we can bring
about a new era of mobile technology one
UI is simple and easy to use
with a compelling design language the
foundation of our design approach is
their hardware and software must work
together in perfect harmony the rounded
corner of our hardware are echoed in our
software this is reflected in our our
icons which have been simplified to help
you easily recognize and understand what
each one is we've taken a new approach
to presenting both
content and controls because we want the
eyes to be drawn to what matters rather
than this is distracted by things that
don't all the important information you
need is within this floating on screen
blocks which is contrasted against the
blank space behind them first we
improved the user experience by making
it easier to focus on the task at hand
with one UI the options on the setting
menu has been rearranged to grip
relative functions together this helps
you to find what they're looking for
straight away we've also regrouped the
functions so the most often ones come
first it's a continuous and fluid
experience where the necessary buttons
appear when you need them and gently
disappear when you don't for instance
when you're dialing a number the UI
changes accordingly the search bar and
menu tabs disappear that's because we
know the user plans to make a call we
made a fundamental change in the user
interface with one UI we have
restructured the way we interact with
our devices now the upper part of the
screen is for viewing while the lower
part of the screen is for touch
interaction when UI places everything
you need to see where it's easy to reach
it just feels much more natural to use
to reach the buttons at the bottom you
had to cover the distance from one
corner to the other now we've moved the
tab to the bottom of the screen so they
are easily accessible for your thumb
last year we introduced night mode in
Samsung internet ad as a way to offer a
more comfortable reading experience when
it's dark consumer told us how much they
loved it and that's why we have now
applied it across one new eye speaking
of colors
we are offering something totally unique
within 1ui a range of color do you
exhume them match the color of hardware
itself now your device seamlessly
reflects your preferences and style by
listening to our consumers we are
providing a user experience of a whole
helping users focus on the task at hand
interact more naturally with the device
and providing a more comfortable visual
experience</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
