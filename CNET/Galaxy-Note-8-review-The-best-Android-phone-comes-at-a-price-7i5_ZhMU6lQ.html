feature packed phone and its first phone
ever to have two cameras on the back
that plus the S Pen Stylus tucked into
the phone give power users a distinct
advantage over phones like the galaxy s
8 but it's also Samsung's most expensive
phone is it worth shelling out for this
instead of the galaxy s 8 or s 8 plus
the LG v 30 or the next iPhone or Google
pixel well that's what we're here to
find out starting with these two cameras
on the back the dual 12 megapixel camera
setup snaps all of those fancy depth
effect photos your friends have been
doing on the iPhone 7 plus and you know
what on the whole they're pretty good as
a bonus you can adjust the blur
intensity before you take a shot or even
after in addition to seeing your
portrait the note 8 can also save a
wide-angle version of the same picture
so it's like getting two pics for the
price of one
both those camera lenses on the back
have optical image stabilization and
that's gonna help keep your videos from
shaking badly even if you're on the move
and for your selfies there is an 8
megapixel camera on the front
the other thing that makes the note 8
stand out is the s-pen I really like the
convenience of having a stylus for
example being able to quickly jot down
wine tasting notes came in handy at the
Half Moon Bay wine and cheese company
the S Pen will also easily open
shortcuts from any app open a quick note
from any screen and then stash it away
is a floating bubble that you can come
back to later
you can even right up to 100 pages of
notes from the lockscreen and then pin
it there so you can go back and read
them without having to unlock your phone
one of my favorite features is the new
eraser function which makes it a heck of
a lot easier to get rid of all your
groups all the messy writing is gone the
S Pen lets you write all over the screen
preview your photos take screenshots of
what you actually want to highlight and
not the whole screen and you can also
make animated gifs from videos or from
photos and messages you create yourself
and then share them with your friends
and the rest of the phone the note 8
gives you a bright brilliant screen
there are shortcuts in the edge menu to
quickly call friends and open apps and
an enhanced split-screen mode that can
open two apps at once
there's the Bixby software that lets you
control your phone with your voice you
have wireless charging the
state-of-the-art processor and the phone
is water-resistant even the S Pen what's
not so good is the fingerprint reader
placement which is all the way on the
back and off to the side you could also
use the iris scanner on the front but
that doesn't always work on the first
try either sometimes it's just faster to
use a pattern or pin okay pause but
you're dying to ask is how's the battery
and is it going to explode like last
year's Galaxy Note 7 to be honest with
you I don't know but we do know that
Samsung has put it through advanced
testing just like the Galaxy s8 and si+
and there haven't been any incidences
with those phones at least reported yet
I do know that the phone has gotten warm
but not dangerously hot and not hotter
than any other phones so fingers crossed
the note 8 is certainly a great phone
but is it worth all that cash well it
depends if you have a note 5 or had to
return your note 7 then yes splurge for
the top-of-the-line features and all the
extras that only that S Pen can bring
but if you're not chomping at the bit to
take artsy portraits the cheaper s8
phones have all the same core features
without that second camera in stylus the
no-date can pretty much do it all but
unless you're planning to actually do it
all there are plenty of other top-rate
phones to choose from
