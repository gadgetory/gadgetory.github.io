today we're talking about the samsung
motion sink bagless upright vacuum with
fully detachable handheld so this $450
vacuum is really trying to compete with
the Dyson's the more high-end models
that you see out there as far as design
at first glance it's just kind of a
boring vacuum but when you start looking
at the details it's actually kind of
weirdly configured I like that it has
the detachable handheld but it has this
weird dustbin kind of sticking out at an
awkward angle the wheels are big and
kind of strange overall just kind of an
odd look and unfortunately that affects
its usability like these large wheels
they're actually not parallel to each
other they're at an angle so when you're
trying to move the vacuum from one room
to another it kind of resists it's a bit
harder to move than I think it should be
it's a lot like a shopping cart that has
one of those wonky wheels as far as
features as vacuum actually has a couple
of neat things going for it I really
like the detachable handheld and that it
has built-in crevice tool and dusting
brush one thing I really don't like is
that it doesn't have an auto or manual
height adjuster this part sits really
low and causes some performance problems
just take a look at how it performs with
these Cheerios this thing was the
absolute worst upright vacuum we tested
as far as the Cheerios because that
piece sits so low to the ground it
really just pushes them around but it
never picked up the Cheerios on the
other hand it was the best performer as
far as sand and sawdust it clearly has
excellent suction because it's pulling
those Cheerios around just not picking
them up but because the particles are
smaller with the sand and sawdust it's
able to draw it into the dust bin so
that's something to think about so if
you're looking for more well-rounded
high-end vacuum I would suggest the
dyson DC 41 but if you're looking for
something consistent that's a bit less
expensive
the Electrolux precision brushroll clean
or the ORAC touch bagless or both great
options I'm Megan Willerton for cnet.com
