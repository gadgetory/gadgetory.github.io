CES and our countdown of the top 10 our
cell products from CES 2016 i'm brian
coulis joined by ambassador scott
steiner ambassador from czech lambier
yes nice to have you here and thanks to
spend another day here translator who
can translate our languages to each
other sir a small creature that can
that's the next CES we've been in Vegas
for five long days as you can probably
tell and today we revealed our top picks
for the best products of the show this
is what won us over all of us the 90
editors - these two here at CES after
wandering through all these halls taking
so many briefings in strange hotel rooms
and out in parking lots and all up and
down the halls we distill it down right
here Scott we start with drones we do
it's a popular topic and we have we
actually have two on this list we're
gonna get to the one that like the crazy
pic don't we this is the crazy yeah the
crazy another one big weird CES pic yang
which was that personal quadcopter that
you would actually go inside personal
quadcopter you ride in yes
it's an air it's an aircraft yeah it's
meant to be sort of a future of aircraft
and this should have what are like 23
minute battery life that's right yeah be
careful where you fly and and this is uh
you know meant to have safety features
in terms of being automatic piloting
yeah ashley is scattered they're looking
at the inside of the cabin yesterday
it's a single seater now as you pointed
out there's a sort of a very worrisome
combination here a 23-minute battery
life which is fairly compact and be
11,000 foot maximum height yes that
seems to like if those two could collide
badly where you get to the top and you
don't have enough battery to get back
down to the ground yeah you want an
active warning system or a parachute yes
or the next version right far out wait
wait for yes Version three
it does look like a Blade Runner car
though so I like that it also looks like
vaporware if you want my opinion yeah
yeah it's it's a holy haul it ain't
gonna happen
not the US FAA is never approve
that thing but nice try big CES ideas
Wow year from now it'll be the
best-selling private aircraft in the
world
exactly it's hoverboards who will buy
them so in terms of thing you might
actually buy the unique typhoon hh4
hexacopter yes so this is this is got
six rotors in it and our drone entered
rush Goldman was saying this is the one
that you really liked it's it's
well-designed it's compact fit into your
backpack you can attach a camera easily
can also it's compatible with intel
realsense 4 for automatic navigation and
piloting and to avoid collisions by
waving a really good view of other
things objects and other drones in the
area you know real sense is that 3d
camera technology from Intel that gives
you a much it gives a machine a much
better ability to sort of figure out
what it's looking at not that there's an
object there and no more detail that's a
future not just in drones but in robots
the ability to have these cameras and in
cars to scan around you that technology
is is becoming very very real and it
will enable with with artificial
intelligence these things to really
navigate very easily on their own with
or without us we hear a lot about DJI
and parrot they seem to get all the
headlines around drones one on the lower
end one on the upper end but this is an
important name to watch they're a
serious credible maker they're not some
new startup that doesn't have any you
know any market share it's it's one of
the big makers out there now in the TVs
they're in later on today at 4 o'clock
Pacific I'll be up here with David Katz
Myer our TV guru and we're gonna do a
special dive into TVs themselves but we
asked cats one TV you gotta pick what's
it gonna be and it is the LG G six OLED
TV now we have recently and they've been
putting it in all their advertising
lately called the LG OLED that was
already on the market the best TV we've
ever seen in picture quality period so
this is gonna be the follow-on product
on that now of course this is OLED in
2030 2016 we're talking pricey stuff
many thousands of dollars still very
pricey and this is OLED that that's
layered onto a pane of glass so you
really can't get much thinner than this
nope and it's a it's an ongoing train at
this show to say OLED is extremely
flexible you put on glass you're seeing
curving ones rolling ones
sets we saw rolled-up we talked about
yesterday like a portable thin-film
panel the see-through one is ether one
and you feel like maybe these could be
sort of just eventually be posters you
put on your wall you know like the TV
yeah the spray on TVs Fanta that's great
idea right spray on TV way to man that's
cool TV in the can you get that and a
can of Cheez Whiz perfect weekend you
could totally do that is there now a
larger TVs are always kind of the you
know the the easy sloppy cell here at
CES everyone loves to see a TV as big as
your car and we had one here as well a
hundred and seventy inch television from
Samsung but it's not one screen it's a
modular set of docked screens that are
amazing because you can't see the lines
where they dock now we have a big by
giant dock screen here in our stage and
if you look carefully you can see where
the modules click together it's uh you
know it's a retail display but this
looks like one TV but it's several
screens put together that's amazing
this is basically like the sort of stuff
you might see outside more stores or
stadiums or outside or CNET booth and if
X number of years or plastering hotels
future of display tech or if you're
extremely wealthy we just recover your
home back to your home you've got a
bigger and bigger wall so I've had some
TV real estate what's interesting about
this though is that it goes to a sweet
spot if I understand it right in the TV
business is really hard because of what
they call yield panel yield they
basically grow silicon LCD panels and if
they have a little bad spot that's it
you can't fix it you have to limit your
cut size to a 65 or whatever making one
70s the yield is almost impossible
that's why there's so much money but
here you can take a bunch of easy to
make smaller panels the yields on those
are very high and just click them
together now they can make giant TVs in
theory much lower cost not dirt cheap
but this is actually a cost savings not
just a size growth you could tile your
entire home in televisions you can tell
you it's our floor in television your
floor your ceiling your baby everything
your bed your family our room the entire
room floor ceiling and all walls is all
screen that would be cool imagine we get
to Ray Bradbury's you know the belt you
can actually create your Hall
Dec or your your fantasy room we think
so anyway yeah we think it's fantastic
tell me about wearables we had the
Fitbit blaze yeah wearables kind of had
a I think a bit of an off year at the
show nothing that exciting it's probably
cuz a lot of smartwatches are in a kind
of an in-between period they're selling
but you're waiting for the next Apple
watch or the next version of Android
where a lot of those backed off but
Fitbit biggest player in wearables yeah
announced a watch now the reaction was
mixed but still Fitbit is the dominant
force here and what they're showing is
that a its fashionable or more
fashionable they're trying to make
something you might want to wear all the
time and not just have it be a fitness
tracker and it's also a little more like
a watch and you're seeing smartwatches
get more fitness regular watches try to
get Fitness from big watch companies and
fitbit's going in here with a five-day
battery life yeah so if it's simple and
something you might want to wear all the
time that's what they're going after for
200 dollars by simplifying the the
function they were able to lower the
horsepower a little and get that long
battery life because they've been a
battery breakthrough this has got to be
about pulling down the performance a
little yeah but doing just what it needs
to do exactly and with a couple of
notifications you know this has some
phone notifications but did by design
they said not too many and it's got some
coaching they acquired fitstar so
there's some coaching workouts that's
something people are talking about how
does that actually work does it feel
comfortable we haven't used it yet
sometimes it's you know like the
Microsoft band just tells you to do
push-ups now now do this and you know
it's like so it's like someone just
yelling at me on my on my wrist a really
dumb drill sergeant I love the bus just
buzzing and saying right now you want
saying that there are ones that will see
how you move so I hope that it's a
little more intelligent in terms of the
wave okay I'm not trying too hard though
and another interesting wearable kind of
we know where else to put it so we'll go
on to wearable are the here h ER e air
buds our Eric Franklin was really into
these these are smart adaptive audio
contouring earbuds now we all know about
noise-reduction headphones most of us
have them as we flying all that first of
all these are very tiny obviously
cordless and wireless inside is powerful
DSP and micro amplifiers that can make
changes to the incoming sound
coming into your ears to do either noise
reduction or selective noise reduction
they can say I'll take out jet engine
hum I'll also take out voice I can learn
and take out crying baby I can take out
the sound of a bus when you're on it
versus just having one single noise
reduction slice all the time which is
pretty dumb at this point in history it
is I got to try these and they were
really cool and I think these are like
the future tech of what you will bring
to CES yeah to 2017 and onwards saying
the block out the noise
maybe you build these into headphones
and you start having something a little
like I said a little smarter yeah then
the noise canceling that you have
something more I could equalizer
we're smart equalizer for that it's
adaptive and constantly learns and not
some graphic EQ you're sliding up
sliders all the time because we don't
know what to do with that the the DSP
should figure that out now they're doing
10,000 beta users before they then open
up to another tranche of something
closer to production which I believe
you're on the list for I'll be nice Oh
Franklin you get to play around with you
know also how you hear things and hear
Bulls people are talking about hear
Bulls here at the show yeah the movie
her was a couple of years ago but people
are still talking about that maybe the
ear is the place to go not just for
noise cancelling and that but for audio
cues maybe for smarter notifications cuz
again how many times you want your wrist
to buzz so it's on your track yeah and
to be honest I mean here we are
every broadcaster in the world we're
still wearing we got these things in our
ears the go down to where's mine here we
go they go down a wire to a totally
annoying and heavy pack like this is
called an IFB everybody who's on the air
wears an IFB it's an interactive
feedback our fold-back
queue so people in the booth can talk to
us this is 1970s technology heavy clunky
disastrous I just want that little thing
we just saw everything Wireless put it
in the ear and all this dreck goes away
I mean that's so it's got vertical
applications perhaps as well as you know
for the average consumer now let's talk
about pcs the Lenovo ThinkPad yoga line
has been extremely popular the last
couple years it's one of the hottest
right after you know that all the mac
books now we have them with an OLED
screen yeah and this is something again
Olleh Olleh we're hearing this
everywhere but OLED in a laptop I know
it sounds like
a buzzword Dan Ackerman or PC editor was
really excited about this it just looks
better it's really crisp it could even
potentially help down the road with
design power Metro and who knows what
but right now you're talking about
putting this in the already very popular
design of the yoga and it's a ThinkPad
so it's maybe a little more business
design it's super crisp it just again
what can you do in a laptop that's
interesting there's still room to
improve the screens I mean you can just
tell the quo we're showing it here you
know on a non OLED screen and you're
watching it at home on a non OLED screen
you can almost tell how good it is
especially here's an a/b I think with a
with an LCD and an OLED and like you say
thinner lower power consumption oh that
has some native advantages that laptops
like to have in them and then this is
the one that you introduced me to that I
am totally excited by if there's
anything on this list that I want to buy
yeah it's this one the razor blade
stealth gaming laptop but also ultra
portable depending where you take it
well it's a 12 inch laptop and so it
kind of feels like it's super portable
yeah and then you plug this into its own
graphics tower and this works via USB
see the sort of thing that we were
talking about with with possibility and
Thunderbolt a while ago that's a Sean
Hollister CNET trying it out and people
don't want carry the glop top around but
you still want to play games there's the
thing you dock it to the giant graphics
engine that you have when you need it
when you need it when you want to play
games there's still games you can play
without it
yeah but you know it looks big but
that's the whole idea it's meant to be a
serious gaming PC right but you don't to
take all that around with you and razer
has a lot of crazy pie-in-the-sky
concepts but their PC business has
created some great stuff great laptops
oh yeah because gaming is also good at
doing video editing and editing and
video rendering and that sort of thing
more or less so assuming you can get one
of this with a pretty good process for a
pretty good SSD storage and then dock it
when you need to go do heavy horsepower
gaming or video work which is a very
common model in lots of people's lives
they want to have a lightweight for
traveling and then when they get back to
their desk together you know work on a
video this is a really cool idea and I
think how small can you go will be where
you go from here because
we're already seeing the ideas of like
Microsoft and continuum you know the
phone becomes your computer wirelessly
but we start seeing the trend will be
super small computers you take home very
easily connect at home maybe it's a hub
maybe it's not but another way of
putting the power the horsepower
somewhere else that were you actually
need it so the cloud is one form of
offshoring horsepower this is another
way of interpreting the concept of
offshoring horsepower so it's there when
you need it but not cumbersome right
like Docs you just assume you keep on
your desk and that won't be annoying
hopefully yeah very cool let's go to
smart home now in the appliance the
smart home category I think we were all
pretty unanimous that Samsung may have
cracked the code on one of the toughest
products to make which is the smart
refrigerator not making what is it hard
I'm making one that makes any sense has
been hard for like a decade and a half
the industry's kept trying this one kind
of worked out pretty well 21 and a half
inch screen on the door giant screen but
it doesn't try to really be an
all-encompassing computer which never
made any sense it has some logical ideas
like being able to mirror content that
you're playing somewhere else in the
home have it mirrored on to either audio
or video on to the fridge so it follows
you around that way messaging and photo
sharing I'm not quite as cogent on that
cameras like you see right there inside
the fridge will take photos of all of
its contents every time you open and
close the door so you constantly have a
latest snapshot so when you're at the
store you're not sure if you need
carrots or not just log into the fridge
and look and see if there's any in the
crisper and then buying a second bag
that way because I don't really like
carrots a whole lot but sometimes you
need them so I want to buy as few as I
have to that's the thing is to get the
dream of the carrot and you really yeah
I like the cameras on the fridge it
sounds crazy I like it looking in the
back of the fridge I want to see yeah I
want to see what's in there that's my
that's my dream is to know what's in the
back that might be so much about your
home just sitting here with you 350
thousand miles from it what's in the
back the back of your fridge
it's where things go - yeah it is
there's some stuff right mine no
different
there's yeah there's strange bad
a mystery bags I want the fridge to help
me help me out be fair better person I
don't know about the front part of it
you know the screen and the ordering and
everything else but everybody's been
excited about this everyone it's seen
it's been excited about it groceries by
MasterCard was the other thing in the
screen where you can shop right there as
you look in the dorms they are out of
that close the door and go buy it for
deliveries for grocery delivery service
and mastercards powering it it's a trial
in New York City so the idea here is
what they call contextual commerce you
can do anything on his phone obviously
and that's been the big trend lately
it's just buy it on your phone while
you're right there but sometimes it
makes sense to build the commerce into
the device or location where it first
occurs to you like buying groceries at
your fridge door like paying for
gasoline from your car key fob things of
this nature and so all of a sudden I
think we're kind of splitting away from
doing everything on the phone not
leaving that but saying sometimes it
makes sense to have commerce embedded in
the place where it occurs this is like
Amazon's button they released a year or
so ago where you could mount it by your
dishwasher hit it to order more dish
water
Landro new detergent same basic idea I
want like machine learning where this is
gonna tell me what other people have in
their fridge like the average I tell you
you know you're not ordering the healthy
foods or you know this is what Kanye has
you know in his oh yes you can kind of
have you know cribs refrigerator
addition right you want to order food
like peyton manning just do that create
the the pro the pro health set like hit
like a profile and have it have it
outfitted it's kind like a pandora thing
that's kind of weird yeah like that all
right let's go to cars now cars and car
technology I think the CNET car team I
think it's pretty much agreed the Chevy
bolt not the Volt bolt with Abby was the
belle of the ball
not audacious but a real car that's
doing really good things pure electric
unlike the Volt which is of course the
extra range extender hybrid so pure
battery electric 200 miles of range
$30,000 after federal tax credits as
long as they keep offering though which
is a big question mark down the road
flat floor because the battery is a flat
pan so there is no transmission hump
front or back so you can slide back or
forth across this Tim Stevens made an
interesting point about that he goes GM
just invested heavily in lyft and they
have a car here that's easy to enter an
exit from either side makes it great for
picking people up and dropping them off
in case you pick them up on the right
side
the street and drop them off on the Left
neoclassic New York City well you want
me left or right
there's no hump to kind of clamber over
to get to the other door it's a small
thing but it's a nice livable everyday
detail so we're gonna see more about the
bolt as well at the Detroit Auto Show
next week but this is about we know
about it's a pre-production sample and
those ugly headlights you see are not
gonna be in the final car I'm happy to
report now VR and AR what did you love
in this space uh again at this show it
was kind of a whole bunch of stuff a lot
of announcements especially in VR as you
heard oculus rift AR is around it's
hanging in there it's going to
enterprise and they're they're looking
to smart glasses and you know trying to
explore that I think they know that for
the average person right now even
getting people interested in virtual
reality is gonna be more of a challenge
no matter how great it looks and we
thought then anybody
fails so going to AR for a moment Intel
announced this daiquiri smart helmet
which looks like it's not meant for the
average person industrial yeah it's got
a visor that gives you a vision of what
you see and it's got real sense cameras
that look forward to see what you're
seeing and interpreting and that's again
the use of the realsense camera des
Craig has something create something
also for now because microsoft hololens
also intended for enterprise is still
isn't gonna be here yet this is going to
come before the end of March according
to Intel and it's designed again for an
industrial-grade and design and
environments that's something that other
companies like Epson and those who have
made these helmets are trying to keep an
eye on it's not necessarily going to
look cool but it's got a you got to use
it on a site place where you can't use
their hands so yeah this could be big
for people who need to use that I was I
was taking a tour of the entire
executive team of one of the largest
industrial products companies in the
world around the floor yesterday and
they said yeah this is the real deal
we've been talking to them before CES
and we're very interested in deploying
this across what may be the largest
fleet of engineering industrial
technicians in the world so there's
something interesting about that there
is in Flex when it comes to virtual
reality you've heard about the oculus
rift now they announced this I think you
heard a bit about them for years
the
it's gonna be shipping there's a $600
price which everybody was going all over
the place about truthfully that's not
the whole price of the system in the
first place you have to buy the PC which
has certain level of gaming graphics
that even serious PC gamers don't have
okay so the total price could be up
around fifteen hundred dollars but
there's that that's not the only virtual
reality platform out there PlayStation
VR that's coming and actually I think
the best experience of the show was HTC
vive and we've seen that that was a
collaboration between HTC and valve
they've been showing off their stuff
since last year they have a new version
of the hardware that they had at the
show improved visual quality and they
said mirror correction so it looks
crisper but it's like camera that camera
now can see what's going on around you
and that it activates when you go to the
edge of the room there's a room filling
VR that uses light sensors laser arrays
and these motion controllers and when
you go to the edge of that room it'll
show you what's in it it'll show you
furniture people not the actual you know
video stream but kind of a Batman vision
render it and bring it real into VR
exactly they say they're doing that to
reduce lags
that's me wandering around seeing that
but that is a unique approach the other
guys don't do that camera import do they
not at all and they need to I think
that's going to be what we see next
probably not that far off because you
look at again intel realsense cameras
and these types of things
these cameras are out there and you know
project tango Google has so I think it's
only a matter of time in a short period
of time before a lot of these VR
headsets put those in could also help
you scan the room and not have to put a
sensor up next to your TV out looking
way of seeing the room and sensing
what's around you as opposed to a sensor
in exact like these guys which is a
little horsey right now looking out also
incorporating the room maybe developing
something that feels like augmented
reality as well yeah starts to blur the
line between the two oh yeah they're all
gonna blend and you want to get these
things down to glasses size so again
even the stuff that you see this year
you may see new versions next year and
this is definitely great for HTC because
I guess I look like I really
fight breakout product and because let's
face it you're not Samsung or Apple you
may not be long for this world in mobile
phones it's very--it's and whittling
down we're into our third year now where
all of the profit and smartphones is
going to two companies I think this will
be our third calendar year you can't do
that forever
so HTC and many other makers that did
really well on smart phones for a while
they need to find their next hit where
they really kind of stabbed with
something strong and this might be this
might be their their strategy for them I
think so it's expensive but you're gonna
see a lot of everything a long race here
it's a marathon for content and
everybody just wants to try this out and
keep going so I bet it's all going to
start to blend yeah very interesting
sector there okay so there you've got it
those are our 10 or so best products
here from CES 2016 total of 12 if you
really want to count them thanks for
joining us thanks for all of us here at
seen that myself and ambassador Stein
we're the global leader here at CNN
technology news and look forward to
seeing you again here at CES 2017 but
don't leave there's a lot more going on
here today at the CNET stage here at CES
2016 in Las Vegas thanks everyone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
