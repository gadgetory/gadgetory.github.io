5 PDA jumped out of our hip pockets and
into our hearts but if you want to
channel a little bit of that old-school
call then the gemini is for you it's
kind of a PDA and kind of a smartphone
it runs vanilla Android but it also has
a full physical QWERTY keyboard so it
kind of operates like a small laptop or
the PDA that you would have had back in
the 90s it runs Android 7.1 or you can
use on Linux OS it has a 10 core
processor a dedicated graphics processor
and 64 gigs of storage on the sides will
find ports for headphones and USB C and
you can also get a dongle that will give
you extra ports answering a call is as
simple as flipping open your phone or
just holding it up to your ear and it
works both ways you won't find this
piece of delightful retro tech in stores
just yet it's still in prototype stage
and it's got an IndieGoGo campaign for
$5.99 u.s. you'll get a 4G unlocked
version or for $4.99 you can get the
Wi-Fi version it also comes with an
optional peripheral camera that can snap
onto the back though if you want the
regular front facing camera you'll find
that inside to the big selling point of
this one the original creators of the
Scion were involved in the design and
development of the Gemini so you know
it's got that retro cred where it counts</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
