welcome to Google ishes for all the
Google goodness that we can pack inside
of a show let's get to it and smart
watches are still the hot topic right
now after an interview with Android wear
execs and cnet revealed their plans to
make Google's wearable platform even
smarter now Android where's director of
engineering David singleton told Cena
that an upcoming update will bring
Bluetooth compatibility to pair a
bluetooth headset with your watch so no
more of that talking to the wrist stuff
unless you like doing that they're also
going to be introducing GPS support for
the platform for devices that include
gps hardware an example to take
advantage of this is if you're going for
a run you could leave your phone at home
and let the SmartWatch record your data
and sink it back up with your phone
after your run alone want your home
eating a scone now a future release will
also allow third parties to develop new
watch faces and make them available for
download at the google play store you'll
see these updates come out before the
end of the year according to the Android
wear team so why do we keep talking
about smartwatches well samsung recently
announced their curved gear s SmartWatch
with a curved 2 inch Super AMOLED
display running Samsung's Tizen OS and
they're still expected to announce their
standalone gear solo watch that has its
own sim card at their September third
event that's five count them five
different wearables officially announced
by sammie in the past year with a sixth
on its way now Motorola's 360 watch gets
its time to shine with official details
this week at its September 4th
announcement LG officially unveiled
their first SmartWatch with a round face
called the G watch are with a 1.3 inch
OLED display that's a full 360 degrees
and doesn't have a dead space for
ambient light sensors or display drivers
like the Moto 360 the G watch our will
go on sale in early q4 of this year with
no price point given yet now Sony will
also be launching two of its own Android
wear of wearables at Aoife 2014 with the
Sony SmartWatch 3 that will look similar
to Samsung's gear 2 neo and their next
health and fitness based wearable the
smartband talk with a curve
e ink display and don't forget about a
sous their CEO already teased a sub 200
SmartWatch called the zen watch running
Android wear with more details at Eva as
well so yes we will keep talking about
wearables alright shifting gears over to
drones we know amazon has lofty goals
for using flying drones to deliver goods
but google recently revealed they've
been working on a delivery system of
their own for the past two years called
project wing the team took out project
wing for a test in queensland australia
because it has more progressive laws
when it comes to using drones now the
priority isn't to deliver products to
customers even though they'll be able to
do that instead they want to use the
drones in times of disaster relief for
situations where cities may become
nearly inaccessible the project wing
drone can deliver anything that weighs
up to 22 pounds the drones are
pre-programmed with the destination and
are then left to fly themselves
automatically and let's just make this
clear these drones look pretty badass
compared to Amazon's wimpy little guys
that could be taken down by a little
hummingbird all right in a couple quick
stories recode reports that the makers
of the android gaming console Ouya are
in talks to sell the company with
several big Chinese and US players in
the mix including Google and Amazon
talks are still in the very early phases
huye was an innovative idea but its lack
of broad software support and exclusive
titles that people really cared about
Curtis chances to become a player in the
gaming world and Google will rebrand
google enterprise as Google for work
think of it as the same service with a
friendlier name to resonate with more
small businesses and anyone using google
services for work all right we'll have
tons of news in next week's episode from
all the major announcements including
Samsung Motorola LG Sony you name them
we'll have them and you can always email
us at google issues at cnet com or tweet
me at brian Tong thanks so much for
watching and we'll see you all next time
for some more of that Google isha's
