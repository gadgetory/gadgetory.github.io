process and protecting its integrity
Facebook's mission is all about giving
people a voice and bringing people
closer together those are democratic
values and we're proud of them
I don't want anyone to use our tools to
undermine democracy that's not what we
stand for and this morning I directed
our team to provide the ads we've found
to Congress as well Facebook CEO Mark
Zuckerberg announced the company will
turn over 3,000 ads purchased by fake
accounts linked to Russia that may have
influenced the outcome of the 2016 US
elections he said Facebook conducted an
internal investigation that revealed
nearly 100 thousand dollars had been
spent on election ads from these
accounts in the live broadcast
Zuckerberg laid out a nine-point plan to
prevent election interference in the
future the plan would make political
advertising more transparent on Facebook
it would allow Facebook to vet the
content and disclose who paid for it the
company also plans to share risk
information with other tech companies
and beef up its security team with an
additional 250 employees for this
division but even Zuckerberg admits this
may not be enough to deter election
fraud online now I wish I could tell you
that we're gonna be able to stop all
interference but that just wouldn't be
realistic Zuckerberg seems to have done
a 180 from his comments
soon after the November elections you
know personally I think the the idea
that you know fake news on Facebook of
which you know it's a very small amount
of the content influence the election in
any way I think is a pretty crazy idea
