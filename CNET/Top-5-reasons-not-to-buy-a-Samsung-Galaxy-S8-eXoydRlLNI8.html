buy the Galaxy s8 so samsung's newest
phone is up for pre-order and you're
wondering if you should get it as an
aside we will have another top five on
why you should buy the SH but right now
let's talk about the reasons to hold off
at number five paranoia the Samsung
Galaxy s8 is Samsung's first major phone
since the note 7 debacle in case you
somehow did not know Samsung had to
recall the note 7 twice last year due to
overheating batteries samsung says it
has a new eight point test to ensure
battery safety off new phones if you're
the paranoid type you might want to wait
on the s8 for a little bit and number
four glass the design of the s8 is
beautiful but can it survive a clumsy
person with both s8 models adopting
samsung's infinity display and with thin
bezels on the bottom and top the s8
might not be able to handle drops as
well as a more traditional phone maybe
the s8 is tougher than it looks
however if you're a klutz maybe wait to
see how it handles drop tests and number
three Samsung Android you get a Samsung
Android phone you get Samsung's
customized version of Android along with
a bunch of apps you may never use if you
like pure Android you're in the wrong
place also that customized version of
Android means operating system updates
could be delayed and number two Bixby is
not ready Bixby might be amazing in the
future Samsung has said Bixby home
vision and reminders will be available
at launch
however boys from Seoul will not be
ready when the device shipped to stores
on April 21st
so while Samsung has dedicated a button
to its new assistant you might want to
wait on buying the s8 if you think big
speed will change your life right away
and at number one the fingerprint sensor
the sensor is now on the back of the
galaxy s phone why is this an issue it's
located right next to the rear camera so
reaching for the sensor may not feel
natural at all other phone makers placed
their rear fingerprint sensors within
reach like Google with its pixel phones
also the s8 sensor just invites smudges
on your camera if you
you might be wondering why we do these
types of top fives personally I like
them to stop a potential impulse buy
since I shouldn't be spending a lot of
money anyway let me know if you're
getting an s8 I'm at is on Twitter I'll
see you online</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
