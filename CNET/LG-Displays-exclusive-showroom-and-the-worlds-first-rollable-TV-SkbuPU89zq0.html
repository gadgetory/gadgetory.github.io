not everyone's gonna be able to get in
this room we're here at LG Display and
don't get this confused with actually LG
LG display separate from LG LG display
provides for a lot of manufacturers
beyond just LG with their screens and
I'm here with Lucy with LG Display and
what we're gonna do here is if you kind
of just roughly look around with me
we're going to actually give you a tour
of all of their cool videos really TV
display technologies and how they're
using them in different ways so trust me
stick with us you're gonna see some
really cool stuff and we will get to the
rollable 65 inch world's first display
here as well but we wanted to kind of
show you some of the cool things so
Luxio we did see the wallpaper TV
released last year and we're showing it
here again can you kind of talk about at
least how this display how you're
presenting it here for us today
outstanding feature coordinate design we
are able to show you replicate all the
great paintings perfectly you can still
see all the brushstrokes as well so this
means when the TV is off we could use it
as an interior factor to further upgrade
our living space so if you're balling
and you you know instead of just having
a TV it can be almost like a nice art
piece in your home yeah and I think so
I'm not sure if you're gonna be able to
but if you find an angle you can
actually see just again how small
there's a thin ribbon cable that's going
from here into the wall and you can
showcase it because this is three panes
of glass again you know we sometimes get
desensitized by how amazing this
technology is like the wallpaper TV was
amazing last year it's still amazing but
then you know they got they have a
rollable TV here to show us to just the
amazing stuff from LG Display we're
gonna keep on moving down this way and I
kind of affectionately like to call this
TV here the show the triple H it's the
8k OLED 88 inch TVs display here from LG
and maybe Lucy P can kind of talk a
little bit about as well as we show it
off first ako LED for it's showing
resolution 4 times higher than 4k and
for OLED since each individual pixels
can illuminate itself yes
showing 33 millimeters are in the
individually so we can show more fine
and detailed information and pictures as
well yeah I mean you go up to it if
you've we've obviously are we've seen so
much 4k but every little like pixel and
subtlety is shown here I even like the
demo that you guys have of the girl's
face I mean you could see like the PW
could see like the peach fuzz on her
face right like you can't see the peach
fuzz on here but you have some you know
great great imagery here of horse here
but this is the 8k OLED 88 inch and you
have it right resting on a piece of
glass did we talked about it earlier I
know nothing is official but it is this
TV expect to be available sometime
within the next year or so possibly next
one or two years kind of amazing kind of
amazing okay let's uh kind of go over
here we'll we'll come back to this one
because people are using it but um we're
gonna go check out here just more kind
of different unique sizes and shapes of
displays that we're showing off here I
like this one I totally can see this at
like a retail spot but this is what you
guys call the 88 stretch and is it
actually like two displays put together
or two sides of displays put together
but it's the same size as having two
4900 okay
so our customers don't need two 49 inch
you can just have one eighty eight inch
and one great thing about this products
and we can fit an extra size of the
model so they don't have to be squeezed
in oh yeah I like for example is this
the TV or is this just me and the TV can
you tell it's just fit if it's if it's
the whole body right okay and then we
have this one over here there is the sub
zero point six millimeter so we can
minimize the gap between the panels so
we can't is one big screen effect you
also talked about the the lighting on
this how you guys have really worked
hard for the corners to get a more
consistent image quality across the
board can you talk about that a little
bit Tony information we cannot help but
yeah yeah so we were able to have the
panel edge corners here the brightness
uniformity would be the same for all the
three or four panels put together
having a more immersive one big screen
okay this is this is awesome stuff again
we are inside of LG Display I'll tell
you right now it this is not a place
that you can just walk up and go into
you have to have an appointment you kind
of have to I guess you kind of have to
be a big deal to come here this is all
right are you saying that I'm a big deal
yeah okay I thought that that question
fell flat well we're will revisit that
okay um let's come back over here this
is what we all came to see the world's
first 65 inch rollable television um
could you show some of that magic with
the remote here
sound effects please oh now this is
really cool what a lot of people haven't
seen here is how it can be used in three
different modes it lifted initially for
just like weather and information here's
a 21 by 9 aspect ratio so let's talk
about like you know maybe cinema mode to
watch your movies and then if you want
to watch it full screen 16 by 9 for full
TV viewing this has the ability to do
this what also is really unique here if
we get kind of like right here on the
side again this is a roll this rollable
display we won't be able to see the
mechanics but we were told by LD display
let's say if you rolled this display
really tightly
you know how big would it really be and
they said about a 50 millimeter radius
so here let me let me try and visualize
this while I hold the mic that's about
this big it's like about almost as big
as my head that's how this screen rolls
up into this box and you can also
imagine using AI right we're talking at
our television sets more and more LG has
shown that in other manufacturers
telling your television set like let's
check out the weather it goes up that
high let's check out a movie it changes
and adjusts on the fly and this is just
a beautiful thing that we're gonna see
the concept is here in living color it's
only going to get better but I just kind
of one of the fascinating things that
you come out to see yes 2018 this is
what you want to come out and see so
we're gonna also move down over here
check out check out our Crystal sound
OLED and Lucy if you could kind of talk
about this one as well we have our panel
acting as a diaphragm Turner OLED panel
into a speaker so
so this is actually the screen itself is
vibrating to produce this sound correct
so the image and the sound is
synchronized providing much more
immersive cinema like vide experience so
like you guys said like right if you
stand here you like feel the sound right
now oh yeah feel it baby feel a baby I
hope I hope people at home can feel that
cuz I can feel it very cool so get a lot
of like really cool technologies here LG
Display we're gonna go check out one
more back over here because we you know
there's a lot of action going on in this
room this is kind of really cool for
future point-of-sale displays retail
experiences and this is their in touch
86 inch ultra HD display can you talk a
little bit about this and you know what
what is the advantage for for how this
would be used in touch we have the touch
sensors all embedded in our display so
it means more accurate touch and high
picture quality since there won't be any
touchable touch patterns visible so for
those will be great for our interactive
whiteboard or for product search in the
retail shops so they showed me this demo
I'm gonna try and do my best to recreate
this but here we have a model here we
have a variety of different colors that
we can select here and we also have the
different aspects of you know maybe you
want to do a little makeup looking good
and we can can actually click on these
different areas right so for example
let's start off with lipstick lipstick
is selected I'm gonna roll down over
here I want to kind of bring that funk
let's go with some little Pantone 240 C
and I could just write right on her lips
you like that mm-hmm you like that
mm-hmm okay let's go check out maybe
some powder blush I'm gonna I'm gonna
try and mix this up a little bit we want
some contrast colors you wanna bring out
bring out her little cheeky cheeks right
here and again right we're interacting
with this we're touching the display
this is all happening in real time and
there you go this I don't know I I mean
I I she looks good right okay so let's
hit this we're gonna hit by now right
and once we hit by there's a
complimentary display over here this is
in touch signage that has the layout of
what we selected
what we can buy here on display like
this is an in-store experience and if we
just here hit this buy now tells me to
confirm the purchase for that powder
blush and I'm just gonna sign this is
gonna be a valuable screen right here
money to change so what I also was told
is that this larger in touch display has
a higher sensitivity level because
there's more interactivity more details
how we were like filling in all her lips
and our cheeks where's here still an
interactive touch display maybe not
doesn't have to be as sensitive just
because we're doing really more of a
final purchase point but you know again
Lucy thank you so much for all this this
is great
she's like the pro here in the house and
just amazing stuff that you can find
only here with seen it at CES 2018 at
the LG display booth we're gonna be
spending more time make sure to watch
and follow up with our first looks our
in-depth articles about everything you
saw here we're gonna keep on bringing
