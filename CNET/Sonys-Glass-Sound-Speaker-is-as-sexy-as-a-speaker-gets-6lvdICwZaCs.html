new line of really cool-looking the
pricey products from Sony's life space
UX division half wireless Bluetooth
speaker
half lantern with a dimmable LED bulb
that mimics a flame got double mood
setting potential it can be moved around
freely because it's got an integrated
rechargeable battery that gives you
around four hours of music playback
depending on the volume level it's one
of those products you really want as
soon as you see it but it's $800 price
tag is a bit of a buzzkill unless you
happen to have a lot of disposable
income lying around you can dim the
light and adjust the volume using Sony's
song pal app for iOS and Android devices
but if your phone isn't close by there
are lighting and volume controls hidden
on the bottom of the device I'm not sure
the speaker delivers 800 dollars worth
of Bluetooth audio bliss but it does
deliver smooth natural sound for a
Bluetooth speaker particularly in the
treble and mid-range and it is
omnidirectional by that I mean it
disperses 360 degrees sound much like
the cylindrical UE boom speakers however
those aren't made out of organic glass
and with this speaker the glass serves
as a tube tweeter which gives the sound
its clarity a two inch woofer is
responsible for the mid-range
frequencies there's a passive bass
radiator for the low end if you're
looking for a speaker that plays super
loud and has more oomph to it space this
isn't it it's really designed to play
background music while blending into the
decor or complementing it and also
provide some lighting be great for the
bedroom cool stuff if you can afford it
