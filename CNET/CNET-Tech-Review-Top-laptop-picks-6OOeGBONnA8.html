Merritt
see you next
congratulations graduates now it's time
to take your laptop down to your local
coffee shop and use their free Wi-Fi to
start looking for a job what's that your
old laptop got wrecked during your last
beer pong tournament well luckily Dan
Ackerman is here with a buying guide
that will help you find a brand new one
I'm Dan Ackerman and is never a bad time
to update basic laptop buying advice but
now is an especially good time because
even though laptops today pretty much
looked like they did six months or a
year ago the components inside have
really changed a lot in 2010 so it's
really a perfect opportunity to update
our basic laptop buying advice now
netbooks today are as popular as ever
and that's because for about $2.99 you
can get a pretty easy on the go
computing experience however the
components inside the netbooks have
changed a lot starting in 2010 we've got
the new Intel Atom n 450 processor now
least new netbooks that have that n 450
they're not a heck of a lot faster than
last year's models but the battery life
is a lot better we're seeing six seven
even more hours of battery just from a
basic netbook like this now we're also
seeing netbooks that try to jack up the
price a little bit going from $2.99 to
maybe 3 99 or $4.99 by adding some
premium upscale features sometimes like
in the case of this Toshiba NV 305
you're gonna see a bigger touchpad in a
nicer keyboard other times you're going
to see Windows 7 premium instead of
Windows 7 starter or you're gonna see a
higher resolution screen and maybe if
you're lucky some basic graphics options
like Nvidia Xion ship that'll let you
play HD video and even some basic games
on a netbook now the mainstream laptops
those 14 and 15 inch models that you
find in your you know your den or your
home office well those have gotten a
pretty good under the hood upgrade as
well they've all got Intel's new series
of core CPUs a core i3 Core i5 and core
i7 what you're going to find is improve
performance and improve battery life
over last year's Core 2 Duo version in
some cases it's pretty dramatic in other
cases less so are you gonna find a lot
of really good mainstream systems like
yeah the Dell studio 15 basic 15 inch
laptop once you add that core i5 to it
you're gonna get better performance and
better battery life over last year if
you try something like the toshiba e 2 o
5 it's going to have stuff like intel's
new wireless display technology what
that does is it takes
signals from your laptop screen sends it
to your HDTV just plug a little adapter
into the back and it's great for
watching movies tis a bit of a fraction
of the second place of not great for
gaming or web surfing but you play a
video on here and then you can watch it
on your big-screen TV and of course if
you're more business-minded let's say
you're running a small business out of
your home or you're a freelancer well
then Lenovo course has a ThinkPad line
those have those core series ships too
and here's a great bargain hunting tip
if you look for something with the Intel
Core i3 CPU you're gonna find those in
less expensive mainstream models you're
gonna get almost the same performance
and battery life as you do out of the
more expensive Core i5 models but save a
couple bucks in the process whenever we
see the core i3 listed on the laptop we
think you're probably gonna find a
pretty good deal
and of course Apple's MacBook laptops
pretty much in a category by themselves
they actually just did a bunch of
updates to the MacBook Pro line what
they did was they ended the core i7 and
Core i5 chips to the 15 and 17 inch
models the 13-inch MacBook Pro model
didn't get the same level of upgrade but
it's still pretty much the same really
good system it was last year you also
get in the 15 and 17-inch systems
discrete graphics by default now and
even better instead of having to go into
a menu and switch those discrete
graphics off and on it just turns on
automatically when you need it like when
you start a game or you start a video
editing program so you'll save yourself
a little hassle that way and you
probably get better battery life because
it'll turn off the extra graphics when
you're not using them just automatically
by itself of course these are still
super premium laptops are you definitely
going to pay for the privilege of having
a MacBook Pro but if you're doing stuff
like video editing and photo editing
there are very few other go-to choices
out there so of course our last category
is something that may or may not be a
laptop at all people argue whether it's
a netbook with the keyboard missing or
whether it's a portable media player
that also does word processing an email
it is Apple's iPad tablet and the
reality it's probably somewhere in
between those two it really is a hybrid
device it plays all those apps obviously
and there's a lot of movies and games
really well but it also does basic word
processing it does really great web
surfing and you can even do email on it
now is this going to replace your
regular laptop or desktop definitely not
is it gonna replace your netbook that
you take with you on business trips well
probably not that either but if you're
going to the coffee shop or you're
taking a plane trip somewhere or going
on vacation you might take the iPad with
you instead of a netbook because you can
do web surfing on it and you can do some
basic word processing and basic email
just the basic messages that you want to
send
and worth while you're on vacation or
something they're just out for the day
but no matter what you call it or what
category you put it in there's one thing
we've figured out and that's people seem
pretty crazy about the Apple iPad so far
so hopefully this guide has given you a
good head start in your next laptop
purchase don't be afraid to ask
questions do your research and of course
always check out the latest laptop
reviews on cnet.com I'm Dan Ackerman
thanks for watching so there you have it
you'll need a laptop a netbook and an
iPad hope you've been saving up moving
on in the good we have a new show here
at CNET TV that you may not have seen
it's called tap that app where Brian
Tong is scouting out the best apps out
there on all kinds of mobile devices
this week video streaming on your phone
cool stuff
welcome to tap that app i'm brian tong
and this is the show we cover the
hottest apps in the mobile space now
this week we're showing off apps that
enable you to stream live video from
your phone and then to your friends
anywhere you are now there are really
three mobile apps to pay attention to
the first one is quick live it's free
and it's available on almost all
platforms but limited to specific phones
when it comes to blackberries Symbian
phones and windows mobile phones and
there is no Palm Pre support in fact
palms webOS has no live video streaming
solution at all with the quick app
you'll need to create an account press
record and your streaming live to the
web with an easy to remember link now
this is streaming video but the app
probably has the best audio and video
quality overall people logged onto the
site can interact with a live chat and
you'll also be able to share your videos
and announce them to the world on
Facebook Twitter and YouTube
now the next app is Ustream broadcaster
it's also free but only available on the
iPhone and Android platforms for
streaming live video this also requires
an account setup but press the go-live
button and your stream is up the unique
feature here is the ability to ask a
question on your stream and have a live
poll where viewers can respond and
you'll see what they think and like
quick people can also interact with a
live chat that appears on your phone
screen - and you can also share your
video with Facebook Twitter and YouTube
friends the third app is knocking live
video it's free but it only runs on
iPhones and Android phones and it's a
little different because you need to
sign up and your friends need to sign up
for you to both use the service to watch
your stream invite a friend that has to
be in the app sure it makes it more
private
but then there's no audio on the stream
and it's only done through phones it's
also linked to Facebook and Twitter to
let people know when you're using it but
it's really a private way to stream
video so what do I think about these
apps well quick is the most universal of
the group and has the best video quality
so I'm given that a good tap you stream
broadcasters unique polling feature on
top of its ability to match all the
features that quick has like real-time
chat and video uploading make it tap
worthy but knocking live video is only
on two platforms it's a pain to set up
friends need to be in the app and
there's no audio
no thanks alright that's it for this
week's show if you guys have any
questions send them to tap that a patsy
Netcom i'm bryan song next to me writes
producer Arielle sure has been getting a
lot of screen time lately yeah we should
give him his own show all right it's
time to take a break but when we come
back it's happy stabbing robot time hey
guys Brian song here and if you're
looking to see the top dogs in tech
face-off
then you need a watch see that's prize
fight we'll throw touchscreen phones in
the ring reignite the console wars
battle web browsers and more so you can
find it all as cnet.com / - and i'll see
you there welcome back to the CNET tech
review now to kick off the bad this week
here's Tom Merritt with a how-to on
creating custom keyboard shortcuts
keyboard shortcuts are fantastic they
make you faster more productive and can
impress your friends and potential mates
but even more impressive than knowing
things like control X and Windows D is
making your own shortcuts that no one
else has creating shortcuts is easy to
do in Windows 7 and they can save you a
lot of time you'd otherwise spend
hunting for a programs icon start by
finding the program you want to make a
shortcut for I'm gonna make one that
will launch paint.net right-click on the
program icon and select properties then
select the shortcut tab click in the
shortcut key field and type the hotkey
combination you want I'm gonna use ctrl
alt P press ok and now try out your new
keyboard shortcut just hit ctrl alt P
and there you go
now go try and press your friends if
they're impressed you have the right
friends hope that saves you some time at
least I'm Tom Merritt Cina Darko
so what's so bad about that video well
as some of you already know this is
Tom's last week with us here at seen it
and that means this will be his last
how-to video bad but don't worry you'll
still be able to find all of his great
tips from over the years at CNN tv.com
we'll miss you Tom and speaking of bad
news this Monday is loaded was full of
it
from new FCC regulations to pesky IM
viruses there was a lot of bad stuff
going on take a look the FCC gives
Hollywood permission to control your
set-top box Sony is updating the VAIO P
with an accelerometer and a robot in
Germany can stab you with knives and
screwdrivers it's Monday May 10th I'm
Natali del Conte and it's time to get
loaded the FCC is giving Hollywood the
power to remotely disable the analog
outputs on your set-top box to prevent
you from watching newly released movies
in an analog format this control is
called selectable output control the
Motion Picture Association of America
said that the studio's in the group
would not authorize early release of
movies until it had this capability
because analog syndication can be easily
pirated understandable but I'm not at
all comfortable with Hollywood reaching
in and controlling any part of my home
electronics nevertheless the FCC granted
this power
last Friday Sony launched a new line of
the VOP notebooks these are the small
clutched looking machines that are
ultra-thin and portable the new machines
are 8 inches they come with an
accelerometer that you can use to
navigate websites pictures or PDFs by
tilting them right or left
they will also go into portrait mode
when they are tipped on the side they
also have 3G built-in we don't have
information about a u.s. release date
but they'll launched in Japan for over
$1000 beware of a new virus that's
finding its way onto Windows machines
over yahoo instant messenger or Skype it
arrives as an IM that asks you to look
at a photo with a link the link looks
like it leads to a JPEG or an image file
but then it asks you to download a zip
file don't do that it's malware if you
download it
we'll try to spread itself to other
people in your IM contacts overseas
apple lovers won't have to wait much
longer for the ipad pre-orders for
international shipments are available
now the ship date is May 28th for
customers in Australia Canada France
Germany Italy Japan Spain Switzerland
and the UK they can buy either the Wi-Fi
or the 3G version in 16 32 or 64 gigs
Nokia filed a new series of patent
infringement suits against Apple for
patents on the iPad and the iPad 3G the
patents have to do with the technologies
related to enhanced speech and data
transmission Nokia and Apple have been
suing each other over patent
infringement since last October though
so this is just the latest in that tango
if you're afraid of robots you're really
not gonna like this one
it can stab you a German researcher
named Sammy Haddad Ananta to see if his
collision avoidance program worked so he
equipped his robot with a knife a
scalpel and a screwdriver
he had it stabbed at a ham some silicon
and finally his own arm the collision
avoidance program worked and his arm was
unscathed but the point is that he was
willing that's commitment to your
research those are your headlines for
today I will see you tomorrow with more
and thank you for watching I'm Natali
del Conte bosina TV and you've just been
loaded stabbing robots are you serious I
know there's a rule about robots not
injuring humans but it seems like you're
pressing your luck if you actually give
them knives let's turn our attention to
happier thoughts shall we like this
week's bottom line
cars are changing big-time you know the
funny-looking concept cars of the future
well they're the funny-looking cars of
today now let's have a look at the Acura
ZDX shall we it's got the lines of a
concept car buckets of tech and a
blind-spot big enough to hide the u.s.
deficit just don't ask me to tell you
what type of car it is it's just the
2010 Acura ZDX Advance
let's check the tech
so this is an Acura ZDX you know it's
one of those coupe UVs that are all the
rage these days notice the lines and
notice the packaging biggish wheels but
more like a coupe that got big then an
SUV that got swoopy and i say that
because the interior packaging is much
more now shall we say tight or at least
sporting and stylish than it is
utilitarian and nowhere is that more
obvious than back here in the cargo bay
and I use the word cargo rather
generously this is really small in terms
of carrying space for the volume of the
vehicle but see the point of this thing
is not to carry a whole lot of luggage
the point is to carry four people in
style with just enough luggage it's your
ultimate weekend Wine Country golf trip
vehicle and one other thing I want to
point out is a very strong carryover of
a design theme throughout this vehicle
back here you've got this kind of
descending V pointed chin you see it
again inside the cabin here it's the
main dominant design of the center stack
where the controller is and its really
strong up here in the front where the
Mighty Morphin Power Ranger face is the
new look for Acura
now as you can imagine we've got an
estimable load of tech in this Acura
it's a high-end car we have the tech
package in the advanced package and
there's plenty to look at starting on
the head unit screen this is the new ish
Acura Honda unit which has been revised
somewhat it's still a little crunchy
looking but it's way better than the
really stale unit they used to be
sticking in their cars for ages as you
can see we've got live traffic in there
via XM satellite radio okay now moving
on to the audio functions we've got a
whole lot going on you got the usual
am/fm but no HD radio standard or
available on the ZDX that's you know
contentious at this point in history XM
as I mentioned is our satellite radio
flavor here's our CD drive it's right
down here single slot because we have a
hard drive and you can rip to that now
under the USB aux button comes the fun
stuff here's Bluetooth audio which
stream stereo music off of your phone
our next choice of course is the iPod
connector and I like this one it lives
here inside the center console it's
actually a USB pigtail into which I can
connect my standard white Apple iPod
cable charges gives me readout of data
and of course plays audio now on the
output side of this thing we've got an
Els system 435 watts 10 speakers around
the cabin pretty well geared up the
usual bass treble balance fader but here
you get to your subwoofer your speed
control Dolby pl2 you've also got DTS
read on this guy so a lot of different
coatings can be read
our transmission is a one choice only
6-speed automatic with a super stubby
shifter down here in the console you
don't shift with this guy
you've got paddles up here on the wheel
to do manual shifting of course I've got
a backup camera which is going to give
me some distance indicators before I go
crunch and it's also got a view change I
can look down at what I'm going to hit
or I can look back to what I'm going to
hit which is a damn good thing because
this car gets the coolie award for
biggest effing blind spot in automotive
production this is the first year I've
granted it because I didn't have to
until now you can't see over the back of
this car period it's like driving a tank
they should have a periscope on the
option sheet it's actually terrifying to
make a lane change in this vehicle IDs
is there adaptive suspension technology
and it's got two modes a comfortable one
and a sport mode now the suspensions
adaptive at all times and this comes on
the advance package in this car this
doesn't turn adaptivity on or off it
just changes the curve and the contour
of how it responds and for those really
bad days there's optional collision
mitigation braking system which sounds
an alarm tightens the belts and
eventually crams on the brakes when you
don't realize you're about to rear-end
someone ok behind the pointy schnoz on
our ZDX lies a relatively garden-variety
Acura Honda 3.7 liter v6 single overhead
cam nothing really clever going on here
lots of variable valve timing which
they've done so well for so long you're
getting 300 horsepower out of this guy
270 foot-pounds of torque
fun 16:23 are your epa estimates on the
mileage 0 to 60 s about a six and a half
second affair so you know it gets out of
its own way but it's not going to be in
the same classes let's say a BMW x6 of
the same type
all ZD X's have super handling all-wheel
drive which can bias power to the wheels
front and rear and left and right
between the rears
there's also cornering ji logic in the
transmission to prevent an ungainly
upshift when you're powering through a
corner but leave the hood and get on the
road and I'm not a huge fan of this
power train I like it I don't love it
not a lack of power and you've got
paddle shifters you've got a sport mode
I still feel like the cars caught in too
high a gear too many times I've changed
this IDs knob from comfort to sport in a
lot of different conditions and I don't
feel a whole lot of difference it's
pretty subtle maybe it's more of a open
road hard driving thing and the handling
and cornering is quite good in this car
it doesn't feel as tall as it looks from
the outside
okay let's price of 2010 ZDX and do it
seen that style that means you buy it
with the tech package that's $51,000 but
includes basically all the toys in the
cabin now what you would add on top of
that your choice would be the advanced
package six thousand more that gets you
adaptive cruise control collision
mitigation braking system that IDs
adaptive suspension and that adds the
blind spot detection system don't even
drive this car a foot without that the
bottom-line this week it doesn't matter
what's behind you man
it's what's ahead of you that counts and
that's our show for this week everyone
tune in next week when we'll have a
complete first look at the new HTC EVO
4G from Sprint and a whole lot more in
the meantime get more great seen that
video at seen at tv.com see you next
time and thank you for</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
