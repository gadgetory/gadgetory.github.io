its curves I'm Bridget Carey and this is
your CNET update just when you think
you've seen everything in a smartphone
Samsung has come out with a whole new
design to stand out from the crowd the
company unveiled the Galaxy Note edge
which is essentially just like the new
Galaxy Note 4 but the right side of the
screen edge curves down to create a
separate side display the bend in the
screen contains its own touch controls
app shortcuts and notifications you can
interact with them without leaving the
window you're on it can show a yahoo
sports ticker or a list of trending
twitter hashtags camera controls pop up
when the app is open and you can pull up
sketching options when you're using the
stylus pen if the curve isn't for you
Samsung also unveiled the Galaxy Note 4
it's the latest phone tablet hybrid with
a 5.7 inch screen if you like your
phone's extra-large this screen is a
higher resolution and it charges faster
than the previous note the stylus has
double the sensitivity and allows for
more drag-and-drop controls and you'll
notice Samsung takes a small step into a
metal design with the outer frame the
backing is still plastic it comes in
black white gold or pink these phones
will come out later this year with the
pricing announced later and if you
decide to get a note for you could also
pair it with Samsung's new gear VR it's
a virtual reality headset that was built
in partnership with Facebook's oculus
you just snap the phone inside and the
controls are on the side panel the
eyepiece reporters were shown demos
including footage of a Coldplay concert
and some animation of flying through
space but I'm not sure how long you'll
want to play a game this way before it
gets uncomfortable Samsung also has been
demoing its new curved screen and gear s
SmartWatch which we learned about last
week it's the first watch with its own
SIM card and data plan that means you
can actually send texts on this if your
finger is so up to the picking challenge
Samsung promises there will be 1,000
apps for it when it launches and the
battery may
you up to two days at best there's also
a snap-on battery charger to give it a
boost while you're on the go now Samsung
is not the only company showing off new
products there's an abundance of new
gadget tree being announced this week as
the IFA tech conference takes place in
Berlin Sony is showcasing a new fitness
band with an e-ink display similar to
what's on a Kindle it's called the smart
band talk because it also makes and
receives phone calls using a built-in
speaker but it needs to be wirelessly
connected to your phone Sony hasn't
given an exact price yet that's your
tech news update you can head to see net
for continuing coverage from the IFA
tech show from our studios in New York
