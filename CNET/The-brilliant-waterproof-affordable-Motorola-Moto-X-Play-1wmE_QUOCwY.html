smartphone world with the cheap but
brilliant Moto G and with the new Moto X
play in shaking up mid-range phones as
well this 5.5 inch Android phone packs
in a ton of high-end kit it's highly
customizable and it comes with a very
affordable price tag it's not bad to
look at and it's easy to see the family
resemblance to the rest of the Moto
range it has a rubberized back panel
which is available in a range of vibrant
colors with coloured accents as well
which you can choose using Motorola's
Moto maker service online it's a great
way of making your own phone stand out
against the slew of gray and black slabs
out there the body has been given some
waterproof ink as well it won't survive
a swim in the ocean
but the odd spilled drink shouldn't give
it too much trouble it's got a 5.5 inch
display with a full HD resolution which
makes everything look nice and crisp
it's bright too with rich colors making
it well-suited for gaming speaking of
which it's 1.7 gigahertz octa-core
processor was more than capable of
handling games like Angry Birds 2 and
turned its hand to more demanding titles
like grand theft auto san andreas it's
running android 5.1.1 and motorola is
one of the few companies that doesn't
apply its own skin over the top what
you're left with then is pure vanilla
Android that's simple to use and Swift
to navigate around the back of the phone
is a 21 megapixel camera which is a huge
number of megapixel to find on a phone
of this price it can take some great
shots balancing exposure and color well
and you'll find features like HDR and
panorama modes if you want a phone with
a splash more luxury you might want to
opt for the Moto X style with
customizable leather or wood back panels
but if you're after a high-performing
phone to tackle all your everyday tasks
with a good camera and an affordable
price the Moto X play is a brilliant
choice I'm Andrew Hoyle 50 net and this
is the Motorola MOTO X Play</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
