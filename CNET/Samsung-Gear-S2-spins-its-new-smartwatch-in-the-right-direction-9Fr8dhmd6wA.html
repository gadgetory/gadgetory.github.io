is doing its best to make smartwatches
cooler starting with the gear s2 it's
round it's nice looking and it works
with many Android phones not just
Samsung ones why is it such a big deal
it's well designed as a round watch see
that rotating bezel around the watch
dial you can spin it to change watch
modes and you can scroll through menus
it's like Apple watches digital crown
but on the watch face and apps are in a
wheel everything is designed to be round
it's a fully round display and it looks
beautiful it feels good and looks good
that's not easy the s2 fits on my wrist
well and it's not too big the simple
sort of futuristic design stands out but
isn't weird it's flashy but understated
well done Samsung it handles most of the
things you need clever watch face apps
can be used to follow your favorite team
via ESPN or check stocks via Bloomberg
or track fitness using samsung s health
or nike plus it gets messages it can
play music and has pretty decent voice
recognition what's the temperature
outside
battery life it's not a monster but it
gets a day more on average than most
fancy smartwatches like the Apple watch
or Android where you could miss charging
it one day and be okay and it comes with
a nice magnetic contactless charged off
to fitness tracking works step count
heart rate all-day activity tracking
they happen smoothly and fitness apps
are easy to use on the watch interface
you can even track water and coffee
intake it's not the best fitness tracker
but it's one of the best fitness
tracking setups on a SmartWatch it's
good enough to replace another tracker
if you have one apps aren't plentiful
however because this is Samsung Tizen
not android where it runs its own
specific apps and there aren't that many
of them but even with what it's got this
gear s2 it's pretty nice and it shows
Android wear watch as a thing or two
about how watches could be designed next
and look a lot more interesting on your
wrist i'm scott stein at cnet with the
Samsung gear s2</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
