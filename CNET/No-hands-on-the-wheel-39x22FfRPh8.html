you this bus is indeed steering itself
UC Berkeley engineers hope that one day
of fleet of these automated buses will
mimic a light rail systems efficiency
and smoothness but with a low cost of a
bus system here's a question is it going
to save me time if you can come back a
bus in the train together as a single
system then a lot of people be more
attracted to this system compare that to
the two to the millions of dollars or
real system for Maya that is a
significance to order differencing when
pulling into a stop this bus really does
operate more like a train getting within
an inch to the curb something that's
very very difficult to do on a
traditional bus with a real-life bus
driver here's how the technology works
it's a ceramic magnets exactly the same
as you put on your refrigerator we
basically embedded have an inch to an
inch under the road now that becoming
your rail spaced every three to four
feet apart on this one mile stretch of
road the bus is too magnetometers under
the doors follow the path but how do
would be passengers feel about riding on
this robotic bus it's not a problem for
me because um
the subway we got a driver already
exists in France first let all the
politicians go on at first no it's got
to be real we're going to keep it real
don't expect a ride one of these
automated buses anytime soon testing
will begin in the San Francisco Bay Area
in the year 2010 in san leandro
