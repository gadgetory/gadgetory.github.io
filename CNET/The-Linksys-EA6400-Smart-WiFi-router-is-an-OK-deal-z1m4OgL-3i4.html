Linksys ei 6400 smart Wi-Fi router smart
indeed because it's one of the more
elegant and stylish routers on the
market take a look it looks great taking
the shape of a modern UFO which is much
better than the old-school UFO I used to
have and now I'm not alien at least not
anymore now on the back here that where
I have a four Gigabit LAN port and one
gigabit one port you give it because
they all give you the speed of up to
1000 megabit per second it's important
to have this fast port here because
number one you know this is an 802.11
AC for short Wi-Fi router they're
offered up to 1,300 megabit per second
Wi-Fi speed you do not want your white
land speed to be much lower than your
wireless LAN speed and secondly the
internet is getting faster and faster
and you need a fast one port to take
full advantage of that there's also an
USB 3.0 port right here to host a
printer or a store device like this
portable drive right here and in this
case you can also work as a file-sharing
and media streaming server now the EAA
6400 here is a true dual band Wi-Fi
router meaning that it works on both the
2.4 gigahertz and 5 gigahertz frequency
band at the same time apart from the AC
client it also support all existing
Wi-Fi client but in this case it offer
the cap speed of only 300 megabit per
second and I believe this is why it's
called AC 1600 router you know I add 300
to 1300 and guess what
that's 1600 now the router comes with a
very nice web interface to manage is
many features you can actually also
subscribe for a link see smart Wi-Fi
account and then you can manage your
whole network via the internet or the
cloud using the browser or mobile apps
now using the web interface you can even
test the speed of the Internet
guess what let's check how fast it is
here here we go what only 316 point 14
now and to 18.75 up
come on see that you can do better than
that it is very hard to impress me and
speaking of not being impressed that's
it also how I feel about this routers
performance in my testing it wasn't
super slow but it was below average
compared with other routers of the same
configuration that plus the cost of $170
make this not a great deal it's an okay
though because it works well and well it
looks nice for more on the router check
out the full review at c8 calm and
follow me on Twitter Facebook or Google+
maybe you can impress me with your home
heating air speed it's unlikely though
that because I'm dango and this has been
the first look at the Linksys ei 6400
smart Wi-Fi AC 1600 router</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
