Lego we're looking at the encounter on
jakku Lego Star Wars set it's one of the
newer sets out there in it you get Rey
bb-8 to get unkar plutt and you also get
this guy that's a Tito and his lug abhi
sort of hybrid robot horse thing let's
build this Tito he's only in the force
awakens for about 30 seconds
it's quite cool look at this
so chained goes on the logo beasts belly
that's what it's called logo beast I did
my research that that's pretty cool
don't see many of them and we're done
we've got articulated legs here and the
head this is good interesting facts
about the lugger beast that I read
online there non-sentient and apparently
it's not known whether they defecate now
we're gonna move on to what every kid
wants to play with
unkar plats oh thanks John
aha oh that's that's that's quite clever
we have completed hunka of plots
convenient under bed storage I think is
what this basically is little drawer you
can see there it's problem blaster in it
and you you can slide that in there
that's a really nice detail my
enthusiasm only slightly tempered by the
fact that it doesn't really show up in
the film
today one water portion amazing plastic
hair that's awesome been looking forward
to this point since we started out the
way everyone else we're faking bb-8 now
overruled yes
look at that we go getting the gang
together
and we're done that was pretty fun
didn't have to use the brick separator
once so Canada's a massive win
personally high points definitely the
lugger beach that was a lot of fun to
make this the sort of market stall I do
really like all the little details like
to draw and the cups of course the broom
and you get rayon bb-8 and I think this
is the cheapest full set that comes with
both of those minifigures so if you're
desperate to get those then it's not a
bad set to get that's all for now so
stay tuned to see know</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
