rumor has it the show that rounds up the
week's biggest tech rumors you can vote
what you think about the rumors too in
the interactive player if you're
watching on cnet today we've got a
SmartWatch rumor the long-lost Amazon
phone and the ipad event is next week
finally let's get started first up some
SmartWatch news for you that doesn't
start with an eye and end with a watch
according to 925 Google citing an
anonymous source a google smartwatch is
just about finished this information
follows a report from android police
saying that a nexus watch codenamed gem
will be announced on October
thirty-first the thing that sets this
watch a part is that it'll have google
now cards at the forefront Google now
acts as a virtual personal assistant
offering answers to questions and
displaying information that's relevant
to you Google is also trying to equip
the watch with a longer battery charge
and bluetooth for point everybody wants
to be a part of the emerging SmartWatch
market but until I can use my SmartWatch
to order thai food through seamless
without having to dig out my credit card
i'll just sit back and watch see what i
did there watch up next for as long as
rumor has it has been in existence so
has the rumor that Amazon will be
releasing a phone according to a report
in The Financial Times amazon and HTC
are working on a new line of smartphones
unnamed sources tell the publication
that the first of three devices is near
the end of development HTC told the
times that it would not comment about
Amazon but said it is always open to
collaborating with carriers and other
tech companies remember the facebook
phone yeah me neither hopefully an
Amazon phone or probably more accurately
the Kindle phone doesn't follow the same
path and people actually buy it and with
HTC's backing it looks like it could be
well on its way and finally the rumors
have been confirmed that Apple will be
holding an ipad event on october 22nd so
here's a quickie to whet your appetite
accord
to leaked images from Chinese sightsee
Texian calm the iPad 5 will sport a
fingerprint reader just like the iphone
5s so obviously why wouldn't the iPad
sport a fingerprint reader I'm also
pretty sure that either it or the ipad
mini will come in colors that match the
iphone 5 s's what do you guys think are
you down to buy a gold iPad do you think
the touch ID sensor is a waste don't
forget to vote and leave a comment and
I'll check in with the cnet Council the
cnet Council is composed of five editors
who cast their votes anonymously their
opinions are not an endorsement by cnet
or CBS Interactive obviously because
these are rumors folks and the cnet
council's verdict is yes four out of
five editors think that the next gen
ipad will have a fingerprint sensor and
I agree be sure to check out Cena on
October 22nd for our live coverage of
apple's ipad event and i'll be sure to
round up all the rumors that were
confirmed or not next week after the
