I'm Bridget Carey and this is your scene
that update pebble is at it again the
SmartWatch that started the Smart Watch
movement has a new model called pebble
time with a new design comes a color
epaper screen and there's a microphone
for sending voice replies and memos this
version comes in three colors the
battery lasts a week and its twenty
percent thinner with a stainless steel
frame there are these little animations
as you scroll between different
reminders and notifications some
criticize this design saying that it
looks like a kid's product well pebble
isn't going after the high end fashion
SmartWatch market like Apple it's aiming
to be cute and maybe this world needs a
little more cute pebble used kickstarter
to debut the watch and take pre-orders
within a half hour of a going live on
tuesday morning the project broke a
record as the fastest ever to raise 1
million dollars but it didn't stop there
as i record this video pebble time has
raped in more than 5 million dollars
those who are first to pre-order got the
pebble time at a discounted price of one
hundred and sixty dollars but it will be
coming out in May for 200 in other news
the world of emojis will soon get more
diversity developers are seeing a
preview of what emojis will look like on
the next versions of Apple's operating
systems you can pick from five different
skin shades for human emoji characters
the default is a Simpsons like yellow
pigmentation but if you hold that down
you'll get to change the skin color
there's no word yet though if they're
going to make a taco emoji speaking of
food how would you like to get a free
waffle for running a delivery errand it
sounds strange but it's a new perk of
using rohde a people-powered delivery
service app you can get paid to make
deliveries for people if you're sending
a large item somewhere using rody could
be cheaper than using fedex the new
twist is that rody is partnering with
waffle house you know the southern
breakfast restaurant chain beloved among
truckers rody members can now use waffle
houses as a drop-off and pickup spot for
deliveries and drivers get a free waffle
and drink it's so crazy it's brill
but that's not all that's brilliant on
the internet if you grew up watching
mighty morphin power rangers in the 90s
brace yourself there's now a dark and
gritty reboot for adults on YouTube you
can find a 15 minute short bootleg
dreamed up by producer adi shankara's
the drug side of a galactic war once
fought by a group of high schoolers it
stars james van der beek as the second
red ranger rocky and Katee Sackhoff of
Battlestar Galactica fame as Kimberly
the original Pink Ranger is part Blade
Runner Park kill bill in all parts
