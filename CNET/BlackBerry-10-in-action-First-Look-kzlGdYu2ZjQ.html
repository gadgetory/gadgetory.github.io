and we're here at blackberry jam taking
a look at the new software keyboard
that's going to be implemented into
blackberry 10 devices we're taking a
look at the keyboard on the dev alpha
prototype and we're here with gary
classic who is the principal architect
for rim and so let's see this keyboard
in action right so this is the
blackberry 10 keyboard you'll notice the
familiar threats from the blackberry
design and what's unique about this
keyboard is that it'll actually
anticipate what words I might want to
type so if I type an eye and I see the
word that I want I can simply flick that
onto the screen it's actually already
particularly good at anticipating what
phrases i might need when I letter early
this would be the home screen is showing
me the different applications that the
user may want and from here I'm able to
see my universal inbox so all my unified
communications at people are familiar
with on blackberry and what we want to
enable is that forever am in the UI I
might want to be able to see what
incoming notifications have come in you
might want to peek at that but I might
want to continue what I'm doing and from
the universal inbox I can open up an
email and also peek back to be able to
see my overall communications and see
where I came from and that continues to
flow so I open up an attachment I can
peek back to my email and further all
the way back to my Inbox cool and from
wherever i'm in new I i can always peak
to check my notifications is there way
one unified place to find all your
notification for ya there would be one
unified place where you can see all your
notifications there will be okay maybe
that by the end of the year their third
quarter perhaps some somewhere in there
we hope later this year later this year</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
