taking a look at the asus g x 700 a
gaming laptop with desktop grade
components not only does this laptop at
the quad-core intel processor inside
that can be overclocked unlike most
mobile chips it has a desktop grade
nvidia gtx 980 graphics chip the same
kind you'd find in a giant graphics card
you put in a desktop PC that can be
overclocked to and the memory can be
overclocked thanks to a liquid cooling
system this is one of the first gaming
laptops with liquid cooling and it gets
that by connecting to an external dock
the laptop actually has two different
power adapters a 180 watt power adapter
you can drop into your backpack and take
with you on the go and a 330 watt power
adapter that slots into the back of the
docking system to get the liquid cooling
radiator going while you get access to a
lot of extra power with a connected to
the dock you can still use it when it's
unplugged it'll just revert the
performance of a mobile graphics chip
when you do so the one thing it has that
you don't see on a lot of gaming laptops
is 84 k or 1080p screen with G sync
technology it's an Nvidia technology it
tries to smooth out the image by
eliminating the tearing and stuttering
you might usually see when the graphics
chip is trying to send images to the
display right now we can't tell asus
didn't actually have any games running
on this system in our brief demo but
we're looking forward to trying it out
soon you'll be able to find a full
review on cnet when it ships later this
year</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
