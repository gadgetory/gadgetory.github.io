on your dad jeans
that's pebble in a world of smartwatches
with shorter battery life and higher end
features pebble watches have opted for
longer batteries simple always-on
displays and basic functions they're
utilitarian and the new pebble too goes
right for the Casio watch crowd with its
design which looks like the original
from 2013 but compact and it costs $130
for the heartrate version which isn't
bad at all
somewhere between fitness tracker and
full-on SmartWatch that's pebble -
pebble can record sleep instep tracking
automatically and the newest addition is
heart rate tracking which works for runs
and workouts all in all not a bad
package but dedicated fitness trackers
do it better the pebble - plus heart
rate does just enough to be fine for
casual use and it syncs an apple's
healthkit in google fit
pebbles new software update adds pop-up
notifications for things like timeline
information and an app menu that shows
more at once but boy that text gets
small and the apps and watch faces that
pebble boasts feel well more of a Palm
Pilot era but at least getting weather
sports scores messages and even replying
to text an email through a built-in
microphone or possible and the whole
thing is 30 meters waterproof of course
you could also get pebbles time or time
steel both of which do steps and sleep
and have color screens and are
frequently on sale or wait for time -
which has a larger color display pebble
- is like my jeans I might wear them you
might not</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
