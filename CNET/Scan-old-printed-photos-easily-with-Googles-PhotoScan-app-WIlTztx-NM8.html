collect dust in a shoebox give them new
digital life with Google's photo scan
app it's free on iOS and Android and
it's an easy way to preserve printed
memories you don't even need to take the
photo out of the picture frame or photo
album with the photo scan app hover over
your print make sure it's centered on
the screen and snap a picture next the
app needs you to align the center circle
over four dots you'll want to hover
until the circle turns blue and
disappears during this process it's
actually taking multiple pictures and
stitching all the data together
eliminating any parts that are bright
white with glare from the light it then
automatically processes the image
cropping out the table or frame around
it you can adjust the corners if it's a
little off the size of the print doesn't
matter this will scan extra-large photos
and tiny wallet prints just fine keep in
mind this isn't going to be as perfect
as using a high-end flatbed scanner but
hey it's free and quick to use the
coloring may be off depending on the
lighting in the room I found my scans
look slightly washed out but you can
loose the color in the Google Photos app
when you're ready to save tap the corner
arrow and then tap save all the photos
are now in your camera roll and also
synced with Google photos which is a
free way to backup your phone's picture
to the cloud then open the Google Photos
app if you want to do some editing you
can tap the pencil and then the middle
icon to adjust settings expand the light
option to fine-tune things like contrast
highlights and shadows expanding the
color menu gives you options to boost
saturation or simply single out the
saturation of one thing like skin tones
if there's sky or ocean in the picture
you can just boost the saturation of the
deep blues in the shot once you save
your changes you can click the share
icon to send it to anyone in your
contacts list they'll get a link to save
the photo even if they don't have the
app photo scan is a handy app to capture
photos when you're going through
pictures at a relative's home and using
it can certainly boost your
throwbackthursday game for CNET I'm
