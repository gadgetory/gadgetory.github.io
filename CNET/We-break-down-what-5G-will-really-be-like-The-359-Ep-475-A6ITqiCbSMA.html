Joanie sauce we kicked off a new package
on 5g today and our leadoff story takes
a look at what 5g will actually feel
like when it launches and this is my
story and I took care to basically try
to poke holes and all the hype around
flat G basically don't expect it to
change your life right away coverage is
gonna be spotty or non-existent your
phones might run out of batteries really
fat or another power really fast there
might be problems with canta feet
getting on to 5g or getting kicked back
down to 4G basically all the problems we
saw when we transition LTE will probably
see with 5 G's right it's gonna change
eventually so yeah look this is the
assignment over 5g is I think justified
in terms of what it can do for us over
the long term when this thing actually
gets built out and there's a bit more
mature but this story's really Unruh
minor that with all the hype there like
early on that things aren't gonna go as
smoothly as everyone says it well what's
the expectation for when we'll reach
that point of that maturity that's
pseudo maturity like like let's say
prematurity but not like clunky ok
doesn't actually work I would say 2020
is probably the better timeframe
t-mobile has said that they they're
promising a nationwide network by 2020
nationwide ish by 2020 and that'll
that'll definitely get a compass with
faster if they comply with Sprint AT&amp;amp;T
and Verizon I'll probably be not that
far behind and then most of the Asian
countries will start building out or
will build up most of their networks at
that point so I think that's the point
where like you can start to actually get
excited with 5g ok all right next up ro
Stephens Jacqueline had a nice breakdown
on how Google uses computational
photography to boost the ability of the
single camera on the pixel 3 for
instance he uses AI to make better
portrait photos takes a bunch of HDR
shots and combines them for better
low-light photos under night shot and
it's got something called super high res
this is basically making up for the lack
of an optical zoom lens uses data to
kind of fill in the blanks
so cool sup but is this enough Joan to
convince you that only one camera is all
you need on a phone you know how I like
multiples of cameras on phones that
Samsung for camera for shooting Gary but
I think that sounds great I mean it
sounds really cool the ability to do all
these fans know is the computational
photographer you what also enables the
stuff like the wide selfie mode and like
the the thing that'll fix when you are
blinking in the middle of your photo no
be so the wide selfie mode they actually
will have a second camera on the front
that is a wide selfie cam so that's not
that's not complicated you can't really
use data for that but for in terms of
fixing things fixing blemishes yeah
that's what that probably what Google's
Banga tricks all about
and then lastly Joan you were covering
Netflix earnings last night and there
was some concern that there was gonna be
a blip or well yeah last quarter with
earnings you know it's always about
expectations and yes and it anything the
only thing that people ever care about
with Netflix is how many subscribers did
you add yeah three months ago Netflix
said we had a subscribers just not as
many those we said we wanted and
everyone freaked out and so last night
people were really worried that maybe
this was Netflix standing on the brink
of a downturn especially cuz other
companies and technology haven't been
doing so great but Netflix said you know
how he said you have this many
subscribers we actually like did a lot
better than that and so everyone freaked
out but in a mighty way yeah it's
interesting that that they're seeing
that kind of success give them like the
sheer number of streaming services that
are launching now like yeah Netflix is
just sort of that core that no one
really gives up right I mean people
always say if you're gonna have a
streaming service the mindset that
consumers have is like you're gonna have
maybe two maybe three and one of them is
gonna be Netflix there you go for a full
coverage truce on a CNN I'm Roger and
Joe nice offer thanks the same
I missed that chime it's weird recording
the podcast there's no chime at the end
I make it ourselves we actually like I
feel like it's not done until I make
that noise you are a dog and a Pavlovian
no way that being said it is good to be
back and thanks getting everybody for
your patience will give me the quick and
dirty version so when we do the video
show like this that you can see there's
a lot of technology here in play and
when one thing goes wrong you see
there's a domino effect and long story
short we use this device called the
TriCaster which is a very compact
consumer friendly level TV switcher to
do all the broadcasting multi-camera
work this that yeah thing boom boom that
died it just straight up died Monday
morning and as I was setting up for the
show catastrophic hard drive failure so
I spent the last two days recovering
redundantly backing up rebuilding all
the projects and I've got this thing
back on life-support and I see in the
chat right now some people are talking
about that there's maybe some sound
issues so we might still be experiencing
a couple things so I'm on it now we do
have sound now right tell me so anyways
thanks again everybody now is the time
to continue the best part of the show
the QA so send in your questions and
comments about all the stories we
covered already I have one thing why do
we have to give a crap about 5g I
remember 3G and 4G and it was fine why
is this such a hubbub to trying to get a
faster network yeah it's actually
question I think that's if you if you're
not really if you don't follow the
wireless industry that's a very natural
question to ask I would say that the
jump from 3G and 4G was pretty momentous
when you think about what that gave us
we went from you know like a dial-up
connection or phone to a broadband
connection equivalent or our home what
that led to it was things like uber and
live streaming service and netflix on
your phone yes netflix on your phone all
these services really new services that
didn't exist before the advent of 4G so
the thinking is with 5g it's not just
about speed it's about the
responsiveness something called latency
the
lag time between when you ping you know
when you touch your phone and and one of
things networking comes back to you
that's still like at this point like
it's less than a second but with 5g it's
more like a millisecond and that kind of
responsive network is great for like
self-driving cars talking to each other
or remote surgery telemedicine the idea
of like streaming VR games your head and
actually playing games and having it be
responsive yeah vibe 5g is critical to
power some of that stuff and really the
what we get excited about is the unknown
is what fives you can actually unlock
and again that's this is when 5g
actually gets into that as you're saying
that prematurity level not enough people
using it enough people using it there's
enough coverage companies and creators
can start testing it out exactly exactly
like it really days it's gonna be a lot
of like one-off experiments for instance
magically 18 T's working of magically
because I sort of set a small 5g hot
zone in their headquarter to kind of
test out how I'm just streaming AR is
gonna work on the glass right and you
can imagine with 5g like those glasses
over one don't necessarily need to have
all that data there but you could have
all these experiences flow through
wirelessly right now so uh I'm excited
for most part when what's the transition
from 3G to 40 what year was that I was
like oh eh oh 10 no 2010 so back nine or
10 years ago
and it was kind of brought it took a
while right there was like Verizon a big
splashy launch of multiple cities and
then like for a while the stories were
all just like four G's now available in
like these five cities and that that
went on for about a year and then I got
you know I got to the point where we
took 4G for granted you started to see a
lot more or these apps get developed
that that really could exist before
right so it's too bad that we're not
rolling cameras all the time because
what you guys missed is before the show
I had that exact question for Roger
because to me I just thinking like it's
just it's just faster right and he got
to sit me down and explained it to me
like a child
so if only we could have gotten a Dante
put it way way more entertaining another
aspect of the 5g implementation people
are kind of cute
about is cloud gaming is that really
gonna be a potential thing what can you
say about that yeah I imagine I mean you
know game at all I haven't looked into
it personally with gaming but I have
looked into video and retro reality and
so like anything that needs to be
real-time rendered and done
simultaneously with multiple users 5g is
gonna make a huge difference it's gonna
unlock a lot of potential so yeah cloud
gaming is one of those things group
video experiences that all happen on a
phone in one place
I think like like crowd mobs or what
does it call flash mobs but like via
like there's crazy ideas of what can
happen when you have a mobile device
with that kind of fat pipe yeah and the
idea is that that mobile device doesn't
need to do all that
like computational crunching for that VR
game I think all that can be done in
cloud and then because that latency can
be shot to your phone super fast and
there isn't there isn't a lag time I was
told that you know we all have Google
photos the one thing well maybe not
everyone but I do and I use it pretty
religiously the one annoying thing is
when you you scroll that further through
like older photos it still needs a
couple seconds to load depending on your
network connection with 5g assuming
you've got a better fashion and that
latency
the idea is you can pull up your photos
from Google photos faster than you can
from the photos are stored in your own
phone because the latency is so minimal
that is like all theoretically like sort
peak speeds optimal conditions so we'll
see if that actually happens but like
it's an interesting idea that like these
cloud services that are still there so
lag for this cloud service is now a lot
of that lag time gets diminished with
o.j something that just occurred to me
as well the reason I didn't really pay a
much attention to the big transition
from three to four I didn't work for
seeing it at the time so I wasn't
surrounded by it yeah hot topic of
conversation so maybe that's that's why
I'm feeling a little over burnt on on 5g
because I keep hearing you guys talk
about I'm like who cares anyways next
question coming in from our buddy Ricky
B is 5g going to help get better signal
inside of buildings that's something I
can get onboard
because the signal in this office is
yeah yeah so I mean it doesn't help
penetrate brick walls any better than
they are in fact particularly with
millimeter spectrum they're really super
high frequencies radio airwaves that
that carry that superfast high-capacity
5g Network that actually has real
trouble penetrating building it's
because it runs at a higher frequency
even trees mess it up treat like if the
leaf blows by like you're gonna see a
bit of a disruption so make it sound so
there are a lot of workarounds that
these carriers have been using but I
would imagine inside in buildings you're
still gonna be relying on Wi-Fi or if
you have 5g it's gonna be sort of
tethered to like some land connection so
yeah it's more I feel like it's more for
outdoor coverage or if you've got if you
got 5g indoor you'll need to have like
specific radio setup and that's I don't
know that's I don't know if you'd want
that necessarily like a little small
cell sitting you're sending the office
somewhere but yeah well thanks for
bringing us all the good news next
question from Timothy do well the
characters increase their prices for 5g
that is a fantastic question and what
I'm still trying to get the bottom of
spring has already kind of teased the
idea that that 5g will be considered a
premium service and might charge more
but like Sprint may not exist in a few
months when they get taken over by
t-mobile
or if they get taken over by t-mobile
and so and I've talked to and the CEO
who said that is now kind of moved on
he's no longer with the company
he's there's a new CEO and they've kind
of had they haven't really talked about
what the pricing scheme might look like
the rest of the carrier's haven't said
that much about it
I know Verizon's home broadband 5g
service it's fairly competitive it's
like 50 bucks if you're a Verizon
customer seventy if you're not a Verizon
customers so I think early days it's
it's it's going to be kind of how 4G was
the you know it'll be sort of the same
plans but you get 5g you get that
capacity and think once we start running
into the capacity castrates
the carriers will will start raising
prices then
next question coming in from Sravan
Servan is there any 5g network anywhere
right now
you mentioned Verizon who else is on
that docket so right now it's just
Verizon and Verizon use this is like pho
5g technology which they use this
proprietary version of 5g that that no
one else in the world agreed to they
just are kind of did their own and
that's kind of how they got out there
first 18 t says they're gonna have the
first mobile 5g industry based 5g
network layer this year in 12 markets
but I imagine it's gonna be like two or
three blocks in each of those markets
like it's gonna be fairly limited
they're gonna just sort of test up the
capabilities I like this question from
Mike Shaw he's asking who's really gonna
buy this so let's break down the
marketing strategy a lot of us are
pretty satisfied before G of course
everybody's gonna want bigger better
faster that's inevitable but is it
really something that is going to be
appreciated or is it gonna be kind of
niche what do you think the adoption is
gonna be like on 5g that's a really good
question I I mean it's part of the
problem is that everyone's doing it so
it's one of those things where like if
you don't get in the race then you're
already kind of behind so your friends
jumped off a bridge like if everyone's
offering 5g I don't think it's like I
said I don't know if they're gonna
charge you extra but it's definitely an
incentive to say well maybe I want to
switch to t-mobile because they've got
5g as opposed to just 4G so that's I
think that's sort of the motivating
factor we got a little bit of an off
topic question coming through people are
curious I didn't even know about this
considering I had my face buried in the
TriCaster for the last 48 hours but
apparently YouTube went down do we know
so I actually I email emailed YouTube
this morning because last night they
weren't sharing what was the cause of it
and I emailed them this morning and they
told me that they still don't have
anything to share on why it happened but
it was a it was a big deal how long was
it about an hour
oh and so that's been not only YouTube's
proper like watching your unboxing
videos and other stuff like that but
also like YouTube TV their live TV
service and YouTube music their music
streaming service maybe their TriCaster
went down to the fact YouTube only runs
on one old tripod
yeah yeah that's what I kind of want a
vision it happened right as I was
putting my kid to sleep so I missed that
window of outage yeah I didn't panic at
all yeah when I went back onto YouTube
it was fine everything was good yeah so
I was a happy camper
from Joseph Gauss when do you think like
what year is 5g gonna really become
commonplace commonplace I say the end of
2020 early 2021 depending on these guys
are super competitive and they're there
they're racing to build these networks
out as fast as possible
and I mean t-mobile's making a lot of
promises because I because I think they
want to get their deal with Sprint done
so they're promising the moon but I
imagine like given the track record of
the folks at t-mobile like they've built
out their 4G network pretty fast
so I imagine like yeah 2020 2021 you'll
get you'll be able to access it it won't
be like completely that's that promise
of that high-frequency millimeter wave
spectrum that's not gonna be everywhere
but they sort of talked about using
using kind of lower bandwidth spectrum
for 5g to get to more places and I think
you'll get you'll get some of that the
the millimetre stuff that's kind of
they'll probably be in bigger cities
there'll be pockets of zones where
things are super super fast but you'll
get some someone's of 5g elsewhere
bye-bye end of 2020 I like some of this
chatter in the chat box right now or
there's I wouldn't call them conspiracy
theorists but maybe heavy skeptics where
they're questioning how are you really
going to validate if it's truly 5g or is
it just some marketing ploy that's a
fantastic question that for like for GE
got complete messed up by at marketing
terms at t-mobile particularly like they
they just decided to turn like they they
called some version of some advanced
version of 3G they just decided one day
it's now 4G and like everyone kind of
like first they crapped on it then
they'd like joined in and then then the
term had no meaning and hey that's kind
of like our show what the 359 we got we
were like five seconds behind oh I think
we were pretty good today in the
beginning remember
when we first started doing the live
show and how many people were like what
the hell is this crap and now we
actually have like a moderate amount was
the amount of people kind of like us
well yeah it's very much very modest
anyways we're talking about what what's
the question
oh yeah 3G and then 4G got muddled in
terms of like oh yeah yeah I mean this
time around it's a lot clearer I think
everyone agrees as to what 5u looks like
what the standards are so it's not as
it's not gonna be as confusing they are
like I said using the plan to use 5g on
different bands of spectrum and that'll
that'll actually have a huge impact on
how fast the the network speeds are
gonna be but generally they're gonna be
10 to 100 times faster than what you're
getting now so either way it's gonna be
good I've got time for a couple more
questions this one's also from Mike Shaw
is 5g going to put internet in DSL out
of business
whoo yeah probably probably not I mean
that's what Verizon is up in for but
it's like I said that spectrum is pretty
finicky and it's gonna require a lot of
infrastructure to build out so I don't
know how scalable it is I imagine that
in some places 5g might be a good
alternative when you can't like lay down
actual like fiber copper but it's not
gonna I don't think it's gonna
completely displace like in like
landline infrastructure broadband
service like that so I think they're
gonna complement each other I think
that's a good way to put it I mean I
still think I want to have a hardwire
into my home yeah so yeah I'm just gonna
put that out there let's talk about
rollout before we say goodbye Scott is
excited for the employment implications
of 5g as an alternative for Wi-Fi in
rural areas where you can barely get
Wi-Fi do we see that as a future option
what kind of coverage can we expect and
how are they gonna roll this out they
can start picking select locations big
cities how are they gonna do this
because last time I checked goggle Fiber
fell flat on its face oh yeah well
Google Fiber Google really wanted this
so expensive it was actually put fiber
down and yeah just in terms of the the
markets it's gonna be
I don't know that they you know imagine
some of the larger markets will get
foggy first for and in terms of it being
like a home broadband replacement like
if you're if you're in like a rural area
you're not getting cell phone coverage
now I'm a little skeptical like they're
the carriers are promising 5g will help
with that I'm a little skeptical about
it we're actually launching another
series on rural broadband coverage
starting next week well we'll kind of
explore this topic and 5g will well
obviously be involved in the mix but
it's tough if you're if you're in a
rural area where there isn't a lot of
infrastructure now I mean chances are
even with 5g like 5g still requires
radios that are hung up everywhere and
so if if it's not there now there's less
likelihood that'll be there with 5g like
it'll still be a problem
for sure so we got one more for the road
this is an interesting thought have
there been any studies put into health
impact any research about and people are
always gonna ask you know oh you got
your cell phone in your pocket you got
the cancer or something like that
you got the cancer okay that was
probably insensitive what kind of
studies or information we have about the
effects on well-being with 5g waves yeah
there I mean there was a report out
earlier this year about it there haven't
been any I think traditional health
studies because just because those radio
Airways aren't out and being used as
extensively as is sufficient for a study
there's always that there's always
concerned that I think having that many
radio airwaves flying around you is not
a good thing
but at this point there hasn't really
been like a lot of concrete proof that
you know these signals are affecting you
in a materially negative way like I
guess it's it's it goes down to more
practical things like don't put your
phone to your head all the time like
though having in your pockets probably
not that much better but your brain
isn't in your pocket yeah exactly it's
not affecting your brain so that's
that's a big deal but it's yeah there
there aren't a lot of clear answers
there's obviously a lot of concern about
it and 5g serve we have to wait and see
once he's down watcher deployed what
what potential ramifications there are
with that but it's still it's a little
early to say all right and that's a
perfect way to end the show on our big
grand return after the little little
break we undertake thanks everybody for
joining us we'll be back one more time
tomorrow and then resuming regular
schedule next week actually yeah until
something else blows up in here thanks
again everybody for your patience and
we'll say goodbye now yeah the 359 is
available on iTunes tune in feedburner
stitcher google play music google
podcast the amazon echo of course
cnet.com we'll see y'all tomorrow
