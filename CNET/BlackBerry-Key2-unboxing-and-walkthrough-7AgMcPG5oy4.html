wants to have is big a screen as
possible but not the BlackBerry key to
the key to which updates last year's
blackberry key one is all about the
keyboard so let's unbox them I've got
the key two in black and in silver these
are both the 64 gigabyte version six
gigabytes of RAM let's take a look and
see what's inside the box
we've got the sleeve here and the box
just says blackberry key - and very
faintly embossed letters this is a very
similar box design as last year's key
wipe so not that much has changed there
our first glimpse of the phone is that
it has a sticker with a decal on the
front this is to show off the BlackBerry
security feature this is sort of a
mainstay legacy of the BlackBerry brand
this is provided by the actual
BlackBerry company that still exists
even though the phones are made by a
Chinese company that makes all two
Alcatel phones so I'm pulling off these
sticker tabs it's kind of nice there's
actually like a little tab off on the
side that makes it easy to pull this off
and so you're not digging your
fingernails into the plastic and that's
it just two pieces of plastic along the
top the front in the back which is
really nice so right now we are seeing
that there is a 4.5 inch screen this is
covered in Gorilla Glass right away I
noticed that the key 2 has a much more
refined design than last year's key 1
the sides are straighter this power
button moves from the left side of the
device to all three on the right side
and there's some texturing on this power
button here so that's kind of nice the
keyboard I'm gonna flip it around so it
faces me the buttons are larger
BlackBerry Mobile says the buttons are
20% larger on the key - and they lose
this glossy coating from the key one
which I didn't like hopefully that's
gonna make it a little bit grippier even
running my thumb over both keyboards I
feel a lot more separation with the key
- which is what you want because if
you're typing by feel means you'll be
able to identify that edges of those
keys otherwise the keyboard looks fairly
similar you still have the spacebar with
that indent
it gets a little bit bigger on the key
to the indentation is important because
not only can you slide your finger above
it but it also serves as the fingerprint
reader there is a brand new button on
the key too as well it's got nine dots
this is called the speed key and that is
what you use to trigger keyboard
shortcuts which we will get to later
right now I want to take a look at the
rest of the device actually I want to
see it in black first so we're gonna go
ahead and quickly do all the same things
open up the box there we go
tip out the phone and here it is in
black I don't think we need this plastic
so comparing the black to the silver
both devices have this kind of tacky
rubberized backing that's really great
for grip although it isn't the all glass
backing or even aluminum backing that
you find on a lot of phones today and
the silver model does have the
BlackBerry logo on the back that shines
through and silver a little bit better
so I would say that the silver model
stands out the black model is much more
discreet taking a look at the sides the
front top and bottom USB C charging port
and a headphone jack on both models I'm
gonna continue looking at the silver one
here okay so on the front we've got an 8
megapixel camera and on the rear we have
dual 12 megapixel cameras this is an
upgrade that means you get portrait mode
versus on last year's key one where you
had a single camera and new portrait
mode one of the biggest complaints about
the blackberry key one last year was
that the phone seemed to be pretty
expensive and didn't have as many of the
features that a lot of people want on a
modern smartphone but the story behind
the key one and key to phones is that
they're geared for people who really
want to be tactile users these are
people who like the BlackBerry promise
of greater security these are people who
want to be more productive and who like
the feeling of a physical keyboard this
is not a phone for gamers the processor
is a qualcomm snapdragon 660 so you're
really not going to be throwing a whole
lot of photo
or resource guzzling games at this it is
splash proof but it's not waterproof and
that has to do with the keyboard
all right I've taken us away from the
unboxing we're gonna get back to what's
in the box we've got the typical divider
and some literature that also includes
the SIM card ejector tool that's in here
there's the tool and there are the
pamphlets and we have the charger this
is a pretty big charging brick and the
phone does support quick charge 3.0
we've got some headphones to go along
with that headphone jack and the USB C
charging cable and that is it you've got
a nice sturdy box if you want to reuse
it for something else maybe organizing
your cables at home okay so I'm gonna
set up this phone and we'll come back
with a little more all right so I've
gone ahead and I started some of the
setup process on the key to and as with
most phones the key to will kind of give
you a tutorial to walk you through what
some of the more interesting features
are so we can see that you're seeing the
BlackBerry launcher here there's some
description on widgets and what you can
do with them and then the shortcut key
which is something that I alluded to
earlier this is called the speed key as
BlackBerry Mobile refers to it the main
point is that when you press the speed
key and then press your shortcut it will
either assign a shortcut if you don't
have one or it will launch the shortcut
that you have assigned when you swipe
off to the side you get the productivity
tab this is basically your hub so you
can easily look at calendar appointments
the weather your to-do lists one thing
that I really like about the keyboard in
addition to creating the tasks is just
the sensitivity here you know the
company has thought a lot about what you
can do with a physical keyboard in a
digital age so if I swipe across the
keyboard it's sensitive and I can
actually scroll I can go back and forth
and if I'm on a webpage I can scroll up
and down by simply moving my finger so
just now using the physical keyboard
I've got to say I'm so out of practice
that I'm very clunky and very bad on
this thing but I'm gonna go
I'm going to practice on it and I will
have a full rated review of the
BlackBerry key too soon so stick around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
