want to track my progress to see how I'm
doing there's a great way to do that
using an app called strava today I have
a nice short casual bike ride plan but
before I hit the road I want to plan my
route since I'm not really familiar with
this area to do that I'll head to Straub
is website and use their route builder
here it's really easy to find and create
routes based on what's popular in the
area you're exploring here I've got the
map pulled up and I'll go ahead and find
my starting point then I'll just keep
clicking until I finish building my
route and as I do that strava will give
me stats about the route that I'm
building so I've got elevation distance
and the estimated time it'll take for me
to complete the route based on previous
rides there's also this really cool
feature that lets me minimize the
elevations so if I'm trying to take it
easy and I don't want a big challenge I
can just enable this feature and strava
will rear out me so that it's as flat as
possible so the route gives me a grand
total of 1.1 miles and the estimated
moving time is about five minutes and 33
seconds at this point I'm gonna save my
route I'll give it a name Oakland
morning ride
save it and now I can head to strava on
my phone launch the app and my route
will be there so that I can follow it
when I'm actually on the road so I just
finished my beautiful trail ride and if
I hit finish in strava I can see exactly
how I did I've got a map showing me
exactly where I went yeah I have a ton
of stats I went 1.1 miles it took me six
and a half minutes and I've learned 53
calories not bad so even though there
are a lot of absolutely you track your
ride this is one of the better ones for
people who specifically want to get more
out of biking</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
