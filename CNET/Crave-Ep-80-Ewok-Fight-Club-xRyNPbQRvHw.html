experiencing the crave podcast and I'm
Donald Bell eric franklin Bonnie Shah
and I think you're forgetting someone
forgetting one person yeah oh no oh
Admiral Ackbar everyone run angel
happening behind me I'm panicking all
the time look at these little his little
arms a little disembodied are missing
Eric shot 20 is it yeah when you cut
Eric trying to fondle the lava lamp kind
of trying to milk this for all this
right now is doing welcome to the crave
podcast everyone we have another
exciting lineup of vaguely nerdy geeky
craveable news for you yeah it's not big
oh absolutely a hundred percent grade a
nerd quality news that's right yeah it
is so if you don't like it think it's
bland I think there's no point to the
show yeah well you have a point but be
like one of the other hundreds of
millions of people who prefer not to
watch this show but poor those corfu we
have another great one for you yes and
it starts with the marvell AR app for
comic books whoa we have an exclusive
for this app that's coming out April
second a 99-cent app that you can use to
get extras out of your comic books you
pointed at a specific panel a piece of
artwork and then you get this like 3d
augmented reality animation that comes
out or you get these extras where the
animator will come up and talk to you
about how amazing it is to be a marvel
comic animator in order illustrator and
then and then there's some other ones
where it'll go through the actual art
process and show you the original black
and white art and then the
coloring process and all that yeah
pretty cool you know a window into the
behind-the-scenes awesomeness of your
comic book yeah another dimension it's a
way to you know keep comic books or
paper comic books relevant right you
know giving you a little extra thing to
do but you know Seth does make a good
point in the video of you watching video
it is kind of awkward it would be kind
of awkward to what to read a comic with
the ipad hovering over a waiting for
that little icon the pop-up says you
didn't ideas only certain panels have
something yes reading that whole thing
the idea is that yes I can second if
you're watching a blu-ray and they have
that little thing where you're watching
blu-ray you get that little I comment
pop up like hey there's some extras to
the scene you can watch right now but
not every scene has that right but still
very cool especially the Iron Man Thing
he showed it to me um um last week the
marble came by with a demo of it and you
can actually in 3d but you know they
aren't that Iron Man model that came out
in 3d go around it and see a few
different angles and stuff like that
it's pretty cool it's cool yeah you can
kind of not really interact with it but
whoever's standing you got to have a
second a vigil there too yeah get in the
scene yeah you kind of fight yeah I
tried to find my lost but I got at least
I got a few hits in yeah good how do you
yeah so there's that but now here's the
thing it it does seem like kind of like
a weird meeting of like the old medium
and the new medium that could just be
simplified by having your iPad's comic
reading app be able to do that stuff
that'd be great right that'd be great
but like I said they're trying to keep
non digital comic comic relevant there I
think it I don't know I don't know
exactly I don't know why they don't just
go all digital at this point maybe other
than the fact that comic book shops
would close down right now um and
there's something to be said about comic
book shops I love comic book shops I i
still love going to comic book shop not
just a comic sister just a whole like
nerd feeling and there's like toys and
comics and games that you know
you wouldn't get at home on your iPad
right now we are talking about comic
experience come experience interest yes
great commotion yeah it goes there every
Thursday just to chat with oh yeah and I
said yeah yeah exactly so go there in
the mid nineties and and they would have
artists there and they would have
writers there will come there and sign
autographs and just hang out so you
don't really not gonna give head with a
at home digital yeah yeah so I
understand that especially even just
coming from a dead medium like physical
formats for meat for music yeah it makes
me I love record stores i love you know
moog story having worked in them and be
part of them of course i totally
understand that but it would be like
holding your iphone / CD to get the
audio extras on the CD when you could
just download all that crap varieties
and listened to it I don't know right it
seems like a desperate gesture to kind
of i mean i cool yet oddly desperate
gesture they're gonna get Mickey Lake it
seems it seems gimmicky no it does he
really does it yeah I I don't think it's
it's I think it's one of the things I
hate well let's just try it now you know
C&amp;amp;C you help you respond to it and they
I think things like this it's good to
get out and have people give their
feedback on it because the next version
of this could be something cooler you
know someone could someone could say you
know I really like this but you guys
tried this is like oh we didn't think of
that let's try that next time and it
might be something even more worthwhile
yeah yeah you know it's also always
better in real life was that that he
walks yeah I mean really can you compare
the experience of like a digital Ewok on
the screen that you're just trying to
reach out yeah our 21 you can actually
take or craft maybe even with your own
hands what if they try to hear you
though like they've been known to do
that they carry weapons they carry crude
but effective weapons I've seen this
I've seen that there's some documentary
footage documenting return of jedi have
you seen this guy
my father-in-law actually just picked up
recently like a DVD that has both like
the Battle of Endor and like that other
weird spin off one there's like two
spin-off Ewok I remember the forever
yeah well they came on TV yeah yeah
yeahs to never collected I'm like one
DVD was it was the one with the two kids
right there brother and sister ragga
older boy a young girl but don't don't
don't think it killed at some point my
gosh I see number I service remember
that in the second movie at the
beginning those two characters getting
killed off that I happen to my
misremembering this they're making this
out we should redo what we should make a
third one and making a trilogy yeah
where it's really like it's it's solid
it goes it goes dark you know where
really the kids are figment of the Ewoks
imagination right yeah they've created
them to get to compensate for the loss
because after the Battle of Endor like
all the humans were we'd love to stay
really blah but we gotta get yeah
there's some like or just a compensator
the psychotic split that occurred when
they accidentally speared them when they
first landed it killed them and felt
really horrible about it and right there
imagine selves follow them oh yeah sure
yeah you know and then it ends in a wok
Fight Club I'm all about it you walk by
could be pretty cool is yes these will
speak no more yeah great and sorry out
there yeah but we can we can actually
set a story boarding it we can get some
felt and some twigs and we can actually
make this like a live yet what are we
talking about here okay see the next
door DIY weekend project protect your
precious flowers with felt Ewoks oh man
and provide your own soundtrack
apparently everyone knows the worst of
this one right really looped it all
surely yeah alright so this is dubstep
he washe remix so this is a part of the
same DIY Star Wars crafting book that
Admiral sac bar over here was born from
a charge I was born from back ron wottus
attract uses the walks actually are
pretty good at setting up traps earlier
so should you be inspired to a derby
pursue the sack bar project or the Ewok
project we have a separate contest here
Bonnie maybe you can tell me about the
posture because I have no idea are

crafting will have no end about hey it's
just me fall down the rabbit hole of
craft you walk villages Admiral Ackbar's
we fall down the exhaust port of
crafting it's the less an explosion of
glitter and felt that will shake the
universe alright then you have to
rebuild never I know you can gonna stop
I'm gonna sound I think you should keep
going and going down that exhaust pipe
alright so enter that contest because
the winners being picked tomorrow wow
you got it you got a craft right now
well it doesn't even well keep listening

huge toy clutch that used to be me yeah
we we got one entry that's gonna be
pretty hard to be already keeps any man
yes
good I want to see that we will will
definitely will hopefully by next week
will also watch winner and will have a
gallery so all right it was excellent
all right more on the digital crafting
the more hackery DIY crafting than the
fealty Star Wars II glittery gluey
crafty we have the piccolo draw bot a
seventy dollar assemble yourself robot
here with an adorable little video hmm
that you can you can program to draw
something specific or you can make to be
honest a self-aware what am I trying to
say autonomous so that it can pull in
data from like how much light is around
it and then make a little drawing of a
tree whose size and you know
characteristics are defined by the light
input yeah or like it can receive
information over the web and somehow the
you know you could have it respond and
make a little animated not animate a bit
little generative art based on your
Twitter feed or something I don't know
is it seems like a cool little hackable
seventy dollar gizmo for people who are
in the Arduino hacking kind of thing
right I want that to be me you want this
I almost if don't yeah if i had money to
spare order it now and then figure it
out later because it's yums yeah I can
feel the desiring you right now I do I
would totally have just like some
butcher paper on my desk and I while I'm
working I would have the little piccolo
draw a lot just kind of makes me
generative tree art yeah and then no
matter how happy my day is on the power
a series of mustaches that makes me
forget about my problems yeah and that's
the idea that you have a little drawing
that you can take with you it's like oh
how can I be mad at my boss yes for not
giving me that promotion mustaches on my
outlet oh this is that my side stories I
actually have another
draw bot that I ordered like two years
ago almost that is it uses like to servo
motors and you hang it on a wall Tom
several yeah I'm not terms / mo but then
it makes a like a mandala like drawing
like lettuce like a bagel Mandela super
cool circle oh wait a turn of the school
yeah dauntless um I never assembled it I
like I never had a wall to kind of use
it on yeah and I I didn't want to like
the one mole I do have my house is kind
of blank and ready I don't want to get
butcher paper out but so I never had put
it together uh I still have it but this
one seems cool because you just have it
like on your desk in it and it has two
points of articulation right it can not
you can draw you know horizontally yeah
sure I can also adjust for pressure like
so like mustaches it can kind of raise
itself up to make little no I don't see
why you don't have this already yeah I
know you can keep my other draw but you
know company yeah they can be friends
baby buddies strontium maybe draw buddy
yay even a close Admiral Ackbar has some
has agree with that doesn't yeah in that
DIY spirit we have the photo gallery of
various projects yes of what is this
guy's name I'm missing it now David
Kramer Kramer yes grammar who has a
pretty amazing collection of oddities
that he's made including a a theremin
that has been stuffed into the
taxidermied carcass of a badger yeah it
makes yeah why wouldn't you do that I
mean really when it because playing a
theremin is one of the most annoying
activities anyone can undertake it but
if it's there's a furry badger
very bad kind of forgive it any better
imagine here makes it a theremin inside
his body my favorite one though and I
put the link to the video for this next
to it on to the right of it is this a
this gnome this quartet of cam driven
dancing gnomes it's a pretty simple
little device but it's has a little
motor and the motor drives a little belt
over on the left-hand side there and
that just tries these little alternating
camshafts that no make us as a numb damn
it seems at least sexual i don't know i
think it's the rhythm of those rotating
things just I kind of want this to be my
alarm clock i'll keep you to set this to
a timer oh they go faster you yeah they
have different settings these gnomes and
then you could play like the Ewok
village you know the celebration song
sure I'd be pretty great I'm glad we got
a points right like that would be a
great day yeah you should check out the
gallery up it's in the will be in the
show notes there's about 10 different
photos here for the different projects
he's done they're all pretty crazy but
the badgermin and the he doesn't look at
me I'm still lying in my blame is still
working alright and then in oh not quite
not quite my second favorite segment but
let's also get this Hammacher Schlemmer
how could I speak as much swimmer the
Hammacher Schlemmer okay what is this
they have now for us a killer whale
submarine Oh hundred thousand dollars
you can get your own two-person
submersible how I know it reaches like a
real killer whale kit Adi this is not
this is not exist it's sad those are
lockups right no no it's real you can
get a pan that can be yours it jumps out
of the water like that yes and you
should also can enlarge the or click on
the smaller photo there that enlarges
and then you can see the view that has
you can see the two people in yeah
absolute is that and the one guys like
trying like right cause way out of the
other guys probably laughing maniacally
that way Thank You area exactly as body
in the background thank you you're never
laid a trap I've trapped you in here
this actually would be the perfect
little getaway vehicle for Admiral
Ackbar right sacré or either one yeah
sure yeah because yeah when he and then
he would get in his escape pod and will
be shaped like this killer whale
submarine screw all you losers amanha
here off the party with Zoidberg find
your own kernel where I like that I like
that I love this thing this thing is
yeah too bad I'm not rich maybe someday
some yeah that's what this that's the
illusion they they want you to believe
alright we won't get it alright so for
my second favorite segments that I've
only really started as of last week
choose the form of the destruct er this
week I am choosing the DeLorean
quadricopter or a quadcopter what do you
what do you have against this yeah why
is this because this is the it before
the analogy this is to stay puft
marshmallow man you don't think that
this is the thing that's gonna kill you
right no you know and it looks really
cool it light has the eel lighting on
the side make it look like this
futuristic DeLorean that's going to go
up into the air fly you to the Future II
futuris it runs on mr. fusion runs on
like you know garbage right but we've
seen what these quadricopter 'he's can
do we have right yes they're not all
this cute little throwback to your
childhood memories of
of your favorites pretty cute to me know
all right now custom the second video
there's a second of video underneath it
once it gets combined with this
technology well that was just the cutest
thing I know I think I probably want to
get one now well the frozen tundra a
little better de Lorean quadcopter feel
like a better person because I saw that
yeah next segment then huh ok and then
oh my god tiny swarms of them and
they're all going to like autonomously
figure out where they are and where
they're buddies are and how they're
going to take you over and release
little microbots that are going to eat
out your eyeballs and then just leave
your corpse by the side of the frozen
Road like shaking yes we have alive yeah
instead of a snuff film wait till they
organized now oh man are you afraid yet
look where's the ride of the Valkyries
those could be DeLoreans don't be fooled
there's a retired immoral multiplied and
that buzzing sound is the last sound
you'll hear all right I think you should
do a voiceover to that that video well
that the heads aksam yeah that's kind of
like a yes the gallon sista just a
reading of the first chapter of Cormac
McCarthy's the road sure you know yeah
exactly and there is a movie Donald well
they're playing double oh seven yeah see
again they're trying to make us like
them love you guys like music that's
vaguely funny sounding is that cute
adorable communing with jumping and
stuff what's sad is after they've killed
us all this is what they're gonna yeah
yeah we just won we just wanting all
your instruments right play music that's
all we wanted except all the instruments
will be made out of art you know frozen
entry are you like the best
we've learned that um yes humans
actually do delicate guitar strum make
the best insurance I i I don't I don't
share your fear that it looks I i guess
i'm thinking more selfishly about how i
can take those in control I give you can
use them be argues for my own evil
domination of at least San Francisco
right yeah well and that would be the
form of the destruction then right
you're right you be like clear minds
think of nothing yeah I'm like whoops I
thought of the gist DeLorean from Back
to the Future it's not good and what can
I do why would I yes mr. fusion everyone
loves him all right now for everyone's
favorite segment meanwhile doom doom
doom doom this is actually atmos
Ackbar's favorite segments mm-hmm I love
it it's a trap don't do it don't believe
I listened to the segment um yes big
news this week mm-hmm you guys if I say
The Lone Ranger Oh what are the feelings
you get when I say that name like Donald
when I say The Lone Ranger will what
what conjures in your mind uh white
cowboy hats and a Scots alright Bonnie
the hi ho silver the all right okay now
see my question is okay so they released
the first shot of they're making a new
well they're making a lone ranger movie
starring johnny depp and armie hammer
the guy from the social network we
played the twins um and they released it
for a shot and Stevie you can put that
up there ah so that's Johnny Depp in the
background is tanto the lone Ranger's uh
faithful Native American companion and
this you know
Hannah Ernie hammer as the lone ranger
that you know with a mask in the white
hat and everything just like you said um
that's not quite a Scott those more just
like an X yeah that's what I was meant
yeah yeah don't yeah exactly um I see
that and I'm excited personally but I'm
also an old man I don't know that this
movie needs to be made like I don't like
guys like even as a like Wells grown up
in the late 70s or early eighties like
Lone Ranger cart in the cartoons but
Lone Ranger reruns on TV fifties reruns
they're awesome I love watching it I
don't know how races they were already
buddy I had no idea all I know is that I
love I love the the music I forgot the
name of that tune but you know what the
horns and everything and you know just
beginning that very the intro when he's
on silver and stuff and with his
faithful pregnant comparing intanto and
all the stuff I loved it hmm but kids
don't care about westerns any more like
you they're putting so much money into
this movie they're putting like two
hundred million dollars into his movie
they got gore verbinski that parts of
the Caribbean dude to direct it I don't
see the point of doing this I feel like
is this gonna be like sweat Hollywood
your ranking yes yes but a West like
each they try cowboys in the aliens last
year right right I saw them we recently
loved it I thought was great but I don't
think that you can effectively market a
Western these days especially a 200
million dollar western and get your
money back I don't know what are your
feelings on is you think kids are over
westerns is it doesn't matter if it's a
westerner it just matters well i was
actually i was reading an admit that i
was reading wired recently and they were
talking about what's the new the john
carter movie yes and they're like
example how they like Disney had had the
rights to that from like the 70s r yeah
like earlier than that sure and they
they just either couldn't make it the
way they wanted to or people pick it up
and not make it you know wasn't but then
they and then they were out of the like
assumption that kids just wouldn't
likely not a budget they would have to
put into this to make it work right
wouldn't pay off because who goes out
and sees just wild sci-fi movies anymore
right and then avatar
aim and later Oh apparently people love
this ass exactly we should why should
you know really fast track John Carter
to get the Avatar momentum what the
thing is it's by that point is too late
right because avatar takes from that
story Star Wars lift some that story
heavily Star Trek everything that story
is really written like what 90 years ago
something like that you know ACC now you
figure it's derivative of all right when
kids see that looks like a lame version
of avatar to me you know so well the
point is being like you can't really
ever predict what is suddenly going to
be the hotness right sure the same way I
would think with pirates of the
caribbean they made the worst ones be
like tech is gonna go out and see a
movie about a Disney ride yeah that way
I think you're gonna miss out on some
really you think they're taking the
chance yeah when why not if someone I I
want to see that movie don't get me
wrong like i like i said i'm a fan you
know man like they read they made some
pretty cool Lone Ranger comics recently
they were kind of like mature and
whatever and it was really good to john
kasay did art really good art um but I
just I don't know I look at that I'm
like I don't know if that's going to
capture the imagination of the utes
right today also the Western thing has
the cowboy western thing has done well
in these different areas like red dead
redemption for gaming sure or even like
trying to the defense of the big hit
movie with that just was out recently
won again young guns not younger true
grit yeah like when I feel a trooper
yeah I get it cuz it's from the 20 years
ago um that's really hard to watch do it
came on TV recently I'm like oh I
remember loving this and like oh my god
it's really horrible is it really it's
like it that 80's Western think of me in
the 90s anyways bowels going to say like
the TV series like there's the new one
that's like the the railroad magnate was
just like rules with an iron fist it's
like the guy who's from Star Trek next
generation playing in
anyways and then there's dead was this
like that whole deadwood series Deadwood
yeah that will put aren't those things
that appeal more to older audiences yes
right um and this I I guess and if older
audiences can take this film and lift it
and make their money back great I just
feel like I don't know how much kids are
gonna be into westerns but it may be you
know I don't know how much kids are
going to be in the pirates he likes I
think hooking Johnny Depp into it's a
good thing cuz if you loved him as a
pirate you'll love him as Tonto you'll
know how his e60 whatever America
hearing about pirate with a dead bird on
his head right yes um okay cool what
happens i don't know i don't know like
like you said about John Carter I feel
like there's they have to be careful
with this move they have to show from
the get-go Lone Ranger this is cool kids
like I felt like the the marketing for
cowboys and aliens really did a
disservice not showing the coolness of
it but just showing like the Western I
feel like I should have it should have
been more of a bait and switch type of
thing because if you watched a movie
it's actually really well written uh
there's you know they're great character
development and stuff like that
character depth are in this ends but
it's kind of slow it's kind of a slow
movie it's not a all out action all the
time but it's interesting the whole time
it's compelling the whole time but I
felt like the the trailers in the
marketing for the movie didn't you
really really get to show that and then
when people see the name like I remember
even in theater and when I saw the
trailer and people saw the name and that
just punch a laughter and I don't think
they gave audiences too much credit like
yes call Cowboys and Aliens but that's
where that we don't mean that as a joke
that's just the name of it I don't you
know as yeah you can't you can't figure
it out immediately if it supposed to be
camping or cool or like knowingly ya
happy what was like a cool in spite of
this game name is knowingly campy we get
that we have a family because we get
that work we are in on the joke of the
name but the movie is actually well done
in serious you know so he comes from too
much sides out of up alice is good this
is where the true geekery comes out
yeah I like it also there's been a new
trailer for transformers 4 i outweigh is
that not transfer mode it's battleship
it's a new battleship trailer you guys
seen this but we should play it we
should plan because I like this direct I
like Peter Berg he did a hancock he did
um the other movie with Jason Bateman
and Gene Wolfe yes a Teen Wolf 25 years
ago it was a it was a war film oh man
was it gets just when Jay come play guys
it was awesome no one side no it was
awesome had like the most visceral last
action scene at the minimal views it was
all so anyway I like the director he did
he's doing battleship so let's check out
the trailer sir you may want to come
take a look at this where did we find it
just fished him right out of the water
warning red
weapons tight
when everything loaded
the debris field from that is gonna
cover the entire hemisphere
it's still unclear exactly what it was
that hit Hong Kong
why didn't he just kill us off
the hell are you doin to us
those sims could do this
what do you think 50 can do or 500,000
we're looking at listings what are your
orders we're not going down without a
fight
dad
now that is how you make a freaking
action trailer okay that's how you get
audiences hey remember that thing you
like last year well this is pretty much
that um with a new coat of paint paint
on it it is like it takes the best of
Michael Bay trailers right and like
Titanic um and just like oh and put
through a pretty girl face in there
Rihanna and like everyone's gonna go I
bet this movie makes tons of money
because of its like like that just that
very transformers derivative look it has
and the trailer is like the scrimmage
the building cuts that have just like in
the trailer in transformers it's the
same thing come on I mean with that is
smart marketing man that's I don't know
like I want to see that movie now like I
had no interest and see that movie and
only like transformers but something
says you know this is just like a better
transformers because well Peter Berg I
like him but I bet I bet everyone dies I
that though that will not happen ah no
they don't want that to happen I just
feel like like someone saw transformers
like a Milton Bradley executive right
who's gonna do a new spin-off of
battleship the game but now with like
alien ships on one side yeah right that
guy and a recruitment officer from the
Navy sat down there like you know what
we need we need one we need more we
create our own transformers take place
on the see if we can sell video game or
not video games a board game what do you
see the beginning says from Hasbro
makers of transformers like not the
movie but the toys remember the toys
it's the same company it's all like just
she just communicator don't worry we'll
take care of you will give your
explosion right you're transforming
robots will give you got enough money
just cut a Chechen IOM and don't tell
make the building split in half for
exactly we have those libraries way that
that's a building split in half we are
we got ya you don't I and I usually love
those kind of movies to it what is it
about it that's turning you off is this
it might be Rihanna huh oh come on I
don't know i just it
I don't know that was for a navy
recruitment purposes really you know
they're like look you stuck on a ship
with Rihanna I'm trying to know why
maybe chicks look just like this yeah um
dizzy no maybe it's because it does feel
like another Transformers movie yeah so
you're you're saying that then your
title Transformers movies I I'm trying
to attach on me yeah these twos but some
reason only shoes anyway that movie I
was talked about before with that Peter
Berg directed call the kingdom pretty
awesome movie action movie with Jamie
Foxx and Chris Cooper engine learner I
do hope that this sparks a trend for
more movies tied into board games though
that'd be pretty great like Ouija the
booth yeah Candyland operation operation

pants there's this giant robot and say
transform we gotta take him out now
