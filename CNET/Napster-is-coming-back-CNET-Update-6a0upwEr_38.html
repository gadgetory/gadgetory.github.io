news you might be asking yourself what
year is it I assure you it is in fact
2016 music streaming service Rhapsody
announced it will be globally rebranding
as Napster in the summer Rhapsody was
already using the Napster name in
countries outside of the United States
you guys remember Napster right it was
this amazing music discovery tool
created by John Fanning Shawn Fanning
and Shawn Parker back in 1999 it allowed
you to share your music library with
others and anyone could download anyone
elses library this was and still is
highly illegal Napster was basically
sued out of existence after Napster's
bankruptcy its brand was sold off to
rock Co then Best Buy and then finally
Rhapsody in December 2011 where after
his official announcement was quite
short here's an excerpt Napster is
coming no changes to your playlist
favorites albums and artists same
service same price
now Rhapsody announced it had nearly 3.5
million subscribers back in December
2015
Apple recently announced its Apple music
service past the 15 million subscriber
mark Spotify pulls in about 30 million
paid subscribers with those numbers it
definitely looks like an uphill battle
for the new Napster best of luck to you
