safety in a car speed intoxication
weather conditions and less often
discussed the age of your car you have
less control over that of course it's a
lot easier to slow down not have that
drink than to go buy a new car but
knowing the risks of an older vehicle is
important data from mitzvahs fatality
analysis reporting system from the years
2005 to 2011 found the older the car
you're in during a crash the more likely
it is you'll come out dead compared to a
baseline new car that is zero to three
years old if you are 10 percent more
likely to die in a car that is just 4 to
7 years old all the way up to a sobering
71 percent more likely in a car that is
18 years or older hi wagons 25 years old
but I believe I pay attention on the
road and slow the hell down
by the way the research data also shows
that this affects the likelihood of
teens to be in a fatal car accident
because they tend to buy and use older
more affordable cars also know that
being buckled up in a newer car is more
effective the being buckled up in an
older car in a newer car you see belts
airbags structural improvements and more
all work together as a system not a
bunch of little islands the list of
innovations that make newer cars safer
is long but here are some of the
greatest hits electronic stability
control required on cars since the 2012
model year a rockstar technology
reducing fatal rollovers by 70% and all
fatalities by 14% in cars double that in
SUVs intelligent airbags and lots of
them only since 2006 have cars been
required to use airbags that factor in
size weight and position of the
occupants to blow better on impact with
less collateral damage and in the last
10 years automakers have been on a bit
of an arms race to have more bags than
the other guy
abs still not legally required on cars
in the US but I haven't seen a new car
without it since about 2012 improve
rollover standards rollovers account for
just 3% of all serious crashes but about
30 percent of people killed in cars the
latest update to roof crush standards
came in 2009 for full phase in between
2012 and 2017 and of course there are
the newer tech innovations like adaptive
headlights front collision blind spot
and lane departure tech and night vision
screens along with head-up displays so
unless you're lucky enough to be buying
a new car every three years
it pays to double-check the shortcomings
of your aging one and drive safely
