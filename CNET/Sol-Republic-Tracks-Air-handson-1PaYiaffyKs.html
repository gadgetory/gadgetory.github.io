cnet.com and I'm through with these Sol
Republic tracts air wireless headphones
these are the Bluetooth version of soul
Republic's popular tracks headphones
they look almost identical but there is
no cord you can attach a cord to them
that you come with a cord but they're
meant to be listened in Wireless mode
and they're a good sounding bluetooth
headphone they cost $200 they better
sound good for that price and they
deliver a lot of bass that's the
signature soul Republic a lot of bass
and decent clarity for Bluetooth
headphones I did like them overall they
have a good design they have the
removable engines the headband has the
conductor right inside it which is kind
of cool the metal conductor so you just
pull off the actual engines and you pull
them off and pull them on again and you
have a few buttons on the headphones
themselves for call answer end as well
as skipping tracks forward and back
these are under the Motorola Sol
Republic brand and they come in black
and white the one small issue I had with
them is the fit these are really
designed more for people with a bigger
head I have a little bit smaller head
so the actual headband ends up looking a
little long with people who have smaller
heads also the ear pads pinch a little
bit on your top of the year so if you do
have glasses like I do you might get a
little bit of a pinch so these are
probably little bit better suited for
people with larger heads in terms of
battery life these are rated at 15 hours
so you should be able to get through a
full day and they do charge via micro
USB so all in all a good wireless
headphone it's well built it sounds good
for a bluetooth headphone it's a little
pricey at $200 I like to see these
headphones more in the $150 range but it
certainly is worth considering if you
are looking for a bluetooth headphone
especially one that delivers a lot of
bass I'm David Karn away and that's the
soul Republic track there thanks for
watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
