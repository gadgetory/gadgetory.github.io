Google Chromebook you've probably heard
of these little computers the big appeal
is their price most models come in at
under $400 while some even retail for as
low as $300 these low priced computers
from Google's cloud based operating
system known as Chrome OS which relies
on internet connection to run most apps
well this can be extremely useful with
no connection it becomes a real pain
most people aren't aware however that
Chrome OS actually runs the Linux
operating system and these computers are
capable of much more than you think
today I'm going to show you how to run
both Chrome OS and you boon to a popular
Linux operating system on your
Chromebook I recommend using at least an
Intel Chromebook rather than a RM
version because Linux programs are more
compatible with the Intel model it also
helps to use some sort of external
storage such as a flash drive or an SD
card so you have more space to install
additional programs so let's get started
the first thing you must do is enable
the Chromebooks developer mode this will
erase anything you may have stays on the
devices internal storage press and hold
the escape and refresh Keys then press
the power button the Chromebook will
then reboot into recovery mode press the
ctrl and D Keys together when you see
the yellow exclamation point and then
press ENTER to confirm the developer
mode you will hear two loud beeps this
is normal simply sit back and wait for
the process to complete it could take up
to 10 minutes don't panic if you see a
red exclamation point after it's done
just wait and the Chromebook will reboot
into Chrome OS next you will have to
download a tool known as crouton which
you can find the link in my article sign
in to the Chromebook download the tool
and save it to your download folder then
press ctrl alt T to bring up the
Chromebooks terminal type in shell and
hit enter then type in this code in the
command line crouton will take some time
to install once it's complete enter a
username and password you would like to
use to enter Ubuntu type the command
sudo start unity in the terminal when in
Ubuntu click on the first icon on the
left hand side of the screen sir
for the terminal open it and type in
sudo apt-get update in the command-line
when that's complete type sudo apt-get
install Software Center
this will allow you to easily install
various Linux programs simply open the
software center and search for the
program you want or download from the
company's website and open it and
install it in the software center to get
back to Chrome OS press the ctrl alt and
back keys together control all forward
followed by control alt refresh can be
used to return to Ubuntu you can also
open the chrome OS terminal type in
Shell followed by sudo start unity
either or works one thing you will
notice is that takes longer for the
Chromebook to power on when you see the
yellow exclamation point simply press
control D to speed up this process if
you want to return the Chromebook back
to normal
simply restart the computer and when you
see the yellow exclamation point press
the spacebar followed by the Enter key
for more detailed information including
the links you'll need to get the job
done check out my article on how to dub
