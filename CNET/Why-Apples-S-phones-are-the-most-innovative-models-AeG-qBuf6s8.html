out we're left wondering is this yet
another incremental upgrade from Apple
maybe Apple is just giving people with
the previous s phone something to
upgrade to but could it be that the s
phones are actually the most innovative
iPhones it started six years ago with
the iPhone 3GS that was the first and
last time Apple told us what s actually
stood for speed it stands for speed it
also brought video recording more
storage a compass and oh yeah voice
control calling a friend with a voice
command didn't sound innovative but it
did lay the groundwork for what would
later become one of the iPhones killer
features two years in a new iPhone
design later the 4s launched and with it
came Siri it also brought up to 64 gigs
of storage Apple's first dual-core
processor and a kick-ass camera Siri
didn't seem like a big deal but today
the virtual assistant is the control
center for getting things done on
products beyond the iPhone want to turn
off your home kit compatible light bulbs
Siri can help can't figure out who's in
that movie playing on your 4th gen apple
TV Siri can do that too
next the iPhone 5s came along and while
its camera improved everything else did
feel like an incremental upgrade except
for one thing
touch ID some manufacturers like
Motorola tried it before but this was
the first time we saw user friendly
fingerprint scanning on a smartphone and
it really worked but besides unlocking
your phone it didn't do much it was only
later that we discovered that touch ID
would let us unlock third-party apps and
most importantly it was a cornerstone of
Apple pay the iPhone 6s is here and
we're left searching for clues that
point to the future of the iPhone it's
camera is improved in now shoots 4k
video and it's front-facing camera will
give you the sharpest selfies ever and
there's 3d touch pushing in and doing
what feels like an Android long press
might feel gimmicky but the potential is
greater than that imagine different
types of presses a lighter press brings
up a menu but a deeper press could do
something like take you to the home
screen ultimately 3d touch could be the
home button killer it's safe to say that
the S phones have gotten a bad rap
and some are saying that the 6s is yet
another forgettable upgrade but looking
back the features of the S phones
introduced are what make the iPhone so
successful and right now it's looking
like the iPhone 6s is no exception
