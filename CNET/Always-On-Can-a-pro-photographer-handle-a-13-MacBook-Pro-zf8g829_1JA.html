photographer you are in theory the
perfect market for the MacBook Pro 13
inch with Retina display so what I want
you to do is take this and use it as
your ideally your primary machine for a
few weeks use this little GoPro right
here to record your thoughts and then
we're actually even gonna company you on
a photo shoot yes
to see what you think I'm excited can I
tell you I'm excited about the computer
but I'm really excited about this -
nobody does that was a photographer
target I want like Oh computer yeah
well good luck with your two toys thank
you
all right cool I'm excited to play with
this new 13-inch MacBook Pro that I have
here thank you seen it and especially
excited to play with it to compare it
with this my existing or my own computer
which is this 15-inch MacBook Pros the
Retina display model so the first thing
we do is I'm going to take this thing
out of the box here is the box brand-new
box here and there it is one hand open
this one up so there's a 15-inch and
it's baby brother the 13-inch just feel
so much lighter no it's only a couple
grams lighter but it just feels so much
lighter I don't know I love the same
size keyboard but I didn't feel like I
can type faster on this one
I don't know it's something about that
small screen that just makes it feel
like it's a little bit more intimate
than the large screen like it feels like
work versus not so much work my first
impressions of it were first of all I
loved it it's just light I love the
weight of it
the initial disappointment and surprises
I guess were that this one had less hard
disk space for my apps and media and
then also the RAM so the RAM on this
thing maxes out at 8 where I can I can
go to 16 on the bum at 15 and now I'm
going to download Lightroom because
that's the software we're going to be
using when I photograph the model turn
to your right just a little bit here you
go right there
hold it you the part okay turn to the
left just a little bit look off into the
distance good just like that
hold it beautiful
she's very photogenic the big thing that
I loved about the devices you know
insights I'm just opening it up in that
new toy feel was just being able to get
my work done on it being able to use
Lightroom in a usable manner with this
device and being it'll do it anywhere
you know words can't really describe how
cool it is to be able to do your
photography work and then pack pack up
your computer and slip it in your camera
bag and go you know coming from an 11
inch MacBook Air initially and then
having a 15 inch the 13 inch fits right
in the middle it's the Goldilocks
computer for photographers and I say
that because of it gives you some of the
power of the 15 inch and some of the
weight savings of the 11 inch it's right
in the middle it's great if I was going
to make a recommendation to
photographers I'd say get it if you care
at all about weight</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
