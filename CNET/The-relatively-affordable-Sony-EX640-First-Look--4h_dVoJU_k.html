and from our poll we know that about one
in five of our readers are then this is
one of the models you should be looking
out for hi I'm Ty Pendlebury and this is
a review of the Sony exc television this
is one of Sony's mid-range models and in
many ways it's much better than the more
expensive HX 750 with the only real
difference being that the ax 640 doesn't
have 3d this is an edge lip television
with a decent set of features this TV is
slowly being superseded by the e x 645
though but the only difference is that
the other one has onboard wireless while
this TV has a wireless USB dongle
otherwise they're pretty much identical
this TV has smart TV but the menu system
is quite simple and arguably better with
easy access to Netflix and Hulu you can
also access Sony's Entertainment Network
if you subscribe to its music and movie
services the design of the TV is quite
smart with an attractive stippled bezel
and a swivel stand picture quality is
very good for the money and better than
Samsung's mid-range competitor the es
6500 black levels are fairly deep for an
LCD though shadow detail could be a
little better color saturation is
excellent but the colors aren't as
accurate as they could be if you need a
decently performing LCD and don't need
3d then the e X 640 and 645 are very
good choices I'm ty Pendlebury from
