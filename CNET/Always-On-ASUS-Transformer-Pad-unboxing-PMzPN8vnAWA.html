transformer pad infinity tf700 like
because that's no iPad right there assu
seems to come out with a new tablet
about every couple of weeks all of them
purported iPad killers and they have
become very popular for this transformer
concept which means that the tablet fits
nicely into an additional keyboard dock
although don't be fooled by the picture
of the keyboard on the box because this
keyboard is not in this box but let's
have a look at what is the transformer
pad is running Android 4.0 Ice Cream
Sandwich it has a 10.1 inch LCD display
and a quad-core Tegra 3 processor so it
is great for gaming one gigabyte of RAM
helps out that performance the weight is
one point three pounds so it is a little
bit heavy the colors are amethyst grey
and champagne gold you also get micro
HDMI and a micro SD card slot it's Wi-Fi
only no 3G connectivity here and it
comes in 32 gigs or 64 gig capacity
there's an eight megapixel camera on the
back and a nice two megapixel camera on
the front for video conferencing the
screen is very high resolution 1920 x
1200 pixels the other thing these two
sous tablets are becoming known for is
that they look really good this one is
no exception it's extremely thin and
light and has this brushed metal back
here comes in two colors and then and
really this is the kind of transformer
part in that transformer name you plug
it into this dock here and you actually
have a usable tablet with a keyboard now
on the face of it there's really nothing
wrong with the Asus Transformer blobbity
blobbity for the really long name the
problem is that it's not an iPad but
it's priced like an iPad it's 499 or 5
99 and then this cool doc that makes it
all transformer II and useful and extra
150 bucks I'm sorry guys but you're
never going to beat the iPad unless
you're cheaper than the iPad</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
