reporter I'm here with Janina gavankar
you might recognize her from True Blood
she played Luna the shapeshifter and
also from NBC's the mysteries of Laura
where she plays detective Meredith Bose
we're going to do a rapid-fire QA to
test your tech cred tech cred okay fine
yes let's go so it's about 20 questions
20 okay fine but I think you'll be
alright
alright let's say you can have three
passes okay some that are too hard
basically they're either/or questions
and you have to say which one you prefer
or identify with all right so first Star
Wars or Star Trek Star Wars or Star Trek
Star Trek all right
follow-up question okay okay Kirk or
Picard okay why because he's he's so
classy all right what about Batman or
Superman okay that is so hard I mean a
which versions i'ma tell you
embarrassing sorry so there was like
nobody on TV that looked even close to
me that I could identify with except
teri hatcher was kind of like very tan
so I thought that she looked I don't
know I got my hair cut to look like hers
and my first AOL handle was one of you
Louis so I guess I have to choose
Superman but then the Dark Knight is a
really good fight for that okay so it's
a that's almost a toss-up but super
toss-up but yeah I guess Superman guys
regard so follow up Superman's dad's
jor-el rockin yeah pocket yeah
okay um middle Midwestern I'm from
Joliet Illinois so okay DC or marvel oh
god these are so hard um Marvel they're
doing more interesting stuff right now
in my opinion but you are on a show
based on yeah you're so what um Android
or iOS iOS maybe but not because it's
only because it's Oh only because it's
just in my pocket right now right I
could change at any moment a theory of
the moment iOS okay Facebook or Twitter
I can't say either I find them to be
very different and equally important so
pass passing on yeah Steve Jobs or Steve
Wozniak
jobs unicode or ASCII ascii my last
Twitter icon was like half asking I took
I took like my ideas photoshoot and I
took my face and I like morphed them
together in Photoshop and so it's like
an echo of me and asking Dumbledore or
Gandalf Gandalf all the way which one
the gray or the white that's for you
that's for me I like the gray why
because I don't know I like the
old-school stuff better I like a little
old-school okay all right
PC gaming or console gaming console oh
oh I'm so sorry to anybody who's a PC
gamer no judgment when I'm console like
I'm like I don't care it's all about the
game so I would play it on PC will
follow up Playstation or Xbox irrelevant
role of it's all about the game all
about the game Sonic or Mario Mario it's
me Mario yeah Mario master chief or
Gordon Freeman Gordon Freeman old school
shuffling zombies or new school fast
zombies even on the the shuffling makes
sense it does make sense but we don't
know what's gonna cause the zombie
apocalypse
so if Rage is the thing that am i
referencing 28 days later there's a lot
of zombies yes fast zombies that's
obvious uh I think that that makes more
sense in my brain that they're shuffling
but I think that the world can have both
so pass there's room in the world room
in the world for any kind of deal you
know where zombie inclusive we want you
know we want you to feel very included
in whatever zombie you'll turn into we
accept all of you and you passed that's
it that's it
you did a great job oh no there's no mic
to toss but thank you Janina gavankar
I'm Joe Saul's interesting it
