every new smartphone attempts to outdo
the last one but they all end up
sporting the same basic design time to
shake things up I'm Vanessa and Arianna
and today I'll be counting down the top
5 craziest looking smartphones you can
buy starting in at number 5 the Samsung
Galaxy s6 edge alright so our definition
of crazy here at CNN may be a little axe
but there's no arguing that the slight
curves on either side of its screen have
managed to turn heads and while the note
4 edge boasted a similar design to
curves are better than one and they
serve a completely different purpose on
this s6 a let's be real here they're
mostly for show but this phone certainly
edges out the competition in the looks
department
and speaking of curves number four on
our list is the LG G flex 2 with its art
silhouette and flexible display it's
slightly more exotic than the previous
contender and cheaper this is the second
curved phone LG releases and I'm still
not clear what purpose it serves as it
has no added functionality to its arch
but perhaps LG was merely trying to
prevent an iphone six-plus like fiasco
by preemptively molding the phone to
your relax and coming in at number three
the Oppo and three it looks like a
hybrid between a little 80s robot and a
smartphone but those aren't really eyes
on the top it's actually a rotating
camera that moves according to the
subject so for all use selfie lovers out
there and you know who you are this
means you can capture every last pixel
of your lovely face on the phone's main
and only 16 megapixel camera it gets an
A for effort but the phone itself is not
quite as good as its camera not crazy
enough for you how about number 2 on our
list the dual screened Yoda phone -
that's Yoda with a team guys sorry this
two-faced phone has a 5 inch main screen
in full color in Full HD
then eating display on its backside the
idea is that you'll be able to do all
your reading on that second screen and
check basic notifications without
draining the battery of the phone itself
to stream hours worth of CNET videos on
the main screen it's a cool concept but
it's also not cheap and what if you
forget to close out of the page you were
reading on the back display the person
sitting in front of you has loved you of
that foot fungus article you left open
but the craziest-looking smartphone by a
landslide has to be the runcible this is
a phone with the design as strange as
its name seriously what does runcible
even mean it was crafted to look like an
old pocket watch or fob watch for all
you Doctor Who fans and while it has all
the basic functions of a smartphone it's
free of all those pesky alerts and
notifications that seem to saturate our
screen and interrupt our downtime when
you're ready to check it your
notifications will appear as bubbles on
the screen that grow as more come in
everything from the bubbles to the
wooden back panel seem so zen-like but
who are we kidding I doubt round phones
will catch on anytime soon so there you
have them five phones that dared to
break the mold for more specs on these
phones head over to phones cnet.com or
tweat meet with some of your picks for
crazy looking phones i'm vanessa hand
ariana and thanks for tuning in</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
