essentially the 9 inch version of the 7
inch nuke HD it costs two hundred and
sixty nine dollars but is that price low
enough to justify a tablet lacking in
media content
compared to the competition hi I'm Eric
Franklin and today I'll take a first
look at the nuke HD plus the milk HD
plus has a light fairly thin build and
unlike the 7-inch version includes that
little nook circle we've seen on other
nook products it also has a power /
sleep button volume rocker headphone
jack microphone pinhole charging port
micro SD card slot and a home button the
interface supports multiple user
profiles for both kids and adults that
are easily and swiftly switchable
there's a carousel of your content at
the top and each piece of content can be
dragged down to the bottom of the
interface if you so desire the tablet
features a nineteen twenty by twelve
eighty resolution screen and books
magazines games and movies do indeed
look sharp there is no native music
service however the Nook store offers
deep book magazine and even catalog
support and while its apps and movies
and TV show libraries are growing you
still won't find as much content here as
you would on Google's Amazon's or Apple
Store there are two key advantages of
the nook HD plus one it's one of only a
handful of large mainstream tablets with
a micro SD card slot which is gonna come
in handy if you just want to load it up
with a bunch of content and - it's $270
with great support for books magazines
and catalogs $270 for a large tablet
makes for a pretty great deal however if
you're looking for tons of great video
music and AB content you'll want to look
elsewhere check out my full review for
more details once again I'm Eric
Franklin and this has been a first look
at the Barnes and Noble Nook HD plus</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
