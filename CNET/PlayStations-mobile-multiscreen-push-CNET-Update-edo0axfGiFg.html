just add screams I'm Richard Carey and
this is your scene that update at the
gamescom conference in Germany sony
announced five new titles for the
playstation and new methods of playing
for starters sony introduced cross-buy
you pay one price to get the game for
both the PlayStation 3 and the PS vita
handheld some of the first titles that
will be sold like that include
PlayStation all-stars battle royale and
ratchet &amp;amp; clank full frontal assault we
got a few more details on PlayStation
mobile that sony's upcoming game store
for compatible Android phones and
tablets players will be able to sync
mobile games with their PlayStation
gamer ID and it'll have games by
existing publishers and new developers
Sony didn't say how many games there
would be but from the short preview the
games look similar to indie games you
would find in your App Store for Android
or Apple and with the game little big
planet 2 you'll be able to use your Vita
as a cross controller to give you a
second screen experience the Vita's
touch screen will give you a new way to
play than what's possible from the
standard controller multiple screens our
games are innovating over the next year
and PlayStation 3 users can now download
a new youtube app that makes it easier
to search for videos sign in to see your
YouTube subscriptions and you can
control it all by using your smart phone
as a remote whatever video you're
watching on your smartphone you can push
it to the television using the app and
now for some non PlayStation news let's
turn to the online crafts market of FC
you can find some really cute and unique
items on etsy but as for human bones
poison and drugs yeah that's a no-no
because apparently some folks were
getting cash for bones etsy updated is
prohibited items list so sellers can be
aware that you can't sell human remains
or smokable products incense and human
teeth however those are actually still
loud like this real tooth in a ring
being sold for two hundred thirty
dollars or by this tooth in a case for
thirty four dollars yeah forget to Tooth
Fairy kids Etsy's where the money is up
Google+ has begun to roll out vanity
URLs personalized to user accounts this
already exists for Twitter and Facebook
but if you
to link to someone's Google+ account
it's this crazy long string of
randomness first celebrities and brands
will get to change that string to a word
and eventually more people will get to
do that Google Plus also has added
studio mode to video chat hangouts it
optimizes sound for music since hangouts
launched there's been quite a few
musicians who have been using it for
live performances and virtual jam
sessions that's your tech news update
but you can always get more at cnet com
/ update and you can stay in the loop by
following me on Twitter from our studios
in New York I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
