is the sony srs x11
bluetooth speaker it's $70 it's at the
higher end of the micro wireless speaker
market which is rather crowded these
days and while you can certainly get
better sounding speakers for that price
you'd be hard-pressed to find a smaller
wireless speaker that sounds as good as
the SRS x11 weighing seven point six
ounces or 215 grams it's smaller than a
Rubik's Cube and seems well-built with
enough heft to it to make you think that
it's got some substance available in
multiple color options the speaker has a
soft to the touch finish on both the
back and top of the speaker or you'll
find the power button lime controls and
an answer end button for the built-in
speakerphone additional features include
an audio input NFC tap tap air
technology for smartphones that support
it and the ability to join two speakers
together wirelessly and create a
left-right stereo pair or just double up
on the sound as I said there are a lot
of tiny Bluetooth speakers out there I
like the JBL clip plus and so republic
Punk to name a couple of them but this
little Sony competes well with those
models and delivers better battery life
a full 12 hours at moderate volume
levels and while the speaker does play
loud for its size with 10 watts of power
and has enough bass to avoid sounding
too thin moderate volume is where it
sounds best for significantly fuller
sound you want to step up to the larger
srs x-33
but if portability is what you're after
this little cube is worth considering
despite its somewhat elevated price tag
I'm David Carr noise that's the sony srs
x11 thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
