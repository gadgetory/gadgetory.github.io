the iPad air is blazingly fast
incredibly lightweight and the envy of
all other tablets but that doesn't mean
you have to buy one
I'm Donnell Bell this top five I'll be
counting down five reasons you may want
to hold off on the iPad air starting off
at number five because your old iPad is
fine
Apple loves to show us images of people
using their iPads to make scientific
breakthroughs or FaceTime chat from the
top of a mountain but most of you are
really just using your iPad to browse
Facebook from the toilet a 7 processor
is not gonna make that experience any
more extraordinary or any less shameful
at number 4 Android the iPad is the
brand name but Google is really winning
the market share here more of you are
choosing Android tablets over iPads and
for good reason Android tablets offer
more features more screen size options
and some of the best prices around $500
in the Android world could buy you a
nexus 10 with 32 gigs of storage and a
suite of cloud-connected software and
productivity tools that people actually
use coming in at number three no touch
ID the fingerprint reader on the new
iPhone 5s is the coolest thing we seen
from Apple in years but they didn't
include that on the iPad air in typical
Apple fashion they did just enough to
the iPad to keep you interested
while deliberately withholding features
for the next update so spoiler the iPad
air 2 will have a faster processor a
better camera and will include touch ID
so why not just wait for that one the
number two reason not to buy an iPad air
price how in 2013 do you justify selling
a tablet with just 16 gigs of storage
for $500 so we're probably really
talking about paying $600 for the 32 gig
model and extra one hundred and thirty
dollars for cellular data so you can
make that FaceTime chat from the top of
the mountain that you're never really
going to climb $69 for the case $100 for
the Apple Care Plus and $100 for the
Bluetooth keyboard you wish came
included and now you really could have
just bought a MacBook
err with 128 gigs of storage doesn't
make sense that said I know how these
decisions go right now and that little
voice of reason over here trying to help
you hold on to your money and think this
thing through logically the Apple has
never really sold a product to that guy
the impulsive one over here on the other
shoulder as soon as this video is over
he'll be the one reminding you how
pretty this thing is the thrill of
showing it off to your friends and the
embarrassment you feel taking your old
iPad out in public so make no mistake
the iPad air is a great tablet and you
may go broke buying one but you probably
won't regret it but before we hit that
checkout button here's one last reason
to just say no at number one iPad Mini
with Retina display aka the iPad Mini 2
aka the iPad you can actually afford do
you think the iPad air is light the mini
weighs a quarter of a pound less this
thing is the real iPad air you get the
same a7 processor the same retina
quality display and all of the same
software you have to live with a
slightly smaller screen but it's a minor
sacrifice for the price $399 for the
base model $499 for the 32 gig model
that I would actually buy so there you
have it 5 reasons to pass on the Apple
iPad air but what do I know you're
seeing that's full rundown of the iPad
air and the new I've had many be sure to
check out our full reviews over on CNET
where we also have a list of the best
Android tablet alternatives or more top
