are pretty common plates these days in
fact every car that's on the market
right now has traction control and
stability control built-in even
self-driving cars are not that rare
every manufacturer is working on some
sort of autonomous technology because
they know that that's the future but
what is rare is the opportunity to
actually get into one of those cars and
take it onto the open road and that's
why we've come all the way to lovely
Gothenburg Sweden and some lovely spring
weather to test drive this this is the
Volvo DRI me program it's a car that can
drive itself so we're inside the
self-driving car now we're being
shadowed by this ridiculous six wheeled
Volvo up ahead of us which is kind of
crazy but the way I should here to talk
about this car we with Stefano Stefan
this is a self-driving car but I noticed
that you're actually driving the car why
is that what the concept is basically
that you're at work and now you want to
go home to drive home what will happen
is that you are going to drive the
vehicle to the piece of road which is
certified where you can switch on your
autonomous functionality we're gonna get
through the center city basically get
out to the highway which is probably the
most congested part anyway and then at
that point you can hit button and relax
right right can you tell me about what
sort of things we've added on this car
to enable self-driving so what we have
added to this car in particular is
basically software it is exciting
because as I said we are using
technologies which are very mature we
have the vision up here we have a laser
sensor to the right of it and then we
have radar in the front so it's
basically the same stuff is on Volvo
cars right now it's something that you
can buy at every war with every model
car is an option package
so I'm just pushing a plus button
releasing the steering wheel and the
pedals and it's not more dramatic than
them and the car is holding about 70
kilometers an hour is it going to
maintain the speed limit yes okay one of
the main benefits of autonomous Drive is
safety now only by having these vehicles
really following the speed limits that
you having on the road already that will
impact and the safety on the road so
there are a few things that you still
need to do as a driver if you're in the
car one thing is changing lanes that
can't change lanes for itself and there
is no infrastructure to vehicle
communication just yet so if there is
somebody working on a road that kind of
thing right now you'll need to manually
do around that but again that's the kind
of thing that should be in place by 2017
when these cars are available for
consumers and the other thing is it
can't quite merge just yet either but
again early days still just a prototype
what you could do is that you can put on
existing infrastructure as you have here
for instance you can put one more Lane
which is much much narrower and that way
you can you can increase the capacity of
the road and one of the things that we
are looking at is for instance lane
markings these are a type of
infrastructure support that we really
hope to have there you go that was
almost this is something that the car
would not do today but it's also
something that should be implemented by
2017 what we are going to have in 2017
again the plan is that the vehicle
should be able to take you on this route
from A to B in a safe manner this is not
that part this is a very early prototype
but idea is that by 2017 we will have
100 of those vehicles and
be able to do something else you had to
say well now what good is a self-driving
car if you have to park it yourself
that's no fun at all thankfully Volvo's
get you covered there too I need to do
is stop your car get out so pull out
your smartphone and iPhone in this case
hit a button the car will find a parking
space for itself
the car uses pretty standard technology
that's already found on a lot of Volvo's
in the road today cameras looking
forward radar sensors and also
ultrasonic sensors and the bumpers and
fenders to detect where those parking
spots are and to make sure that it
doesn't back up a little bit too far and
run into the car behind it when you're
done and you're ready to get your car
back all you need to do take your phone
out of your pocket and hit a button
self-driving cars and self-parking cars
it's impressive stuff but probably
what's even more impressive is that
Volvo's doing all this with really just
the sensors that are already built in
production cars today yeah there's some
GPS thrown on the roof there but
ultimately that's not really needed for
the system it's just basically a safety
blanket in case something goes wrong
this car as is it's really just a
development program it's the brains
inside that are what they're still
working on and by 2017 some people will
be able to buy this car but for now I'm
gonna try take this thing for a spin
give more my speed I can find the keys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
