motorola xoom hits the streets and gives
ipad fans something to think about find
out how to surf safely on public Wi-Fi
did you get unfriended on facebook odds
are it's not me it's you and hot iphone
on iphone action this week's prize fight
it's all coming up right now
hi everyone I'm Hollywood and welcome to
the cnet tech review where we collect
our hottest videos of the week and tell
you what's good and what's bad in the
world of tech plus offer our unique tech
wisdom in the form of the bottom line
let's start with the good today we've
got a couple of new products that could
make your mobile computing life a little
bit easier first up the motorola xoom
our CES best in show award winner for
2011 that hit shelves this week and we
got one in our hot little hands can it
live up to the hype and after that a new
sony vaio with the AMD fusion platform
built in cpu and GPU all on one chip
processor porn at a price hey I'm Donald
Bell and today we're taking a first look
an official first look at the motorola
xoom this is an android-based tablet
with a 10.1 inch screen 32 gigabytes of
storage and a price tag of eight hundred
dollars off contract or six hundred
dollars with the two-year commitment
from verizon sir on the same size as the
original ipad although it has more of a
widescreen dimension and the bezel
around the screen isn't as wide it's
definitely heavier than the ipad which
sounds like a small complaint the
tablets are something you spend a lot of
time holding on the bottom you have
connections for micro USB and micro HDMI
though you'll need a doc if you want to
get video out from this thing on the top
you have a headphone out and the door
that covers up the micro SD memory card
slot for additional storage and a 4g SIM
card slot for the 4g support that's
coming later this year there's volume
control on the left side and on the back
you get a 5 megapixel camera and flash
and a pair of stereo speakers you also
see the power buttons over here on the
back now it's a little weird to have the
speakers blasting out away from you but
it's nice that you don't actually run
the risk of covering them up with your
hands you also get a 2 megapixel camera
on the front that works with video chat
apps like Google Talk one of the biggest
differences between the zoom and all the
Android tablets we reviewed in 2010 is
the lack of tactile navigation buttons
on the home screen this is a good thing
controls for back search and many have
all moved on to the touch screen thanks
to the latest version of Android made
specifically for
tablets verizon and motorola are the
first to have android 3.0 and it's a big
part of why this tablet is so special
you get all the stuff that makes android
great there's full support for android
market official google apps for gmail
maps gps navigation and calendar a lot
has change though the browser has this
tabbed interface that works more like a
desktop browser than a smartphone you
get this nice big keyboard notifications
and settings are down here on the bottom
and generally all the included apps have
been overhaul for the larger screen of
the tablet so now the big question is
this thing a real competitor to the ipad
from my perspective there's no doubt
it's fast it's pretty and you can see
that a lot of thought went into the
execution it's not cheap though and with
so many tablet options coming out this
year I stay away from contracts like the
plague rising to Motorola how the lock
on Android 3.4 now but there are many
eager contenders on the horizon so
that's the motorola xoom from verizon
for cnet.com I'm Donald
hey there i'm dan ackerman and we are
taking a look at the new sony vaio yv
why is this a worthwhile Sony product
ake a look at because it's one of the
first laptops that we've seen with amd's
new fusion platform that's a combination
of a cpu and a GPU or graphics chip
together built into the laptop so you
don't have to get a CPU and then a
separate dedicated video card to get
decent HD video playback or a basic
gaming we've seen a few other AMD fusion
laptops usually in this 11 in size HP
pavilion dm1 is very noble one this is
the sony version so it looks a little
nicer also costs a little more you get
essentially the same performance out of
this guy as you would add of that HP DM
one which we also liked a lot but the HP
is 450 bucks this guy is 599 now for
that you get a little bit more RAM
there's four gigs in this model larger
hard drive 500 gig hard drive in there
but you're really paying for the build
quality which is excellent and of course
the design sony always has great designs
i like their island style keyboards a
lot a couple of the keys do get short
changed however if you take a look the
shift button over here on the right side
is very tiny the tab he's also a little
bit small made touch typing a little bit
difficult I like the large touchpad but
the separate buttons but you know that
two finger scrolling gesture that every
laptop has now so you really want me on
this I had a really hard time going up
and down long web pages and documents
the screen 11.6 inches 1366 x 768
resolution that's what you're going to
find it pretty much every laptop between
11 even all with the 15 inches these
days that's fairly standard and of
course you get some of the extras you'd
expect to find on a slightly pricier
ultraportable like this like bluetooth
and you get an hdmi output of course
being a sony laptop besides the SD card
slot you also get a memory sticks lot
just in case you one of those guys using
a memory stick if you want to save a
little bit of money you could definitely
get an AMD fusion system for about a
hundred hundred fifty dollars less like
that HPD and one we've mentioned a
couple of times this guy is a little bit
pricier but certainly look so nicer you
get some more hard drive space i am dan
ackerman that is the sony vaio YB
well sure you could spend less but then
would you still get the pink I do like
the pink now whether it's a laptop or a
tablet if you plan on taking your
portable computer out of your house
anytime soon you would do well to listen
to these tips from Sharon Vaknin she's
helping you protect yourself when you're
using public Wi-Fi if you're using Wi-Fi
at places like starbucks or your local
bookstore and go about your normal
computer activity it's time for a
serious wake-up call hackers even
amateur ones are sitting around waiting
for Wi-Fi happy people like you to
connect to these unsecured networks and
reveal their personal lives I'm Sharon
Vaknin with a how-to on safely using
public Wi-Fi hotspot the first thing you
should be aware of is that if a hotspot
doesn't require a password it's not
secured don't be fooled if a hotspot
does ask for a password or guides you
through a login screen you're still not
secured here are a few things you should
always do when connecting to a public
network check to see that your firewall
is enabled it's like locking your own
house windows and mac both have built-in
firewalls that are enabled by default
but here's one thing to modify make it
block all incoming connections you can
do this by going to your computer
security settings now you should also
disable file-sharing which allows people
on your network to access shared files
and folders when you connect to a
network for the first time in Windows
your computer will ask you what type of
network it is or where you're connecting
be sure to select public this will
automatically turn off file-sharing for
that network if you're on a Mac go to
your sharing preferences and uncheck
those services with these settings in
place you're already much safer but
there's always room for more security
i'd suggest installing a browser add-on
called LastPass it will secure your
passwords by storing them in the cloud
instead of on your computer where there
in plain sight for hackers LastPass will
also defend you from keyloggers which
record everything you type
HTTPS Everywhere is another great
browser add-on that will force websites
to give you a secured connection so any
activity will be confidential to you and
the website and if you're really
paranoid you can surf the hotspot
through a VPN or virtual private network
which will make you completely invisible
security kiss and hotspot shield are a
couple free VPNs if you take those
precautions you're in good shape but you
still need to get into the habit of
doing things like checking the network
name hackers will often set up fake
networks like free starbucks Wi-Fi or
free public Wi-Fi to lure you in check
with an employee to confirm the name and
here's my last piece of advice treat all
open networks as a security risk don't
do any banking online shopping or any
activity that could potentially expose
your personal information if you
wouldn't do it with the stranger looking
over your shoulder it can wait until you
get home for cnet.com I'm Sharon Vaknin
and i'll see you on the interwebs of
course none of these tips are going to
stop you from getting crumbs from your
scone inside your left hubs keyboard if
that's a problem for you maybe a tablet
like the zoom is a better way to go okay
folks I know we brought it up last week
but it is still tax time if you haven't
done them yet it's time to get organized
luckily our own Jasmine France is here
to get you organized and ready to go
with the best tax prep software and web
sites out there
we hate to be the bearer of bad news but
it's that time of year again tax season
and it literally makes me sick as
unpleasant as it might be filing your
taxes is unavoidable the good news is
that with the plethora of online and
desktop tax prep solutions most of you
can avoid hiring an accountant even
better every web-based program offers a
free federal efile if your tax needs are
simple I'm Justin France senior
associate or for cnet.com and i'm here
to give you an overview of the variety
of software options available for the
2010 tax season more specifically we're
going to go over the four best known
solutions TurboTax H&amp;amp;R Block Tax Act and
complete tax and figure out which one is
right for you so let's start with the
option that seems the most
budget-friendly on the surface complete
tax this service offers three ways for
you to file completely for free one if
you lost your job over the past year two
if you end up owing money and three if
you successfully import your 2009 return
from one of the competitors however if
you don't meet one of these criteria tax
act is actually the cheapest offering
plus complete tax has the most dated
interface of the bunch and it doesn't
provide much in the way of tax term
description or general help most users
on a budget will be best served by tax
act which has the lowest overall pricing
especially in terms of state filing
whereas the competition charges about 30
bucks for State Tax Act only charges
between eight to fifteen dollars Tax Act
provides a clear interview process and
now provides audit support for the 2010
tax season it also offers a handy tool
called answer Center where you can find
help for specific questions access
various calculators and view tax related
documents Tax Act doesn't offer as much
hand-holding as turbo tax or as much
personalized care as H&amp;amp;R Block but it
should be the top consideration if you
have a solid understanding your tax
needs and don't anticipate any major
issues with their filing of the four
options H&amp;amp;R Block provided the most
enjoyable interview process with plenty
of visual cues and clear explanation of
tax terms H&amp;amp;R Block also offers the most
generous customer support including one
free tax topic discussion with an expert
if you want professional help without
the expense of a full-on accountant H&amp;amp;R
Block is the choice for you finally we
come to turbo tax which can be the
priciest appending on your needs
TurboTax offers a slick interface with
lots of links and descriptions for
various tax terms in fact the interview
process
is overly detailed in places so TurboTax
may be in annoyance if you want to fly
through your filing however TurboTax
lets you import practically everything
from last year's return to w-2s to
investment information to quicken data
plus the service paired up with mint com
this year so if you use mint TurboTax
can automatically import interest income
and if you only need to file a 1040 EZ
there's snap tax a mobile app that lets
you simply take a photo of your w-2 in
other words if you hate data entry turbo
tax is the solution for you so there you
have it tax prep for 2010 it's a lot of
information to take in I know so here's
the breakdown consider complete tax only
if you fulfill one of the free filing
requirements and would otherwise become
drool filing by hand log on to tax act
for an inexpensive experience that lets
you fly through the tax filing process
check out H&amp;amp;R Block if you're after
personal attention and a user-friendly
interface and get on board with TurboTax
if you're a mint com user who hates data
entry if you want more detailed
information on any of these options head
to download com to check out our full
reviews I'm jasmine France for cnet
speaking of jasmine France for cnet I'm
sorry to report the jasmine is moving on
to greener pastures we're thrilled for
her but I am sorry she had to go out in
a tax prep video love you babe and with
that let's take a quick break to work on
our good luck jasmine greeting cards but
we'll be right back with more tech
review right after this
welcome back to the cnet tech review our
weekly video digest of all things good
and bad we've seen here at cnet TV it's
time to check in and see what's going on
in the bad now it's not often you hear a
27 inch monitor compared to ross perot
but i'll let the incomparable eric
franklin explain just make sure you
cover your eyes and after that Brian
Cooley is here with a very helpful top 5
that will hopefully help you remain
popular on Facebook it's the top 5
reasons that people unfriend people
let's say you in the market for an
affordable new car within a range of
prices you're looking at there is the
most expensive model that also offers
the most bells and whistles there's a
cheaper option that skimps on a few
features and then maybe there's this
weird third option that hits in the
middle of those two in price but offers
the lease and features you know the
option no wonder the right mind would
actually choose hi I'm Eric Franklin
from cnet and the samsung syncmaster p 2
770 fh is that we're third option for
monitors not cars now saying that no one
in their right mind would actually
choose the fh maybe a bit hyperbolic but
compared it to both the lower price a
sous ve 276 q and Samsung's own more
expensive p 2 770 HD the fh just doesn't
offer enough for its price but I'm
getting ahead of myself to be fair let's
see what the fh does offer the fh is a
27 inch monitors so right off the bat
that's more screen real estate than some
smaller monitors for the same price a
definite win for the fh also it includes
both swivel and tilt hdmi and DVI
connections not to mention both optical
audio and analog audio outputs also the
OSD offers a lot in terms of options
including individual color controls and
seven different presets lastly it's
swell pretty i mean it's a design we've
seen several times before from samsung
but it still holds up now all of this
probably sounds great that's just me
leading you to the twist
lackluster performance specifically the
FH is proclivity to fire green gamma
rays directly into my eyes making me
more and more angry even though I've
told the monitor over and over again you
wouldn't like me when I'm angry yes the
fh has a green push which means there's
an overabundance of green on the screen
for most of the time this would all be
forgivable if there weren't clearly
better options like the aforementioned a
sous and the P 2 770 HD available not
that their performance is much better
but from a total package standpoint they
do offer more we were able to diminish
that green effect by adjusting the color
controls but at the end of the day the
fh couldn't measure up to our reference
monitor the samsung PX 2370 meaning that
among three hundred dollar to $350 27
inch monitors the FH is a third choice
it's like the ross perot of monitors
which you know all things considered
isn't the worst thing in the world once
again i'm eric franklin and this has
been a first look at the samsung
syncmaster p 2 770 fh
used to be you unloaded a friend by
gradually not hanging with them they got
the message after a while now BAM you
unfriend them on Facebook and an
instance they can't access your wall see
your embarrassing pictures or read your
name posts you showed them I'm Brian
Cooley with top 5 reasons people
unfriend people on Facebook this list is
drawn largely from research done by
university of colorado denver doctoral
student chris simona who surveyed 1,500
facebook users in 2010 to find out why
they do the dirt of the 21st century
saying goodbye on facebook number five
it's actually nothing you do on facebook
at all savona found that fifty-seven
percent of unfriending happen because of
something which happened in the real
world how quaint number 4 i'm going to
toss out my own jump ball here i think
it's because of facebook pull back as we
use facebook more and more I hear from a
lot of people who are using it less and
less it's because they come to the
intersection of the novelty wearing a
bit thin and they realize how much about
themselves they're exposing and in the
process of taking that back they whittle
down their friends list too well actual
friends number three racist or vulgar
posts this is kind of a no-brainer right
we've all got those morons in our crowd
who go there and then there you are with
their mortifying utterances on your wall
where all your enlightened friends can
see you also hang out with losers number
two posts about politics and religion
social networks do not change one of the
great truths of human relations that is
layoffs politics God and gun control if
you want the party to stay polite before
I get to our number one reason people
unfriend people on facebook note that
unfriend is not hillbilly English it's a
real word in fact it was word of the
year in 2009 as named by the New Oxford
American Dictionary which said it has
both currency and potential longevity
and it's just a handy phrase okay the
number one reason the people unfriend
people on Facebook is
persistent in nain posts no kidding
farmville updates alone are enough to
inspire genocide please people post
something you think the rest of us at
least might care about not another damn
golden egg for more top 5s like this
head over to top 5 cnet com I'm Brian
Cooley thanks for watching
in anat is such a subjective thing
though really I mean you guys care about
my split ends don't you I have a
beholder No well at least it's not
farmville all right let's go ahead and
check out this week's bottom line coke
versus Pepsi PlayStation vs xbox Jacob
vs. Edward some debates will just never
have a clear winner but when it comes to
which iphone is better verizon or AT&amp;amp;T
there can be only one true Victor let's
finally put this debate to bed in an
iphone prize fight for the ages what's
up prized by fans i'm brian Tong and
this is a prize fight that you the
people have been asking for it's a prize
5 butch out with verizon iphone 4 and
the AT&amp;amp;T iphone for our judges for this
fight our senior associate editor nicole
ice cold lead senior associate editor
Jessica Duke it out dole court and my
self regulating Tom now we'll take all
three judges scores and average them out
to the nearest tenth each round the
final prize fight score be an average of
all round using the same decimal system
we aren't going to go over every single
feature because the phones are so
similar but instead will focus on the
differences it's a five round throw down
showdown round 1 and design the iphone 4
is still the sexiest looking phone on
the planet with its clean design and
sharper than sharp retina display the
AT&amp;amp;T phone was notorious for its antenna
design so the verizon iphone changed the
location of the seams but if you squeeze
hard enough you'll still have similar
problems even if it's been way overblown
we're talking to sit down even at 4.7
next round is controls and user
interface we can't say it any more than
we already have the iphone is the
easiest mobile OS to use swiping double
tapping pinch and zooming it's all here
and it just makes sense now when my one
and a half year old nephew can navigate
the apps
and YouTube you know it's a good thing
round two ends up in another tied with a
perfect five from all of our judges dr.
abs in two rounds we're even at 4.9 next
round is features finally around where
there's differences to compare the
verizon iphone gives you the personal
hotspot feature which lets the phone act
as a wireless modem for up to five
devices for twenty dollars a month and
early adopters will get access to the
unlimited data plan the AT&amp;amp;T iphone 4 is
expected to get the hot spot in the
future but its main differentiator is
the ability to use voice and data
simultaneously something the current
verizon iphone can't do then there's the
calling limitations on the verizon
iphone you can only conference call with
up to two other people while 80s goes up
to five of your best friends in the
whole wide world and the other verizon
bugaboo is that you aren't able to place
a call on hold between two people plus
ATT is a gsm phone which is more
friendly internationally compared to
cdma phones that have limited use
overseas aemc takes this round with a
4.7 and verizon gets up for next round
is web browsing and multimedia whether
it's verizon or AT&amp;amp;T the iphone 4 is
still hands down the best multimedia
experience on a phone with its top-notch
media player in interface movies look
amazing on its screen and the itunes
store gives you access to boatloads of
content you won't find anywhere else
then the safari browser is still one of
the best mobile browsers even without
flash support it's another tie and a
perfect 5 for both bones so after
averaging four rounds the AT&amp;amp;T iphone 4
leaves by two tenths of a point but the
final round that the sides vault is
called quality and performance
we've tested both bones in a variety of
locations in San Francisco and outside
of the city and one thing is clear the
verizon iphone is better at making phone
calls and experiences less dropped calls
call quality is pretty solid and very
clear for both phones when you have a
solid signal but one area where AT&amp;amp;T has
an advantage is with data speeds now in
San Francisco verizon had bested a TMZ
in some cases but in many other areas
around the country it's clear that ATT
data speeds are faster and in some cases
even twice as fast but you know what's
the most important part about a phone
the fact that it makes phone calls in
the final round the verizon iphone gets
a perfect five and the AT&amp;amp;T iphone gets
a 3.3 so it's average out all five
rounds and in an epic battle where we
were tied three times AT&amp;amp;T when it's
around five with the lead but verizon
came back strong with a perfect score
taking this battle 4.7 to 4.5 and is
your prize fight winner you could almost
call this a win-win since the iphone is
now both carriers but the decision isn't
really clear if you have salt AT&amp;amp;T
coverage you're a heavy data user that
cares about speed and you travel
internationally there's no need to
switch but if you want better call
reliability unlimited data and a
wireless hotspot then the verizon iphone
is for you i'm brian Tong thanks for
watching it will catch you guys next
time on another prize
the bottom line this week and the winner
is Apple they're still selling a ton of
iPhones no matter what carrier they're
on and with that I promise we'll never
mention the iphone 4 again Oh Who am I
kidding you guys keep watching the
videos we're going to keep on making
them and that is our show for this week
but never fear we'll be back next week
with a brand new cnet tech review until
then there are tons of great videos
available every day at cnet TV com see
you next time everyone and thank you for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
