iPhone but once you weed out the really
stupid ones we're left with a somewhat
shorter list
I'm Brian Cooley let's celebrate the
good ones today here's our top 5 iPhone
apps as determined by the editors of C
net and then verified and ranked by you
because you know sometimes we all need
some adult supervision here we go number
5 Photoshop calm yes
Photoshop one of the most overwrought
pieces of software on earth on an iPhone
how does it work
great because it gets slimmed down to
just the features you can comprehend in
a way you can figure out even better
it's free which is an even bigger
departure from the real Photoshop number
4 we kick in the games here flight
control I don't know about you but
nothing says fun like spending a little
time simulating the most stressful job
in the world air traffic controller in
this one you vector in multiple planes
at varying speeds even some helicopters
and try and get them all down on the
ground safely before an avatar of Ronald
Reagan comes in and fires everybody in
the control tower ok that last part
doesn't really ever happen but this
one's only a buck so you could afford it
even if you have been fired
number three Pandora I know what you're
thinking if this isn't number one what
is I mean pandora is a monster streaming
music service that has everybody talking
this free version on the iPhone is even
better because instead of playing audio
ads it pays its way with banner ads
you'll never look at tell them add in
the fact that it works over Wi-Fi or
your carriers data network and you
realize quickly why the folks who work
at satellite radio are getting fitted
for sandwich boards number two aha this
is why Pandora is number three who tunes
it rolls up some 23,000 radio station
streams from over 150 countries sorts
and categorizes them adds album art
lyrics links to music videos on YouTube
and even lets you record the streams for
offline listening later
now it's pricey in the cheapskate world
of apps at five bucks by the way before
we had our number one you can take pride
in being a big spender you iPhone user
according to AdMob twice as many of you
buy paid apps than folks on Android or
any other smartphone platform add in the
iPod touch and it's not even a race I
guess I gotta stop calling you a
cheapskate ok what's the number one
iPhone app according to you and us here
at CNET it's what Angry Birds yeah it's
a gaming phenomenon that lets you put a
bunch of cranky birds to work hating on
everything as you launch them jackass
like into stuff and into other little
creatures and what-have-you stupid
yeah it is but I bet you can't stop
playing it and there are something like
a hundred and fifty levels so by the
time you exhaust this game you'll have
worn grooves in your screen $0.99 or you
can snag the free lite version
cheapskate okay there you go five more
apps to put on your iPhone or iPod Touch
and keep the chick with the watermelons
company I'm Brian Cooley from cnet.com
we'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
