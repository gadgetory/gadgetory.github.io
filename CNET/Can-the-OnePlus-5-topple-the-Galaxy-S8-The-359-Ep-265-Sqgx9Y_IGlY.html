Alfred hang when it comes to smartphones
do you splurge or scour for the best
deal out there when it comes to Android
there are two that really arise at the
Filip each category one is the sleek
redesigned but super expensive Samsung
Galaxy s8 on the other side you're
looking to save some money the one plus
five is a premium phone that's got you
know got a lot of bang for your buck so
our own lin la pitted the two phones
together and the results were
surprisingly close actually and I know
you're a lover of budget phones and
cheap things what what do you think
always get the cheaper phone always as
technology goes as well like anything
just get the cheaper thing that's how I
look at cars that's how I look at phones
it's how I look at computers well you
get the cheaper thing because it's like
nearly the same I when I go to the
pharmacy and I like buy aspirin I never
buy Tylenol I get like the generic yeah
I get the generic brand thing cuz it at
the end it's like the same outcome well
look so actually Lin tested these phones
out and I mean generally the Galaxy S a
comes out on top for things and the
biggest factor though was was the water
resistance which obviously it's kind of
a big deal for consumers but
surprisingly the camera kind of was a
was a tie which is another big factor
for people when they're looking to buy
phones which is surprising cuz Galaxy sa
it could be a hundred sometimes hundred
fifty dollars more than the one plus
five yeah I mean I understand you know
wanting to pay more for higher quality
things I completely get it but it comes
to a point where when you look at
something you know when you compare the
photos like sure this one might be
better like slightly but is it a hundred
and fifty dollars better like that's the
benchmark firm right well I mean people
gonna be making that calculation once
again in September when Apple comes out
with their super expensive iPhones so
super iPhone get the cheaper phone all
right all right next up we're gonna be
talking about a cabin it is a basically
a hotel on wheels that takes you from LA
to SF they only pitched is 8 hours and
$115
which is essentially double the cost of
a flight a roundtrip
basically round-trip flight from Elliot
SF is $100 this is a scenario where it's
cheaper and better to just take a flight
cheaper faster yes you could argue that
this might be a better experience
because you're sleeping you know you're
a reporter they're gotten no sleep train
I didn't sleep at all on that although
if you look at the video the super pods
do look kind of comfortable there's
Wi-Fi that's respectable there there's
yeah but you know there's that weird
dream water that she had yes but you're
comparing one hour to eight hours of
travel time for where you're not exactly
though seriously it's less it's actually
a little bit more than one hour if you
think it through it's you know whatever
the half hour commute to the airport you
got to get there two hours early or an
hour and a half early when you get back
and when you're arriving at your
destination you've got another half an
hour to get to wherever you need to get
to so that's I mean it's still like
three or four oh yeah you're comparing
that to eight hours eight hours on the
road it's yeah hours of peace it lists
if this was she if this were cheaper
than a flight then I would totally do it
yeah but that's the whole point of
taking a bus over a flight is that you
know that it's gonna be longer but you
know that it's also gonna be like half
the cost and that's twice it's actually
interesting that they're taking it
intentionally longer route cuz it
doesn't take eight hours ago from LA to
s method it's usually like five or six
but they took a longer route to Matt to
basically find the smoothest course so
you have a more restful again that's not
why people like take buses though they
don't take buses for like the comfort of
it they yeah all right lastly we're
gonna be talking about sex dolls it's
part of our turn-on package of stores
looking at the next generation of sex
toys our own right Chris actually
visited a sex doll factory that it's
incorporating AI to its products this is
really sort of like wes world isn't it I
don't I don't watch well look like I
think it's easy to make fun of them but
I like they do have some like legitimate
reasons for wanting these like sex dolls
there's the ride
talked to somebody who was a Vietnam War
veteran he's about 71 years old and his
wife and died in 2015 after they had
been married 35 years you know he didn't
really want to go through like all the
dating and all this stuff again
at his age and it was just you know this
was something that was like providing
him company yeah I mean in terms of
companionship I mean I was really
interested actually in the fact that
they're even investing in AI the the
idea that you can for a subscription
create a personality that you can
interact with this is right now you
can't even get the sex all with the
personality cuz that's coming later this
year
right now you basically get some sort of
online avatar and it's kind of like West
world where you can shoot like the the
people who kind of run the theme park
can choose the personalities by hitting
certain buttons on tablet this is
essentially what they're doing here
which is kind of freaky yeah I don't
want to kink shame anybody but yeah this
is uh it's not my cup of tea
you know wouldn't do it in my bed but
you know what goes on in your household
is you know no judgments here alright
for those stories and more check us out
on CNET I'm Rhonda Chang I'm Alfred Inge
thanks for listening
yikes on bikes
am I getting attacked for my cheap views
what am I getting attacked for my cheap
I haven't even looked I'm still kind of
reeling from the sex doll story it's
it's a great story there's it's a
package of stories a series that's gonna
be running for the next two or three
weeks we've got a number of different
pieces including one for mouth yeah next
week
yeah it's about how easily you can hack
a dildo a smart dildo yes or a normal
one with a knife it's fake stories fake
news I want to talk about the bus right
evolve yeah cuz you actually you love
sleeping on buses I want to live on that
bus I don't know what to live on it
definitely can't afford to live on it I
just traveled between Los Angeles and
San Francisco every day would you
consider appealing to your cheapness
which consider that trip if those fifty
dollars yes if it was basically the same
price as a flight or less then yeah I
would sit
I would definitely I feel like though
there is that it is eight hours is
probably you know you're losing probably
five or six I feel like I'd rather do it
because if it was like cheaper just
because like you
like I take like basically you just want
to save money yeah I used to take bus
like like from from New York to Syracuse
is basically one hour on a flight right
and that's less okay yeah it's less than
an hour one more time taxing than you do
in the air yeah so I I always took the
bus there and I would like visit like
it's six five to six hours depending on
how good your driver is and so yeah I
would take that trip like very
frequently and I would always do the bus
just because it was like a quarter of
the price of a right yeah
and basically that that's the whole
thing like if it's cheaper that's what
I'm doing all right
well I mean this obviously they're
selling the idea of comfort that's and
their whole like overnight strategy
that's also what I did I would take it
at like midnight and essentially a
red-eye yeah I don't live it like 6 a.m.
and it'd be great I'd sleep on the whole
bus ride yeah but is it really worth
when you could get what would we find
out the round trip from SSDs like a
hundred bucks a round trip cost as much
as of one way yeah I mean that's my
point like if it were cheaper then yeah
they have something on their hands here
but you know yeah I think it's an
interesting idea they're trying do you
want to try it yeah that's the thing
like I think I would actually pay to try
it once it wouldn't be something I'd
regularly do but just for the experience
kind of cool I mean is isn't this
something they already do if like the
Train though like I've never done Amtrak
all right no I don't take the train
enough to know I mean I just took the
train from LA to San Diego I know for
sure there were no sleeper cars there
but you know they had big spacious seats
they're you know it's a comfortable ride
on you but you can't sleep there no
sleeper pods yeah like they're all here
but I mean I find it for whatever reason
soothing comfortable acceptable to sleep
like if I get on a bus or a plane I am
out instantly and I have terrible
insomnia half since I was 11 years old I
can't sleep for crap most nights right
but it's the sound the vibration
I don't know I'm on that and I'm done
you see I know subway
I have I discovered new areas of the
Bronx by accident one day because of
that
Wow but of course you know you try not
to it's not a smart idea yeah that's the
safest thing to do my friend got his
laptop stolen like that yeah
that will happen so well Danny Green
wants to talk about the phones he says
they're do it there is no budget iPhone
now bingo well or you could be like me
and buy an older iPhone because it's
pretty much the same thing anyway well
slower processor if it's a used iPhone
than when the 7 was announced I went
straight to the store and I bought a
brand new like 5s 5s well that's the
thing Apple's kind of cut down on that
like they stopped selling the older
versions like you could probably get
them at some fish and I think prices
drop even more when they drop when they
like release oh yeah yeah how was the
refurbished phone because I'm always a
little suspect about the battery but
like I don't know I've really been
enjoying mine and I really can't like I
had an iPhone like 6 / 6s for work
before - yeah I'm just one of those
things where you know it's obviously a
downgrade but it's not that much of a
downgrade to me that like it doesn't
matter like it doesn't matter that much
like when I was talking about the the
car argument before with the with like
these phones like premium versus like
the lesser but like equally good version
like I look at it like when I'm in New
York and I see some dude and like some
souped up like Maserati or whatever like
next to like a normal car and you're
both going in the same place like not
New York but if you were anywhere
outside of New York that would be true I
mean I guess
legally it's just so goofy to me that's
my point like I look at phones the same
way to be honest I see I don't think
because cars are ultimately more of a
status symbol like you're right you pay
for the horsepower that you probably
won't be able to use a camera or a phone
that's got a superior camera that's got
water resistance there are tangible
features there that make I mean though
that's how I looked at like laptops - in
college women basically I
everyone there had like a MacBook Pro
yeah yeah and like only maybe like ten
people there like needed it for like
like its processing power like the
horsepower that you're not going to use
right because it was like all these
people's like you're like in the
journalism school year me yeah if you're
like a writer MacBook Air is pretty
sufficient what are you doing nude I was
like the best laptop it's like sometimes
the best is not what you need that's my
point
truth elite Brian gaming wantses expand
and tell him how powerful is the 1+5
they actually they both use the same
processor the Snapdragon 835 it's also
cheaper so actually they're they're
technically both equally powerful so in
terms of specs it's actually they're
fairly equal actually one plus five gets
edge on battery life it actually lasts a
couple hours longer is it because it
doesn't have the Samsung like OS stuff
wearing it down well no it's potentially
some of the bloatware but I think it's
more the larger display and having to
kind of run that larger display for a
long time that probably cuts into the
Samsung let's go back into the chat we
got a comment here from Razer to o4a
says anywhere in the country we'll have
you bound with unreasonably low speed
limits New York recently lowered the
speed limits to 25 miles per hour
when speeding revenue are speeding
ticket revenue dropped that's also true
yeah bear in mind alright so if you got
a Maserati and you're in New York City
you're gonna get to the red light faster
than me I'm gonna feel dumb now I've
gotta go Maserati I've got to leave the
city now alright so elephant in the room
we're probably going to need to expand a
little bit more in this whole sex doll
story sure as I look for something safe
for work in the b-roll file the sex
dolls are always looking that was like I
was kind of a little nervous when you're
skating through the store I'm like a lot
of that videos do not autoplay a reason
we're gonna get flagged explicit not
suitable for work for your own curiosity
there will be links in the description
and the on demand when this show post
and
or two so you can go and explore to your
heart's content
story because there is no tech in it
right the kind of notion of artificial
intelligence and actually creating or
aspiring to create robots or not robot
sex dolls that you can actually
emotionally connect with you know it's
an interesting concept it's it's sort of
like this tangent to what bigger
companies like Facebook and Google and
Apple are all trying to do with AI
anyways it's trying to make a personal
assistant necessarily but someone that
you can connect with also it has boobs
yes wait so other male success we only
got to see in the early parts of that
story the female we scroll down there
are there are pictures of apparently
they make custom ones too so you can
make it look like you know like a
celebrity or something like that they
that's they draw the line though you
don't they don't do anybody that doesn't
give permission to be essentially they
have like an arsenal like a menu you can
come that I'm sorry
they don't do kids and they don't do
animals so they draw the line on those
I'm glad they do yeah Wow yeah I'm
curious just know how many of our
viewers would try this out though okay
yeah light up the chat let's see if any
bar are you interested like super
expensive right yeah what are they
running at ten thousand dollars if you
want the one with personality is that
true yes or 70 all right yeah or you can
get the cheaper refurbished apply
I guess there's interesting topics at
hand there from a scientific standpoint
and I don't mean that in the internet
puns are science
but at the same time I guess who isn't
morbidly curious about what's the phrase
I want is there terminology for that man
sex doll feel kind of weird well they
call them real dolls
that doesn't help all right all right
switch gears one more time before we
wrap it up for the day
scott maya asks how can the one-plus be
cheaper what did we lose out on Oh what
do we lose out on didn't pay for
marketing that's kind of it it's
marketing it's the fact that you can't
really get a one plus five at a carrier
store it costs a lot more money to run
one of these phones through carrier
certification so you know having to
customize for carriers having to market
and Samsung markets the crap out of all
this products where a lot of the money
goes yeah the components are sourced
China Samsung has its own sort of
facilities they've got I believe they've
got plants in China by other than
Vietnam so it's just a matter of
sourcing they they save a lot of money
on keeping a fairly lean operation
Samsung is this gigantic global
corporation so there's naturally a lot
of overhead yeah I feel like a lot of
people always have this assumption more
it's like if it's cost more money it's
that's better better and it's just no
it's not true well no no the processing
side I mentioned that they both have the
same chipset and there's one thing to
keep in mind Lin brings up in her story
is that the 1 plus 5 oneplus kind of
came under fire for skewing the the
benchmarks which Samsung has also done
the past so you know you have to kind of
keep that in mind over all these these
phones are both really fast
they're like using the fastest latest
chip out there you know one may be
slightly fast the other because of
individual tweaks but they're both
really good
I remember the oneplus 3 was also like
pretty hard to get your hands on is this
the same for the one plus five I think
they've got better with distribution
it's not like that like whatever a lot
of a system because that's what I was
gonna say that's another thing that
you're losing out on is you know
distribution yeah yeah it's tougher to
get they make fewer of them
Samsung obviously you cam in any carrier
store they just make tons of them so
they're everywhere so it's you know if
you want one you can walk down the
street
by one one plus five you have to go
online you don't get any carrier deals
with it yeah there are no deals
there's no it's certainly you're buying
sight unseen right because there's no
real store for you to check it out yeah
my mind went to terrible places where
you see you walk down the street and buy
one because I'm still thinking about the
sex dolls geez imagine if that became
like a corner so we're probably gonna be
a thing like don't sell like flashlights
and dildos at like your corner store but
like there's probably like a sex shop
like somewhere close to where you live
that you can go to and like buy like I'm
sure there's a store we don't mean to
shame anybody in this there are more
than a few people in the chat they would
be like that's kind of interesting and
legitimately talked about so thanks for
bringing that to the table this morning
how exactly I just want to leave us
today with a comment from razor 204 8
yeah this is exactly the mentality we
should maintain he says why get a sex
doll when you can just spend far less
money building a gaming PC and get an
experience that is better than sex
bless your heart Wow bless your heart is
it talking about VR call duty oh man
what if they got VR going in with that
and I think it's a future story okay all
right you like tape that you saw or
heard hear or offended we're sorry check
us out on CNET or podcasts also
available on iTunes tune in stitcher
SoundCloud Google Play and Feedburner
see y'all tomorrow oh wait not tomorrow
no weekend weekend think about sex dolls
