and I'm here with t-mobile's chief
operating officer Mike Seaver Roger
thanks for having me
so it's jump into this recent
announcement you're letting your
customers use our phones in Canada
Mexico and without an extra fee so tell
me more about it
it's called mobile Without Borders and
we called it that for a reason because
what we're really doing here is tearing
down another major barrier another
border in the wireless industry it's
kind of absurd the way this industry is
always worked I mean basically the
carrier's get together and they decide
hey you know what we're gonna charge
each other these roaming fees and then
we're gonna turn around and Jack that up
90% and charge the the actual end users
incredible fees just to drive across the
bridge or go across a border what we're
doing with mobile without borders is
giving to our simple choice customers
the ability to just call anywhere they
want in Mexico and Canada in the United
States and travel anywhere they want
just as if it was your whole own home
coverage area
so we're basically giving all three
countries for the price of one alright
so that sounds really great but what's
the catch well you know look I mean
we're not really into caches are our
favorite price point is free and that's
what we're doing so basically every
single plan that's available starting on
Wednesday the 15th of July is includes
this with whether it's a promotional
plan whether it's a basic plan you get
it and so if that plans available on the
15th of July you get this and and by the
way and it's for no extra charge and
this is kind of interesting because what
the carriers tend to do is offer two
paths either you don't sign up for
anything where you could wind up if you
just use your phone with AT&amp;amp;T and you
don't sign up for anything in advance
you could wind up spending $10,000 a
week just to use your phone in Mexico
the way you would normally use it at
home well you bring up a TMT and
obviously they have a vested interest in
being in Mexico they just purchased two
carriers down there with the intent of
building out this network between the
two countries how is what you're doing
different from what they're doing it
just it just showcases how our
philosophy is totally different they're
a command-and-control ownership kind of
domineering type of company so what they
what they do when they want to go to
Mexico they flew down there and they
bought up companies by the way so second
tier third rate companies
what we do and then what we do is so
different than what we're doing is
partnering with the number one and
number two carriers in both of these
countries that allows us to provide an
incredible experience LTE in all the top
cities but we don't have to own it you
know what we've created here is a
consumer movement in uncarrier that
people want to be a part of consumers
want to be a part of it and so to
partners and it's so much better way to
go I mean the world is still waiting
you know AT&amp;amp;T said they we're gonna go
buy all those companies for four billion
dollars and that their customers would
benefit well we're still waiting to see
what that benefits gonna be right well
let's talk a little bit about
competition
you added 2.1 million new customers in
the second quarter what is the
competitive landscape look like right
now is it things are things getting
better
thinking worse quieter well things are
accelerating for us you know this was a
great quarter for us and it really
showed that this consumer movement has
legs
you know everybody said things would
quiet down we're not interested in
things quieting down we're interested in
continuing to bring people into the
uncarrier 2.1 million customers in a
single quarter Sprint CEO Marcelo Claure
I recently took a page out of John
Ledger's dictionary and called the
uncarrier campaign
bs without being so polite then how
would you react to what were your
thoughts on that reaction you think that
was scrappy I think I kind of chalked it
up to he was having a bad day you know
let's face it q2 was coming to an end
that day he was probably looking at his
numbers who knows what motivated but
we'll see pretty soon I'm sure yeah
we'll see
and certainly the other the other side
of things with the bait - I mean Verizon
has been making a lot of noise about
making the point that no matter how blow
your price is it doesn't matter if the
coverage is lacking and well t-mobile
has done a lot of work to improve the
network in big cities your coverage
isn't as ubiquitous as those other guys
what are you doing to improve things
well one of the things is the rapid
rollout of low-band which we now have
licenses covering a hundred and ninety
million pops of the US and we're rapidly
rolling it out and just clarification
low bad spectrum is some kind of
spectrum that's able to go across wide
rage walls better it reaches further
from the towers at because it's at a
lower frequency and this is something
that's new for us
and so the other guys have had it for a
long time we're now rapidly rolling it
out and what that results in and this is
huge an extra million square miles
of coverage just in 2015 think about
that we're more than doubling our
footprint and so it's it makes a
tremendous difference and and we
announced this morning to that we're
hitting 290 million pops that's two
hundred million two hundred and ninety
million Americans are now covered by our
LTE network so we're in all the places
where people you know work and play and
we're rapidly improving in the rural
areas as well because of this rapid
rollout of low-band technology all right
well last I want to ask about
acquisition rumors DISH Network has sort
of made it or it's been speculated that
Dish Network is interested in buying
t-mobile what do you think about that
and have you thought about what it would
be like to work for Dish chairman
Charlie Oregon yeah you know our our
strategy is pretty simple it's to
position this company in order to
succeed in an environment that's rapidly
changing I mean think about it you know
the all content of all kinds is landing
on the Internet and the Internet is
rapidly transitioning to mobile so
there's this great convergence going on
and that's got us looking around going
okay how do we turbocharged this
strategy of ours because the strategy
we've got is working we've got an
uncarrier movement a strategy a team and
a brand that are on fire and what that
does is it gives us lots of options
because what we're doing is really
working and so what we're looking for if
we're looking are things that can turbo
charge that strategy if there's a
partner out there that could bring us
spectrum or other raw ingredients that
could take this thing that's working and
position us for where we want to go then
of course we'd be interested so that's
that's the context that's really good to
have the position of strength and a
strategy that's working you know when
all this convergence is happening
because it allows us to be patient and
thoughtful and look for strategies and
potential partners if there are any that
can turbo charge what we're doing our
strategy and if and if possible make it
more successful okay great thanks Mike
really appreciate your time
