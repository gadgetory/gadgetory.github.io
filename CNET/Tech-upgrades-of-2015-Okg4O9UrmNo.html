coming out in 2015 like those new VR
goggles from oculus and 3d food printers
but what about the practical tech that
you already use every day Donal Bell and
in this top 5 i'm counting down the 5
most exciting tech upgrades you'll make
this year starting off at number 5 your
laptop the laptop market keeps
contracting year after year but the good
news is that the products are getting
better 2015 will see the launch of two
highly anticipated pc laptops the Dell
XPS 13 and the Lenovo love easy both
make use of Intel's latest broadwell
processors and both take direct aim at
the macbook air given that I've be
surprised if appleton up the ante with
the dramatic refresh of the air just to
keep things interesting at number four
Windows 10 I'm gonna break this out
separately from laptops because it's
estimated that half of the world's PCs
are still running windows seven for all
their effort Microsoft just couldn't
lure all of you to embrace Windows 8 so
along comes Windows 10 later this year
along with a retreat back to the desktop
centric view of Windows I number three
your home at least the parts of it you
can upgrade with this year's tidal wave
of smart home accessories there's now a
full-on battle between Google's nest
platform samsung smart things platform
and apples home kit so if you've ever
wanted to tell your phone to unlock your
front door or spy on your cat with
night-vision cameras or quantify your
water usage into a tablet app 2015 is
your year coming in at number two your
car stereo between android auto and
apple carplay the bases are pretty well
covered for anyone looking to have a
tighter integration between the car and
the content and services on their phone
aftermarket options like the Pioneer NEX
line and the parrot RMB six are the
first out of the gate but expect to see
other manufacturers pylon and finally
the number one tech upgrade to save up
for in 2015 the great Thor khaya
fication of everything this is more than
just 4k TVs those are already here
and the options will just continue to
improve as the year goes on but we
forget about all the other stuff
connected to your TV getting real 4k out
of your DVR Roku Apple TV or chromecast
will take more than just a software
update we're talking hardware upgrades
across the board this year for Kate will
be inescapable your smartphone camera
will be 4k your computer monitor will be
4k your drone your SmartWatch your
burrito in your underwear all 4k and
your wallet will be empty so there you
go five tech upgrades you're likely to
make in 2015 more top 5s head over top 5
