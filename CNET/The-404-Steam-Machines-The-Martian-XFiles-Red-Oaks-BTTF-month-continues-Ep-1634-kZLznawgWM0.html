we're doing a family thing oh because i

the way for you as a close one uh we're
gonna do like an Addams Family thing I
was gonna say I would would have guessed
at a family cuz you love the addams
family so we like Adams family so is is
is doing puberty yes okay he is gonna
pubert so hard I think that's acceptable
so if you don't know uh and I don't know
why this film is not appreciated as much
as it should they're both phenomenal
both of the movies are real we're gonna
say the word phenomenal for the second
1i yes one hundred percent I might
possibly like the second one more
because the camp stuff is so excellent
the camp stuff happens to be really good
and pubert is all in the second one yeah
is pure but anyway I'm a family to they
they have a kid a baby on name pubert
yes and it's like this little how would
you describe him he's almost like a
china doll oh yeah in a weird why he has
the caked on makeup he looks like a
morsel is stackable and he has a
mustache right yeah he grows a mustache
at the tender age of like one month yeah
anyway I'm gonna obviously be Gomes
Stacy's gonna Morticia herself an issue
like big wig yeah like I do no come on
we can do the Whigs were gonna be it
what's the situation with your beard
though now he's never all my beard
laughs guess what the Gomez gonna beard
have a red beer if you ever inexplicable
red beer to go along with his wiry jet
black mustache in hair yeah um and then
Morticia my wife Stacy will she shall
rock that and then we got we already
have costumes for little man he's got
we're not
put them in a wig that's messed up right
sure I guess yeah right cuz he has like
Gomez hair right yeah you got gomez here
okay sure I don't wanna draw on him I
want to do anything in okay so but we're
gonna give like a mustache pacifier oh
that's great yeah very sword will do
that and then we'll do on and then his
jumpers got like a spider on his jumper
yeah which is like the it's like a
little pugsley kind of jumpy I am so
that's it we're slicing yeah it's gonna
be like a creepy pram to push him around
in pram that's that stroller is that
like the old Victorian sort of strong
it's short for perambulator shut up
you're making it up sure you get this
crap that's what they call in England
all right juice you're such an angle Phi
epic time all right so there what about
you whatever you and Alex doing ah we
have not nailed it down because we've
been very busy we have plans do you want
plans we do have plans oh forget you we
did get invited to a party but yeah we
haven't nailed azam we might do like
something adventure time centric we both
like that show a lot all right I'm not
trying to I'm not trying to rain on your
parade is it done no it's not i'm sure
it's obviously overplayed but sure ha
like like b-list Adventure Time
characters that only show up in one
episode yeah like one off guys yeah do
you do whatever you want ok my feeling
and I am preaching right now so fight if
you're if I'm in your ears right now I'm
sorry I'm getting a little Halloween
preachy but your Halloween costume needs
to be scary needs to be effing scary I
mean there are scary characters in
Adventure Time that's fine like people
who a lich they hold their own eyeballs
and stuff like that that's a lychee got
like a scythe and he's a skeleton
anybody's fire he's scary do that
there's a lot of work like people dress
up like you know me pizza rat chick
they're gonna be so what do you think
it's gonna be pizza rat it's gonna be
like Trump here's here's the issue
here's my rule of thumb for the
Halloween even though i like the holiday
my chief concern for a costume I just
want to get over that hump of like okay
this person clearly didn't try so I want
to be above that but I want to be below
thee this costume is determining how
much fun I have tonight because I have
to carry around like a goddamn bathtub
right you need to it's gotta be
practical practical that's a huge
element again halloween i think that's
that's right up there with like good cop
like I need a private right something
you can move around in yeah all right
but what do you think you're gonna be
the most common things this this uh I
creepy threat Trump um I don't know
what's what else is in the zeitgeist the
site with the zeitgeist to turn over so
quick you almost forget like something
that happened in march eight right
something would happen in mar don't even
know march exists anymore it's so far
away who remembers like what was all
what happened right right now yeah I
literally can't think of like you just
have the election going on there were no
minors to save yeah there's none of that
I'm doing a quick search on the internet
because there's always like some someone
who's making a list the whole time yeah
so people are gonna be doing Netflix and
chill so some assholes gonna be wearing
a netflix sure i do oh my god is a party
in williamsburg i believe which seems
appropriate but it's run by a friend of
mine I and all the costumes are internet
memes so you have to go internet meme at
the bell house so I'm sure that'll be a
big one that's not bad a lot of people
are like Oh zombie Jon Snow is gonna be
a thing yeah that seems a little dated
at this point that was like that ended
like four months ago this this website
says that weird multi colored dress that
nobody could tell but yeah that's
definitely that is that was vanished
from my mind but think about it you're
gonna walk around and address and
everyone's gonna be like oh you just
have a dress on no but if it's that
weird is it white or blue thing that
only happened because of the photo and
the lighting in that photo it doesn't
work all the time it's not like you if
you saw that dress on the street you
would think the same thing I know I
think I would remember it cuz cuz the
picture they have in this thing is like
it fading from white to blue okay how do
you do that without future tech no it
isn't like refreeze gradient you don't
think I can work I'm sure it'll be a
costume but it's the other important
thing is you don't want to have to
explain your costume
has all the tile night it's all the
talks that sucks uh uh so yeah I Netflix
and chill I feel like is gonna be so how
do you dress is that you wear a netflix
shirt and hold the bag of ice oh yeah
lame I know it's really bad it just
seems silly a lot of Star Wars stuff
this year i have millions Oh save me
from the minion Anna Freddie all right
Halloween acai bb-8 oh maybe some bb-8 I
would I don't mind that let us know what
your dressing up as this halloween the
back to the future month continues
yummies in general no going still going
on we just passed a date right no don't
was this it's it's october twenty first
wafer and law I always confuse it with
the fifteenth why I have no idea maybe
the 15 in 2015 doesn't matter cuz guess
what I'm doing on october 21st 2015 time
ya know guess who I am interviewing oh
my god Doc Brown no way with to me
probably more important okay um Biff do
you see that see that song he he wrote
no so he kind of and he's a stand-up is
Thomas Wilson last name and look it up
on youtube he's got a song called the
question song people oh I'd like if
people constantly breathe the same
question question yeah no I don't hang
out with my fatigue Fox anymore is it
Michael J Fox who you're interviewing
Michael J Fox no I know I would I don't
know what I'm interviewing the mayor of
Goldie Wilson because of no not him I uh
for CBS and interviewing Bob Gale whoa
that's cool yeah you know having Geno
babka yeah until the listeners he was
the screenwriter right yes for all three
all three of them that's very exciting
so I like that you tried to catch me in
my fronting lie that I don't know who
Bob Gale is no I know we wanted a little
bit of exposition so that we could
perhaps you know explain it to the re
exciting I didn't want to say I'm maybe
I feel like I've been around the office
today Tooting my own horn
yes I am way more excited to even up to
have you have you looked at as he been
up to anything dude did a little bit of
constants on all the mr. gale ya know
jojo's I'm to me it seems like he is
just reaping in the wrong charities from
that chilla G is he doing like the Rick
Moranis thing where he just like so did
every once in a while with his work and
then chills out for a while uh I'm gonna
say sure did you see you didn't see the
rick moranis profile I did he just in
the Hollywood yeah so he does some
voiceover work every five years or
whatever and then he goes back into
hibernation like raisins kids that are
now grown so I didn't we get that
problem no I did because I just loved
seeing a new photo of him right like it
is the reason why I the same you uh go
search for the hollywood reporter did
maybe like a thousand words not even
with uh Rick Moranis and they asked them
specifically you know why'd you say no
to the Ghostbusters reboot is like I
don't need to be in that right you know
which I guess his answer about that was
a little it may be just upsetting to the
fan in me maybe I it's hard to I think
say get context or tone of voice right I
don't think he was dismissing it that's
rarely it's for him personally like he
doesn't have an urge I mean the way he
described I thought was good which is I
worked on this thing 30 years ago to
come back and do like an hour's worth of
work on it seems really weird yeah I
mean no and I don't think him being in
it would have made the movie better or
worse Louis Tully is a great care I'm
gonna say in all honesty I kind of one
hundred percent wish that the other the
old Ghostbusters were not in the movie
uh because it comes off as like an
endorsement no it comes off as like a we
maybe it's in my mind I'm thinking back
to start with the first star wars
episode you know the prequels yeah where
they felt like they needed to like make
nods those characters yeah I don't know
although Ernie Hudson can be in anything
that's acceptable I understand why uh
you have this maybe unspeakable
explanation as to why um you know you
have an issue with not that
I have an issue with it I just makes you
feel uncomfortable adams takes me it
like breaks the fourth wall a little bit
and you kind of remind yourself oh this
is a sequel to a movie set franchise and
it just sort of takes you out of it
whenever I see stuff like that that's
very like naughty to the camera but I
don't know maybe I'm just crazy I'm sure
you're saying I'm not everything I've
seen about the new Ghostbusters and I
know we I know if you have seen your
damages guys went back to visual
Ghostbusters is there anything else we
talked about on the stamp show but um
I'm I'm not uh i'm actually looking very
forward to this Ghostbusters yeah as am
I on and that's for the other reason I'm
like right yeah i kinda wish like maybe
use on its own its own thing sure um
alright but going back to Bob yo Bob
Gale I you know I'm so I'm not nervous
I'm very excited sure like there's a
part of me it's like men so when you're
watching this movie in 1989 when it came
out when did to come out any is
something like that yeah probably like
80 87 88 you know I was like I just all
these things came I came out in 89 all
these things came up came to me was like
oh when this date really does happen
you'll talk to the guy who wrote this to
me that's crazy to think of that as a
child watching this right you know I'm
saying yes I don't think that's cool I
read its article I respect the guys
writing he's very talented but like it's
imaginary those those states didn't
really those dates existed sure I mean
like when I was watching the future aid
when I was watching back to the future
too yeah I remember thinking like oh man
i'm probably gonna see october twenty
first that's sure if everybody is
exciting and now on that day and he
picked that date i'll get to right now
yeah so it's this weird paradigm are you
gonna wear a double tie when you do the
interview obviously I do have a Back to
the Future shirt I don't think I shadow
that do not wear that okay don't be glad
i vetted that with you before so cute so
like there's also this paradoxical thing
right we're like this movie set in
motion a chain of events for the future
like so like people a change the future
people were like very conscious of like
what was the directions that is what I
truly believe is a thing and I'm that's
what I'm gonna talking about technically
literally anything butterfly effect but
you know but here's the thing right but
here's the thing i'm a big believer that
it sounds crazy but it seems like human
innovation and ingenuity and and
progress in terms of technology has
attempted to emulate science fiction
futurism yes sure right so lightly so
the Star Trek tricorder becoming mobile
phones etc I think it's definitely a
source of inspiration so in itself that
notion has these paradoxical features
where you are making a film that takes
place in the future yeah but unwillingly
and indirectly at the same time yeah are
shaping our future but you understand
what I say what I'm saying what I say
literally everything does that yes
settle I heard everything does do that
sure but when you have dates and when
you have stuff like this it's like okay
come on sort of get it you don't think
that's a fun thing to else about Gail
yeah oh it's an interesting question
sure yeah yeah I I guess I'm being too
clinical yeah you're being way too lame
a bad oh sorry I guess I've seen that
movie butterfly effect too many times so
you know look I'll give you a perfect
example sure the whole Cubs thing okay
okay so what you're implying is it
becomes tried extra hard no not at all
and God saying that or I'm not saying
that this movie in any way shape or form
change the outcome of this baseball
season it most certainly did not okay
I'm not a goddamn idiot okay but at the
same time like this thing is now it's
now a synth now a thing and there's a
lot more people rooting for the Cubs
because they just want this to line up
with the moon right now say what you
will Cubs been shitty for a while yes
name won a World Series in like a
hundred years and that's why they were
in the movie
a joke about how bad right and I'm again
I'm not saying that the film set in
motion a chain of events that would lead
to the Cubs winning the world series of
course they can't win the World Series
by october twenty first but it's just
kind of fun right it yet it's cute it is
it is strange yeah that they're making
it this far in this year the odds are
very the odds I'm sure they're like one
in 10,000 or whatever it is whatever
yeah I mean the odds of them making
today NLCS is essentially there in the
Final Four effectively right so it's
four out of 30 30 yeah well but then
factor in like how shitty they are yes
there are we got this hear me um see
it's just stuff like that's fun yeah
it's fun you know yeah I don't know what
I so I'm very excited you want some
other inspiration for questions well so
like here's the thing so I want you to
ask him about that how does he feel
about the whole marketing angle is that
too deep for him like whether he feels
like everything's been co-opted like we
were discussing on the other show yeah
I'm gonna ask him about I'm gonna try
and touch on that I'm gonna get geeky
with him because we have like 30 minutes
what is he doing was he promoting like a
blu-ray he's just celebrating I mean
yeah he's promoting everything because
I'm sure he's a nice fat paycheck after
you you know you buy a Pepsi yeah um
yeah so black my buddy Vladimir do these
who's the CBS correspondent he or Ernie
shot with Bob got and he's gonna be
doing mob now yeah he's a close personal
friend oh and also alan silvestri I'm
gonna get big bad I how you gonna start
the engine and pimping started acoustic
be the most professional interview
you've ever done you mean like all right
geez never at this kiddo casa uh so yeah
he talked to Bob gallon on Silvestri
about um you know the film and they did
they did a segment for CBS this morning
there that morning yeah but for CBS n
the streaming thing I think we're going
to like the 60 minutes set whoa we're
gonna sit down in front of the flux
capacitor the insider times right there
sue me it's gonna be fun yeah so look
forward to that i'll definitely post on
let's go catch that uh but yeah I'm
super super excited man it's uh it's
pretty crazy yeah that's great right
aren't you excited about I am excited
for you I was gonna say like be excited
for him I am internal i internalized a
lot I've barely and you also like know
how to spoil a good time for people
you're trying to have one uh which leads
us into the subreddit that adren s3
started regarding this ball sports
Almanac theory which I will be asking
mr. gale do you think the Almanac should
have been thicker right very good
question um we really need the prop
expert right we need that guide but I
think Bob Gale will be able to uh to
speak on speak because they have those
tiny Bibles where it's like written in
like you need a magnifying glass like
real a text yeah so it could've been
that I don't know uh andhra and johnny
has rights could it be since we see the
book itself has flippable pages yes that
it was a kindle / real book hybrid which
would explain its thinness yeah yet
having all that information so this is
the reason I don't think it's that
unless the technology got so crazy to
the point where you would be able to
discern printed page from not is that
all a young biff does not freak out when
you see is just like what's a stupid
magazine yeah it looks through it news
like what is a good job old man buk buk
bak no you're right and that's the
that's what I produce at it ah-h safia
rights what about battery life flexible
thin battery that lasts decades sure
there you go don't forget this book is
also 15 years old in 2015 right it's
from to take only 15 years older yeah
then when the film takes place right um
is it like on store shelves like that's
a common thing people need in 2015 is
this is like a thousand antiques through
alright antique store right come sorry
sorry sorry it's been a little while
play ball with me bro I show I go it's
clearly a book in the movie is it not
and then we went on to talk about this
yeah um flexible screens he comes back
at me and I said look if it was a
flexible screen and just three iterate
what you just said
yeah wouldn't would not old diff have to
kind of explain right to young biff yes
it's like don't let this book blow your
head but here's would it look I would
drop it in the sink uh so yeah I'm also
gonna talk to him about like hey the
second he gives in that book shouldn't
he have died right away right that's
just like a time paradox thing well but
that I think goes to the like idea that
Marty takes a while to fade out of
existence as well he's not an instant
fade out of existence I think because in
the timeline he's currently occupying
yeah it's teetering right and that's the
whole thing it steering as to whether
he's gonna use the Booker right so when
he guarantee one hundred percent he's
gonna use the book that's when old Biff
breaks his cane and dies behind a
garbage can he just fades away which
we'll talk about that and it has stomach
pain yeah when you cease to exist you
have some stomach thing we talked about
this last year doing that we're like you
vanishes very weird you're like oh I
guess time travel just like tough on the
old man but no he's dying he's vanishing
from existence uh really cool stuff I'm
not going to spend too much time on back
to the future too late I know but I'm
just super excited to be able to talk to
him on mr. Bob Gale on october 2413
that's that's pretty rad I will get the
more subreddit at the end of the show
thanks for everyone to contributing to
our subreddit being a part of the
conversation let's kick it back to the
rundown and see what else we got there's
an interesting story we're reading about
from Microsoft they're offering two
hundred dollars for your old laptop but
three hundred dollars if its a Mac it's
I think it's pretty smart and there was
a brief moment where I was like I have
an old Mac maybe I'll do this this is
like trading in guns yessica leaf right
the way they're looking at it but they
are yeah it's a promotion where you
bring in your old laptop and they give
you 200 bucks if it's just like an old
thinkpad or whatever and 300 hours if
it's like a macbook or whatever because
pro because you're because that three
dollars is to incentivize your switch
your swag the switch your conversion and
I don't for me I don't know if you've
met Enys people I've never really met
that was like i've been using a macbook
air or whatever for a while and I'm
gonna like I'm ditching this in favor
windows like I have not heard of that
switch being super common obviously a
few years ago yeah there was that big
campaign by Matt Apple that was like
make the switch now it kind of feels
like Microsoft is forcing people to go
the other way yeah I'm sure it's gonna
happen a few times this iteration yeah
but man those Apple people I mean
looking at you we're sticklers what can
i say sticklers and you're not very open
to change your so i changed one I used
to be a windows person and I changed one
I mean you have a gaming pc too late to
go caving pc that's true but all i do is
game on that so in terms of work and
everything else it's always on a Mac and
I I made that switch once when I would
like this is like 10 years ago and I
haven't looked back so what can I say I
don't think they haven't given me a good
reason here the aisle and we said this
is a little last week I think the person
who is buying them the the new surface
book is not someone who had a macbook
now 100 I think this is someone who's
like you they have a giant ugly thinkpad
something enough already I'm gonna get
something that looks decent as light and
I could use for work computers hot man
we've had in the lab it's uh yeah it's
really a nice 98 piece of equipment but
yea I'd I don't I can't see you know
Johnny Apple who's got the macbook the
ipad and he's got an iphone yeah and now
he's gonna be like all right well this
mmm this Microsoft laptop looks bad go
not gonna happen now maybe somebody with
like a six or seven year old macbook who
maybe doesn't maybes open to the idea of
and are using is like browsers yeah
we're yeah they want word and stall I
mean obviously get word on that but yeah
I think there's room for that conversion
to happen yeah just don't know if that's
exactly what we're gonna they are they
are putting their best foot forward
totally so good for them interesting
story there we're going to take a break
when we come back we've got a van on
spoiler review of a new movie starring
uh this guy Matt Damon and he's a he's a
foul mouth
rock and roll astronaut on a crazy
foreign planet where there's all this

asking if we could change our of the
image the image on tunein radio yeah
I'll not do that meter well I've no idea
to do that yeah I do not you it is
pretty amazing cuz the image is not even
from like a generation ago it's like six
years old it's like from old Wilson's
all right yeah yes crazed old that's
just crazy and I I don't know what to do
yeah um alright so before we get to your
um
your Martian review yeah what uh you had
a little move yourself I'm ooh yeah
birth tomorrow I understand that was
that's a move it's a Segway try uh yeah
I moved to Queens Queens New York to be
closer to the New York Met that was
exactly we are pretty close we're about
a 10 minute drive from them yeah or bus
ride yeah so I moved it is the first
move that I've made in nine years and it
was emotionally heart-wrenching it's
just like moving sucks and I'm really
glad I did not do it between those nine
years because it was just I mean I was i
I don't yell at people I'm generally
pretty moderate but when I'm like really
frazzled or like upset about something I
just get super quiet yeah you you're an
introvert I'm it just in those
circumstances where I'm like really
stressed out and there were multiple
times when I felt really bad because
like Alex my fiance would be like are
you okay and I'm like it's just the move
it's not you or it's not I was like I
felt really bad and that literally I
didn't know when it would happen but it
was literally the second the movers left
from our new apartment it was like I
took a giant poop like so much stress
was relieved and I was just like walking
on air and I bet I felt great since and
I'm like I was like and she was like you
are like a completely different person
compared to today's so normally I'd be
making fun of you about yeah but you
know is I'm fine but I know cuz moving
is a terrible thing anyone can be
involved in you always hear that that
editor it's like hey the most stressful
things someone can do is move have a kid
or get married and you did one of those
yeah about to do another right so what
was like what was it for you like what
could you not process and in sort of
riser there's just so many variables in
terms of like what's going to fit in the
apartment what we hired movers because
we had to because that both building is
required it but like I paid a little
extra for the quote full pack what does
that mean what love that means they show
up the day of the move with boxes and
like pack
 for you whoa whoa what yeah and
then and you were stressed well I was
stressed because it's like this doesn't
seem a hundred percent like the whole
apartment was still like a total mess
when they got there and like this
doesn't seem right like how are they
gonna do right exactly and like people
would come and visit they're like you're
moving in two days we're like yeah wait
a minute wait a minute wait a minute
yeah so you're at your place yeah wasn't
even I mean here's what i did is i
unplugged all the electronics and I like
gathered the cables in like little
baggies so it's like here's my xbox
baggy and here's my playstation 4 baggy
I'm ready to go the desktop i unplugged
basically all the electronics and like
put some clothes in the closet that was
like it he just moved you they moved me
so well how's his cough uh the full move
was like 1,500 bucks that's like I'm
tanya is it worth it absolutely one
hundred every cent cuz we move the bed
we moved my giant couch we moved a large
TV stand and furniture like it there is
no way like friends of mine would still
be friends of mine if i had asked
something with me so it's okay so they
so they come in so how many people did
this I think the crew is like four
people so did they come in and what you
were scared they're gonna be like oh my
god yeah and actually when they came in
they're like they're like we don't have
enough boxes oh really yeah and then I
let them know there were some things
that were staying and they sort of got a
little more confident but they were
scared they were a little scared uh how
long the whole thing take they got there
at 8am yeah they left my apartment my
old apartment at one-thirty so it takes
you five hours to pack of performance
yeah and to bring me everything
downstairs and then the move-in took
like an hour once they got there cuz
it's just it's just bringing stuff up
yet minnow unpack you do they unpack the
like big electronics and they rebuild
the bed and like that stuff but not like
clothes and stuff like that which is
fine it's great it was faith at like and
it was literally like night and day and
we have a balcony and it like this great
view and
in queens and overlooking the trees and
everything and just standing out there
with them being on he was just like this
like heavenly moment it was really
fantastic so for you I'm glad you were
able to rise up I did have one issue
though is that so we have two bathrooms
in this two full bathrooms which is
quite a luxury I was not expecting that
in this new apartment one of the toilets
before it was even you just thank God we
noticed when you flushed it it leaked
out of the bottom of the tank in the
back oh yeah that's some water sir no
that's what's supposed to have so we're
like oh no no good so I contacted my
super she was very helpful and like put
us in touch with or you know got a
handyman to come by and take a look at
it so that he came by this morning and
I'm doing work in my office and
listening to music i'm listening to you
actually Gloria you know that son Gloria
Gloria do didn't I think I got your
number glory oh nice yeah yes things
that I don't remember it's also notably
on the metal gear solid 5 soundtrack
which is what made me put on my place
that's the wackiest thing ever um so I'm
listen to that and he's in the room
fixing the toilet he's in the bathroom
and I just hear him whistling to Gloria
and I like both shared this little
moment loving Gloria and and he helped
it with a few other things he was very
friendly and at the end of it I didn't
get his name until they enter like I hi
what's your name and he's like taco taco
and I'm like uh ty taco he's like tato
oh and I felt like them the bigger the
most white guilt moment I've ever had in
my life years like that dudes name was
taco and he happened to be Hispanic but
he was super nice but I just felt like I
had any I'm sure they get that a lot
from all these stupid white people but
they're like oh your name's taco I eat
tacos all the time and I just felt like
so guilty and like the blood rush for my
bass Oh your name's taco my name is
hamburger how are you but he was very
friendly but so put you guys are cool
now you're not gonna sabotage me and
taught or tato yeah are closed taco I
felt very embarrassed you know nobody is
named taco
I mean I thought it was an option maybe
they're very close names together taco
he quit he stopped me so quickly that is
like 9am now it's not an accent yeah a
little bit I like tato how cool is cool
dude he like Gloria Gloria yeah it's
pretty good uh all right let's uh let's
pivot into some entertainment news of
the week we're trying to do this try to
make this a regular thing where we watch
something yeah whether or not it's a
brand-spanking-new but I want to give
you a spoiler free review of stuff are
this week Ross is gonna tackle Matthew
Damon on Mars in the Martian in the
Martian um I really like this movie I
don't you haven't seen it all I know you
have a baby you don't leave the house
anymore oh that's not entirely true you
son of a bitch but it's fine are you
bringing your baby to r-rated movies
o'clock so that's the thing you can't
bring a baby a six-month-old baby as
well behaved and as beautiful as a child
in turn is can't bring to movie you can
bring to like 11am matinee of a kids
movie cuz it's accepted that everyone
there is gonna have an awful time like
that's just a rule everyone just crossed
the second they get in there but no you
can't bring him to like the Martian no
really at any time I guess it's just
everyone's just gonna be pissed they're
gonna be upset um yeah I really like the
movie um you read the book I did not
read the book but I based on the
descriptions the book everyone told me
that the book was written in the style
of a reddit post which is to say like
very naturalistic and full of curse
words and yeah cuz apparently the guy
who wrote this book and actually have a
little bit of like a kinetic connection
but my brother-in-law's brother and no
my brother's brother-in-law at that
point I don't think you can even line oh
it's like the end of spaceballs when
he's like my cousin is former roommate
right no my brother's soon-to-be
brother-in-law yeah I believed helped
publish in some capacity this okay
something Sherman his company got the
right don't you walk by the building one
time maybe he knows Matt Damon
personally is what I'm trying to
understand um but anyway said it was
written but and also he was a game
developer yeah you kept on a sar craft I
don't remember
oh crap but yeah definitely a in the
games industry and what I liked about
the movie and I'm sure the book is very
close to this is that it was weirdly
very lacking in tension it's not a movie
so the closest comparison people make is
Apollo 13 which is obviously a real
historic event that happened but that
movie is such a tension my god it's like
every minute is just like awful
succession met game um and with the
Martian it's weirdly not because like
you're constantly like oh he's dead now
like there's no way he's getting out of
this and then he's constantly like
figuring out ways to get out of it but
not in like a the air is running out in
30 seconds I got to fix this like right
now he's like okay so I have two weeks
that's how much food I have left I have
these you know materials on the base I'm
going to run out of water in three weeks
what can I use here it's like Oh mazha
MacGyver episode gotcha but without the
gunfights right so and it just like felt
very true and then meanwhile they have
this whole story with NASA trying to
like whether you know how they're going
to get him back if they're gonna get him
back and how they communicated stuff
like that and it's just like a very
rational grounded it didn't feel like a
sci-fi movie it felt like this could it
happen next week and it the events would
not feel and what makes it so good then
if there's no tension I think what
people find interesting and what I found
interesting was like like realistically
how would they solve these problems and
these because it was just a bunch of
logics it's a lot of logic stuff and
it's stuff that would work with my like
they don't have crazy lasers like or
future Ted the only future tech they
have is they have a spaceship that can
go to Mars fast I mean not that fast it
takes eight months to go to Mars even in
the movie this is mostly longer or yeah
maybe now it's too i don't know how far
away's morris pretty far like a few
miles a couple miles um so they don't
have future tech and like all the
clothing is not like it's not like back
to the future they don't have future
fashion they just use like normal day
fashion and it just feels very grounded
there's a scene in Apollo 13 that I
always think back to which is
they're they're like running out of air
and they need to make a new filter and
the guys at NASA like spill out a bag
that has like all the things that are in
the space station and they're like okay
we have to use this stuff to make this
thing fit into this thing right classic
Apollo right like what the air filter
thing exactly so you're just like a very
logic filled moment that's obviously
tense because there's lives on the line
etc but you know there it's not driven
by emotion it's driven by logic which
and everyone in the movie felt like a
scientist that was like making
scientific choices so it's fun it's not
it's not inspiring I mean no I wouldn't
call it scary now I I found it
interesting is the best way it was
almost like a more interesting Nova
episode yeah like you yeah if you want
like the super nerdy I'm not nerdy but
like the very specific details about
Earth to Mars interplanetary travel yeah
uh Mars is closest point to earth
happens every one and a half years
roughly about 16 years and a direct
flight would take about 260 days ok so
that's not crazy and that's about what
they were saying yeah obviously the
issue more important is the issue of
like how do we sustain life for that
long and if they land on the planet can
they sustain life and like where is this
money going to come from given that
NASA's budgets keep getting cut so there
are I think more logistical issues but
they deal with a lot of that stuff in
the movie like the politics of like NASA
existing and like how they need to
release all of the state like everything
that he says Matt Damon's character says
and types back to NASA has to be public
publicly released so there's funny
moments where he's like cursing Russian
they have the line at least what do you
think about all that stuff do you think
we think we need to go to Mars do you
think I know this is like kind of
curveball in here but do you think I
mean I'm sure that you ponder that
watching this minute I have thought
about that idea it's tough man because
it's like at a certain point you're kind
of saying do we need Mars or do we need
to pay teachers more right or like do we
need better food in schools and stuff
like you have to you know at the end of
the day you're making a choice now
granted there's also like can you cut
one
% of the military expenses and have
NASA's entire budget maybe I don't know
who yeah so Mars is nice I thought I
wouldn't mind it um you know but it's I
don't I'm not enough of an economist /
world creator to make that call takes a
while to get that it does just send like
can't they just like shoot GoPros at it
and like instead of like sending us
virtually what the rover is yeah but
it's way more expensive it's go just
like shoot some GoPros at it with with
like a bb8 didn't you just roll it
around that water stuffs crazy yeah I
think you know I think the biggest thing
people you know net it's funny when you
watch NASA operate like they always have
to operate where it's like we're
relevant we're relevant right look at us
yeah what we did yeah and I feel like no
one really is gonna give them the time
of day until they're like we found life
yeah like that's what they have to pull
up I don't you feel like if that
happened like like one of the signals
came back and they actually found life
don't you think another agency would
like instantly take control of that what
do you mean like my claim that by the
NSA or not claim the news but my arms
are like we're not finding beings we're
finding like microbial but even okay so
let's say we found microbial things like
once LG single cell right let's say we
found that on Mars that's a week-long
news cycle and that's it right and
that's super depressing but like and
people like what they found cells that
are living who cares they're alien cells
yeah that's cool that's right it is I
mean it's cool stuff it's just a little
depressing given like I know how the new
cycle would work and it'd be like oh
yeah we found aliens like legit aliens
okay see you around yeah good luck Cody
Kardashian fell on her ass yeah they're
all night what speaking of single-cell
organism know what what they're only oh
they're only sell set on a cellular all
right yeah well tell them to selfie us
or something is that a pun on cells no
no it was not wrong no we gotta sell
some advertising
go more 404 right after this break will
finish things up with some love from the
subreddit we got steam machine stuff and
a few more programs to speak about more
404 right after this so often layer any
like I said that it was great ladies and
gentlemen a soft layer looks like a
metal band no it's not a metal band but
I'm sure if you're a metal band and you
in need cloud infrastructure you can use
soft layer probably because softlayer
delivers clouds support that's built to
perform whether it's your business your
applications your computational
workloads all of that is unique so you
deserve a cloud that meets your specific
needs softlayer is an IBM company ever
heard of that yeah they do computers
real well internal business machines is
that what it is International Business
Machines something like that I would
imagine international it doesn't matter
IBM uses softlayer and its cloud
infrastructure foundation for all IBM
cloud products and services this
company's going places smart people work
for this company I met some of these
guys really interesting stuff what
they're doing right now all of our
listeners have the opportunity to get
500 clams off cloud infrastructure by
visiting softlayer calm / podcast what
can that pay for bare metal servers
there you go there's the metal virtual
servers storage networking anything you
want from software well you get five
hundred dollars off using softlayer calm
/ podcast get started today hey welcome
back to the show kids uh so this week
cnet com we put up a story about the
alienware steam machine so you don't
know what steam machines are they are
hardware that are that have licensed
valves steamos yes which is a mobile
operating system not some sorry which is
an operating system excuse me that runs
on a computer like product
that steam which is a gate a pc gaming
platform yeah distribution service can
run on and play games uh we saw these
machines come out a while ago
specifically from alienware they came
out with one called the Alpha that had
windows on it right so steam was like
the store it had windows on it you hook
it up to your TV you use an Xbox
controller you play the game on your TV
and it's basically a console right so
now they're coming out with these
strictly steam machines which don't run
windows no they run steams operating
syste Callen expand operations of
correct which here's the caveat isn't
compatible with nearly the amount of the
games are compatible with windows yes so
this thing comes out and we're like all
right well why would you and so here's
another thing they have the same specs
yeah for the most part the same price
right what do you buy why would you do
that and no one can give me a good
answer as to why you would buy the
steamos steam machine and not the Alpha
yeah I don't understand it if it's the
same price that's us make any sense to
me at all I don't get it and there and I
think for indie games you're probably
gonna see a lot of like steam OS
compatible stuff but for like big titles
like other like assassin's creed or call
of duty I don't think stuff is going to
come to steamos at least not at launch
it's weird so like I don't know what
their argument is the I always look at
it on paper was like okay steam gets the
cut out windows like they don't have to
pay for licenses and you get a gaming PC
effectively right and that's all it is
so it's cheaper and it's a gaming PC in
it you plug into TV and it just does
gaming for the most part right but the
second the price is the same in the same
specs like wow I don't I don't know why
why do I just don't know and they also
came out with a controller right and if
anything that's the thing but you could
buy this separately and you can use the
controller windows right they came out
of steam controller to call the steam
controller it has pc / mouse like
tendency
is where the face buttons or rather the
face pads we're like the d-pad and the
you know they have another pet on the
right side of the controller their touch
sensitive so you can kind of use your
right thumb as a mouse in a way if it's
like if you use the console controller
it's effectively the right analog stick
right but there's touch involved in this
one right there is also a stick on the
left side yes I don't know I played
around with it a little bit not a huge
fan of it yeah um but there you have it
steam machines are real they're they're
out now I think the logic they had was
that they wanted something that would
work with obviously controllers you know
work well with like pursue stuff like
that but if you're playing like a real
time strategy game something like that
probably wouldn't work super well with
an Xbox controller so that was they
wanted something that would work for
those games as well but you're not
feeling it which makes the use case so
small at first there's only these days
very small I don't want to see how
people respond to this I just don't see
them really doing well I think if
anything this creates way more of an
awareness and willingness to get that
first one that supports windows well
let's face it i mean you know steam
still gets money you're right so for
sure al and that and that has me
wondering like well maybe this whole
thing is just sort of like a weird
licensing commitment that just has to be
fulfilled um maybe i don't know i don't
have a definitive answer but if you're
interested in steam machine stuff head
over to cnet com we've got the latest on
the product that just came out alright
you went to go back and watch some
x-files yeah so you're going back and
you're watching the original season so
how many seasons were there for like
eight ok but it got really bad after
about five or six ok so where are you at
now we're still in season 10 ok so a
while he was this well Alex had never
watched the first few seasons like she
started around when the movie came out
which was season 5 gotcha and I haven't
rewatched the early season in about
seven years or so so it's been a while
and it's it really holds up I mean
granted some of the
monstery stuff is hokey but most of it
is like they do a really good job hiding
the fact that their budget is not huge
and they don't have like a lot of money
and those episodes are like super
entertaining and awesome it's pretty rad
don't forget like there's a lot of stuff
i mean with you know X Files for me was
like one of the first weird shows that i
started to watch I mean I got into Twin
Peaks a little bit yeah um but I was
after the fact I mean I still love
twilight zone I love these very strange
kind of you know offbeat sci-fi make you
think a little bit kind of stuff yeah
and expose was a big part of that in the
90s and they are bringing x-files back
is the other thing the reboot comes out
I think later maybe december or
something to you I didn't know if it was
this year but I am aware of the reboot
yeah so the reboot is coming I think
it's a six-episode miniseries
effectively and I'm trepidatious because
it's been many many many years since
good x-files existed do you think
moulders just gonna be like was crazy
sex anyways like monster well he did
love porn that was one of his big things
is that he loved porn right in the show
yes in the she was fascinated by it yes
yeah and obviously in real life he does
like sex that's and he was married to
tally oni they are they divorced yeah
they broke up I think mostly because of
the sex thing right um but it's
excellent show and early on it's just
like instantly charming the relationship
is instantly great characters i I've
been also listening to Camille none
giannis podcast the x-files files which
if you like x-files really excellent he
goes episode by episode and talks about
each one and really entertaining and
funny so if you dig x-files or if you
haven't watched it ever go back and
watch it it's on what's really cool on
netflix it's HD I guess think because
they shot it on film or a shot on film
yeah because it's it is full resolution
HD on netflix some of those at some of
those storylines especially the one offs
yeah we're wasn't this the overarching
wow yeah there is one of them's like
abducted right or something
that I mean that's a lot of them what
are you talking about the overarching
oversee things like Mulder had all had
sisters just deducted and like finding
out was printed but the one I just we
just watched the one off last night
called the ice which is like a nod to
the thing mmm the classic car movie and
it's just like great interpersonal like
reactions and felicity huffman's in it
and a bunch of other actors like they
did have great really great our guest
stars because none of these people have
careers been yeah then so just like
really excellent and and we now know
obviously a lot of the people on The X
Files went on to do shows like breaking
bad apparently two of the direct writers
went on to do the final destination
series which I find really interesting
that sounds about right um so yeah I
mean it's great it really holds up and
we'll probably stop watching around
season 5 right because you just kind of
can give up then you them though the I
remember the first movie being good yeah
the first month that so that was the end
of season 5 and the movie came out and
then season six has like a few good one
offs there's like a great one on a boat
a ghost ship where there's Nazis and
they go back in time and it's really
super cool there's a lot of bees bees
are a big part of it yeah that's like a
big conspiracy thing is the bees but the
it basically becomes very clear that
like the conspiracy that they created
could not sustain eight seasons letter
right five right it's tough it's tough
to its this stuff so they basically
could still do good one offs every once
in a while but then Dave the company
essentially was off the show right it
just sort of fell on its face but I have
hopes I really just long as I mean they
look close enough to how they used to
look yeah they're fun it's fine it did
not there were two very attractive
people ya gonna be fine yeah um alright
and then so that's on Netflix you can
watch that you can watch all this season
and they on amazon and then go on Amazon
and watch red oaks it's a show that I
started checking out um you know I
forget what what freakin time does it
take place during can't remember if it's
aa he remember if it's the 90s or the
eight at the 80s okay
late 80s uh takes place a summer camp
sort of thing it's got like shades of
wet hot in it a little bit just with
like this is done straighter is it like
a parody no it's it's it's supposed to
be it's a straight story but I just love
like the styling polarisers in it it's
kind of cool what kind of show is it
it's like it's like a coming-of-age show
about a key a college kid was like
finding himself okay set a set with like
this red oaks kind of like um summer
destination as the backdrop it's like
all the weird people that work there I
understand and that's what it's like the
Gilmore Girls I don't know what that is
whatever you think that means but it's
on amazon video right now if your Prime
member will guess what you got for free
that's great then that's the first
season that's on yeah I believe it's
only one season I really enjoyed also
another exclusive amazon show is
catastrophe with Rob Delaney oh what's
that about it's a BBC show about it was
done in the UK and then brought over by
amazon it's about an American business
guy that hooks up with a woman in the UK
has a one-night stand with her and then
goes back home and then she calls him
and finds out she's pregnant oh wow and
then he moves back but it's like a very
kind of like a dark comedy but like very
wry and good very funny all right there
you have it do recreations um yeah i I
just I like that I like the vibe Richard
kind is in it I love richer kind he's a
he's a funny dude and Josh Meyers also
admires brother uh yeah it's fun it's
just like this weird country called
country club that they all like those
quirky I quirky yeah family like my
community things totally yeah so so

wrote Rossum sighs every well uh whether
or not you've seen it what is your
opinion of the show your he's curious he
or she is curious okay so you've never
seen it ice I've been accidentally
bumping into it on BBC america sheriff
and I'm like what is this yet so it's
yeah but I know people love it yeah so
Alex my fiance absolutely loves it it's
very impenetrable like it's really tough
to get into and what got me into it
there's like a few like similar to X
Files there's like a few a handful of
like excellent excellent one-off
episodes that like don't have a lot of
goofy characters or like goofy costumes
or lame special effects they're just
like good twilight zone x-files type
one-off episodes so those kind of are
the ones to check out this an episode
called blink that everyone points to is
like a good example of that yeah um for
me if you're interested I would
personally recommend skipping until the
first season the Matt Smith started I
think that was season 5 wow this is this
is not but it's good so that was the
issue is like for me I I got held up
hung up on like the campy special
effects on the costumes and it feels
like they didn't really wake up and
unlike ways to fix those problems until
like season four season whatever matt
smith started and i'm sure a lot of
Doctor Who people would be like that's
blasphemy David Tennant's great and so
on and so forth but could pissed off
everybody I'm sure I did that for me not
am I not being like a huge diehard
Doctor Who fan but enjoying it those
were the episodes i was able to watch
and really enjoy because there's like
good he's got a companion that's like
good she's a good actress and like good
backstory and it's a little more
interesting than I think they're all
your seasons are yeah but as you said
it's super impenetrable if you turn it
on randomly i would say eighty percent
of the episodes you're gonna be like
what
how am i watching you would sort of have
to get yourself a little bit into it
first like dip a toe in with like a more
approachable episode and then when they
throw a wacky shitty you like sonic
screwdrivers and stuff you sort of can
handle a little better that's literally
a thing a very common thing that comes
up so that would be my recommendation
there's a great episode written by Neil
Gaiman called the doctor's wife I think
it's called um and so there are like
excellent standout episodes I'm just not
sure I'm ever gonna watch I don't think
it's for you to be honest I don't think
it's your vibe you're pretty dumb so
thanks man on to the next story so which
star trek not show yeah was the best in
your opinion is on other questions are
right I don't know anything my son I
know enough about Star Trek to know that
I cannot voice an opinion everyone's
next generation me next generation is
generally considered that people really
like it I was the what was deep space
nine you say Stan was one of them to
people like Voyager was another one
Voyager has sort of like half and half
of those are the best I never got
hardcore into the Star Trek episode
shows I love Star Trek six of the
undiscovered country the movie it's kind
of a weird forgotten about movie I think
in the group of Star Trek movies but
yeah I really like that movie but I
never got into show it was like the
first kind of show that I got into that
was like that was Battlestar Galactica
the new one so surrounded by nerds yeah
um what is your favorite scripted show
currently on TV I can answer that real
easily it's a show called Fargo oh yeah
a second in Fargo is fantastic it's but
that first season was probably the best
first season of television I've ever
seen I can't think of a show that did it
had a better first season other close
ones would be lost no no I have an
answer for that Breaking Bad had a good
first season but Fargo is ten episodes
of just like amazing writing amazing
acting amazing cinematography and story
it's just like what the hell are a
psycho
not such a good first season oh no cuz
I'm trying to think like cop like drama
you can be any it could be any I know
Rick and Morty had a great first Rick
and Morty an excellent first season I
think I feel like uh I don't like so
there's a lot of stuff on Comedy Central
that really solid for season one city at
a very good for us season and excellent
for a season it's up there but Fargo
right now as far as much about if you
forgot like this season's looking to be
better than the first one which I can't
even understand how they're able to do
I'm trying to avoid any marketing
anything so are you have you watched the
first episode no did it aired yeah I
watched you should do that here's my
issue with it's such an atmospheric like
involving whites like you're
watching a coen brothers movie
commercials are so much cooler than show
the bane of that to the point that I'm
probably just gonna buy it on iTunes or
something to avoid having to watch
commercials we just DVR it and fast
forward yeah but even that it's leavin
that takes me out of it a little bit
yeah you need help brother I know I'm
crazy another question aside from post
in are such the 404 would you consider
yourself a poster or an observer on
reddit as in do you create a new post
often or do you mainly read other posts
and comment on them I tend to fall in
the latter camp yeah I would say my
ratio is probably 20 to 1 in terms of
comment to posting but i don't i'm
probably 500 to 1 yeah I I and the only
time I post apart from the like random
posts i do on the subreddit it's like
sometimes I'll do like a destiny reddit
post I try and I try and do
showerthoughts oh yeah I don't really
get that I get intimidated by those like
huge subreddits because there's just so
many so many people it's like oh this is
funny yeah and I get frustrated when
they don't do anything so that I have
had stuff make it to the front page of
reddit you have yeah those test your
claim to fame I think twice I made it to
the front page of reddit I remember that
believe me you make sure everyone knows
about it lastly from and this is all for
has been for
Santa Santa ran 97 questions lastly in
the theme of Halloween do you think that
kids nowadays are more difficult to
scare than your generation if so why
great question i would say yes i think
that's just an evolutionary thing i
think like every generation becomes numb
to horror to a certain degree I don't
think yeah I don't think the new
generation is numb i think the they are
there they're numb I think they're more
exposed to scarier things earlier in
life because the internet because of TV
being so ubiquitous whatever like
they're gonna see horrifying like worms
put in ears stuff yeah they're like
three right and then by the time they're
six they're like oh i'll watch friday
13th i don't care Blair Witch of course
I think you're right I think I think
that's definitely a thing those punk
kids they're gonna overrun us I don't
know about that they don't know how to
talk to each other um boo jenkins rights
in of all the time travel movies and
television shows what do you believe got
the actual core theory of time travel
the most correct what is the core three
attendre like who do you think
exemplified time travel in the best
fashion gotta say he goes on back to the
future really made time travel the idea
of it pretty cool and stylish it being
in a DeLorean sure so what I guess he's
the requirements it's like cool
establish or like true to like the song
like what like yeah like the signs of it
or what what entertainment property has
presented the notion of time travel in
the best light okay I don't know if this
is an entertainment property but the
book so I had short stores works a sound
of thunder huh I that was um oh my god
I'm blanking on the author's name now
but a Google sound of that you'll find
right now in three seconds Oh sound I
think it's a sign of thunder and it's
from you know it's old but essentially
it's a story of time travel where that
what's remember ever I thank you i
blanked on it I knew is something
so whatever it's a short story it'll
take you two minutes to read but it's
about people that go back in time to
hunt dinosaurs effectively and for sport
for sport and they have to like stay on
this path very strictly and something
goes wrong and they someone steps off
the path and something goes wrong and
then they go back to their current
future I guess and things are not as
they was butter five it's effectively
the butterfly effect but I feel like it
was you know you don't really see that
level of thought as much I mean you know
and there's the classic like the time
machine hg wells and stuff like that but
i always found the sound of thunder like
to be a really concise because it's just
a short story or novella i guess but
it's a very concise idea of time travel
and shows all the potential
repercussions because of it and we
struggled with i have never read this
i'm going to read it I'll read it
tonight YUM I I mean I always struggled
with some prolific authors and the way
they deal with time travel like a
Vonnegut okay who on paper I should love
Kurt Vonnegut sure i like i love his
writing i love his writing but like some
of his stuff like that his book time
quake yeah like I just couldn't just
couldn't do it because that because the
science wasn't matching up for you or it
just didn't work for me maybe I'm you
know I i have a problem reading in and
comprehending like i can't always suck
down the whole thing where I have a
sometimes that I wander a little chair I
mind did he do and I have trouble yeah
comics me a while to get through books
um but you know I don't know that's why
short stories work way better for me and
comics kind of work better for sure too
because they are for whatever reason
able to capture my attention yeah uh you
know comics also get to the point yeah
they don't really beat around the bush
but either way a sort story is
definitely something that i could
probably
my head around a little better so I'm
gonna check out a sound of thunder yeah
believe it or not sound of thunder was
published in nineteen fifty two and it
made it into Playboy magazine in the
june nineteen fifty-six issue Wow I
bring a playboy oh yeah relevant because
playboy ladies and gentlemen is ditching
nudity yep they're putting clothes back
on I think it's a smart move everyone
freaked out and was like this is stupid
or this is gonna headline it's not only
a good headline I think it's good for
their business of course it is it's like
who is buying playboy to see nudes these
days nobody and all that all the nudes
did for them was make them like make you
feel weird buying in a store or like
they would have to be blocked in the
airport by those like cardboard things
that like block all the porn right so
whatever now it's like Maxim I mean I'm
not gonna go out and buy but I guarantee
it'll a help with their advertisers and
be probably maybe help with their
subscriptions I don't know if anybody
going in subscribe to it but might be
the kicking a website stuff and you know
maybe not feeling bad about picking it
up for a flight right arm their
readership apparently in subscriptions
is 800,000 that's like way more than I
thought that is a lot more than I
thought but that's down from 5.6 million
I think at their prime which is also not
a lot here again it's a magazine yeah
yeah apparently they did this on the
website first they made the website safe
for work and then there traffic
quadrupled yeah that sounds very it's
it's it's great I don't know that
they're related necessarily I mean they
also had like I think they had that
interview with what's-his-name from dark
knight as Jim Gordon gaeriel Gary Oldman
I think was a Playboy interview right
when he said and that was it she talked
 about fifth element among other
things shifted what is it I forget I
pretend that denied um yeah so there you
