at the Sony STR DN 1050 receiver while
Sony has prided itself on its audio and
video quality there were a few years
there when its products lagged behind
its competitors but as far as receivers
are concerned the company is currently
firing on all cylinders and it's STR DN
1050 receiver offers excellent sound for
around $500
while most receivers look identical the
DN 1050 is reasonably stylish in an
understated way and includes handy
features like a front mounted HDMI port
and USB port the remote is one of the
biggest changes here with a much
simplified design that is much easier to
use than the large scientific
calculators of yesteryear the user
interface though is what makes this
receiver really stand out with
attractive icons and a straightforward
menu system features include Bluetooth
with optics Apple AirPlay and built-in
Wi-Fi the streaming services on offer
are a little lean compared to the
equivalently priced Onkyo with only Sony
unlimited music tuning and Pandora on
offer that doesn't mention it in the
receiver menus it does support Spotify
connect unfortunately the number of hdmi
ports is also less than last year's
eight now reduced to only six in use so
sony has the best sound of the receivers
we've tested so far this year with a
rich and convincing stereo image and
excellent surround sound whether you
have two speakers or a full set the
performance of the Dan 1050 is as good
as you can expect for the price only
when it came to using some of the
networking features was I less than
impressed in conclusion if you're
looking for sound quality this is the
receiver to get but if you want a bunch
of doohickeys and Deauville a keys and
also decent quality sound then the onkyo
TX NR 636 is the one to consider this
