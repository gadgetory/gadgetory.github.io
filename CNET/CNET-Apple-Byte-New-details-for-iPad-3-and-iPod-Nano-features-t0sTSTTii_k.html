welcome to the apple pie for all the
good and bad inside the world of apple
and we start things off today with the
latest product rumors now i know you're
tired about ipad 3 maybe you aren't but
let's talk ipod nano you know i'm not
really the biggest fan of the device but
maybe they'll win me over after new
photos were released of a nano casing
that appears to support a rear facing
camera now we've seen them in the past
but mi see gadget is saying this picture
is real and it's a two-month-old
prototype the report Apple is having
issues with the 1.3 megapixel camera
taking over exposed photos even though
the user interface for the cameras
finished and that's what's holding them
back but who really wants to take
pictures with the nano anyways this
great looks good that's awesome okay
okay be the lion you are one with that
you are alive okay so I guess there's
someone out there now boy genius report
provides us with the ipad 3 room of the
week with photos of screenshots from
Apple's I boot development and debugging
software that reveals details and a new
application processor that is presumably
part of the new asics system-on-a-chip
after the a4 and a5 chips have shown
earlier model numbers now the report
says it's still expected to be a
quad-core processor and supports the
claim that the new iPad will support LTE
gsm and cdma 3g networks on the single
device now rumors also pointed to
februari as the announcement for the
ipad 3 but that was recently debunked
after the loop reported there will be no
februari event at all so so those are
you hoping i would lose that bet about
my armpit hair it looks like all bets
are off Oh Brian I wanted this I'm
really sorry Apple biters but you'll
have to blame that on the big a and in
not so surprising news a new report from
Piper Jaffray says a major TV component
supplier disclosed that Apple has
contacted them to ask about their
products rumors have been flying all
over the place from screen size to
release dates and this is another
product that the rumor mill will not
leave alone all right let's take a
breather and check out our app
check out this new game called
papermonster the best way I can describe
it is it's like little big planet for
iOS and it's a throwback platformer
that's a 99-cent universal app it's a 2d
side scroller with 3d graphics with the
all-important double jump now you
collect buttons which help you get you
credits to then purchase different
clothing to customize your character or
you can go the lazy way and by your own
buns but check it out it's a game for
you or the kiddies that you'll love look
at how high he chose you all right back
to the controls now we wanted to give
you a follow-up to the foxconn an apple
story reported on last week the day
after the news broke Apple CEO Tim Cook
sent a memo to employees that leaked out
to the Internet and he reiterated apple
stance cook wrote we care about every
worker in our worldwide supply chain any
accident is deeply troubling and any
issue with working conditions is cause
for concern any suggestion that we don't
care is patently false and offensive to
us now the New York Times responded by
saying they still stand by the reporting
but really the point here is that Apple
has such an influence they can affect
real change in workers conditions
they're doing it right now but they can
even do better all right let's check out
some quick bites Apple released the mac
OS 10.7 point 3 update recently but many
users are experiencing a widespread
crashing of apps and artwork errors in
the crash notice so the solution is to
use the combo version of the update
right now that should fix the issue and
yes you can update it over your current
running version of 10-point 7.3 now also
i berated the first release of final cut
pro x but Apple has now released updates
for multi camera support advanced chroma
keen and XML support and motion and
compressor are also receiving updates so
that's been coming for a long time and
if you're frustrated with iTunes Match
like I am because it's sometimes matches
your explicit versions of songs with
censored versions instead cult of mac
reports Apple is said to be working on a
fix there's no work around at the moment
so we'll keep you posted with that and
let's leave you with a fun little video
there's been stories about Syria and how
she has trouble understanding Scottish
people so comedian Gavin McInnes decided
to give her a try in this video
cooney is uh gonna give me a hand here
getting some neat and like I'd something
simple like a chop by ear maybe a jammy
Tochar and then a pint of I don't know
you know my kids like it I caledonian EE
I'm not aware of any meetings about gang
without Mahatma Johnny George and Joanie
jinpachi look you yeah I need a sandwich
a jammie Dodger it's just bread and jam
no need for profanity or for say that I
it's a good laugh but be aware of the
constant F bombs throughout the video
that's not for the kiddies alright
that's gonna do it for this we show
email us at the apple byte at cnet com
and we'll get to them i'm brian Tong
thanks for watching we'll catch you next
time for another bite of the Apple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
