nonprofit co.org wants at least to start
hour of code is an event that aims to
teach kids about programming it takes
place December 9th to the 15th during
computer science education week the idea
is to get a 1-hour basic introduction to
this field that is sort of behind this
veil of mystery it's this veil that
separates the average person from the
mark zuckerberg and we want to basically
break down that veil and let people take
one hour to basically see what it's like
to write code sound intimidating code
org says coding is easier than you think
it started with ones and zeros and even
in for last 30 years nobody really does
that stuff but now it's at the point
where giving instructions to a computer
are almost like speaking a simple
language to help educators introduce the
topic to students code org has compiled
a range of lessons
Mark Zuckerberg may not draw them in but
Angry Birds might
six-year-olds play it not even knowing
that it's learning they're just playing
it because it's a game and you know each
level that you progress through the game
you're learning a little bit more about
how computer science works Westborough
middle school in South San Francisco is
one of nearly 10,000 schools across the
globe planning to participate it's time
to really understand how to go about
doing certain tasks and understanding
the benefits of technology like many
schools Westborough offers a computer
lab course for students but that focuses
on computer literacy the art of code is
about incorporating more computer
science in the classrooms not just
learning how to use Microsoft Office and
use the Internet's but actually being
able to understand how to create these
applications hour of code is backed by
dozens of tech companies and luminaries
like Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey and
Bill Gates 13 when I first got access to
a computer file sharing service Dropbox
is donating storage for the event
CEO drew Houston hopes students get as
hooked on coding as he did I was lucky
enough that my parents bought a PC
Junior when I was like three and so
there's this like glowing box in the
living room and had all these buttons my
dad showed me how to use the computer
and actually showed me how to write my
first line of code 20 years later
Houston has built a multi-million dollar
business using code gets the right code
and then press a button and then
millions of people now have a problem
that's solved and I can't think of any
other tool that has that kind of power
it's unlikely the Common Core education
standards will be revised to include
coding still 60 minutes could bring some
change
within an hour you can build up to
something more complicated that you
didn't even realize and have that little
aha moment of I actually got a computer
to do something for me a moment that may
spark interest in a career or simply
strengthen logic skills either way
sounds like an hour well spent in San
Francisco I'm suma das CNET for CBS News
