it's Wednesday January 11 2012 I am
Brian Tom and I am hollywood welcome to
buzz out loud scene that's podcasting a
determinate like live from CES we are on
day two of initially thought it was day
three last night it's like more for us I
think the week continues to get harder
but still just as fun still a lot of
great stuff that we can see on the show
floor and everything yeah yesterday was
the first official day of the show the
first day of the show floor was open to
attendees and so everybody started to
get a look all the duct tape time came
off the vacuuming got finished already
got a look at what's actually on the
floor and then of course a little bit
more news that will talk about and we
had our awesome cnet party last night so
we're so covering from that we're still
recovering from that we had a really we
had a fun time the parties have started
the gadgets are coming out the TVs are
bigger and actually our colleagues at
newscom did Jennifer gave in at newscom
did a pretty awesome roundup what
mattered on day one at CES and we've
seen you know we we maybe not have
expected to be this larger trend but
it's even becoming bigger the way that I
from kind of what I've seen in feel
ultrabooks Ultimates have been huge you
know we've already seen companies enter
into the Ultrabook market but
specifically here at CES we've we've
seen ton of entries del with their XPS
13 we've seen a HP with their Specter
which is like a corning gorilla glass
covered laptop on three sides yeah but
they're the definition of an ultrabook
has also kind of changed here at CES
because what we used to think of as
let's say macbook air type clones we're
now starting to see companies call
ultrabooks 14-inch laptop 15 inch
laptops so you know it's it's a laptop
but they're kind of changing the
definition here at CES of what an
ultrabook used to be yeah in fact I had
a conversation yesterday in fact if
you're here live after this we're going
to have a laptop discussion with our
laptop editors on this stage me and dan
ackerman and I had a conversation with
Scott Stein yesterday he was saying he's
kind of getting skeptical of the ultra
thing because there's already mission
creep two things first there's already
mission creep Samsung is calling the new
series 9 which is a 15 inch laptop an
ultrabook I mean it weighs three and a
half pounds which doesn't sound like a
lot but it feels like a brick compared
to something like this 11-inch macbook
or something that you started to expect
out of that ultrabook word so they're
definitely having that mission creep
problem and then on top of that Intel
gave a press conference on day one that
essentially said don't buy anything
that's announced here at the show
because all the good stuff in ultrabooks
is going to happen toward the end of the
year they said that's when you're going
to get voice recognition and windows 8
and Ivy Bridge everybody's being all
sneaky about whether they're prototypes
are even running the ivy bridge
architecture it's I feel like the
Ultrabook thing is much more up in the
air than I thought it would be
considering how many are littered
throughout the floor yeah I mean it's
one of the big themes that we've
definitely seen her the show but like
you said it's another way and see kind
of like how mobile phones have taken off
where they're they're going to be
released throughout the year rapidly and
constantly we're probably gonna see the
similar trend with ultrabooks take that
take you know follow that lead so yeah
definitely so don't be in a rush to buy
a new ultrabook because clearly they're
just going to get better with time yeah
uh we got a look at first like yesterday
at every year there's like a promising
concept that comes out this one is the
project Fiona tablet an actual
full-fledged gaming tablet they hope and
they showed it running some pretty
impressive first person shooter stuff
yeah this is from the company razor who
does a lot of great gaming stuff in
there they're implementing pretty much
controllers on the side of a tablet so
everyone's complain that you can't
really do any hardcore gaming on a
tablet where razors trying to say like
no no you actually can we're gonna give
you the tools to do that right it'll be
interesting to see him how people here
and how you know it's one of our
nominees it wasn't actually razor that
same company got the people's voice
award last year for the Switchblade
which was the mobile pc gaming a mafia
the gaming laptops all the hot buttons I
don't think that ever came out I'm just
gonna put that out there I don't I don't
remember if it did or not I my google
this while we discuss it ah but that but
it does it looks like another kind of
potential oh yeah I did it happened it
exists it's amazing how something like
that will get so much presence e yes and
that it comes
eight months later and were like who
we've talked about a lot just here at
CES were a lot of things do get lost in
the shuffle once that once the year
actually goes by yeah but all eyes are
on everything here another another thing
that we still does seem to be any way
okay it's up in it came out but it was
they weren't able to manufacture enough
units it's been like a lukewarm
reception but yet again a cool concept
from them yeah also on some of the
things that we've seen here at CES with
Intel finally showcasing their first
mobile phone this is from Lenovo this
the k800 this will be the first mobile
phone that comes to market it will only
come out to China they have not said if
they'll bring it to the US yet but it'll
come with our medfield processor the
k800 will have a 4.5 inch screen it runs
gingerbread but this is one of the now
since we're Intel really trying to step
up their game in the mobile platform
with where they've really fallen behind
with armed ships and processors you know
Qualcomm with their Snapdragon they've
been behind the race as everything is
transition to mobile they're really
trying to make the argument that we can
produce chips that are just as efficient
if not more efficient than what's out
there and you'll have to wait and see
what we come out with to it later in
2012 and I was happy to see Paul
Otellini focus so much on that during
their keynote yesterday because that is
you know they gave that big press
conference and talked all about
ultrabooks and people were saying look
it feels like the real thing that Intel
needs to be talking about is this war
with arm why aren't they mobile wire and
why have they not done a better job so
they they kind of pauline ii started
their keynote by sort of saying oh no
we've been in the game the whole time
we're doing a great job we're fine we're
good but we are super gonna focus on
this this year like we're all over this
this year not that we haven't been
before but this year we are all about it
so you got your hands on that phone last
night yeah i mean the phone it's a
little blocky right it's i'm still I'm
still not a fan of the like four and a
half five inch form factor yet right I
still have it's not because i have very
tablet I don't want I don't miss out on
my pocket I mean I think I think the
four incher is four and a half and five
kind of get kind of gets a little you
know uncomfortable hold for my hands but
the phone itself it was sleek I didn't
really feel like there were any
advantages of its speed and snappiness
compared to what we've seen on the
market right now even the operating
system although was a little different
it wasn't anything that is everyone's
gonna flock to an Intel processor but
what Intel's challenge here is getting
their process or getting their platform
with vendors
everywhere like if this is really the
only phone it's going to take some time
before we see their their processors
across the board by other manufacturers
other manufacturers already have these
relationships with other processors like
we talked about you know ARM processors
Snapdragon hung hummingbird from Samsung
yeah so that how much entry in the
market will they really get is dell
going to be there buddy in this venture
who else can they really get on board to
push their mobile platform forward I
know well they did have motorola motoroi
sorry no motorola joined lenovo but
announced that they would do
intel-powered motorola devices later
this year so there is you're exactly
right there may be a little traction
they may have been able to trot out one
partner but the fact is a lot of these
manufacturers especially if they have
long lead times for these phones some of
the stuff is already sewn up no it's it
there's no question that despite what
they say they're really late to this
game and actually watching how this
evolves over the year i think is going
to be one of the more interesting sort
of company like industry stories that we
get to follow lenovo like we said
unveiled their first smartphone also and
we have a cool poll because i have to
say looking around the show floor I
actually did think there would be a lot
more smartphone announcements by now I
mean there have been some but it didn't
feel like the flood from last year the
droid bionic and the Atrix 4G yeah it
was it was like it just felt like phones
were coming out this guy there have been
a few phone announcements here but not
so many so we put up a pole at newscom
asking our readers what's grab their
attention so far at CES yeah so we have
an audience here really quickly if
someone could shadows what is really
what is really grabbed we're gonna just
read down the 55 options that we had and
just we'll have you guys raise your hand
from what you've read and seen what has
grabbed your attention so far here at
CES first of all a bigger thinner
smarter fancier TVs than ever is that
been the number one thing that's caught
your attention crazy okay yes no hands
for books ultrabooks kind of the new
mobile laptop super slim appears not
even playing i can tell that i think
they're waiting damn have people's
uniquely designed here like laptops that
turn into tablets has that been tickling
your fancy no no no nobody's having the
dynamic video on smartphones you guys
okay i love we got a little bit we got a
little bit 3d printers
all right all right look I'm with you on
that one I voted for that according to
our survey right now we are close around
it it just came out somewhere in about a
thousand votes the number one thing that
is grabbing people's attention this year
right now at least at home at least at
home thirty-eight percent responded with
the bigger thinner and fancier TVs it's
working now what now with that list
after you heard that entire list maybe
some people are all yeah actually it is
the bigger fancier TV we talked about
how it's going to be really they're
pushing this is the center of the
ecosystem but have you seen the OLED
displays yeah I thought that it was I
really truly thought that I was over
being wowed by TVs se es I thought okay
give me a break I've seen the TV the
size of like a house wall and they're
this and that and then I stood in front
of the oled TV and I just I was
flabbergasted it is beautiful it is
actually that much of an increasing
quality am I going to drop a grand on it
anytime in the year too probably not
right but it was it was enough of an
increase that it was really it's it is
standing out and I think people are
actually seeing the value proposition
even if they're not necessarily ready to
buy it still it shows that TVs have that
lasting sort of sex factor and that the
focus on 3d hasn't diminished people's
interest in just having TVs with a
better picture yeah Jimmy's a great
lesson right stick with a better picture
thing yeah so you guys can you if you
have a chance to check it out you can go
over to LG's booth and Samsung they're
both displaying their own leads and some
of these TVs are literally four
millimeters thin they're ridiculous
enter than some of the phones that you
guys have in your pocket sharp i think
is showing off an 8k TV which i am dying
to get my eyeballs on i heard it i mean
it sounds like circling ridiculous point
right but i encourage you to go look at
that and the LG the 84 inch 3d for K
monster monster TV really great TVs on
the floor right now we're gonna take a
quick break when we come back we'll
recap some of the cool things that we
got to do yesterday
namely Brian Todd oh come on duetto with
LL Cool J
welcome back to buzz out loud live at
CES we have a studio audience today
we're excited coming out everybody
coming out there's going to be a lot
more amazing programming on our stage we
probably just want to sit right here
we're gonna have an epic look at laptops
in a minute or two 50 cent fitty cent
will be on our stage at 2pm talking to
brian Tong so we're pretty excited about
that we you know this is the place to be
look at the company seats feel free to
come on in sit down there's room alright
so yesterday we had CNET's kind of this
is like our premier panel event the next
big thing super session where we talk
about what we think is going to be the
next big thing the next big tech trend
for 2012 this year we focused on the
ecosystem which I felt good about
because the word ecosystem was bandied
around roughly nine million times on
press day and beyond it's this you know
this really this idea of all of your
devices working together in concert
either from one manufacturer or all
powered by something like Android so I
sat down with we had a great panel
actually i sat down with eric schmidt
from google for 20 minutes we talked to
tim baxter who's the president of
Samsung America's consumer and
enterprise divisions and then we talked
to sit like a great VC guy and an
entrepreneur who sits on the Amazon
board and we really just got an overview
of the whole thing but we're only going
to talk about Eric Schmidt right now
yeah I was going to say like that that
was kind of where all the news bits and
tickets came from you had a chance that
you were the one interviewing him it's
true if he seemed to be a little dodgy
with some of your questions and not
answer them directly is that an accurate
statement glass is what he does he mark
my words he would go into politics he is
so good but they have the whole panel is
available online or the whole session
but one the main thing that I took away
from it and the thing that I really want
to try to get a question on was whether
they feel that Android is too fragmented
because I feel that way and when I asked
my google+ followers and my Twitter
followers what they wanted to hear what
their number one question was it was
some version of when will the
fragmentation end will you offer a stock
of a net one of the most clever
suggestions actually was could Google
start offering a stock vanilla
android installation like a secondary
rom or something so that you could just
install stock vanilla Android if you had
to know how anything I like it on it'll
be nice I know I was like I should
totally do that he was not having it in
fact he said he doesn't think that
Android is fragmented he think he thinks
its differentiation between devices that
continues to offer greater freedom so
differentiation for better or for worse
for better or for worse yeah and that
they feel but but our panelists really
especially Blake girly who's a venture
capitalist and Blake kerkorian who
founded sling and is on the Amazon board
they both seem to feel that Android at
this point is pretty much unstoppable in
terms of that platform that is going to
drive multiple devices in fact we even
saw we've seen now too I think one from
Lenovo and China one from a TV
manufacturer that I'm not familiar with
two android-powered televisions and Eric
Schmidt told me that Android is even
operating in at least one refrigerator
that he knows up so that was one of
their goals about a year ago when they
announced that kind of initiative to
push Android into other platforms right
like they wanted it home appliances yep
and we're starting to see that creep out
there so because of its flexibility at
least to be able to do what these
manufacturers want to do with it it is
going to live a lot longer life just
beyond the mobile devices that we're
seeing so yeah and it seems like if
anybody's in a peson you know I Samsung
has a great vision of the ecosystem but
involves all Samsung devices Android has
a vision of an ecosystem that is their
platform powering anything it was a
really it was a very interesting
conversation I thought although i would
say that dodgy is the word actually at
the end i asked him one question and he
it was you know my last question he goes
I'm not going to answer that question I
can answer a different question it's
this and I was like how did the crowd
responded we always right when you asked
him what was more important to the
ecosystem hardware or software and
services exactly what do you think and
he goes I'm not gonna answer that I'm an
ass I'm gonna tell you what most
surprised me in 2011 yeah it was like he
said instead I'm gonna tell you where
baby giraffes come from hahaha all right
he said he you know it ventually answer
eventually did answer the question but
I'll tell you politics for that guy but
another thing that you guys can look
forward to is Omar women in tech panel
right our women in tech panel yes
that'll be happening at is that today is
today at five o'clock back at the stage
of women in tech
we'll be talking with men or welcome
obviously it's a it's a conversation
about the industry and I hope you guys
will all join us it's going to be
fascinating where Marissa Meyer from
google Padma warrior the CTO of cisco
and Caterina fake who founded co-founded
flicker and founded hunch which ebay
just bought for 80 million dollars so
it's going to be a fascinating
collection of women I think just talking
about why there's never any line in the
girls room here it's a yes now also CES
you guys know there's a lot of
celebrities that come out here to
partner with companies to throw new
products but we had a really awesome
opportunity LL Cool J came to our stage
yesterday but he wasn't here to pimp a
product he knew nothing about it he came
to showcase his product it's called boom
dizzle and it really is a game-changer
for audio music production where you can
real-time create music with someone in a
completely different location let's say
someone on the east coast summer on the
west coast someone in a completely other
another country and be able to make
music and we got to test it out we got
to play with it okay I'm right as being
so modest right now because he ll cool j
are soul mates they had the most fun
time of here can we play a little bit of
the when brian Tong sings no did why
today's have a come on no that's
embarrassing anyway it's actually
fascinating software i love that i mean
watching that video the idea of
collaborative music making yeah very
cool one thing about l2 he's I mean he's
a really smart guy but when we walked on
the show floor a lot of times sometimes
when we do these tours people just want
to walk through them they don't really
care yeah about that technology oh it's
I would ask him do you want to stop use
like yeah let's go check out and he
would soak in you know some of the new
demos that Sony had with their you know
crystal LED technology he would walk up
to the LG wall and we know we were just
standing there for five minutes and he
was just like this is crazy and he would
just love you in every moment of it so
him and his buddies they were just like
freaking out when they saw the OLED TVs
you know and so tech is he loves me he
loves his tech and he you know he's all
about it so yep I think everybody really
is all right back to CES news real quick
and then we'll wrap up with a little bit
of non SI es news a kind of a cool story
we all know that Microsoft is pulling
out of CES what you may not have read or
I hope you did read on news com is that
Microsoft's CES floor space you know
they have that huge corner there in the
central hall that's what they have
dominated all this time
that space sold in 45 minutes 45 minutes
obviously was scooped up pretty quickly
a dish and Chinese electronics maker
hisense they pretty much are splitting
that space for the same price that
Microsoft would have paid yeah it wasn't
like oh so by the way what that price
was yeah they won't tell us half a
million a million dollars what do you
guys think we have any sense of how much
that boots baby when your booth
organization any insiders no I guess we
could ask our market it I'm sure it's a
lot of it is extremely prime real estate
and it's it's gonna be really
interesting next year to walk into the
central hall which for years years and
years nears has been Intel Microsoft and
see it be all different anyway i love
that it was just like in case you were
worrying that people weren't as
interested in having big flashy booth
space on the CES show floor apparently
they are you know apparently that's
still working for them all right so we
have this little gadget have you have
you had a chance to play with this
little thing no but i want to think i
don't know if it's still in our back in
our CBS area but you know we had there's
always kind of like fun silly little
toys that are playable here at CES um
how about an inflatable cube an
inflatable bouncy cube for your ipad
just not for you maybe for your kids or
maybe for you it's adorable but it it's
you so you can sort of embed your ipad
in what is basically a giant bouncy
beach ball thingy so then i'll toss it
all around it's like your Betsy house
for ipad okay ipads gonna have a lot of
fun but i don't know i know you guys are
like know anyone bind up for the kids
know anyone nope on the toy stuff i saw
one hand go up back there that's right
you know what I know exactly my
five-year-old is gonna see this and be
like it that's on my list random tangent
you know how we talk about CS catering
to the kids who oh man I can't remember
the company off the top my head I should
but at a digital experience they're
showing off literally a DVR for children
so you put it in between your cable box
in their TV it's this handheld device
and it allows you to record scheduled
programs and then the that your child
can disconnect it and take it with them
wherever they want to go and watch TV
shows that have been recorded like a DVR
it's one of those durable you know
fisher-price looking type toys little
screen but I mean it's it's scary
because we see how
advanced kids are getting with all this
technology the touch technology yeah
boys a touchscreen but this is a DVR for
your kids and it when I saw them like my
niece's would totally use that not that
I'm gonna buy it for them because that's
danger he's going I want to be I don't
want my you know my sister to say you're
bad uncle but kids and the stuff that CS
comes out for them you sometimes see
some of those crazy things but it's
there I do I like to see the toys that
come out I am also skeptical about the
beach ball thing but that kind of DVR
p.m. we prob looking thing all right so
real quickly not at CES an interesting
update on SOPA which we have not
forgotten the Stop Online Piracy Act
which is everybody on the internet wants
to go away I had an interesting
conversation actually with a guy from
CEA yesterday about this and he said it
you know Congress people are reporting
that they're getting hundreds even
thousands of phone calls about sopa anti
SOPA calls because partly it's such an
easy sell right everyone's really mad at
Congress every loves the internet and
they want to protect it and nobody wants
to hear about people with a lot of money
getting benefits right so you so you
come along and you say like hey these
people with a lot of money who who exert
undue influence on Congress want
Congress to break the Internet and the
crowd goes wild so opposition continues
to grow to sopa reddit which is a pretty
geeky online forum is actually they're
going way farther than the you know
change an avatar picture they have
announced an entire blackout day on
January 18th the entire site will go
dark yeah for 12 hours to protest sopa
so this is an if you're not familiar
with them this is a news aggregator
right yeah this is great this is a news
aggregator site and they're their
messages look if you if you let SOPA
pass through stories or sites like us
could be completely removed from the
internet from existence without any due
process right they would have no control
over their psycho in a way so they're
putting a big message that says stop
sofa and you know it it's it's some
people say oh they might be trying to
drive attention but really for those of
us that love and care about the internet
and use it every day everyone in this
room yeah it's an important message to
sell any website that allows commenting
that is a forum that has sort of
discussion going on is at risk for how
you know having someone accidentally or
on purpose post a site to infringing
content
under this law the domain could be
blocked the domain could be removed and
you'd never be able to get to read it
because someone posted a site to what
was said by someone out by a private
party to be infringing content but
there's yeah and for those of you that
are here III mwah its far-reaching it
could take down sites literally like you
know break a Google searches ebay
transact if they could say look there's
there's a legal content on eBay we want
you to take that down not take down the
auction take down the site yeah I'm it's
that far reaching it's really bad we
have all written a lot about it so if
you don't know we're talking about come
and ask us later or read up on it
because it's it's terrible we're not
going to mince any words on that and
then speaking of google searches twitter
and google in a big huge fight right now
google this week rolled out some
personalized search results where they
are changing their algorithm instead of
just simply giving you the sort of most
relevant results when you're signed in
you'll get results that are a little
more personalized to you and as twitter
puts it a little more heavy on the
google plus and so google so twitter
fired back they very clearly said we're
concerned that as a result of google's
changes people will not find twitter
results they'll find google+ results
instead google's changes in that that
google is breaking the way that search
works so this is probably going to be
one to follow its heating up pretty dust
no i don't know if it'll find twitter
information harder to find but it does
feel a little bit like google
prioritizing some of their own results
which we see that that's the thing that
makes everybody nervous about google and
big machine yeah so all right we weren't
look we're getting this thing so we got
to go we have more stuff coming up on
the stage that is up a bar buzz out loud
show for today we will be back on Friday
there's no show tomorrow because the
best of CES awards presentation is
happening right here at the same you
guys can't miss that the 17 winners of
the best stuff that we've seen here on
the show floor yeah and hopefully
awesome products that will continue to
be the best throughout the year but
again this this is the flagship awards
ceremony here at CES yeah I'm sure to
come and check that out and like I said
right after this we'll be looking at a
bunch of new laptops dan ackerman
usually shows up with an armload of them
and we just we look them all over so
there's a little gadget porn happening
in about 15 minutes here right on the
stage fitty said like i said we'll be
back at two o'clock and five o'clock as
