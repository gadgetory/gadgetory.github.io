cnet mailbag the show where we let you
in on the wacky wild and wonderful email
that we get from viewers like you Vinny
had a question about Brian tongues
recent video on how to stop iTunes from
backing up your iphone and ipod touch
every time you sync he said I was just
wondering if you could explain what the
iTunes backup is actually backing up I
was wondering the same thing brian Tong
tells me it's backing up any changes
you've made so if you have to restore
your iphone in the future you'll be able
to get them from last time you synced
unfortunately that backup can apparently
take as little as five minutes and as
long as 30 30 thus our video hope it
helps Claudio from New Jersey roading to
say from time to time the cnet TV home
page along with other seen at home pages
such as cnet news change their looks to
a black background with the cnet logo
modified but then either a few minutes
or hours later it changes back to the
regular design see not having problems
with the new look or is it just a test
Claudio our redesign is still in the
rollout stage we're testing it right now
so that only a few users get it at a
time so sometimes you see it sometimes
you don't it's because we're trying to
get feedback and let people see the
design without serving the whole thing
up at once but soon we will be all black
background a new logo all the time I
hope you like it now a few comments on
the terrible job that we're apparently
doing here at seen it Fred wrote like
I'm watching the 2008 audi a8 l w12
video and at 340 that video skips like
who edited that vid and did they bother
to watch it when they were done like
seen it wake up I say wake up flop I
like cookies i also like cookies fred
and even though we barely noticed the
tiny audio hiccup which editor Mitch
Chang swears was an actual paz by Brian
Cooley we still fix the video and
reuploaded it Sean wrote all this week
I've been seeing a couple of odd
spelling mistakes Tom Merritt misspelled
storage as story edge and on cnet live
you guys spelled problem as problem I
thought you guys were expert journalists
these are silly unnecessary mistakes
that should never have been made love
the show smiley merit journalist and on
the ceri are you just joking Sean you're
just joking right okay but either way we
fix those videos and we re uploaded
those too on a related note Erin asks I
know cnet is currently owned by CBS one
of the biggest broadcasting networks in
America so is there any chance that one
day we could see seen at TV actually on
TV I for one would love to see this yeah
Erin we're probably not going to be on
the big screen because I don't think
real TV lets you fix your videos and
re-upload them no I'm totally kidding I
don't know for sure but honestly the way
we've been integrating with CBS I
wouldn't be surprised watch for natali
del conte on the CBS early show actually
she's on there all the time me I'm just
hoping to be the next host of The
Amazing Race all right Michael had a
Content request for us hey Molly can you
get somebody to do an insider secret on
using tomato or dd-wrt to make a super
router Michael I have no idea what you
just said to me so I'm guessing it's
right up Tom Merritt Sally I'll talk to
him about it and finally let's end this
week's episode with some lover male nick
says has natali del conte ever repeated
the same dress unloaded or does she have
some sort of mystical closet with an
endless supply of outfits and by the way
she's uber pretty yeah that's right I
said it that's nice Nick and yeah
Natalie if you could email me the
password to the mystical and the supply
closet that would be great actually I
think it's called New York and that's it
for this week everyone keep that
feedback coming tell your friends to
watch mailbag at cnet com or send me a
postcard to 35 second street san
francisco california 94 105 see you next
week</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
