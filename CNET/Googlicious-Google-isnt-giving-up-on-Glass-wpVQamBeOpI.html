weekly serving of google issues for
everything google you guys can think of
let's get to the show and the latest
from eric schmidt is that google isn't
giving up on glass they're just going
back to the labs now in a recent
interview with The Wall Street Journal
Schmidt emphasized that glass is still a
fundamental platform for google even
after they shut down their explorer
program and brought the project back
in-house to be overseen by the head of
Google's nest connected home division
Tony Fadell now he compared a glass to
Google's self-driving cars as a
long-term project the head of google x
projects Astro teller told an audience
at South by Southwest than when the
failures of glass with that Google
encourage too much attention for the
program but they weren't even close to a
finished project really let's keep it
real Google if glass caught on and
actually gained some real traction if
consumers were demanding it and
developers really supported it with
compelling experiences you wouldn't be
saying anything like this we know you
did everything in your power to promote
glass as the next great platform except
it wasn't it definitely has some killer
uses but privacy issues and the huge
social stigmas associated with it really
couldn't be overcome so now it's back to
the drawing board and that's what really
happened also a quick update on Google
self-driving car project during a
Vancouver TED conference the head of the
division said the team is working to
launch the project in the market by 2020
Google is also working with GM Ford
Volkswagen and Daimler on the
self-driving tech and that target year
is coincidentally the same as Apple's
for their own car project all right
android police reports google is rolling
out a new smart lock feature called on
body detection where it uses the phone's
accelerometer to figure out if your
device is in your hand or your pocket
and locks it when it's not so if you
left it at a table or forgot it
somewhere your phone will auto lock it
appears to be a slow rollout on devices
running the most recent Play services
and it's showing up on non-nexus
hardware running five point 0 or higher
as
and since we're talking phone hardware a
new report from Korea's eated a says
Google is looking for LG to manufacture
the next Nexus phone google engineers
are said to have met with LG execs
earlier this month and we know Motorola
handle the Nexus 6 LG helped with the
four and five and HTC built the original
nexus one so this is common for Google
to bounce between manufacturers we also
know smartwatches are getting a big push
with the latest iterations of Android
wear products and apples watch coming
soon so Google has pushed out this wear
what you want video to showcase all the
different Android wear watches that are
out there it's colorful and fun but
Android wear is making big moves with
the recent announcement that they'll
partner with tag heuer and intel to
create a SmartWatch version of one of
tags most popular models the carrera now
they didn't give too many specifics but
the watch will be a digital replica of
the original tag heuer black carrera tag
CEO jean-claude be there welcome the
launch of the Apple watch and said Apple
get young people used to wearing a watch
and later maybe they will want to buy
themselves a real watch and that's what
we call a dig alright google invested
542 million dollars in virtual reality
startup magic leap last year and the
group is reportedly hard at work on an
augmented reality headset this video
could be a glimpse of what we can expect
ranging from doing things like checking
your gmail to play in a first-person
shooter game in the office and yes it's
purely conceptual right now but even
with something like microsoft's hololens
this type of stuff is becoming more real
and once these platforms exist its
developers that are going to make them
shine alright that's going to do it for
this week's show you can always email us
at google issues at cnet com or tweet me
at brian Tong thanks watch it will see
you guys next time for some more of that
Google Isha's
