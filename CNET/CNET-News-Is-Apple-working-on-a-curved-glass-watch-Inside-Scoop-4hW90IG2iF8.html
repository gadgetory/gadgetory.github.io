Sumi das and joining me is Josh
Lowensohn senior writer for seen it
thanks for being with us a pleasure it's
been a while since we've chatted what
brought us together again apple rumors
and a weird one at that it's not a
television okay it's a watch it's a
watch okay so where did these watch
rumor step from they really come from
China they come from Foxconn were we're
all good rumors come all the
contributors come from but they really
stemmed from two reports one from the
New York Times and one from The Wall
Street Journal that kind of all come
around this idea that apple's making a
watch okay so what are the sources
pretty much people in the supply chain
which is kind of confusing the idea is
that they're toying around with this
idea in cupertino and it have been doing
that for years in fact that they've been
hiring engineers and working on
prototypes for this glass like device
it's going to glass yeah so so glass it
would wrap around your wrist okay all to
us I don't know about all glasses it's a
possibility but they have to put the
battery in there they have to rubberize
it you don't have all this thing and get
cuts yeah it can't be all glass so does
this make sense for Apple let's let's
just take a step back is this a logical
next step for Apple as a business I mean
I do know that pebble that project that
made ten million dollars on Kickstarter
obviously made us all think about
watches as a space and they're a bunch
of other efforts as well so is that why
Apple's getting into whether I think
it's really interesting because if you
think about watches in a lot of ways a
smartphone and phones in general kind of
oblivia the need for it you just don't
need it you always know what time it is
but then you have devices like Nike
FuelBand obviously the after mentioned
pebble the jawbone up all sorts of new
technologies that are coming out to do
things more than just tell time so if
you look at something like a watch
that's maybe running iOS any of the
possibility of apps you have the
possibility of all these sensors and
sending data back and forth there's a
lot of applications for that but also a
new thing to sell yeah exactly it is
Apple looking for a new thing too so I
mean what are your thoughts what do you
think they are and then everybody's been
talking about a television is the next
big thing to the problem of the TV or
even a set-top box is that you buy and
you might not
place it every once in a while true
something that's on you all the time
something where they can have a lot of
variations that's just like the iphone
that's just like the iPad it's something
that you might want to buy and it's
gonna get more wear and tear you might
replace it where else exactly alright
well we'll keep an eye on the watch face
yeah we'll watch the watch space as it
were and you'll keep us honest on the
rumors definitely Josh thanks so much my
pleasure for inside scoop I'm see me
dance thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
