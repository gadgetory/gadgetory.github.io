look at the 15-inch MacBook Pro 2012
edition no it is not the super fancy
Retina Display MacBook Pro this is just
a plain old one they still make that and
they still updated it with some new
components the big changes inside are an
Intel Core I Siri CPU from the latest
Ivy Bridge generation in this case it's
a quad core Core i7 but a more major
change has been taking the graphics
going from AMD which these things have
had for a few generations now to
invidious and they get Nvidia graphics
card with this and then the third major
swap is the USB ports are gone now
replaced with the USB 3.0 which will be
great if you have some USB 3.0 gear like
an external hard drive you want to hook
up to it and of course you still have
that Thunderbolt / DisplayPort
connection on the side that you can use
either go out to a monitor or to hook up
a Thunderbolt peripheral there probably
more USB 3.0 peripherals out there that
Thunderbolt ones so you might find those
ports more useful on the outside this
looks and feels exactly like the last
couple of generations of MacBook Pro
it's still a solidly build pretty
attractive fairly thin for a 15-inch
kind of laptop but the competition is
really starting to catch up now
especially there now that we're seeing
14 and 15 inch ultrabooks the Retina
Display MacBook Pro takes a big step
forward this is regular ngon retina
version even though it's still very
expensive starts at $17.99 and it's
starting to feel a little bit dated now
because we've basically had the same
design for a long time in fact if you
take a look at it it's pretty thin for a
15-inch laptop and I'm going to show you
the retina version right here same thing
15 inch laptop higher resolution display
a lot thinner and actually a good deal
lighter as well you've still got all the
things that I like about Mac books the
excellent keyboard back with keeping of
course the gigantic glass multi-touch
trackpad that has all those cool
gestures that other laptops try to mimic
but they don't really do as good a job
mimei knock against the pro these days
is that the screen is a 1440 by 900
screen you can actually get a 1600 by
50 upgrade but you have to pay more for
that for $1,700 I'd like a higher
resolution on the default screen other
than that this is still one of the most
universally useful midsize laptops you
can buy but I have to admit if you're
gonna shell out $17.99 for this you may
want to save up a little bit more and
get that cooler retina version as long
as you can live without the optical
drive and the Ethernet jack otherwise
you may end up feeling just a little bit
of system at me I didn't act remember
that is the 15-inch MacBook Pro</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
