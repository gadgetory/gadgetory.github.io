empty and dumb but after a lot of work
we've transformed it into the CNET smart
home let me show you some of the coolest
stuff we've done we made voice control
the center of the home because it's so
simple and intuitive with Amazon's echo
we can control almost every smart device
in the house including the lights Alexa
turn on the whole house
here in a family room we've smarten up
the entertainment center by hooking
Alexa up to a device called blue moon
you don't have to worry about finding
the remote when you can turn your TV off
with your voice we also installed a
smart ceiling fan with motion sensing
technology no wasting energy when you're
not in the room and these motion sensors
talk to our downstairs thermostat the
Eco b3 in addition to talking with Alexa
this thermostat can sense when we're not
home also saving on electricity costs
here in the kitchen we've gone with two
connected large appliances over here is
the samsung family help refrigerator and
here's the samsung Wi-Fi range the oven
connects to our smart phone and that can
send us a notification in case we've
left a burner on for the fridge it has
cameras inside that can show us the
contents when we're at the grocery store
and can even track the expiration dates
of food we've been skeptical about smart
laundry products but the Whirlpool
washer and dryer set here actually has
some useful features they can send a
notice to your phone when your load is
done and you can also remotely start and
pause loads mid-cycle we also turn this
old bedroom into a room for kids
complete with color changing lights in
this handy remote control we have a
camera with night vision so you can keep
an eye on your kids when they're
sleeping as well as this bed to let you
track their sleeping patterns we added
that same sleep tracking to the bed in
the master bedroom and here it works on
both sides of the bed we also have our
second floor thermostat in the master
and here we went with nest it controls
the general heating and cooling up here
but in the bedroom it works together
with our other haiku ceiling fan and a
smart vent to regulate the temp in this
room more precisely we even added smarts
to the garage door this device lets us
open and close the garage doors from a
nap
but also with the lexan voice commands
but not everything works as well as we
want it to this countertop from DuPont
actually has wireless phone charging
built into it but as you can see it's
not quite as responsive as we'd like it
to be so what do we learn from all this
well a few things we learned that voice
control really is great but you do have
to learn the lingo to make sure you get
things working the way you want them to
we've also learned that setting up a
whole house with smart home tech can get
really expensive even the lights and
smart switches we've installed here ran
up to multiple thousands of dollars
finally we found that the best products
in the smart home are the ones that
don't rely too heavily on a smart home
platform things like the Amazon echo
nest cam and a Big Ass Fans Haiku
ceiling fan stand out by themselves even
if the networks they talk to become
obsolete the devices themselves
still be useful thanks for watching this
has been super interesting for us and if

strong home technology please come check
