with this latest range now I take some
traits from some old models that Samsung
has debuted like the Flex duo with an
insert that turns this range into a
double oven but it adds two new features
that I really like Wi-Fi capability and
a black stainless steel finish that
looks really really cool now let's go
back a little bit and talk about this
Wi-Fi now with the oven's connectivity
you can control temperature and cooking
times from your fault now the app isn't
perfect there were some problems with
the oven not reading on the app and the
app thinking that the oven was unplugged
when it clearly wasn't but it is very
responsive it checks the burners being
on or off really well and it was just
kind of fun to use but definitely not a
must-have for an oven now the same sense
other features were pretty cool too I
love the black stainless steel finish
it's something new and different that
elevates this appliance from dozens of
stainless steel ovens that I've seen
before but it's cooking performance was
just so-so which was a little
disappointing considering all the
special features that the Samsung has so
this range is three thousand $99 which
is pretty high for an oven in this
category but with its Flex duo features
and it's Wi-Fi connectivity it might be
a worthwhile investment for you if
you're really interested in the
connected kitchen and you're a fan of
Samsung products however if it was me
and my $3,000 I might wait a year or two
to see how this oven progresses and
newer models like I said the Wi-Fi is
nice but not perfect</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
