today we're going to take a look at hp's
Omni 27 so this is the largest
windows-based all-in-one and we say that
because it has a 27 inch screen pretty
much every other large windows on one
before this has a 23 or 24 inch display
so HP is currently the king of the block
in terms of screen size now apples iMac
of course also has a 27 inch model that
actually has a higher resolution in this
HP but for most consumers the 1080p
resolution on this 27 inch HP should be
good for home entertainment particular
if you want to watch blu-ray movies so
our 1249 configuration here comes with a
core i5 cpu eight gigs of ram a one
terabyte hard drive embedded graphics
and a slot-loading blu-ray drive that's
a fairly average configuration for a
system of this price it's really the
screen that sells the system so it's
worth noting this is not a touchscreen
like a lot of only ones we see these
days that said HP is still included it's
magic canvas software which is a touch
oriented platform designed to give you
sort of a larger working space that
makes it easier to use if you're using
just your finger we're not really sure
why magic canvas makes sense here it
really just seems to clutter up the
display that said you can turn it off
completely ignore it so it doesn't
really do any harm HP also includes
beats audio on the Omni which as far as
we can tell it's just a software overlay
that exposes some of the audio features
already built into Windows 7 now that
said we had no problems with the blu-ray
audio when we played it got loud enough
at kept its integrity so we really don't
see the need for beats here but you
might want to play with it I guess now
the other very cool feature is that it
comes with an HDMI input which is
actually not unique but with this large
screen that makes it very useful if you
want to use the system as a home
entertainment hub with HDMI in you can
effectively use the system as a second
display and connect a cable box a game
console or any other HDMI based video
source we do wish hpn included some
other video ends and outs in the system
it makes it easier to say use the second
monitor or to use a perhaps legacy video
devices for other connectivity features
you get USB 3 USB 2 and a couple other
audio jacks that's really about it we
should also add that for about the same
price you can get a 23 inch on one from
another vendor that has much faster core
specs so while the system can handle
day-to-day browsing around and most
mainstream tasks it's
Betty graphics chip makes it hard to
game on this system which is kind of
disappointing even it's a nice big
display so because this is the first 27
inch windows all-in-one HP can get away
the charging a little bit more for it if
you want to windows all in one with a
nice big screen like this right now HP's
is the only game in town that said we
know later this year lenovo Samsung and
other vendors will also have 27 inch
Shaolin ones and those will actually
have touchscreens so it might be worth
waiting if you're in the market for a
new large screen online so our merch
brown this is the HP Omni 27</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
