dudes know it's Thursday my dude not one
more before the end of the year yeah so
everybody knows what we have to talk
about today so just go ahead and shuffle
that way yeah this is gonna be a big
show I mean we've been talking about net
neutrality pretty much like all year
long you know just taking a look at the
protests the different issues that have
been going along with it I was in cons
yes pros so you know today's the day
they're going to vote on it at 10:30
a.m. Eastern Time or at least that's one
of the FCC's a monthly meeting will
start and we'll be following along as it
goes on but we did want to get through a
lot of talking points on our show today
and we'll also be talking about a
Disney's big acquisition they now own
Fox which included oh no no there's they
agreed to purchase them okay hasn't
happened yet oh it hasn't gone through
yet okay thanks for clarifying Ben
semantics so yeah do you want to jump
into it or yeah let's go ahead and dive
right in the votes gonna take place any
minute now so uh let's have a podcast
and after four minutes where the
headlines will join all of you back in
the chat for an unseasonable early
morning for us and we'll take some
questions and comments about net
neutrality and other things and that
will be it for 2017 in the 359 podcast
so thanks everybody for joining in we'll
see you back in the chat in 3 minutes
and 59 seconds from 3 to welcome to the
359 I'm Alfred Eng I'm Ben Fox ribbon
after months of protests online and in
person on every web site from Google
Reddit and Twitter to steps on Capitol
Hill and outside politicians offices the
big day has finally arrived the FCC is
voting today on net neutrality
regulations that essentially guarantee
the Internet service providers need to
treat all traffic on the internet
equally meaning Verizon Comcast spectrum
whatever would have to give Google the
same treatment as
no Ben Fox Rubin shop comm order any
small website John Ben Fox Rubin shop
comm the regulations are meant to keep
the internet open and fair but the FCC's
Ajit paw has come out and argued that
net neutrality stifles innovation and
investments and saying that getting rid
of these regulations would actually lead
to a better internet experience Ben this
is a monumental decision in internet
history I mean when we look back on this
from the 359 episode two million I mean
what do you what do you think the
Internet is going to look like I mean I
don't really it's it's a very good
question and good job really explaining
a lot of what net neutrality is is a
pretty complicated issue it's it's hard
to say really what this is going to do
and that's why I'm certainly curious to
see whether the vote actually does go
through today because it has been
scheduled but there's been a lot of
pushback to delay the vote and it's
unclear how exactly this is all going to
shake out and whether it's going to
impact consumers in any significant way
whether a new administration with a new
FCC chairman or chairwoman would end up
just bringing back net neutrality so
there are a lot of questions as far as
what's actually gonna happen here you
know the New York Attorney General's
Office actually warned yesterday that
two million of the comments on the FCC's
website you know commenting on this vote
had come from stolen identities or were
fake some of them had come from people
that were like had just died a month
before they made the comment and you
know the FCC rejected requests from the
New York Attorney General's Office as
well as 28 senators I'm assuming
including one today from Senator Susan
Collins yeah I might be 29 with Susan
yes but to delay this vote until you
know this is properly investigated it
seems that every attempt you know
including the protests to stop or delay
this vote has kind of been unheard I
mean why do you think the FCC is so
determined to push ahead with this I
don't really see a situation where the
FCC which is basically controlled by
three Republicans at this point versus
two Democrats that sit on the FCC board
what delay would actually do in changing
the calculus and their decision to
repeal net neutrality they view this as
stifling regulation going
too far whether the vote happens today
or a month from now I I don't I don't
know that why would they actually like
make a different determination with that
so that's probably why they decided
against delaying it because it's just
gonna create more protests and add more
pressure on to them and yeah it's not
it's not going to change their ultimate
decision and you know we talked about
how there's there's going to be changes
on this but a GPI has said in another
interview talking about how it's not
gonna be like y2k where everyone gets
out and it's like an apocalypse on the
internet all of a sudden but there are
there are definitely going to be certain
gradual changes I mean when do you think
the general public is going to feel its
effects and you know kind of realize you
know do you think it's gonna take for it
to hit their wallets or anything like
that yeah I I think the general public
overall is is somewhat vaguely aware
that net neutrality exists and what's
been going on there but until it
actually impacts people's wallets I
don't think that they're really gonna be
that involved or at least most people
yeah also in lighter news but also
important Disney signed a deal to
acquire Fox in a major deal that
basically means that the x-men and The
Simpsons are now Disney owned along will
be will be Disney owned along with a lot
of other Fox products I think that means
that Marge Simpson is a Disney princess
now oh my god that is that's fantastic
also game on Netflix I mean like that
seems to be a big reason for this yeah
we're following and covering the vote on
net neutrality as it goes on throughout
the day please be sure to check back
with cnn.com for the latest updates
that's all the time we had on our show
today if you liked what you heard check
us out on CNET I'm Alfred a I'm Ben Fox
Ruben thanks for listening so I was
actually one of those whose identity was
compromised in part of the the FCC
commentary that did take place I I
submitted my own comment manually in
favor of maintaining net neutrality
humanly human human as human as bonds
much of a human as I am thus far and I
there was somebody built an algorithm or
and a tool or an app or something like
that that was connected through the FCC
site I honestly don't remember what the
URL to it was right now if I could find
it I'll put it in the show notes
although it's kind of too late now
because this has already been
well-documented uncovered and you ran
this and what it did was it skimmed all
of the comments the millions of millions
of comments and it found my name three
or four times submitted so every
submitted your name three or four times
it did and although what was strange to
me is that no point did it change the
tone at one of them essentially copy
pasted my original comments several the
other two were in the same favor of
maintaining net neutrality but they were
different like not not my words at all
so that was my experience I mean I
wonder though what if there's just a lot
of Brian in fact elders in New York out
there that build with why they're not oh
I talked about this before you mentioned
that the bots armies that have attacked
the FCC website with these comments have
come from both sides right yeah and we
also don't know it so there's been a lot
of investigations on this where you know
the Department of Homeland Security has
actually asked the FCC basically because
when when their website that came down
or when all these comments came they
said oh this was a DDoS attack on us
what the thing was was they didn't
really provide any proof of it aspect
especially when investigators had asked
can you provide us with the data that
you were receiving so we can look into
this more like it was weird that they
didn't want to provide that data it's
after claiming that they had been
attacked do you think that Schneiderman
and those senators have a reasonable
argument to call for a delay because so
many of those comments yeah I think
we're you know I think if you're going
to rely on a public comment system and
say hey let us know what you guys think
but then you know not actually get a
look at it or not actually you know have
a sheep even yea not appreciate the
legitimacy of it I think that's kind of
making a mockery of the system that
you're saying oh everyone has it has the
ability to give us their opinions on it
just yeah I I hear you on that it's
basically asking people to put in you
know submit their comments into a
comments box that's that one yeah for
actually yes right it's absurd
it's kind of making a mockery of the
system that they they say you know we
heard all your voices except no we
didn't the thing is is that I think we
all understand that they they brought up
the point the new FCC board brought up
the point that look we're gonna we're
gonna take up a repealing net neutrality
which means that they are probably going
to do it and it would have really
surprised me if they said you know
cheese Brian made some really good
points in his letter and we're not gonna
do this anymore yes it's a lot of it
really just has to do with like they're
the folks that are in power right now
and that's what they want to do mm-hmm
all right it's time to take a look at
the chat I'm excited to say that we have
fantastic reputation representation on
both sides of the net neutrality repeal
as always our audience is fantastically
awesome we'll get to some of those
specifics later right now I want to
address a question or more of a comment
from pella who says I think 5g is gonna
make customers have a wide variety of
internet providers and this seems
relevant across the board in relation to
what's going on there's going to be big
competition then which is essentially
what this vote is all about I mean I
think I think that's that would be nice
but I think you also have to consider
who's going to be controlling and in
charge of the 5g it's which would be
Verizon AT&amp;amp;T t-mobile etc and from a
very personal note yeah non-affiliated
opinion opinion I've had bad experiences
with service providers and that's what
makes me nervous as a card-carrying mean
lord but but when you say so as
providers you mean broadband providers
like somebody like Comcast or spectrum
yeah okay yeah totally so that's what
makes me nervous is because I because I
don't rush the man they've been vilified
for years there is a lot of opportunity
for folks like Verizon derive it Verizon
and t-mobile I don't I don't dispute
that at all but folks like Verizon and
t-mobile at least at the moment have
pretty good consumer reputations maybe
people would would argue that Verizon
charges a lot more money and I'm a
Verizon customer so I don't personally
like that as much but there is an
opportunity going into Pelley's comment
to for those companies to actually try
to steal customers from the incumbents
because
there a lot of people really do not like
their cable providers sure and let's
just I mean let's put this all out in
front Street as far as this entire
conversation goes this isn't about who's
right or wrong now it's about opening a
Pandora's box that will be borderline
impossible to shut again at least
without significant efforts up yea
upward battle about where this goes from
here this isn't like automatically
everybody's internet now cost double and
you can't go to porn sites this is now
somebody else has the keys to that car
let's see what they do with it yeah my
biggest oh god I think you know it's
going to get to a point because this
continues - you know ping pong back and
forth between yeah we are like you know
we are for net neutrality and then you
know a new administration comes as I
open know if we're gonna repeal it I
don't think I think it's going to get to
a point where senators and Congress
members are going to have to get
involved with this basically saying
we're going to sign a bill you know
basically designating this as opposed to
you know it changing every time yeah
yeah yeah which is which is
understandable why a lot of people
really deem that as being very
undemocratic because AGID pie and the
other FCC folks on the board were not
voted in yeah they're they're brought in
vibe and that's why they're able to take
measures like these without kind of you
know fearing you know oh we're gonna be
up for election or something like that
it's kind of they're not acting in the
public's interest on this that's
debatable
I mean I wouldn't I wouldn't go that far
but going back I wanted to make one
other mention from Pelley's point which
is one of the biggest concerns relating
to repealing net neutrality has a lot to
do with with the fact that a lot of
regional players are essentially
monopolies if 5g and it's not coming
quite yet yes 5g does open up those
monopolies and actually create some real
competition then the potential of you
having to pay an extra $10 to your
broadband provider or for Netflix would
would be reduced yeah thanks to market
forces so here's hoping that does
actually happen but it's still again a
lot of this stuff is really in question
it's hard to me whether it's actually
gonna happen one way or talking about 5g
and kind of mobile data providers so you
can kind of already see like a version
of
you know an internet without net
neutrality is like I mean considering
that you know you unlike if you have
t-mobile you can get like netflix for
free or like like it doesn't affect your
data plan at least like you still pay
for a Netflix account but the data like
it's not affected by that I mean I'm
sure that you know Netflix or t-mobile
have some kind of deal for that and
that's not exactly like net neutrality
and in that aspect yeah but it's it's I
appreciate what you said as far as that
is that giving Netflix an extra boost
yeah an extra benefit from from a
certain perspective I think it's like if
I were if I were using t-mobile right
and I had both a Netflix and a Hulu
account but I know that Netflix doesn't
bite into my data plan like why would I
ever watch anything on on Hulu and that
kind of like tanks business for them
what because hulu has Futurama
on it which is a good show so it is
10:37 a.m. Eastern Standard Time the FCC
has convened yeah do we have any
real-time updates watching a live stream
right now right they're currently
talking about the 911 call system so
it's not yet well I don't have it in
front of me because I've got everything
else in front of me so yeah ice actually
sent you the live stream on slack oh
yeah well I'm not gonna go to that read
yeah anyways let's take some more
questions and comments serene joy when
FCC gets barraged with the inevitable
lawsuit posts with this vote how slow
were those lawsuits be moving to take
any significant effect that's super hard
to tell because I like what he's saying
totally I think the problem is is that
whether a judge would actually grant an
injunction or not yeah if an injunction
is allowed then the net neutrality
repeal would be barred or held until the
actual lawsuit I I also yeah I also
think the lawsuits would probably be
thrown out in the same way that you
can't sue your senators for voting on
something that affected you negatively
mmm I don't really think that this is
something that it's a tactic yeah I mean
that's I think though I don't think I
don't think any court would like take
that case at the same time I do think
that it seems inevitable that the loss
it's will be filed there are a lot of
folks that have argued very strongly
against this and to at least try to take
it to the you know judicial system and
see what they can get out of that I
wouldn't be surprised if it went in that
direction taking some more from the Chad
to keep the conversation going
Christopher Burke what effect will the
lack of net neutrality have on non-us
ISPs now we've had this conversation
several times on the show before it's a
great question keeps getting brought up
and people like obsessive Burnett think
oh this isn't going to affect me in the
UK well you know my answer to this you
you go for it I'm not gonna respond this
is your show I don't know your answer
for this I don't think I was on the show
when you gave it I've said this I've
said this before but and I'll say it
again it is a very good question is that
a lot of regulatory regulatory
internationally look to the United
States because the United States is
often viewed as a gold standard for a
lot of regulatory regimes so it's
possible that also for hamburgers right
absolutely so it's possible that the
u.s. is position and you know
influencing other decisions but every
you know sovereign state is different so
is the UK going to get affected in the
short term probably not I don't I don't
think that the same conversations are
going on in the UK right now not
necessarily the ISPs but a lot of the
media actually consume the information
the data consumed on the internet might
in fact be affected if it originates
within US borders the other way of
looking at this too is that if there's a
significant backlash and the internet is
seen as being significantly eroded by
the repeal of net neutrality then
obviously other sovereign states are
going to look at this experiment that
the United States decided to do with
bringing net neutrality and then we're
appealing it a couple years later and
decide on I don't know some other tactic
because nobody wants to see the internet
significantly diminish mm-hmm
Riki Brito is the net neutral Newton the
Type O net nutritional bill I think
we're on to a different topic perhaps no
I think it was a nutrition I think that
was a
but I could not help but acknowledge it
because that was great and made my day
it's the net neutrality bill going to
apply to wireless networks as well I
don't think so I think that's a
different network entirely but I wish
Roger was here because he knows the
answer to that well somebody had to take
a vacation nice and early this year
good man oh they're sorry Roger I love
you Josh boy do you think this will give
Google Fiber a second chance
ooh silver lining yeah I was I was don't
laugh at me no no I'm trying to be
optimistic for the first time on this
show it's very optimistic to think that
Google Fiber is gonna get a shot in the
arm from this yeah I would argue I would
say that Google Fiber kind of died out
though because of you know local
legislation they had tried going on I
believe it was Nashville where they had
tried setting up but then all the ISPs
there were basically saying no you can't
come in here and you know there were a
lot of like arguments you know at there
like on the state government level just
about whether or not Google is like
trying to intrude on like these
territories I guess set up by by Comcast
and all that and then they were kind of
eventually driven out of town so I mean
the argument about you know oh there's
not that much tech innovation because of
all these regulations and yet Google is
trying to come in and they weren't even
driven out because of you know net
neutrality regulations they were kind of
driven out because of ISPs that didn't
want the competition so I think that if
there is a potential white knight in
this situation it would probably be 5g
what Harvey Dent or Harvey done
absolutely but with Verizon t-mobile
Sprint jumping in to the fray that seems
more likely because Google Fiber didn't
really work out Verizon FiOS isn't
expanding anymore and that's because
it's really expensive and time-consuming
and sometimes very difficult on the
local level to expand fiber systems the
fiber optic systems so it's much easier
to do it wirelessly with 5g and that's
why I would expect 5g to if there's
gonna be new competition in the market
it's gonna come from there
well said let's take one more question
from net neutrality
position before we move on we are
getting low on time but we're gonna try
to hang out and see if there's anything
developing Alfred nothing yet still on
the NYPD currently and the 911 emergency
system understandable
fair enough topic to occupy some time
we'll have continuing coverage as the
day continues sir enjoy can this be an
opportunity for Silicon Valley
entrepreneurs who are Pro net neutrality
launched new ISPs that brag of equal
internet surely they will do they will
get good hedge funds yeah I think the
Google Fiber to a certain extent was
exactly that you know that was that was
a major Silicon Valley company that was
investing significantly in a new concept
and it didn't really pan out yeah that's
the craziest thing to me that you know
we we we've always looked at Google as
kind of this like major like corporation
but the fact that they can't beat red
tape and I guess be lobbyists is nothing
beats the government yeah that's it's
insane and you know I don't even think
getting rid of you know I mean if we're
going with the FCC's argument here or a
gpi's argument about you know there
hasn't been that much innovation because
of all this like red tape and
regulations but the thing is like the
things that he's like changing doesn't
like help Google Fiber or any new ISPs
come out there so it's you know the the
innovation that he's talking about like
is not like boosted by repealing net
neutrality so it's absurd you tell me
how you really feel it's absurd it's all
right lost legacy he's got a good
question here do you think that Apple
will buy netflix to compete with Disney
buying Fox that would be like such like
why brain explode ow my brain would
explode if Apple bought Netflix and I
feel like that's like one of the many
like acquisition parlor games that a lot
of folks play would be like forever
correct me if I'm wrong but somebody
tried to buy Netflix a minute ago didn't
they and didn't not blockbuster a few
years ago was it no it's not definitely
not blockbuster there's something
tickling in the back of my brain that's
making me recall but somebody made like
I don't know if it was a formal offer or
it was like we're considering it kind of
thing and Netflix just kind of laughed
at it I don't my way off on that one
today I don't know yeah no it's it's
entirely possible but it doesn't it
doesn't strike any memories okay never
mind I'm million brain out of my element
here anyways I thought that was kind of
funny like imagine the the war of the
major networks buying these young
whippersnappers and Netflix is like so
expensive though what is it what's its
market cap I don't really know it might
be somewhere to the tune of 70 billion
obviously Apple could afford it the
question is I don't think they'd be able
to yeah more cheaply and would Netflix
want to be yeah just as a more important
part there is a common saying that it
was blockbuster it depends on how long
ago were looking at so so Netflix did
offer this was like when Netflix was
still like the DVD model only where
they'd send it and I think they like
offered to sell de to Blockbuster for
like a very low price like something
like a million or two million dollars
and blockbuster is this energy warning
people people like to leave their home
so yeah that's that's what happened with
blockbuster if there was something
recent though I wouldn't I wouldn't know
about that okay yeah this wasn't
anything recent if something I think I
remember hearing about in the earlier
days of Netflix when before they
dominated everything but anyways let's
talk I can't pronounce the screen name
at all but they asked if Family Guy was
part of the deal so Family Guy would be
part of the deal as far as an IP goes
but being the Family Guy exists on the
television network Fox maintains
ownership and control of our TV
broadcasting so that's going to be one
of those weird gray areas just kind of
like The Simpsons to really think about
it but I think that opens up a lot of
doors for creative crossover as far as
characters encountering each other in
movies and I don't know word in the
comic book realm right yeah but I mean
what are some of the IPS that are that
we really think about this we said
Simpsons we got x-men but I heard that
there were some kind of shake up with
x-men and Fantastic Four and it might
not be as simple as like okay now they
exist
in Marvel verse or in the Feige verse
right now what else
because Fox is maintaining news and
sports but everything in the
entertainment division is essentially up
in the air at this point
Disney is purchasing Fox Studios which
does include The Simpsons there they're
also getting like the movie studio
that's why x-men fans had or yeah
Fantastic Four and Deadpool are they
gonna rejoin the Marvel Universe those
are those are some of the bigger
headless they might be there in the
reboot I don't think they'll be there
for like infinity Wars no I'm sorry
going on no but like cuz it's supposed
to be like a two-part thing but like the
whole thing like 15 bars but the thing
is like if they're talking about like so
the whole MCU is essentially about like
world building and stuff right where
it's like oh this happened and then
Doctor Strange happened to be there but
he was like in the background or
something like that and I don't think
you can't just bring the x-men in
because like it would have just been you
know where the hell were you this whole
time when you know New York was getting
attacked and like you but I believe
Xavier Academy or whatever is like
supposed to be in upstate New York so
it's just you know if the mechs
Manchester never they were busy to just
make up an excuse there's like okay cool
like all this stuff was happening and
the x-men were just like we got class
yeah they were there stuck in traffic at
this point if the end result is they all
get to show you the screen will buy
whatever excuse yeah the only the only
crossover that I could see happening is
like Deadpool kind of just like breaking
the fourth wall and absolutely yeah
and just like popping oh hey guys what's
up and then just like leaving like that
way people are concerned however if
Deadpool is going to get neutered and
going to a Disney on yeah that's
interesting
not interesting and kind of like pretty
much a guarantee if he is though I mean
did she has me Disney has made oh you
did not go there
Disney has made r-rated films in the
past usually through their subsidiaries
Miramax and so on but it's not unheard
of but Deadpool belongs in the r-rated
realm that's all that people are worried
about yeah any news and updates on FCC
while the testimonies from the NYPD the
the family of a slain NYPD officer have
stopped talking now the FCC is back just
commenting about a blue alert switch
which is actually pretty important but
it is not you know landmark internet
stuff this is this is really important
though yeah but like this is also
reminiscent of like I used to be a local
news reporter and this is what agendas
look like even though everybody's like
all eyes are directed at the FCC at this
point they're gonna go through their
agenda and usually it's like the very
last item on the agenda that's the
important thing
I mean it's really it's physician really
sell ads in between these like they
should put like ad breaks in these
hearings they could make a lot of money
for like Verizon or just I don't know
yeah but like they already take our
money like they just take a surtax a
just saying if they're making us wait
for this big climactic conclusion you
know this is this is TV 101 they should
know this it's true they should have a
lot of commercial breaks yep brought to
you by Charmin so we're still gonna be
waiting yeah how long do you think we're
gonna be sitting i I can check what's on
their agenda to see how many items they
have to go through this would be really
funny if we just kept the podcast going
until the vote happened but we might be
stuck here for a while so yeah I thought
we were kind of anticipating the night
let's wait let's say let's see it's what
I were you a new emergency alert system
for blue alerts then rural health care
support mechanism followed by Twilight
towers public notice then restoring
Internet freedom I believe that is the
right then CMRS presumption report and
order peace electronic delivery of cable
communications and then national
television multiple ownership rule which
is also an important vote yeah it's so
it's right smack in the middle and we're
I think we're at it we're only at the
first item buried eye socket number two
number one
yeah we're yeah docket number 15 - 94
okay people
net neutrality is number three in the
no agenda for you said for I think I
think it's four out of this is which is
better than I do a marathon it's number
four out of seven items guys we don't
have anything you're stretching right
yeah no we're stretching at this point
no it's I wish we could sit around for
this entire thing and wait and catch it
in real-time but I don't think it's
gonna be in the cars put the live stream
on on our channel yeah cuz that's legal
it's the FCC exactly anyway alright I
think that we've been we've we've
dragged this on long enough yeah sorry
everybody we wish we could sit around
but unfortunately I have to move on to
another project at 11:00 and we've had
problems with it go go we hit up a G on
Twitter and tell him he's too slow and
we will have a lot of coverage on this
yesterday on CNN sock constantly check
it out seen that's definitely not
ignoring this we just have to end the
podcast because we have to end the
podcast yeah and on that no it is the
final live podcast of 2017 so I would
like to take this opportunity to say
thank you very much mr. Brian BVG my
pleasure were your very capable and I
dare I even say cram Yulin efforts as
the producer and we wouldn't be here

important days but I will forgive you a
million times over yeah I don't know how
