Groupon copies Yelp I'm Bridget Carey
this is your cnet update if you want to
really know a gadget you have to get
your hands dirty and break it open or
just watch other people break it on
YouTube the device repair website I fix
it disassemble to Apple's new iPads and
revealed a few interesting secrets the
new iPad air 2 has a smaller battery
than the previous version it's fifteen
percent smaller but Apple advertises
that it has the same battery life as
before how will the improve software and
processor don't use as much juice in our
tests we found that it did perform as
promised living up to the 10 hour
battery life iFixit also found an NFC
chip inside but that doesn't mean you
can bring it to cash registers to use
Apple pay the chip is locked off from
being used in stores the purpose is to
keep your online shopping secure for
when you use your thumbprint to pay for
things inside apps the iPad minis
biggest surprise was the glue the inside
components are the same as last year's
model but now there's a fingerprint
scanner on the home button and that
button is held on with hot glue you see
there's lots of adhesive holding your
iPad together making it hard to repair
considering all that's new with the mini
is the fingerprint scanner you may want
to save money and buy last year's model
groupon is trying to grow in a new way
by becoming more like Yelp a business
can have its own page on groupon to show
off its operating hours phone number
website and promote discounts Groupon
users can also write comments on a
business page which is not different to
what you can do on Yelp and down the
road you can book a reservation from a
groupon business page Yelp itself is
also adding new features now you can
book a hotel room right from a Yelp page
Yelp struck a deal with the travel
search site hip monk read a review on
hotel then just book it on the same page
Yelp started down this path with some
beauty businesses letting you booked a
spa appointment or a haircut through
yelp in the world of music google has
added songs of features to its Google
Music app songs as an app that Google
bought this year which features pre-made
play
based on different things like the time
of day your activities your mood it has
all sorts of themes and Microsoft is
pulling the plug on its free version of
xbox music the option to stream music
for free with advertisements will end
after December first and then the only
option left is to pay ten dollars a
month but if you're more of a
PlayStation person I'll take note of the
system update that's coming to the ps4
on Tuesday the update comes with share
play and let your friend play a game
wiki remotely even if they don't own the
game that's your tech news update and
you can get more details at cnet com
from our studios in New York I'm Bridget
