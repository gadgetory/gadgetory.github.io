cnet.com I got my wii u today and right
now i'm going to do a little bit of an
unboxing video for you guys show you
what you can expect on November 18th
when this launches in North America
alright so let's open this up here it is
here's the full shot of the box there
people really love unboxing videos good
thing I like unboxing stuff alright so
there's two levels of boxes here first
we have Nintendo Len which is only
included with the deluxe set for $350
the $300 one will not come with that
we've also got a pretty thick
instruction manual what seems to be two
types of stands here I guess we'll find
out what those do in a minute on HDMI
cable not bad thanks for including that
Nintendo this sort of seems to be some
sort of stand as well okay see what else
we got a sensor bar that kind of looks
like the old wee one we'll find out more
about that in the review another stand
this looks like it's the control tablet
controller charging stand wow there's a
lot there's a huge power brick is the
largest power brick I've ever seen for a
Nintendo console it's pretty massive and
then I guess this is the power supply
for the charging cradle as well let's
put that aside just for a minute and the
other box inside the Wii U is the
console it's very long a lot of people
haven't talked about how long this thing
is so here it is the Wii U console
itself again you're only going to get
the black version if you get the 32
gigabyte version the deluxe version
here's the
the inputs on the back looks like we got
an HDMI 2 USBS a Nintendo proprietary AV
out power source and the sensor bar so
looks like if you want to do HDMI you do
have that option out of the gate that's
why they included the cable up front
here is the Wii consoles front you got
the disc slot and then it looks like
there's also two USBs up front as well
as an SD card slot so that's pretty good
that's the most input connectivity a
Nintendo console has had to date and
then the one thing we're missing is of
course the tablet controller arguably
the most impressively cool and
interesting thing about the Wii U so
here it is in black looks pretty slick
let's just do some reconnaissance around
here looks like there's a headphone port
on the tablet that is neat
you got your triggers and shoulder
buttons there's a stylus as well and
then down here looks like charging
connectors and some sort of interface
port which of course I will test out
thoroughly and let you guys know what
the functionality is of that sort of
stuff so here it is everything you'll
get in the Wii U deluxe set the 32
gigabyte version that will go for three
hundred and fifty dollars when it goes
on sale Sunday November 18th in North
America that's the same day you can head
back to cnn.com for my full review of
the console until then I'm Jeff Bakalar
this has been an unboxing of the Wii U
console thank you for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
