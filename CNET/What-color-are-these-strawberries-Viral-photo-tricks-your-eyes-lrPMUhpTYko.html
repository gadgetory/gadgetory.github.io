your mind for the rest of the day what
color are the strawberries in this photo
if you said red you are wrong this
optical illusion is driving folks
bonkers on the internet because we are
all realizing that our eyes are lying to
us so let's break down what is happening
in this photo of strawberries on a pie
believe it or not there is not one
single red pixel in this photo it is all
hues of blue and gray but our brain does
something funny
we know strawberries are red we see that
there's a blue hue to the photo so our
brain is perceiving this image as being
under blue lighting and it corrects it
for making the strawberries appear red
but if you go through each pixel you'll
see there is no red in the photo at all
this color correcting effect is
something our brains do all the time
when we see objects under different
types of lighting if this trick feels
familiar it's because we've been here
before
exactly two years ago this week remember
the dress oh yeah that debate got people
raging online because some people's
brains were interpreting the colors as
white and gold and other people saw blue
and black because of the lighting in the
background of the image the strawberry
optical illusion was created by artists
Akiyoshi Kitaoka he's a professor of
psychology at Ritsumeikan University in
Japan and if you take a gander at his
library of illusions well be careful it
could break your brain not only is this
trick making me hungry but the fact that
I can't trust my own eyes anymore is
causing me to stress eat is this even
read how could I believe anything
anymore for scheanette I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
