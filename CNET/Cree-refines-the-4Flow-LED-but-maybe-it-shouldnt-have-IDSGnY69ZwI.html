the new version of the Cree for flow led
now this is a refined version of last
year's model it looks the exact same as
before really just a couple of small
hardware tune-ups inside the bulb it's a
little bit more efficient than the old
bulb using just 10 watts instead of 11
and it's also got a better color
rendering score up to 83 from 80 a
little more significant is that the bulb
will last a lot longer instead of the
25,000 hour life span that you saw
before this bulb will last 30,000 hours
or 27 years if you're using it at an
average of three hours per day so that's
a very nice number another number i like
the warranty the old bulb gave you three
years of coverage this bulb gives you
five so that's a little better a little
more peace of mind if you're not sure
about that longevity claim all that said
there are a couple of steps backward
here that I was disappointed to see
first off it didn't come in quite as
bright as the original both bulbs
claimed 815 lumens worth of brightness
the original came and above that number
this bulb came in a little below even
more disappointing was the dim ability
cree claims that this is a better bulb
for dimmer switches than before but we
didn't find that to be the case the old
bulb dimmed flawlessly with all of our
dimmers on our dimming rig this bulb
didn't on this middle one here the
Leviton switch you see a lot of liquor
down there at the bottom that wasn't
there before I don't like to see that
all in all this is still a very decent
bulb does a good job regulating heat
with those convection events it's a neat
trick and it has a nice incandescent
light design just like before but that
flawless dim ability was really key to
recommending this bulb over the cheaper
competitors out there like the GE bright
stick LED and the Philips 60 watt
replacement LED now that dimming isn't
flawless and so it's a tougher bulb to
recommend for more check out my full
review of this bulb on cnet com and
field your LED questions my way on
Twitter foreseen that appliances I'm rye
