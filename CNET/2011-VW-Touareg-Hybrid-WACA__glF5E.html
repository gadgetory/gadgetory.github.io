space fuel economy performance if the
answer is yes
VW would like to think this is motorised
mammoth let's see if it has a prayer of
delivering on all those fronts as we
check out the 2011 VW Touareg hybrid and
check the tech the Touareg is
Volkswagens Cayenne with one big
difference the Cayenne is Porsches best
selling product the Touareg VW's worst
they share a hybrid powerplant and
transmission as well as frame shell and
doors
beyond that the two diverge a lot don't
tell your friends you bought a Cayenne
that just costs less they'll think
you're a tool let's talk about interface
in this Touareg Hybrid you've got two
good places which I couldn't say about a
VW until just about today first of all
here's your main screen is a whole new
rig for VW if you haven't been in one
lately anywhere from the navigation map
which looks really good nicely rendered
good dot pitch you got your 3d a little
bit of topo going on there 2d as well
you can look at traffic as a contextual
list or you can have it display of a map
of course and as I bounce through things
like climate settings and other screens
you can see you've got a nice big
touchscreen big buttons very forward
like in that sense from earlier forward
systems but it's got a partner screen
also which is really kind of in the
class of some of the BMW and Mercedes
Helper screens in there between the
gauges kind of a wall-to-wall LCD and it
gives you all kinds of other information
you can plug into by using this rocker
on the wheel and that'll get you from
navigation audio telephone or vehicle
now what you drive with in there as I
showed you is navigation of course and
you've got this sort of menu bar instead
of lots of busy buttons around here so
again these are dynamic here's where you
would change your map orientation I like
how it focuses things to little small
buckets of function as opposed to
getting me Hugh
nested submenus and you've got some
other relevant stuff this isn't about
destination but it pulls up the
bluetooth streaming media screen or
whatever is your media right now to kind
of have that all in one place because
they're realizing you're going to have
the destination up and want to keep it
up while other stuff takes place now
let's move on to our media choices here
I like how when you go to media you just
get what you're playing now and then if
you want to dive into sources you open
that up to expand that's kind of the
right way to orient my top of mind
awareness of what I'm doing you have a
built-in hard drive in this car you've
also got bluetooth streaming media I've
got my phone hooked up now the bluetooth
streaming is pretty slick you've got
full readout of metadata as well as
transport control now here's where we
get into some fun SD card internal CD I
guess you can option an external changer
on this guy where would they hide that
aha over to the glovebox what is this
pull the yellow tab it's kind of like
when you're on a jetliner heading down
into the ocean and down slowly drops
this little deal here very
double-oh-seven ish here's where you've
got your single optical disc player and
two SD card slots but both those media
are outdated I'd gut this thing keep a
Glock in there was an extra clip oh by
the way I see that connector down there
that's one of those multimedia interface
deals be them you didn't see fit to give
us any of the proprietary cables that go
with it
but you can use that to create a USB
female pigtail an aux female an iPod
connector etc and those would pop up on
the source the review camera has as you
can see trajectory and distance plus you
can decide to option in or out this
overlay screen of what the distance
sensors are showing you so that's kind
of a nice rich interface for deep
bumping into stuff you've also got this
mode over here on the right this ribbon
that lets you decide on sensors and
sensor overlays and some camera
positions it's almost more than you're
ever going to want to screw with but
it's a nice toy you have one choice of
transmission on this guy it's an 8-speed
automatic it's technically a Tiptronic
from the Porsche Audi vwfamily you move
it to drive or kick it over here to tip
it into different gears you've also got
a sport mode back here which we'll check
out when we get on the road and right
next to that you've got your --mode for
extremely
economical running it biases the car
more toward efficiency then even drive
and of course even more than sport
here's your all wheel drive control for
motion is very simply implemented on
this car you're either on road or you're
off-road the Touareg has a very cool
headlight technology developed by hella
a forward scanning camera constantly
evaluates oncoming headlights and
reshapes the beam cut off of your tour
eggs headlights in real time to give you
maximum lighting without blinding them I
think it's the only car in the world to
do that very cool we've got a three
litre v6 not necessarily just direct
injection because you'd see TDI here we
have TSI so direct injection combines
with super charging here's a
supercharger here here's the nose pulley
here's your intake plenum so this is a
very different thing than you're used to
on any hybrid except this and the
Cayenne which has the same motor it's an
Audi motor by the way you can tell by
all these various fittings those valve
covers are a dead giveaway oh yes so is
the Audi logo on front of the cam here
this guy will get you a 380 horsepower
425 foot-pounds of torque
lots of torque because superchargers are
torquey electric motors are torquey this
guy of course has one sandwiched between
the engine and the transmission 0 to 60
is 6.2 seconds for a vehicle that weighs
50 135 without you in it that's pretty
impressive mpg not so much so 2024 but
given the whole package how big it is
and how fast it moves I guess that's
something of a wins
now driving this Touareg supercharged
hybrid is interesting mixed bag of
experiences you've got these two drive
modes there's drive and there's Sport
and you've got this --mode as I pointed
out Jekyll and Hyde going on here this
car can be the biggest slug you've ever
driven if you poke along Indy and eco
mode real disconnected real rubbery long
delay it's like steering the Titanic you
know gotta make a left turn give me five
minutes well on this thing it's like got
to accelerate to get in that hole up
there give me five seconds that's a long
time but once you get this guy in till
it's a sport mode and or mixed agir
yourself all those gobs of supercharged
and electric torque come on and you can
absolutely punch out of a hole now I
didn't get this guy off road so I can't
tell you much about how it does there
but one last note about driving is
visibility in this vehicle very
interesting a square cornered mirror you
don't see that very often looks at a
very square back light to the rear which
maximizes the amount of visible area and
as I look over the corners this car
actually has very little in the way of
blind spots I mean they're they're like
any modern cars thick pillars but
they've done a really good job carving a
lot of holes in this vehicle so it's
better than most at staying visible and
of course I love this panoramic roof
this is one of the most panoramic of the
panoramic roofs that are so much in
vogue these days you really feel the
airiness in this guy which it actually
doesn't print that area from the outside
but when you're inside it's very very
nice light greenhouse now before you
pull the trigger on a Touareg hybrid you
got a pencil out the TDI version the
turbo diesel check it out
the hybrid gets 20 24 mpg the diesel
1928 the hybrid gets to 60 in 6.2 the
diesel takes 7.9 the hybrid cost about
61 grand the diesel about 48,000 but you
will have to spend a few thousand more
to get things like the panoramic roof
still you save many thousands and get
the TDI's lovable torque curve and I'll
bet the TDI doesn't feel half as much
slower as the numbers suggest
okay let's price this Touareg hybrid
about 61 5 delivered and that's about it
there are no tech options there are
hardly any options except for light
color then you got to compare it to the
turbo diesel
you owe that to yourself test driving
both head-to-head the diesel costs a lot
less it needs a few thousand more in it
to get the equipment the same but you
got to do the math on that one and the
Genki powertrain here could be a
deal-breaker no matter what</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
