the things you should remember and you
can't stop remembering
the things you should forget we've
always had power not anymore what we
have is each other
we're ghosts fighting for something that
can't be killed soldiers stand against
their enemies
the ghosts
call of duty set the gold standard for
first person action in the current gen
and make no mistake we're going to do it
again with call of duty ghosts for the
next gen we've had a camera crew inside
our iconic studio Infinity Ward
capturing the creative process as the
vision for this game is unfolded and we
wanted you to be the first to go behind
the scenes and take a look at what
they've been up to here to infinity ward
we've had a great time crafting the
benchmark of the modern day shooter on
current-gen and we're really excited
that we get to be the studio that brings
call of duty into the next generation we
have a whole new story with brand new
characters completely new world and this
is powered by a new next-gen engine that
gives us amazing graphic fidelity and
really innovative new ways to play the
game
so what we wanted to do is create a cast
of characters that you really felt more
emotionally attached to they had the
opportunity to work with Stephen Gaghan
this is the guy that won an Oscar for
writing traffic he wrote and directed
Syriana what they really wanted in this
game and called duty ghosts is they
wanted emotional reality you know they
wanted these characters to feel real to
feel like real people so the story opens
up with a mass event America is crippled
our military forces are devastated our
governments in disarray and as the
player you are actually the underdog
fighting back against these superior
forces so the team you're a part of is
formed from the remnants of all the US
Special Forces ghosts are a super elite
fighting force to like the Spartans all
the way through SEAL Team six they've
adopted every technique that's useful
for modern urban guerrilla style
fighting one of the fascinating new
additions to your squad is a dog we've
had dogs in call of duty before but
never like this this is someone you care
about this is a squad member he does
everything from sniffing out explosives
to protecting the team so with this next
Call of Duty being in a new world on a
whole new story line one of the things
that we want to do to support that was
create a new engine
our goal this game is to make brand new
next-gen characters and weapons has
never been seen before and call due to
game we have a new tech in the game sub
D the ideas is a closer you get to it
the more tries to maintain any curvature
that you see this is very helpful on
weapons helmets for characters and makes
a huge difference for visual fidelity at
what the player sees from a distance as
well as close up with a new next-gen
console this is an opportune time for us
to reinvent the experience that we
deliver it's important to keep our core
philosophies about gameplay drives tech
so when I think about the animation
features that we've been working on for
call of duty ghosts well the first
things that come to mind is immersion we
have a new mantle system so that when
you're running quickly and you hit a
wall you get this nice boom you hit it
and you leap and you go and you just
maintain your momentum but we have to
lean feature that allows you lean out
and lean in and get a better view of the
battlefield so another feature the world
can't with animation is the slide it
allows you to get somewhere quickly get
out of the line of fire and at the same
time do it in a really cool-looking way
we've added fluid dynamics interactive
smoke and also added an AI system to it
so we have fish move out of the way when
you get close to them the poly counts
the texture increases the shaders the
lighting tech the level should feel like
you're really there and all the
technology is going into it allows you
to achieve those goals
with this being an all-new call of duty
we really taken this opportunity to
revamp multiplayer one of these new MP
features that are most excited about is
dynamic maps we have everything from big
earthquakes and floods down to
player-driven actions doors explosive
traps things that change the flow of the
map all of this creates a new dynamic
experience for the player another new
feature is character customization you
can choose the heads you can choose the
bodies you can choose the helmet gear
that you're wearing you can connect with
who you are as a player more so than
we've ever done in the past dynamic maps
and character customization are just two
of the new innovations that we're
bringing to next-gen multiplayer we have
the best fans of the world
and we're committed to creating for them
a new next-generation call of duty
experience one of the key reasons Call
of Duty has been as successful as it is
is we focus on gameplay it's the thing
we designed for it's the thing that
drives our successes of franchise and
with all of the new tech all of the new
story limits everything that we're
putting into this next generation call
of duty we are still 60 frames a second
low latency controls a great feeling
game
this will be the most beautiful call of
duty game we've ever made it will also
be the most character-driven and
emotionally engaging call of duty game
we've ever made and it will be the best
call a duty game we've ever made a
stunning leap forward not just for this
franchise but also for console gaming to
show you what I mean we've put together
a little comparison video that shows you
what's possible on the next-gen and put
side by side the differences between
what we're going to be delivering in
call of duty ghosts and what was in
infinity ward's last game called duty
modern warfare 3 which was state of the
art just a very short time ago and when
you look at the differences side-by-side
it's actually pretty stunning let's take
a look this sequence shows one of modern
warfare 3 s main characters price while
this asset pushed the limits of what was
capable at the time the technology
employed by the new engine allows us to
take the visual fidelity of our models
to a whole new level this
next-generation head is modeled with
multiple features represented sub-d high
resolution textures subsurface skin
shaders multiple lights and self casting
shadows
here you can see the dog model from
modern warfare 3 our new dog model is
taken from high-resolution scans of an
actual SEAL team service dog every
detail is replicated right down to the
scars on the nose and the tattoo inside
to you when playing first-person action
games your character's arms are one of
the most looked at visual elements the
arms in mw3 were beautiful at the time
but the new engine allows for
significantly increased texture
resolution this advancement in
technology allows us to convey fine
hairs bruising cuts and even the dirt
beneath the fingernails here's an
example of a jungle environment from
modern warfare 3 now here's a jungle
environment from ghosts this scene
employs many new tech features including
volumetric lighting boosted polycom and
self casting shadows</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
