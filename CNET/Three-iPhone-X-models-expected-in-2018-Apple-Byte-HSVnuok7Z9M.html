to the Apple buy for everything good and
bad inside the world of Apple of tons of
stuff going on with the new iPhone 10
but Before we jump into that you know
you want to hear about next year's
iPhone already don't you well you know
what you're going to because I said so
now according to KGI securities Ming Chi
quo
Apple will launch a trio of iPhones in
2018 including a 5.8 inch and 6.5 inch
models with OLED displays and a 6.1 inch
model with an LCD display the reports
say all screens are expected to come
with a new true depth sensor and the
full screen notched design so notch
lovers this one's for you
the two OLED models will target the
high-end market the five-point inch
model will retain its 458 pixel per inch
density while the 6.5 inch OLED behemoth
that will not fit in any of your skinny
jeans will have a roughly 480 to 500
pixel per inch density now the LCD based
6.1 inch screen is reported to have a
weak-ass 320 to 330 PPI that will make
you question your vision and is expected
to target the lower end to mid-range
markets now close reports are pretty
reliable these days and that means next
year's potential lineup would retain the
current iPhone 10 model bring a bigger
iPhone 10 plus into the mix and add the
iPhone 10 blurry alright a new report
from Bloomberg says Apple is working on
a rear-facing 3d sensor system for the
2019 iPhone to push them further ahead
as the leading consumer augmented
reality device Apple is looking at
different technology compared to the one
used on the current true depth sensor
the new system would use a
time-of-flight approach that calculates
the time it takes for lasers to bounce
off surrounding objects to create a 3d
map of the environment around you now a
Ark it can currently handle flat
surfaces really well and placing objects
on them but it has issues with walls or
doors or vertical planes and needs more
accurate depth perception so the iPhone
10 was in 2017 we called out the iPhone
dos a keys for 2018 and get ready for
the 2019 iPhones their flex
ah wait I mean 30 it's it's iPhone 30
it's Apple come on what was I thinking
all right let's talk the current iPhone
10 Apple basically called out the
hacking community to try and break face
ID after emphasizing how difficult it is
with the odds of it working on someone
else's face being one in a million
Vietnamese security firm B calf was up
to the task and released a video and
blog post showing they cracked the code
with a mask made up of 3d printed
plastic silicone makeup and paper
cutouts which together tricked the
iPhones face ID into unlocking it now
their methods haven't been confirmed but
the B cave team says their mask costs
one hundred and fifty bucks and they
only needed a half face because the
recognition is not as strict as Apple
makes it out to be but the average
person won't be able to do this so mom
don't worry about someone making a
replica of your face any time soon and
unlocking your phone unless it's your
ten-year-old son now this video shows a
mom who registered her face with face ID
she shows us that the phone is locked
and face ID unlocks it so it works for
her then she hands it over to her son
who's able to unlock the phone using his
own face plus if you're ten years old is
still not played out for you so you got
to throw on that dab so it's legit huh
now Apple is yet to make any comment
about the recent face ID hacks that have
shown up and you know what they probably
won't now there's more iPhone 10 inches
Apple's working on reports from users
claimed their touch screens become
unresponsive in the cold the iPhone 10
would immediately refuse to recognize
any touch input and Apple says it's a
software bug causing the issue that will
be fixed in an upcoming update you know
it's really frustrating because I also
know what it's like when something or
someone is cold to you in
now a limited number of people are
getting a dreaded green line that
appears on the side of their iPhone 10
screen that won't go away once it
appears it's not limited to a specific
model of the iPhone 10 and none of the
phones were reportedly dropped it could
possibly be an electrical fault on some
devices that causes all the voltage to
flow to the green subpixels but you'll
need to reach out to Apple care to get
this taken care of and this isn't a fix
for the iPhone but if you saw our Apple
byte iPhone 10 review I talked about how
I'm still not a fan of the knotch some
of you are and some of you aren't and
that's okay but there are ways to get
rid of it thanks to a free app on the
store called
notch remover that lets you put in your
own pictures and hides the notch for you
on the home screen there's also a
website called notch list dot space they
offer their own wallpapers and even give
you the Photoshop template to make your
own if you don't want to use an app and
I know some of you are saying dude get
over the knotch
it's fine so fine I'll give it a chance
and I've just decided to embrace it with
this wallpaper also FYI I do know how to
swipe up to close apps like this and it
still takes longer to close apps swipe
or no swiping
in a good Apple update Apple is rolling
out the faster Wireless 7.5 watt
charging and the latest beta for iOS
11.2 on top of Apple pay cash we don't
know when it will get a public release
just yet
but 95 Mac says they didn't see any
meaningful difference in charging speed
after the update according to reports
only manufacturers that partner with
Apple like Belkin and Mophie will be
able to be certified and take advantage
of the faster charging speed all right
here's a little quick fun tip from omar
alpha neck on twitter the Apple earpods
case can also act as a makeshift stand
for your iPhone but it's pretty wobbly
and has to be balanced in the right
sweet spot I wouldn't use it but you
know what here you go you guys can and
there's more 2018 iPad news after
reports from Bloomberg last week that
face ID and a minimal bezel design is
coming to the iPad pro Chinese website
my driver's reports to next year's iPad
pros will feature octa-core processors
based on TSM C's new 7 nanometer
manufacturing process the 8 core chip
will be tentatively named the a 11 X
Bionic with 3 high-performance cores and
5 energy efficient
ones will also likely bring a next-gen
m11 coprocessor and neural engine for AI
test in all the face recognition goodies
from the iPhone 10 now all of this will
result in CPU improvements and wait for
it
the fastest iPad Apple has ever made
okay sticking with the iPad we found out
it's not one of Microsoft CEO Satya
Nadella is favorite devices Nadella
walked into a room and saw a couple of
reporters with iPads and said cheerfully
to one of them you need to get a real
computer my friend oh that burns Apple
by nation a little bit I mean you're
talking about my iPad pro but come on
Sasha you know you're just hating
because people teased you about your
last name rhyming with a tasty hazelnut
spread with cocoa damn all right that's
gonna do it for this week's show you can
email us at the Apple bite at cnet.com
or tweet brian tom thanks much for
watching we'll catch y'all next time for
another bite of the Apple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
