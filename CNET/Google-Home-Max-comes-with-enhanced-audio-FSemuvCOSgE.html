sound at Google home ever the first
thing you'll notice is how we obsessed
over the bass its 24.5 which will first
have 22 millimeters of excursion an
extremely high range for their size
that means these woofers can move a lot
of air oh and max to really hit those
low frequencies and max can play loud
really loud it's one of 20 times more
powerful than Google home so they'll
fill
any room in your house with amazing
audio now great hardware alone isn't
sufficient for great sound the challenge
of speakers today is that they're tuned
for ideal acoustic conditions but they
fall short in the real world that's why
it always sounds different in the store
than in your home to sound great the
speaker needs to adjust to you and your
home so today we're announcing smart
sound a new audio experience powered by
Google's AI it allows max to adapt to
you your environment your context your
preferences so for example if you set up
a speaker near wall on a shelf in a
corner fairly common places it can
dramatically change the sound balance of
the speaker and make the music sound
muddy and the vocals lose clarity well
with smart sound we automatically tune
the speaker to correct for this effect
using a machine learning model a trained
with thousands of different room
configurations what's really cool this
is all done dynamically so if you decide
to move max a few feet it'll compensate
within seconds max also supports cast
Bluetooth and stereo aux input so you
can play anything from your phone or
plug in that record player to breathe
new life into that vinyl collection and
of course max has a Google assistant
built right in we made your assistant
can hear you even when the music is
blasting using your unique microphone
placement and Google's neural
beamforming technology Google home max
will be available starting December for
$399 and will come in two colors chalk
and charcoal Edition launched in the US
with more countries coming early next
year</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
