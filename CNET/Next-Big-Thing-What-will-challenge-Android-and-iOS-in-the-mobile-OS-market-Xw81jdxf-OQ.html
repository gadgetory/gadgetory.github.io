been who will take that third position
in the running with iOS and Android now
the discussion is begining to tilt a
little bit away from who to whether
running Windows Phone 8 as its operating
system this Lumia has 4g LTE and NFC in
addition to the usual smartphone
capabilities you won't find any buttons
on the phones face and that's because
the z10 uses only a series of gestures
to navigate around this is the home
screen of Tizen this operating system
wants to go head-to-head with Android
you can see you have your apps arranged
on the home screen as opposed to Android
there is no normal home screen that you
fill with widgets and then a separate
app tray the app tray is the home screen
if you like in the bottom right you have
a back button which is quite similar to
how Android works while over on the left
you get this context sensitive menu
which will display different things
depending on what you're looking at
thanks to the new Snapdragon 800
processor pages and menus are accessed
near immediately look at this global
market share data from gartner there's
Android then there's iOS below that and
then everyone else rolls up into an eye
test at the bottom and worse than that
either not trending or trending the
wrong way similar us data from emarketer
there's windows phone blackberry and
other rolling up to take increasingly
less share of the overall market as time
goes on it's not the direction you want
to be going and we'll talk about
Microsoft's specific prospects in a
future episode but whoever wants a
challenge for that third seat or even
prove it exists they've got to get these
things done in my mind first of all be
different but recognizable that's kind
of a tightrope to walk you want to be
different enough to justify switching
pain from whatever platform the user is
already on but at the same time be
common enough to have an answer to every
arrow in iOS and androids quiver that's
a lot of arrows next it seems as though
you have to do your own hardware I mean
much to my surprise look how things have
shaken out Apple of course has always
done hardware now look at Google with
Motorola Microsoft soon to have nokia
amazon's kind of in there as well it
looks as though if you want to be
in this battle you've got to be able to
fight it on two fronts be affordable
perhaps the only low-hanging fruit left
in the mobile business is in the low or
lower-cost market either
socioeconomically or geographically
around the globe finally be simple by
that I mean simple in terms of how I use
the device its interface and its
services but also simple in
understanding why I would do so and
either leave one of the entrenched guys
or get into Mobile's for the first time
which many millions of folks are about
to do</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
