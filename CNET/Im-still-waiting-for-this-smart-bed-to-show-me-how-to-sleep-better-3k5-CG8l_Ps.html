set my Sleep Number as you can tell my
dog is a huge fan this is a smart
mattress that has built-in sensors and
works with select smart home products
and services to hopefully um can get a
better night's sleep so so far I have
really loved sleeping on this bed it's
super comfortable it has this memory
foam that's really nice and cozy and it
has those dual air chambers so that you
and a partner you can customize your
firmness settings which is a nice option
and I am seeing data pulling in from the
built-in sensors and from the
third-party integrations I have set up
so I have a nest thermostat installed
downstairs I have a fit bed I have an
Apple watch my husband is wearing a
Fitbit we have some smart scales from Y
things and Fitbit all sorts of stuff and
I'm seeing some of those integrations
pull data into the sleep IQ app which
was still asleep number app but I'm not
seeing any custom mess
related to that stuff yet so basically
that means after two to four weeks
you're supposed to start getting custom
messages and push notifications in the
sleep IQ app that says okay we noticed
that you tend to sleep better when the
nest thermostat registers an ambient
temperature of 68 degrees for the night
or on days that you run you sleep better
than the next night so stuff like that
is kind of the next step with this bed
it's what could actually make it truly
truly useful as a tool to give you
trends and recommendations on how to
improve your sleep score so that's what
I look for in the next six days or so it
should happen for me soon so definitely
check back</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
