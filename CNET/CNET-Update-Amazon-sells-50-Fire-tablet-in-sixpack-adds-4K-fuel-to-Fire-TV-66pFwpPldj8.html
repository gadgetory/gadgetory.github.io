this year's hot holiday gift I'm Bridget
Carey this is your CNET update Amazon
just released three brand-new tablets
and the seven-inch fire model starts at
50 dollars at that price amazon wants
you to buy several as gifts and get this
you can buy them in a six pack by five
fires get the six free gonna think we
get to a day where you can sell gadgets
and six packs but hey here we are
the fire has a 7-inch screen a quad-core
processor a camera on the back and the
front you can order a kid's edition of
this tablet for $100 and with it you get
a bumper case and a year of Amazon free
time unlimited that's a service that
accesses 20,000 age-appropriate websites
and YouTube videos and there's a
two-year warranty to get it replaced if
it breaks also new to the fire family is
the Fire HD 8 and Fire HD 10 you're
getting better screens and Dolby audio
with these models and they come in more
colors beyond the basic black the HD 8
comes in pink blue and orange and it
starts at a hundred and fifty dollars
the 10 inch model comes in white and it
costs two hundred and thirty dollars all
of these tablets were on Amazon's
special operating system based on
Android and you'll likely need to buy an
extra memory card for more storage to
save all your movies music and books the
cheapest models only have eight gigs of
memory built in and that's not much
Amazon is selling the tablets now as
pre-orders and they won't be delivered
until September 30th that's not the only
new thing Amazon refreshed its fire TV
box and fire TV stick both devices let
you stream video from the Internet to
your TV like Netflix the Box cost 100
dollars and has brand new hardware
inside with a zippier processor it also
supports 4k video also known as Ultra HD
of course you'll need a 4k TV to be able
to see that higher definition the remote
can listen to your voice commands so you
can search just by talking and also ask
questions like who is that actor or what
song is that
and it'll display the answer on the
screen for an extra 40 dollars there's a
gaming Edition that switches out the
voice control remote for a video game
controller the fire TV can download
play android games so the game pack also
comes with a 32 gig memory card and two
free games shovel knight and ducktales
woohoo if you're looking for something
more basic there's a fire TV stick it's
half the price that $50 comes with The
Voice remote I just plug it into the
back of your TV with an HDMI port
they both ship in October now even
though 4k Ultra HD video is hard to come
by these days you can take your bragging
game up a notch and buy an 8k television
sharp is the first to sell an 8k TV and
this 85 inch beast can be yours in
October for a hundred and thirty three
thousand dollars that's it for this tech
news update and there's more as cnet.com
from our studios in New York I'm Bridget
