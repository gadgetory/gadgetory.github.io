extra tricks and can take a serious
beating I'm Dan Ackerman this is the
Lenovo yoga 11 e Chromebook now of
course we've seen plenty of 11 inch
Chromebooks even a handful of them with
touchscreens like this guy has although
that's still fairly unusual
what makes this very unique is that this
is a yoga Chromebook and if you know
anything about Lenovo yoga line you know
that means it has a special 360 degree
fold back hinge so you can pick it up
fold the screen like this then keep
going and then you can stop it sort of
this mid point we call that kiosk mode
if you're watching a movie or doing a
PowerPoint presentation there's
something like that that's actually
pretty handy and again you still have
the touch screen to interact with it or
you go all the way down like this and
then you have a kind of thick chunky
tablet just like other yoga systems so
you still have the keyboard and touch
pad in the back but you know they're
deactivated so it's it's a little
unsightly and annoying but it's still
functional but this really means this is
the first Chrome OS system running that
you know Google Chrome operating system
that is either a hybrid or even arguably
a tablet that we've tested and so adding
touch this sort of tablet mode this
hybrid mode makes us definitely much
different from every other Chromebook
we've seen and potentially a lot more
useful now this guy is intended for what
they call the education market and that
really means it's super rugged so kids
can knock it around you may see people
using it maybe on industrial sites or
just if you're super clumsy and are
always spilling coffee or dropping your
laptop you may want something a little
more rugged however it is thicker and
heavier than pretty much every other
Chromebook or even 11-inch ultra
portable or hybrid that we've tested
it's about 3.8 pounds if you feed up you
feel it's actually really super super
heavy I does have reinforced hinges it
has a thicker back of the lid so you
won't knock through it if you drop
something on it and the glass it's not a
really glass but it's something very
similar it's supposed to be scratch
resistant supposed to be crack resistant
you can actually put a lot of weight on
the screen performance-wise it works
pretty much the same as other
Chromebooks which means that it runs
Chrome OS you can't run individual
executable apps on it but you know
web-based tools whether it's Netflix or
Google Drive or whatever side of a web
you want to use all work fairly fine as
long as you keep your expectations
modest you are however going to pay a
little bit extra considering the rugged
design and that unique yoga style hinge
this guy is about 450 while you can get
a very similar set of components for you
know $300 maybe even 250 if you just get
a flimsy regular plastic Chromebook I'm
Dan Ackerman and that is the Lenovo yoga
