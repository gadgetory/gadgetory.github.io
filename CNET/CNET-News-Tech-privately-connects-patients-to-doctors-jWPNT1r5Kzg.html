has logged on to VC a free telehealth a
panerai padded to video chat with a
doctor in Florida about her son Darian's
ear infection it's nice to be able to
put the TV on for the toddler and I
could talk to the doctor with no
interruptions yeah 3 VC was designed for
families like the B sins people who live
in remote areas here in the US or even
worldwide who have non emergency medical

while other services like Skype and
Google video are good for consumer uses
VC is the first HIPAA compliant
fda-registered telehealth app that is
free to patients patients pay the
medical provider who then in turn pay
vca usage fee saving a long trip to San

pen to circle areas of the pedigree that
we're focusing in on in less than two
years on the market tens of thousands of
patients and thousands of doctors have
used VC more coming online daily proving
telemedicine visits are going to become
commonplace in San Francisco I'm Kara
