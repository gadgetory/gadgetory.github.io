looks like a tank it has a commercial
field design that makes this dual fuel
30-inch watt oven feel very industrial
and like it's gonna be a powerhouse now
unfortunately it's cook times don't
quite live up in fact when you take a
look at how long it took to Broyles
burgers and boil water in this
KitchenAid the times were about average
as compared with other ranges that I've
tested but what makes this oven really
stand out is it's cooking result the
convection roast feature on this oven is
brilliant not only did I not have to
preheat the oven but in less than an
hour I had a chicken with beautiful
golden skin and moist meat that was some
of the best we've ever tried here this
KitchenAid is also really easy to use
the burner knobs are really big and
substantial and easy to handle
while the touchscreen controls tell you
a lot of information and walk you
through how to use each feature from
it's easy convection convert feature to
just set and cook times for your meal so
despite some just average cook times
this oven would be a good addition to
your home if you have the money for it
this range costs four thousand six
hundred and forty nine dollars which
ain't cheap but if you're looking for a
range that will cook food beautifully at
pretty decent cook times this is one to
go for</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
