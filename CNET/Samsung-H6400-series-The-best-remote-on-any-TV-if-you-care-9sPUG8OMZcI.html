is Samsung's H 6400 series this is a 55
inch member the series the series is
available in sizes from 40 all the way
up to 65 inches this series sits right
in the middle of Samsung's extensive
2014 lineup it's real claim to fame is
it's the cheapest Samsung TV that
includes its new touch motion remote
Samsung calls it the smart remote I call
it the best remote I've ever played with
on a TV I'll get to that in a little bit
but first we'll start with the exterior
this set very minimalist design it's got
a nice black board around the edge to
differentiate it from step-down TVs
there's a little sort of see-through
edge a little bit around the black so
you get a slightly thicker bezel but
again it's only about 0.3 inches thick
so the TV looks like it's pretty much
all picture of course samsung's
trademark swivel stand is below here
with the kind of spider legs and a nice
chrome finish so all told really
nice-looking TV especially at this price
level so I'll mention that remote
Samsung finally this year is including
motion control and it's remotes LG has
been doing that for a while Samsung
basically copied that and added a nice
little twist on its remote when you're
doing motion control which makes the
cursor behave a little bit like a
Nintendo Wii you can select things by
waving at the screen to enable that
control in the Samsung remote you kind
of just rest your finger on the touch
pad that's a really nice intuitive way
to get the motion control activated
motion control works great for web
browsing and a lot of the Samsung Smart
TV menus you really want to find it as
much use when you're watching regular TV
speaking of regular TV this TV can also
control your cable box so Samsung again
aims to kind of subsume your cable boxes
UI into the TV zone interface you do get
a native Samsung guide and a couple of
other cable box controls but in general
compared to using a standard universal
remote or even the remote that came with
your cable box this remote scheme from
Samsung isn't quite as accurate then
again if you like using a lot of these
other features including that web
browser and some of the other smart TV
things you really appreciate this motion
remote it's especially nice for typing
in search terms
speaking of search Samsung it also
includes a voice search on this TV you
can talk into the remote and you can get
the TV to react to a bunch of different
commands you can actually say channel
numbers it'll tune to that if you have
it set up correctly
ESPN it'll also do searches for actors
and a bunch of other stuff we found the
search a lot more accurate than we've
seen in the past so kudos to Sam
for making that work relatively well of
course like all voice search do you do
run into plenty of failures but if you
like playing around with that you don't
like typing on an on-screen keyboard
that's really the way to go
of course this TV includes Samsung's
full Smart TV suite that includes more
apps than pretty much anybody else one
real standout is HBO GO you also get a
variety of other video apps hundreds and
all to choose from as you mentioned
there's also 3d capability in the set
for people who care Samsung includes two
pairs of 3d glasses right in the box you
can also purchase additional glasses
from Samsung for the low price of 20
bucks connectivity is ample including
four HDMI ports a component video port
and a LAN port for the internet of
course this TV also has built-in Wi-Fi
samsung also offers three USB ports you
can plug in thumb drives are also hard
drives beyond all those fancy features
in slick design the picture quality on
the 6,400 seems a little bit of an
afterthought sure it's pretty good with
accurate color and very good video
processing but the black levels are
really not that great so you get a
little bit less contrast and see on some
TVs at this price level on the flipside
we did appreciate the bright room
picture thanks to this nice matte screen
although all told it's really not as
good as a lot of the TVs at this price
just for picture quality then again it
includes this excellent feature set with
the great remotes if you're going to be
using all that stuff the 6400 is a
pretty good TV to consider that's a
quick look at Samsung's H 6400 series
