holiday party on a tuesday yeah it's a
little anti-climatic one of those will
know if your call in sick tomorrow why
you call in sick there are people in
this office I'm telling you out there
I've seen them there are people out
there they don't know it but maybe just
maybe if the mood strikes in the right
fashion they're gonna do it do you think
that's what's gonna happen I think I
took I think these two people are gonna
bang yeah it's already gonna do put like
blue-cheese trackers on all of them to
make sure that you can see them all they
look these two one into a closet
together this is their own business okay
so you're not dragging mine say it's not
a discovery special just saying like
it's it's the it's just the excitement
of all the possibilities in the Wonder
so you're just gonna sit there and kind
of like tent your fingers and just wait
for something to happen no again none of
my business I just think it's amazing to
know that like there are two people out
there on the floor they don't know it
something's got all the forces all the
all the lineup everything's gonna
conspire together the over there wind up
having an awkward cab ride yeah and then
since tomorrow's Wednesday it'll be a
very awkward Wednesday yes let me see a
couple people see that's the thing see
who doesn't give each other I contact
tomorrow or somebody's excessively
friendly to another all of a sudden I
feel like people think we're kidding
around but this happens I promise you
this happens right yes it's gotta happen
in at every holiday party across the
country yep two people awkwardly
slobbering on each other if it's in an
office it's like on a weird Xerox
machine just getting nasty staplers and
office supplies fallen from the shelves
that's a good thing we don't do the
actual party here it is good to have
cameras and lighting and all the
lighting and cameras what's that and
cameras and camera and there's awful
lighting Numidia live stream button
there like
no this would be great no one's getting
lucky with the kind of fluorescent
lighting in here harsh like super
unflattering yeah all right i wanna i
want to wish everyone a happy holiday
season that's what i want to do enjoy
your awkwardness and your slobbering and
may all your shady office hookups go
over well it's tuesday december ninth
let's start the show
much river I've ever heard like two
people say oh we met at an office party
right when they already know each other
though yeah but that's I don't know we
got together yeah like how how'd you
guys meet Oh believe it or not it was an
office holiday party seal the deal there
must be was right up there with the the
woman who says that she was Kat called
and that's how she met her husband right
why not there exactly how often um
thanks for tuning in to the 404 show
today I'm Jeff Bakalar I Zach tars to my
left Arielle Nunez over there in the
role cube yep you had frozen so I was a
perfect shot of RL is going I'm just
gonna hold that face the whole show so
we've been getting a lot of responses to
the news that we broke out last week
about how 44 in 2015 is having a baby it
was having a baby but it's also going
audio only mm-hmm which you know I guess
I expected the amount is maybe a little
more than I realized or anticipated
rather so I guess it's probably apt to
to address some of that you're making
this sound so freaking official is like
okay so we're not doing video and I'm
sittin like I you know I get people are
upset this one our buddy here err some
of his video I'll make a find it um his
name's Calvin he's not happy we could
play some of it right here let's play
that real quick remember Kelvin oh I
consume you guys okay I have you guys
here one and I'm playing some league of
legends on the other or some whatever
other game you know battlefield whatever
I don't know and then I have liked which
open over here seems like you're
multitasking a lot while you're watching
our show how is even watching us we can
watch all great how is he watching us
it's just a little eyes so do you have
sir also on anyway he it's a funny video
actually and obviously we appreciate him
Calvin taking the time and sending us
into us so you know some people are
locally upset and I I I empathize with
that and I get it but it's kind of what
we gotta do and he actually said like
you guys are not moving to the future
you're taking a step back and not that
was the one point where I just actually
did not agree with what he was saying
just because I think podcasts what do
you have it just seems to be getting
increasingly it's really about the words
it just looks angry so I haven't seen
the video entirely yet I'll start to
frown a little bit I just want to leave
this in the background the whole time I
knew that I loved it it's a good video
it's a funny video and if he lets me
maybe i'll post the link to everyone so
they can check it out but for me it's
like I get it podcasting has never been
more popular though and the popular
podcasts are audio like cereal I think
that crazy oh this american life WTF i
mean the list goes on and everyone's got
an audio podcast and that's what this
show is it's like we said we were
filming a radio show yeah man like the
fryer word stern look at the microphone
how the hell is it go work out there
there's a giant hint that this is for
audio really because I why should just
have a nice little lavalier yeah a
little mic and not these monster things
looks like Mike and Mike on ESPN right
and that sound like watching that I'll
like watching boomer and carton those
guys suck man oh yeah that's an Emmy
they don't they're CBS employees they're
always on the TV downstairs they are hmm
I do like boomer not their graphics I
don't really care for that everything
else anyway that's a new york thing
anyway um so that's what's gonna happen
uh and you're gonna get a longer show
out of it and specifically to your point
Calvin I think you can afford not
staring at one more screen there right I
just think you should have the waveform
up man what's that up look at that and
watch it go by way more dynamic than
just it which is one shot we're just
sitting like this that's it anyway I
guess my point is you know we can't make
everybody happy but just take some
comfort in knowing we're making
ourselves happy so if that's not good
enough for you I'm sorry but that's how
it's gonna that's how it's all those
videos over I wanted that to go on
forever it does every minutes and 53
seconds gets he gets in there just in
the furrowed brow he just just look so
hurt a week from tomorrow is gonna
bri social so sad wicked said kelvins
actually looking at a smaller sadder
version himself in this in the shot yeah
can you make that we're gonna miss our
still image for today seriously that's
gonna be a real man you made it congrats
are not happy you're a meme no chips
ahoy let me just say that I've always
been told the key to a successful ending
is to end on your own terms yeah you
know and this is this is something we're
doing we all have other things that we
want to pursue in the future and all
things have to come in to an end it's
better that we end it on our own while
we feel like we're at a good level then
to gradually fade out people just forget
about wait I was gonna make the show
suck until we go into audio only that's
what I've been doing this whole time
anyway so no one could have put it
better than Arielle yeah just you know
he's all like he's got perspective and
he's got like intelligence and stuff
like that once it's not going away we're
still do we just go to the next room I
mean we don't put a camera on there
there's a drop cam no then we're back
then with the whole thing starts over
again listen we put a camera in there as
well do how we wind up here in five
years again it's a cycle I like two
cycles how that vicious cycle worked um
alright so that's that right we could
put that to bed for now sure a week from
tomorrow Steve Guttenberg is gonna be
here and that'll be our last video show
nice okay so that's the wat that's the
17th it's the last show for a while so
getting the way re oh you won't be here
for that right no I'll be here tomorrow
I mean no week from to a week from
tomorrow Oh probably not so your last
video show is probably gonna be Friday

Monday or Tuesday oh no oh yeah we have
a beer for that okay I thought you were
gone all next week not all right yeah

like staring at these people we got a
Windows be rigid I know I just I do it
all the time ah it's good thing we're
getting a ting there's a squirrel going

notified what else that's all the house
keep housekeeping I gotta do let's get
into the show's stories the show let's
show stories so you just get into the
show story so there's this thing called
sony ever heard of it yeah oh good it's
very exciting now he's been hacked again
and again and again and again and again
again again it's kind of like a monthly
thing with you guys but whatever well
there was a lot of stuff that was leaked
including a passwords and social
security numbers or whatever but one of
the weird ones that was leaked was a
section called 2012 comments it's
actually written by a bunch of people
that work at Sony and there they are
grousing about a number of things but
the headline at vulture red Sony
employees really wish they'd release
fewer Adam Sandler films I can't blame
them cuz they're like we have these
great movies like Moneyball and like we
don't have to like dumb it down have the
lowest common denominator like Adam
Sandler I think he's hurtin with this
you think he's upset by the fact that
Sony itself is like well yeah I'm sure
he's blowing his nose with
thousand-dollar bills I mean I love Adam
Sandler he has a very special place in
my childhood heart that said you can't
deny that his last real good movie was
Big Daddy which is what how many decades
old to least one no right it's over
another one as crazy so I mean I did I
stopped watching them like once it hit
that one I'm like I'm not watching this
well the south what was the movie that
he did that I think made it made his
sort of comedic relevance jumped the
shark um Scott after waterboy that might
have been too usually big daddy was
after I know that's what I'm saying that
like 40 dates where that thing was
called with 50 first date that one that
was good yeah that one good it's like
okay let's just get these two together
again is like nope not watching this is
good I don't believe you it was good it
was good but it's the same storyline as
every other like rom-com you know
totally and they play the same roles
totally and he's always like haha you
know and he does that laughs and you
like plays with a penguin you're saying
this is good no but it was it that movie
was not what made his career jumped the
shark it's not it was something after
that it was before Jack and Jill maybe
he was click I hate that movie maybe is
that stupid click the remote control
yeah there's that and did what
punch-drunk something like unsure on
glove was not a comedy and that was fine
it wasn't supposed to be funny that's a
PT Anderson move you don't mess with
zohan how about that one that the one
yeah a bit it although i feii find
people every now and then that that's
claimed they enjoy it I don't know anger
management wasn't bad that when I saw
what the jack nicholson yeah that one
was pretty good all right i'll give you
50 first dates is after that which is
where i'm saying he started to suck you
don't agree then he goes over to longest
yard which is one of like a lot of
people click is right after that would
you go is god-awful there you go king of
queens I think it's really this one
don't you don't mess with the zohan that
has to be so hands really as own hands
probably the one then you got zookeeper
Jack and Jill that's my boy grown ups 2
there it is yep and the grown-ups thing
that the grown-ups thing sure he's got a
movie called cut top 50 that's with that
Chris Rock I'll even say this to
thousands Little Nicky that was a mile
of garbage not a huge that's the one I
forgot not a huge fan of that one mr.
deeds was pretty good though like this
is when the Sony leaked the studio needs
to change needs to change deal structure
that has been
in place with Happy Madison as this
arrangement has disproportionately
benefited adam sandler and his team
relative to spe it's totally true that
was like easy it's like athletes who
sign these like front-loaded contract
deals we're like to get all this money
up front and but it goes on to like 2048
you know they're still paying these guys
like this guy 7d he's been the deal for
like all of the season yeah Adam Stanley
said we're getting no production out of
him are we still paying him you know why
do we stopped it was not producing on
the field and we're into him for another
30 million dollars for the next two
years I'm just glad you know sometimes
we see enough trailers I'm like how the
hell did this piece of get made I
mean there was like a decision made and
like people sat in a room like yeah you
know we can raise money and there was
like negotiations and that kept
happening with Adam Sandler movies and
so I love that there's one line in this
internal employee conversation there is
a general blahness to the film's we
produce although we managed to produce
an innovative film once in a while I
love how nonchalant they're talking
about this social network Moneyball the
girl with the dragon tattoo we continued
to be saddled with the mundane formulaic
Adam Sandler films and you know what
from like a real business perspective
they're not wrong they're not wrong Adam
Sandler movies just on with the you son
is 11 we're not getting even be I think
big daddy is a great film I really do
happy gilmore Billy Madison all that
stuff that really sounds good but like
you can't you get like I don't know
grown ups 2 and you're like telling
paying this guy for the obvious wants to
do like wasn't it did he actually go on
television and say that the one of the
reasons he takes films is so he can go
work on vacation that's how he actually
decide yeah I guess there was some
promise before funny people came out but
that kind of fizzled I don't know but
then that thing that's what a boy movie
now netflix has got to deal with them so
we don't be having to deal with him on
the big screen it's interesting it's
interesting to get behind the scenes
sort of stuff i love that sort of
candidness um alright i want to talk
about tinder a little bit we ever know
and then we bring up 10 there are three
of us are all um you know tied down for
the
part and I guess I wanna say it's one of
my life's greatest regrets but yeah I
kind of wish i had a year on tinder I
kind of just wish and I know Stacy's
like you know she but she totally feels
that regret also she does not because we
don't love each other and we're like
thinking about going elsewhere with our
lives it's because you just want to be
able to play that game at some point
like if I had tender in college you
know right never gonna be like lost
opportunity no is on the only one thing
I wouldn't mind I'm right there with you
anything about yeah how much like in my
face rejection i got just to see
thousands of that like happening of the
course of college would probably very
depressed did but digital rejection is
so much you so much of an easier to
imagine I've never used the apps have no
freaking idea how it actually is like
him any idea I do you just like it's
kind of like a mini facebook mm-hmm it's
like super micro profile if you like
somebody swiped to wonder ahead and you
swipe right if they match and in
education right if they've swiped right
on you I believe it's right if they've
swiped the correct way for you to it
like lets you know otherwise you don't
get any notifications it's kind of this
goes into nowhere right and they look
like that you could chat with them mmm
yeah like a rejection is just never
hearing a hearing about it does only
have this giant thing a notification
system a 25 here all the people that
said no doesn't work like that anyway
this is a story about how one guy
hitchhike and use tinder to do uh just
that across North America yeah this guy
named Dan Beaumont and he we've just
doing this hitchhiking thing already
they figured he had this tinder app on
his phone he goes okay what if I just
changed my bio explained that I'm an
adventurer that wants to hitchhike
across North America maybe I could use
this in combination with other things
like Craigslist and couch surfer or
couch surfing to find a way across North
America and he freakin did it he went
over 12,000 kilometers which is like Oh
7,500 miles across country and people
were totally willing to pick him up and
drive in places apparently people were
really excited cuz he's a Brit
one of the most freaking questions
charming as one most freaking
questions like all my OMG do you have an
accent a lot of girls were right back
and goes maybe like no I'm just born and
raised in the UK he goes no accent to
which i replied ever heard James Bond
speak I sound like him brilliant done
deal the world was this guy's oyster so
this guy traveled yeah older across the
country with this using tinder really
people are asking if he had an accent
that's what this guy says it's wrong
because I was matching man maybe I'm
just jealous cuz i know that accent
works it does but it's just like the
hell you need to ask for you right
dumbass oh right he's meeting with a
matching a lot of curious american girls
so he just like banging his way across
the country banging anybody I'm sure it
doesn't say that I didn't say didn't do
it i'm sure all platonic and alone yeah
when they they just drank wine and
talked about you know my so-called life
that must be it that's actually sebastes
24 there's no freaking way he knows what
that is true its way before that's like
probably would will be you bond over
friends you probably caught the end of
friends the end of resin he's on a
syndication you know when friends is on
channel 11 oh I so wrong I've seen
friends it's no problem well hey what's
that you wanna bang no prob I just need
to go you're James Bond oppression as
much to be desired stop James Bond it's
just like says he sounds like oh I can't
do James Bond gonna be all slick and
everything that's not something I can do
either that was like my whimsical London
guy kind of sounded like was it Andre
from that leaked it I don't want that
I'm sure anyway so yeah good for this
guy man he did it if you want to read
the whole thing it's over on the show
notes will post the full story how this
dude did it before he did tinder by the
way they only got about 8,000 kilometers
so when he was just basically just a guy
out there with a thumb so we got a lot
more miles by using tinder actually so
twelve thousand of them 12,000
kilometers that is I mean we're fishing
as hell because he was able to like find
love and travel at the same time that's
what it is what's dis tinder ever slogan
I have no idea I could find out it's
just be like at the least you might get
a han ji
10 ATM at the end of that it's close
very close to a very least you're in it
for a hanji it says it's how people meet
halos M EA T there's a caption contest
winner right there it's how people meet
ah watch tinder plus what's that tinder
plus is the new premium service we get
higher class people no no tinder plus
allows you to like grab the one that got
away what so if you like accidentally
like swiped left as you could look back
on the widgets why plump I think that's
what it is or force is a notification to
go by that didn't exist I don't think
they're showing the realistic sort of
like tinder relationship here well
there's Sam 25 like that guy's hand is
way too sturdy feel like most people
using tinder or drunk you think so
because they're just looking for hands
all the gestures looking for some
companionship practicing gestures
already why in the wee hours of the
night mm-hmm you don't think so am I in
my stereotyping uh I was a bitterness I
think its bitterness cuz I I think I
think if you had to and you're like okay
wait a second this is my chance i want
it i don't want to accidentally swipe
you would have a steady hand as
otherwise you could accidentally match
something you don't want I've kind of
done like the over-the-shoulder tinder
thing where I live vicariously through a
single friend okay it's not all it's
cracked up to be you're swiping for them
he's not just like oh no thanks new
things new things would would would you
know it's not like that I'm sure there's
some bros out there who treated like
that though anyway there there's the
undo that's what you were talking about
right you can undo and there's also
another thing and I think tinder is
entering like the traveling at the
market too we're like I'm only in you
know Toledo for 48 hours so like you set
up your hotel actually hotel anymore you
set up your car you set up your flight
information and yeah find where you're
crashing right with tender right and
it'll be like oh there's a single person
on the 10th floor of your hotel
get at it you know and you get there
there's like seven other people you're
like oh who's your first up take a
number so how it works that's pretty
messed up all right you didn't have here
Oh some drone stop drama drone drama
yeah we said it was gonna happen this is
that big we told you so all we do is
predict the future so freakin take that
TGI Fridays they're highfalutin drones
with mistletoe this was such a poorly
conceived idea well if you guys don't
remember there's like this promotion and
TGI Fridays where they will fly these
drones around with mistletoe because
when this mistletoe you kiss the person
you're with like ah except this time
there was it chop someone's head off say
I kind of nipped somebody's a part of
their nose off Oh honestly so it was
pretty frickin bad that's bad but not
it's not decapitation no it's not they
were apparently some journalists from
Brooklyn daily went out to check it out
and the quote is it literally chopped
off a tip of my nose it took part of I
took off part of my nose cut me here
right under my chin so she got cut twice
and said she yeah I have no yes oh yes
you got hurt twice by this drone because
you know that's the way this is going to
go down this is this is the exact kind
of press TGI Fridays was looking for
this I mean this is it jackpot guys
Jackie I mean what are the odds is gonna
happen again right that's the one you
want to go back you go back to that
place this isn't like plane crash this
girl's bulletproof now so you always
want to eat with her kind of like you go
fly with the person's been in a plane
crash alrdy it's not gonna happen again
no not to this lady a photographer she
said she's happy that her eyes weren't
damaged and they have a great line at
the end of this who wrote this piece
this is from grub street it is unclear
if anyone kissed her in the aftermath of
the incident oh she was bleeding
profusely so Russell Joe is still there
i mean the rules are in effect they are
right about that I don't understand that
what why a plant over somebody's head
means to kiss them yeah you understand
why an app swipe is ok but not like a
finding pieces I mean it works it's low
test is just like
just like some mysticism I'm unfamiliar
with the origins of stores some sorcery
it's unlike Catholic sources sounds like
some samay wanted to like okay
let's see how can I get her to kiss me I
got it I'll try some like if
you're underneath this plant then you
gotta kiss me I don't know how old is
that tradition hundreds right hundreds
of regional feels it feels old it was
around when we were kids yeah it was for
sure so it's gotta be older than that
before we were kids definitely I mean I
mean why we were sperm Michael Jackson
sang about it was about Santa kissing
mom underneath the mistletoe which it
was years ago which is cheating yeah no
I'm care who would a messed up man and
then what else uh maybe it did start
with Michael Jackson maybe he created it
he was granted I'm today I learned
Michael Jackson invented the mistletoe
also isn't that song older than Michael
Jackson though no pretty sure is it like
a cover it is it is older but it's also
not because he created it before he was
born dave is my bday right makes sense
he's Michael Jackson finally a story
that's close to arielle's heart a bike
thief was chased and then caught in real
time on Facebook Wow yeah maybe you
don't update your status that you've
successfully stolen a bike is that what
this is about no see then that would be
a very interesting take on it's actually
the person who got his bike stolen is
the person who actually he knew the
person who spikes being stolen so he
immediately wrote it on on facebook and
explain it the actual description look
at Jane Jamie's Janice how do you say
this muter oh I don't know your guess is
as good as mine I'll say Jamie's
commuter there's studded tires but
bright blue Krait attached to the back
rack so that this full description of
the bike and within like a couple hours
they actually like the friends like unit
here they actually track down where the
bike is they're actually saying where
it's going the bike is heading towards
sunrise now but how they just freaking
knew it was everything was because it
just happened so they were like dis
around this area apparently but I don't
understand how Facebook could have done
it like how like who saw it I think a
lot of luck is involved here to posting
for Zoey Prince flasher bikes alone from
back there so they all had like they're
part of a group
though that's probably why they were all
like at the same area sure what was
going on but yeah this went down pretty
freaking fast interesting this is that
amazing let's see I'll call Zoe come and
get it wait who has it on my way Danvers
then in Rex's you guys thank you so much
i'm almost in tears reading this thread
i can't believe it so they actually get
this I'm happy for him that wouldn't
have happened for me no no if I would
have posted something on because I don't
know any of my neighbors if I would have
posted on it like I'd probably just get
like a couple likes that's it my bike's
getting stolen my friends will just like
it hope you get your bike back break
yeah like sucks man sucks sucks bro a
lot of sucks bro yeah exactly also the
group's Twin City stolen bikes there you
go there already like vigilante
activists in the neighborhood watch yeah
that's pretty cool maybe I should get to
know my neighbors well if so we're join
some like brooklyn-based bike recovery
program yeah to the idea is that if you
get your bike stolen to put it on
facebook yeah I guess you know like
clearly this is more efficient than
calling the police they kind of freaking
back are there there's the actual bike
then there's the so nice looking bike
nice but you know where it is you know
where you can find it I'm gonna steal it
now this all backfired now that's pretty
cool ah what's the best um app to put on
your computer so if your computer gets
stolen are you familiar with those apps
like a LoJack lane yeah nope no why cuz
I every now and then you'll see a story
on reddit where a guy was able to
recover a computer and like take photos
of the thief you know through through
its you know through the front facing
camera I feel like that happens all the
time this isn't like find my Mac have
that built in I think there's something
like that but it's like it's never been
a worse time to steal a laptop if you
like well get it's like if you steal a
laptop put a freakin posted over the
camera yeah we got a GPS and the second
you connected to the internet like if
you ever plan on connecting this thing
to the internet you're screwed you're
screwed so this will figure out a new
way for thieves to do this properly
that's it and a new show
um a steal yeah that's our that's
actually what world that's was gonna be
right here on this side he had exactly
oh original points that way you go
hey Jeff look over there and then I got
my xbox with that that's how i got my
xbox little smash and grab uh here's
some calls from the public let's listen
to these fine people time to show the
love 86 404 cnet also got some emails
see if i have time to get to that
remember my idea to crowdsource the baby
name yes going on for a fourth crew I'm
glad the voicemail of 6 i'm wondering in
this day and age how voicemail can even
get full with a cheap storage ill stuff
is but whatever 1 jun 3 i'm jeff wanna
congratulate John the baby I know you're
going to crowdsource the name
potentially I did that with some of my
friends and I you know good luck with
that because the number one name that my
friends wanna name my son was a genius
and I think for certain reasons people
don't name the kids Judas anymore but I
love the show keep up the great work
late that's good advice Judas I mean
it's not like I have to do that like I
don't have to use the no no you did say
your crowdsourcing so now you have to do
it yeah but so now you're bound by law
yeah I know I was a lawyer you know
you're the authority on this kind of
stuff clearly I must know what's going
on so this is a binding contract that
you have screwed up here's another
voicemail real quick about black friday
stuff we were kind of playing it down
how it wasn't that big of a deal but in
in other parts of the country it was a
very big deal hi guys this is priscilla
calling you from the Mexican border a
longtime listener first-time caller and
it's lovely to see eyes on something it
doesn't include the tricks video I'm
just calling because my husband my dog
and I were completely outraged by your
analysis your dog was out really kidding
I mean you don't raise his dog so maybe
yes my dog is not like outraged that at
you know I podcast this dog might be on
the
order no idea what you guys are doing up
there in New York but way down here we
sat down to 11 plates of food and
afterward went out to see what was going
on with this black friday madness we'd
seen people lined up outside best buy
since the day before Thanksgiving lines
of amia supermarkets cars throughout all
the parking lots throughout the two
weeks before Thanksgiving so we wanted
to see some of the craziness sure enough
we went out and Walmart was blocked by
police tape and lines it wasn't a space
of it looks cuz someone was probably
killed there over like I don't know
unless I thought the last like piece of
gravy or something less panic baby she
goes on she says like it's still a very
big deal and we're wrong that we said
Black Friday's kind of fizzled probably
right well I think in some places yeah
like if Walmart is like the big
attraction of the town maybe we em if
you got one center where all the the
town folk can can like fall on at the
end go this is the place we're gonna go
to yeah you got that kind of problem but
like I mean if you got a big enough area
just got people dispersed right right do
you think it's fair to say that Black
Friday is more of a suburb II kind of
thing yeah medium and I think it's
really more an online thing let's keep
coming up with more wrong theory and yes
they're just eerie i think it's just
flatly rural that's what it's about it's
all these freaking farmers man obviously
New York is a it's an insanely
commercial City there's a lot of
shopping and all that but you know I
don't think it's it's just we can't tell
because it's just always crazy and if
Black Friday makes it a little crazier
that's not enough of a change for us to
notice yeah i mean i didn't don't think
Abel Damon go out on they're not
supposed to that's the rule that's like
the unwritten law where you're just like
oh it's black friday don't leave no I
think I got a bagel that day I was
exciting well it's scary yeah there was
no crazy line there so clearly because
of Lenny's on 74th that is the truth for
all of America sorry lady you're wrong
and thanks for remembering I used to get
some other horrible place that was how
you really feel like
I got stories stories I can do without a
camera yeah maybe we'll do that when we
get into the podcast studio that'd be
real are you gonna try the you can
actually have a website for the
crowd-sourced name thing no there's
somebody didn't name my daughter com
really yeah Amelia Savannah joy
McLaughlin what I'm not making it up
there's nothing really funny about it
but you can see all the first names ever
submitted I like the ! idea just name
your kid an exclamation point just name
them hashtag oh my god you realize
someone in this country is named hashtag
probably has to be there's no way that's
not the case at all the a names here and
I bet it's sparrow Lester wrong
airblaster that's where blasters a
freaking awesome name I don't know why
you'd use it for a care airblaster
Bakalar I'll get on a blaster and I was
look I was I was kind of hoping it
wasn't gonna be something with the name
blaster what however fun Joker I was
gonna name it amber amber cromby
Hollister middle name will be and that's
perfect see it always sounds like a like
a law firm what do you think of well I
don't want to go I don't want to give
any of the ones we're noodling 7 I'm
also worried that we have like we have
to close friends who are giving birth
before us when anyone and we're worried
and they're both having boys and we're
worried that we're going to be doubling
up which just shows you how trite our
name ideas are got a copyright them now
seriously I'm sure the first middle
won't be the same but first I just don't
want him you're gonna buy the dot-com
for the kid and you're gonna buy that
you're gonna get the at gmail right now
because again the three names is gonna
be hard man I guess I should get the the
Twitter nayagan then Twitter do it now
get their Instagram screwed like I got
the dot-com for my son's name
immediately and then I grabbed it I
grabbed the at gmail one just so it's
waiting for him yeah although I don't
have a twitter account for him I'm okay
with the with the with the lead I might
do that like really soon but you know
when he gets old enough to do his own
gmail he's gonna want to be like dark
horse 53 we can
oh yeah he do it everyone but y'all know
the professional ways but he's ready to
be a real party yeah yeah i mean like it
like we goes to college or something you
might have like a college in eighteen
years man good christine lee foss like
you know a couple hundred thousand
dollars per ticket through one of those
dams I just hope it's free like that's
where I'm kind of holding out for like a
lot of great countries in the world have
free higher education right I feel like
we should probably no no no see the way
works here is crippling student debt
exactly to the Machine and that's why
they want you to keep doing it that's
why you can get credit credit cards at
college when you have no credit history
and they give you a t-shirt yeah like
this is friggin awesome a t-shirt I got
like a daily planner I got a frisbee too
yeah maybe they cut up the cards oh my
god touching this stuff you out of your
freakin mind twenty-three percent that's
pretty good that's exciting well if you
have a holiday party coming up in your
company make sure you you take advantage
of it and you have fun all right we'll
