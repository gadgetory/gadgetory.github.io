coverage of CES 2019 coming to you live
from the scene that staged at Tech West
I'm Dan Ackerman and I'm here with Josh
Goldman and Justin Jaffe and we're here
to talk about all the best and coolest
laptops of CES 2019 so this has been a
great year for laptops I think it's
usually very strong Category here but
this year I think for seeing a
phenomenal amount of new stuff a lot of
it is driven by those new Nvidia r-tx
graphics cards which is why we have all
these gigantic gigantic gaming laptops
so these are not that big I mean they
must used to be much much larger we used
to have the 15 pounders everyone would
take that giant one on the subway and
shoot photos of them sitting at everyone
did the same gag with the big gear of 20
inch laptops I'll show you the one that
I think is the wildest in terms of
design this is the Isuzu mothership and
we got a description of this I think via
email at some point and we all read it
and we all said to ourselves I don't
understand what that subscription means
how does this actually work and when we
saw it in person you go oh that's it so
here you go looks like a regular laptop
I'm gonna put it down like this and push
down on the back and a little kickstand
is going to pop up and then I'm gonna
lean it back on the kickstand which is
not something you usually do with a
laptop open up the lid like this and
it's a little bit reversed there's your
screen and there's your keyboard and
your keyboard tray and you go okay it's
a big laptop that needs a kickstand you
know there's a little secret here right
don't you you pop this off now you've
got a removable keyboard you can fold it
under like this and just have like a
regular keyboard so it becomes basically
an all-in-one gaming PC that's battery
powered or you can plug it all back
together and use it like a laptop is
this the most outr√© design you've seen
at CES it's amazing
I'd say so I think I think that probably
the only thing that would sort of
compare that in terms of novelty of
design would be this bad boy right here
which I'll push forward oh yeah this is
the Acer predator triton 900 and you can
see here it's got this sort of I'm gonna
call it a cantilever design here I'm not
an architect but I think that that's
what this might be so you can see that
it lays down flat almost like a tab
here gaming tablet in that mode yes and
now what you can do is you can raise up
this hinge here and set it like that
regular laptop you know so that's kind
of an interesting design that I don't
know that we've seen before
a few laptops do similar things but not
really gaming ones but I like that you
can take the screen and put it just in
just in back of the keyboard and kind of
move it screen forward yeah and I think
one thing that we're all sort of pleased
about here is the previous edition of
this model was was the the 700 model and
that one had the touchpad in a very odd
oh yeah that's right it had the touchpad
above the keyboard which economically
just crosses glama plate yeah so so I
think Acer has heard the feedback the
touchpad now is to the right of the
keyboard which is I think we can't we
can all agree it belongs there if it's
not gonna be below the keyboard then to
the right play that works and when it's
on the glass plate it also got very hot
I took out my temperature gun and we
clocked it at like 118 degrees at one
point yeah that's super nice now you've
got a window into the heat pipes for the
new Nvidia card
fans and yeah that's a nice extra there
speaking of showing off I think one of
the things I'm most excited about is
right next to that and that is that big
white laptop right there that is the
Alienware area 51 M and I know you're
saying area 51 that's a that's a desktop
for mailing where it's not a laptop
that's why they use the desktop name for
this new design which is probably their
most complete design overhaul in many
many many years because it's got a
desktop level GPU and CPU in it and I
think the big selling point is they are
at least on paper upgradeable the CPU
easy enough to GPU if there's a future
GPU that's you know also removable and
you can you know the small desktop
version you can stick it in there you
could actually access the back of that
and upgrade it yourself which is the big
problem so many people have with with
gaming laptops they're not they're not
upgradable and of course tons of venting
they had a whole hex theme around it so
on the ban on the bottom of those giant
hex vents which just kind of look cool
and it comes in white which is a
different for alien we're so good for
them now if not for these guys I would
think this is pretty gigantic but now it
seems small in comparison right it is
definitely small this is Samsung's
newest gaming laptop just called The
Odyssey they've had previous odyssey's
previous gaming laptops but this one is
completely redesigned because the last
one what's cool yeah what the logo on
the back but umm so this this one is
nice it's all metal on there and you can
see it's really nice and thin and that's
what we're seeing a lot of I like how it
puts the screen further up so you're
just like looking down with the bigger
screen up up and then nice thin bezel
right outside so the whole overall thing
is nice and small and then they did this
nice little I don't know if you can see
that little texture tag on pattern on
the little liquidy yeah I've talked nice
little accent yeah and these are all all
of these able to use the new NVIDIA r-tx
graphics cards which promise a huge jump
in game performance and will probably
add a little bit to the price I'm not
gonna lie and I love that all these big
4 examples of gaming laptops here do
something different like no two of them
are the same right and and none of them
are what you think of as a traditional
big bulky gaming laptop even though
they're all pretty big ya know I don't
think that's the thing is that we're
getting smaller thinner more portable
gaming laptops so and we're still cooler
yeah nobody went to the dorm room
special you need that spousal I call the
SAF the spousal approval factor and if
you're gonna bring a big gigantic gaming
laptop with dents and fans and Dragons
on the back and everything home that may
not fly if you're you know over a
certain age so one of these that's a
little slicker looking has a better
chance of getting through the front door
so this might be a good moment to
mention that now that we're seeing sort
of desktop components in laptop form
factors one of the more interesting
things I've seen here at the show is
this bad boy right here this is the zou
Tech mech mini and in this sort of
bizarro world where we're seeing desktop
components and laptops
we now have a desktop gaming rig that is
arguably smaller than a laptop of course
you don't have the display or the
keyboard of the mouse but just in terms
of the components this thing starts at
about $1500 you have an RT X 2080 in
there you can see that it's covered in
venting so there's about 270 degrees of
a ventilation in this thing so that it
can stay cool because there are some
really heavy duty components in the
airplane there are some antennas that
screw on here and cool lights ports
lights all over this thing
very cool programmable lights on the
front of this so kind of a nice
counterpoint to some of the the gaming
laptops that we've seen because that's
why people started to move to these big
laptops because the desks us were just
shoved gigantic and and gotten away all
the time so those are the big guys now
let's talk about some of the small guys
obviously I think any discussion of this
has to start with this little guy right
here the Dell XPS 13 there's a brand
that's been around for a while they had
a big refresh last year really squeezed
down the bezels they're one of the first
major laptops that did that and it's
been a great laptop everyone has liked
it but it's always been one fatal flaw
the the webcam was always right here
under the screen because I couldn't fit
it above the screen and that led to what
everyone called the up the nose shot if
you were using the webcam to go on skype
or anything like that and if I thought I
didn't think it was a deal breaker
because I don't do a lot of web casting
or web video chats but I could see how
it would bother people so for this new
version which is you know roughly the
same dimensions as the previous one
it's got upgraded components they've
filed they found a way to put the webcam
right up here on top it's so tiny it's
like a 2.3 millimeter high webcam I'm
shocked that they were able to fit it in
there but that solves that problem and
that and that means that you can't
complain about the nose cam anymore and
that was the only thing holding this
back from being one of my absolute
absolute favorite laptops the last
several years
well you can't complain about the nose
cam on that one but you can on that one
I will oh and I will so so if you're if
you do a lot of webcasting or meetings
video meetings and you're not the kind
of person who puts the little post
over your webcam all the time there you
go the new XPS 13 which I think
continues making nice improvements to
that every year now I'm impressed by
this but there was one thing I was
waiting to see here they didn't actually
see in person until today and it knocked
me out this is a laptop I really love
the original version of last year it's
the Acer Swift 7 superlight under 2
pounds very thin bezels and they shaved
them down even more here and they've got
this really wide touchpad and look at
that it's a little bit shorter than most
laptops and just feel how light that is
no it's right thank you let's see I it
doesn't even feel real at this point and
it's just it's got a touchscreen which
on these super thin ones they sometimes
cut to get the weight down and get the
battery life better and the fact that
they managed to work in the Thunderbolt
and a touchscreen and that big touchpad
and a keyboard that's ok it's not gonna
be your favorite keyboard and a
reasonable number of ports and made it
smaller I think this is the this would
this one's my most improved
year-over-year contest although as you
point out there's one thing that'll
drive you nuts
that's the webcam which is right down
here because they didn't apparently shop
at the same webcam store that Dell does
to get that super thin one so it pops up
here so if you're doing a lot of
webcaming XPS 13 if you want it under 2
pounds swift 7 which i think is just is
just fantastic and we have a couple more
small ones to show you what does this
guy - I don't know oh you can see it
it's your pal the HP spectre x360 with
now can we tell how this laptop is
different from all the others it's got
an OLED screen oh boy I love laptops
with OLED screens we don't see him that
often now can you see the difference
between this and a regular LCD screen I
think so I think so I mean it's very
vibrant the colors are popping in it's
it's it's a crisp display I think it
actually does make a difference it
really does especially on a big 15-inch
screen like this and of course being a
360 you can flip it over and you've got
like a mini OLED TV right here which I
think I think really looks great and I'm
always surprised that more companies
don't have old laptops a couple of them
have them but not in the US where they
have them then they discontinued them so
here's my vote everybody's listening
more
laptops weeds in more different screen
sizes and I think that dell and
alienware did announce that they are
starting to bring that technology into
more 15 inch models oh I would love that
would be fantastic they had the 13 inch
OLED from a couple years back that
everybody loved and I saw a prototype
from Razer of their new blade 15 with an
OLED screen it's not something that's
ready now but they they put it in there
to show us it could be done and that
would be that would be fantastic
and even Lenovo which we're about to
talk about they announced a c7 30 with
an OLED display unfortunately not coming
to the United States right now but maybe
I that knows but this is their other big
announcement the yoga s 9:30 it again
super thin very light but it is a it is
a very CES laptop thing so what you get
is nice thirteen point nine inch screen
squeeze into the body it is the first I
don't think you can see if it's a linear
level but you like it the the way they
were able to get the body down and
remove here they have a curved glass
almost like the original Samsung's with
the care of galaxies got that so yeah it
curves into the frame there it's a
really nice look but you can't really
see it unless you're right up on top of
it also this camera is up top there's an
IR camera for signing in with your your
face that windows hello cuz I think the
the Dell one can't but it has seven a
fingerprint reader right so but this is
going to have glance software so that
you can if you look away from your
screen or you walk away from your screen
it'll automatically lock you out of the
computer so you don't have to worry
about somebody coming out and behind you
and getting access but it'll also now
they're working the same offer for you
I'm always very worried about that when
I work with my understand and it will
also tell you if somebody's shoulder
surfing oh wow
pop-up
little notification let you know that
somebody's right behind you looking at
money so that's nice and then also later
when it comes out in May they
unfortunately couldn't demo this to us
because you know see yes
you'll be able to if you connect an
external monitor you'll be able to if
you're working on something on this
display and you look over to the other
external display the external display
will come alive with your windows and
stuff so it's a really nice watching you
everyone is going to be very comfortable
with that concept one point about this
some I'm wondering what you guys think
about this so this this laptop solves
sort of the camera issue by having this
little notch at almost yeah I know it
sort of looks like that the iPhone XS or
X notch my preference is I'm with that
over the nose cam any day and so I'm
noticing a lot of manufacturers are
really consumed with super thin bezels
yes and and that that forces them to put
the camera in unconventional places that
sometimes don't work I think this is
totally fine and I think that the
message to laptop makers is we're okay
with this notch we're we're okay with
the camera above the display I think
that's where it belongs people are
pushing for those thinner bezels and yes
and something's got to give
speaking of Lenovo I have a little
Lenovo bonus for you I was you guys
thought I was crazy for just playing
with this thing for like an hour and I
was fascinated by it it is this Lenovo
yoga mouse and it's it starts out flat
like this then you twist it and it
becomes a little mouse maybe not the
most ergonomic Mouse ever but it's
portable you can slip it in your jacket
pocket like that and I was just going
like this for a while and then I
discovered it's also a presenter mouse
which means your press this little
button here and it becomes a laser
pointer and I I caught the can't
antagonize err so it's a convertible
mouth slash presenter slash can't
antagonize err and it's called the yoga
mouse and for some bizarre reason I I
fixated on this and I you maybe F's of
doing there I'm collaborating the red
dot around the wall so so so that's one
of my two little accessory extra picks
and the other one I'll tell you about
very quickly before we get to our very
last device right here
a lot of these have USB see only so you
have to carry
Don goes around with you or little power
cables or anything like that our buddies
over at pad and quill which is a small
company that makes laptop bags and phone
cases and things like that I first
noticed them when they made book style
iPad cases that were really cool they
actually just dropped by with some new
products and these are these tech folio
products and if you open them up it's
got room for all of your wires and and
little plugs and even even the small
plugs that power some of these very
small laptops are almost phone size now
so they could even conceivably fit in
and here's the bigger version in case
you have a few more cables and you know
I think these are handy for throwing in
your bag if you have a laptop and you
don't all those little wires and dongles
dangling around dangling around in your
back there you go now Josh you have you
know you're the final word here okay you
have two final word here this is super
cheap it's the Samsung flash and you
think the texture design is I go back
and forth I think it's it's either a I
don't know if you can see it's either
like a burlap or twill yeah surface what
is this plastic yeah but Samsung has
been known to experiment with plastics
on a lot of things on laptops and this
this is an example of that so they just
wanted to give it a little bit more
freely on your laptop yes from book but
it's got like Chromebook components in
it and they did throw in some extras you
get fingerprint reader and relative keys
for a little bit we were always had a
time somebody just asked Justin real
fast what would you what would you go
with a plain looking Chromebook or
slightly fancy looking Windows laptop
both around 300 bucks same components
I'm gonna go with I you know I don't
object to this texture I love
Chromebooks a lot of Chromebook news
this year
now AMD processors in their new models
from Acer HP and a seuss so I think you
know with a Chromebook however it
appeals to you that's the one that you
go with because they continue to be very
popular
Josh votes no on the texture you vote
yes I vote interesting I want to play
around with it some more I think that is
all the time we have they're yelling at
us to wrap it up so these are our
favorite laptops of CES 2019 Thank You
Justin Thank You Josh I'm Dan Ackerman
