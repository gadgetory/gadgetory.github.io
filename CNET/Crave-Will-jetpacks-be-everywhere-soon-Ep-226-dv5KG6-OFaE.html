scraper behold the 2016 Guinness world
record holder for longest two wheel bike
in the world members of the mill van
Mears workflow egg challenge themselves
to somehow get into the Guinness Book of
World Records and they succeeded with a
one hundred and seventeen point five
foot long bicycle held together with
stage tresses one person in the back of
the bike pedals a giant tire while
another guy steers the bike from the
front but don't ask them to make a turn
they were rewarded a place in the
Guinness Book of World Records for 2016
but an Australian team is challenging
their record for the 2017 Guinness Book
of World Records with a one hundred
thirty six foot long bicycle that
accommodates 20 peddler's a team of
designers and engineers from the
University of Waterloo and Canada have
built a 3d printer that prints custom
circuit boards the volterra v1 circuit
board 3d printer started its a
successful Kickstarter project and is
now an award winning product
earning the 2015 James Dyson Award in
engineering and design the v1 uses a
mechanical head to print custom to layer
circuit boards using conductive and
insulating inks that are printed from a
2d image file the end goal for the v1 is
to help make prototyping electronics and
circuit boards cheaper easier and faster
for students and small businesses
the force is strong with YouTube user
Colby Powell who posted a video of his
newly constructed 23 foot tall
operational Death Star in Lafayette
California the Death Star's frame
required 162 geo hubs 18 cans of paint
2,000 feet of half-inch PVC conduit and
two t10 grey parachutes to cover each
hemisphere making a total of 960
connections the Death Star had to be
lifted with a crane to be mounted on top
of the house and after adding some
lighting the death star shined in all
its world destroying glory the top mr.
Powell's home just in time for Halloween
and will most likely remain operational
through Christmas
jetpacks have long been a part of pop
culture and we all wish we had one but
the proliferation of drones filling our
skies the past few years it begs the
question is the next Renaissance of
flying vehicles going to be the jetpack
the CEO of jetpack Aviation David Mayman
thinks so
as he took a flight across New York
Harbor using one of his company's jb9
jetpacks in a video released by the
company recently we can see MAME and
buzzing around the Statue of Liberty in
a jet pack that seems almost effortless
to fly the jv9 jetpack can reach an
altitude of 1,000 feet fly at speeds in
excess of 100 miles per hour and has a
flight time of about 10 minutes before
needing to be refueled
according to jetpack aviation the jb9
jetpack is lightweight and can fit into
the trunk of your car the jetpack has
been approved by the United States
Federal Aviation Administration and the
Coast Guard but there is no word yet on
a price or release date
