that smart home kitchen with the review
of the home kit enabled Insteon hub pro
the Insteon hub pro is a smart home
controller now it's got apple homekit
built in so what that means is that
you'll be able to control it on your iOS
device using those controls that are
baked right into iOS 8 and iOS 9 like
existing versions of the entity on hub
you'll plug it into your router and then
it'll speak to entity on devices using
Insteon s-- proprietary dual-band
network from there you'll be able to
turn those devices on and off using your
phone or turn them on and off using Siri
thanks to the assist from home kit so
just for a quick demo if I ask Siri turn
on the kitchen light the light comes
right on you can also group devices into
specific rooms or zones so if you wanted
all the devices in your living room to
turn off or you wanted all the devices
downstairs to turn off you can do that
all in the app now I think the app is
pretty well designed it's simple and
it's not too hard to navigate it's got
nice icons you can choose for each
device that are very specific a lot of
options there so you can kind of make it
your own
I like that they even animate some of
them this desk fan one will start
spinning whenever I turn my desk fan on
so a very nice looking at it was also
pretty simple to get the system up and
running I plugged the hub into the
router and then enter its info into the
Insteon app and just in a few minutes I
was ready to go adding devices was a
little more tedious when I screwed a
bulb in or added a lamp switch sometimes
it wouldn't register during the adding
process it scans and sweeps with this
radar animation but I'd often get an
error message or a failure notification
only to find out that it actually had
paired successfully so in the end not a
huge deal but a little glitchy so all in
all it's a simple start if you want to
get into apple's homekit version of the
smart home the problem is that it's not
quite as expansive as past Insteon
products you can't use all of its John's
devices with this new hub pro you can
really only use entity ons light bulbs
and on/off switches and dimmer switches
which is great for lighting and
appliance control but there's no support
for motion sensors leak sensors smoke
detectors wireless thermostats
cameras a lot of that stuff you could do
with Insteon before it's just not here
now however you should be able to
control other homekit enabled devices as
Apple adds more of them under its full
so this is a system that could get a lot
better as time goes on but right now I'd
probably recommend waiting and seeing
how much better things get before buying
in for more including how the update to
iOS 9 might make the system a lot better
