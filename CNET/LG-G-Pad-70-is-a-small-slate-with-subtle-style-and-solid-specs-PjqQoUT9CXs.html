with the LD d-pad 7.0 this 7-inch budget
tablet sports a simple look with a
smooth back panel that stretches around
to the front of the screen
it's bare-bones design may not be your
style but it's an extremely comfortable
build the rounded edges easily conform
to your fingers when holding it in one
hand and the rounded corners barely make
a dent in your palms and landscape
orientation on the tablet you'll find a
headphone jack IR blaster and microSD
card expansion slot on the top edge a
power button and volume rocker on the
right edge and a micro USB port on the
bottom it's simple design does have its
downsides the pair of speakers on the
back are easily blocked when holding the
tablet horizontally and though I like
the way the silky smooth back feels it
attracts a lot of smudges running on
android 4.4.2 kitkat the seven-inch
tablet features an overlay that can also
be found on some LG smartphones it has a
flattened modern design and supports
multi-window abilities the function is
basic with only some apps capable of
doing it yet it works well for simple
multitasking the LG G pad 7.0 houses a
standard 1280 by 800 pixel resolution
IPS screen and it wears it well text and
images are sharp colors are vibrant ly
rich and touch screen responses Swift
inside the G pad is a Qualcomm
Snapdragon 400 system-on-chip one
gigabyte of RAM and only eight gigabytes
of internal storage for basic tasks like
surfing the web video streaming and
checking email the tablet performs
quickly large games take some time to
load but once each level is launched
gameplay runs smoothly the rear three
megapixel camera is actually pretty good
for a budget slate there is a manual
focus option and the exposure
automatically adjusts to the focal point
though there aren't many scene modes to
choose from the front-facing 1.3
megapixel camera also functions fine for
low res selfies and video conferencing
the LG G pad 7.0 comes in a 4G model
that is available through AT&amp;amp;T the two
looked the same
however the 4G variant has a slot for
the SIM card and ships
loaded with useful software to manage
your AT&amp;amp;T account if you're looking for
a cheap and small tablet you have plenty
to choose from
however the 7-inch LG G pad offers a
supremely comfortable design and a list
of solid specs that work just fine for
casual use for a more in-depth look

I'm Xiomara Blanco and this has been a
first look at the LG D pad 7.0</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
