out there than there used to be and
Emerson's 160 dollars sensing Wi-Fi
programmable thermostat is one of them a
lot of the smart thermostats out there
are really trying to dazzle you with all
these smart features that can actually
overcomplicate your user experience they
can definitely help you heat and cool
your house more smartly but they're not
always that intuitive and and this one
is the opposite of that it isn't the
smartest model we've ever tested it
doesn't have geofencing it doesn't have
a smart algorithm that it learns over
time but it does have a related app and
it's one of the most simple streamlined
apps I've come across in terms of
thermostats so far and if you don't want
to use the related Android or iPhone app
to interact with sense that you can
obviously do it in person one thing
you'll notice is that it doesn't have
the sleek streamlined modern look of
nest or eco veer some of the other smart
thermostats but it's super intuitive the
buttons work really well they're not
sort of weird wonky touchscreen that
doesn't respond when you want it to it
also interacts with Amazon's Alexa
enabled products so if you don't want to
use the app you don't want to control it
in person you can just say Alexa set my
thermostat to 68 degrees and that's a
unique thing for Scentsy because it's
one of the least expensive smart
thermostats that actually does have that
kind of integration Alexa is usually
reserved for no eco Bjorn a store the
other really really high-end models that
cost well over 200 bucks so obviously we
didn't get into the full details of this
thermostat here for that be sure to
check out my full review but overall
sensi is a smart thermostat option
especially if you don't want to spend a
ton</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
