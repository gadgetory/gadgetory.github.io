yet again I'm Bridget Carey and this is
your cnet update hashtags have landed on
Facebook the system of using a hash
symbol before word became popular first
on Twitter as a way to link to other
posts on the same topic and pretty much
every Network has done the same for a
while now-like tumblr pinterest google+
and instagram with facebook finally
joining this trend it means you might
find yourself spending more time on
Facebook as you dig deeper into a
conversation to see what other people
and pages are saying about a topic these
clickable hashtags are just rolling out
to users now on the website but over
time it'll be on mobile and Facebook
will also show trending hashtags 3d TV
continues to fizzle ESPN has confirmed
that it will stop broadcast in its 3d
channel at the end of the year and
instead it's going to focus on new
television technology perhaps like 4k
which is ultra high-definition the news
came as a tweet from an employee who
said it was due to limited viewer
adoption of 3d services to the home ESPN
was a trailblazer into 3d and it
launched the channel in 2010 when the 3d
TV craze was at its peak could your next
living room game system be your iPad
that streams to an Apple TV with the
release of Apple's new mobile operating
system iOS 7 companies now have the
green light to make officially certified
game controllers to work with iOS
devices we've seen companies try to make
game controllers for ipad games before
like the icade which was just pretending
to be a bluetooth keyboard and some of
these only work with a limited number of
games but with Apple allowing game
controller accessories we could see
universal controllers that can easily
work with many games logitech and power
a are two companies making controllers
we just don't know what they would look
like there's yet another version of the
galaxy s4 this one is called the s4
active and it's being sold by AT&amp;amp;T if
you're rough with your smartphone this
might be a good choice since it says its
resistant to dust and doesn't get water
damaged as easily as other phones and
the screen has Gorilla Glass so it's
harder to scratch it goes on sale at 18

total of five types of galaxy s4 models
