first look at the Logitech TK 820
so what Logitech is done here is combine
a trackpad and a keyboard into one
device for Windows 8 users that take
advantage of all the touch gestures you
can do stuff like swiping up and down
with four fingers to maximize windows or
sliding in from the left to get your
charms bar it's a pretty thin keyboard
and it's made of plastic but it really
doesn't feel cheap thanks to this
battery compartment on top you get four
double A batteries inside that power it
and Logitech tells us you can get up to
six months of life out of it and
obviously there's really no way for us
to test that but there's also a power
button on the keyboard itself so you can
save power while you're not using it
since you get a trackpad on the right
instead of a number pad you're also not
going to see the row of keys that
usually sit above the arrows instead the
delete and insert buttons are now at the
top right corner and you can use the
function button to scroll up and down a
page so I spent two weeks using this as
my main keyboard and the slightly
rounded keys actually make for a really
easy typing experience it actually feels
more like a laptop keyboard and you
really shouldn't have too much of a
learning curve the trackpad however
might take some getting used to
it's obviously larger than your laptop's
trackpad so there's really no issue
there but you might need some time to
memorize the 13 microsoft touch
shortcuts and once you're comfortable
with that you probably won't miss your
mouse at all unless you're using
Photoshop or playing a lot of PC games
regardless the option to switch to a
touch pad is really convenient and for
$100 this is a much better deal than
buying the tooth separately you can read
all the details in my full review on
CNET but that's going to do it for me
I'm Justin you you just took a first
look at the logitech TK 820 keyboard and
trackpad thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
