mobile world congress in barcelona we're
going to take a look at Tizen OS a new
operating system backed by Samsung we're
looking at it running on a samsung
prototype device this operating system
wants to go head-to-head with Android so
let's take a look at what the interface
is like all right so this is the home
screen of Tizen bear in mind this is a
very early version of the operating
system so all of this is subject to
change but you can see you have your
apps arranged on the home screen as
opposed to Android there is no normal
home screen that you fill with widgets
and then a separate app tray the app
tray is the home screen if you like so
if I dive into some of these you can see
if I go into my files for example you
can see how the basic layout works so in
the bottom right you have a back button
which is quite similar to how Android
works while over on the left you get
this context sensitive menu which will
display different things depending on
what you're looking at so if I pop into
the camera and have a look there you can
see I've got the options to create
folder for example or hide the file
extensions at the moment we're using a
samsung prototype device but you take a
look on the back you can see the Samsung
branding there but we don't really know
anything about the the hardware of this
device itself and again obviously it's
not final if you press the home button
currently that takes you back to the
home screen now if you swipe down from
the top that brings you a notifications
page it's a little bit slow again this
is still early stuff so this is a this
is quite different from the way Android
works because instead of sweeping down
over the top of the screen it pushes
apps out of the way but on this
notification screen you do have an
impressive number of options so I like
that you can turn the brightness up or
down very conveniently and
it's got a battery indicator there as
well there's also a shortcut to the
settings menu in the top right corner if
we go into the settings you can see the
version that we're using the model is
just called reference device in the
version is Tizen 2 point 0 point 0 one
thing I do like about this settings menu
that I think is possibly a little neater
than Android is that at the bottom
there's a frequently used button so if
you tap this you will see the settings
that you most often go to so things like
Wi-Fi or location that is quite a good
idea because I for one I'm always
fiddling around in settings menus trying
to find the thing that I want from a
long list so it's quite handy to be able
to quickly jump to the things that I'm
usually looking for let's take a look at
the camera as you can see on screen here
it says if you tap and hold the camera
button then you can take a burst shot so
if i press like that it's taking some
bird shots along the bottom there that
is quite a lot I think that was 20
photos in roughly a second and now it's
processing all of them if you tap on the
bottom e you get more options such as
some editing you can crop rotate left
and right set a slideshow you can see
the details which is quite in-depth as
you can see things like the ISO and
exposure time and you can also add tags
which should help you organize your
photos more camera options in the top
right you've got settings for the flash
and in the top left you've got general
camera settings this is the phone app no
real surprises here it's very similar to
what you would get an android keep as
contacts key logs jumping out of that
and into the browser typing on the phone
feels quite comfortable this on-screen
keyboard will be very familiar to anyone
who has used android or even the iphone
no real surprises there obviously this
is all prototype but the browser does
feel quite slick zooming in and out
seems very smooth so that is promising
we're in the gallery now something
that's a little unusual is if you tap an
image you zoom in using this slider on
the bottom if I try and pinch to zoom
you can't do that double tapping doesn't
do anything either you can scroll around
the image but if you want to zoom in and
out of it you have to use this bar so
obviously very rough around the edges
quite far from being finished but it
seems like Tizen has a couple of good
ideas that I'm interested in seeing more
of will it be enough day to take on the
likes of Android i'm not sure i'm luke
westaway for cnet and that was a quick
look at Tizen OS</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
