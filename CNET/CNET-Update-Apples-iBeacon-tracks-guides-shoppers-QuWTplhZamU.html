tracking you I'm Bridget Carey and this
is your cnet update Apple stores are
using new technology to track customers
and send messages to their iPhones when
they walk to different areas of the
store so as an example if you're
standing near a display of iPads you may
get a popup on your iPhone to learn more
about iPads it's all part of iOS 7's
ibeacon technology but for it to send
messages to an iphone the user needs to
have bluetooth turned on and allow for
location to be tracked with ibeacon and
they also need to be using the
businesses app in this case the apple
store app this year several places are
looking into how they can use ibeacons
to communicate with their nearby
customers Apple installed ibeacons at
all of its stores across the u.s. but
Major League Baseball showed off a demo
of how it will use ibeacon technology
next year to communicate with fans as
they walk throughout the stadiums
sending alerts to iphones with coupons
for hot dogs or details about nearby
points of interest for baseball you need
to have the at the ballpark app to see
the messages some department stores like
Macy's are looking into ibeacons that
communicate with the app shopkick so

to accurately spill the beans on
upcoming tech products razor makes
