the next generation of beats
best-selling Bluetooth sports headphone
which looks a lot like its predecessor
but does have some small but important
changes each says slightly altered the
design in an effort to improve the fit
of the headphones and allow more people
to get a tight seal this new model did
fit me a little better but I still
couldn't get a tight seal from one of
the four included tips so I tried a few
I had lying around from other headphones
and ended up with a foam comply tip that
worked for me it's important to get a
snug seal because if you do this is one
of the better sounding Bluetooth sports
headphones out there with good detail
strong bass and pretty open sound
however if you don't it will sound thin
and mediocre and you will be
disappointed particularly since this
headphone costs $200 as for other
changes you get a new protective
carrying case which I liked and the
remote top inline remote has been
redesigned and the buttons are more
responsive on the inside the headphones
equipped with Apple's new w1 custom
Bluetooth chip while the headphone works
just fine with Android and other
Bluetooth enabled audio devices the w1
chip makes pairing automatic with Apple
devices and the battery life is improved
it's up from about eight hours to about
twelve hours also with beats fast fuel
feature a five minute charge gives you 1
hour of playback
I prefer beats cable management system
to Jaybirds
and it's easy to adjust the cable and
cinch it around the back of your head
for a tighter fit if you want it that
way
unlike Beats new beats X headphones this
model charges via microUSB not lightning
and I think some people will prefer the
beats X which is coming soon and cost 50
dollars less there's also plenty of
competition from the likes of j-bird and
Bose all those new models make this a
tougher sell at $200 and yes it is
overpriced but at least it is improved
