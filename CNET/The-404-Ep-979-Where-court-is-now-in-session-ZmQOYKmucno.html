it's Wednesday January 25th 2012 you've
done the right thing tuning into the 404
show on Sina TV I'm Jeff Bakalar I'm
Wilson tang and I'm Justin you and this
is the show where Court is now in
session tis the Honorable tackle our
guys are there is no honor do you really
want Jeff to be a judge I don't even
listen so the thing with judges that
they have to be in differently like here
every one side I would judge based on
which mode they walked in yeah you know
I went to chill like traffic court this
morning and I know I didn't do that
online yeah I was summoned I had to be
there plus you thought you could take
down the price of the ticket which is
but no I took down the points I was able
to do that which the big did you do that
just lied no no it's very uh it's it's
just that it's a racket they got going
on there yeah you can pay your way out
of anything you want if the price is
right right by me that that makes sense
though you're paying more up front
instead of paying more later no it's are
hanging more well no I don't even know
if what my ticket would have motive
given me or a higher insurance rate but
regardless you know some of these people
that walk into this courtroom yeah just
like no one told them like dude don't
wear a baseball hat okay don't do that
because if I'm I'm just this is free
advice I'm no lawyer I know like scholar
in the legal system yeah but maybe you
don't you know you know like a SAG your
jeans down to your frickin ankles ocurro
sweater over the wife beater yeah maybe
those and maybe you don't wear like you
know all these chains in paraphernalia
that are intimidating tape off the judge
those cuz i think there's this one guy
there who is a let you know you sit in
the core when you wait for your turn and
this guy had all these terrible charges
like you know driving a license Oh
container droolin a few drug things any
like goes up and he's like wearing a hat
backwards like why would the judge look
at you and be like you look like a model
citizen yeah clearly learned from his
mistakes yeah pew I it's just don't get
it I'm sorry how long did it take for
you is it was like in and out canal it
was about two and a half three hours Zoe
I me in front of a judge oh that was 40
seconds before we both knew is his
business as usual there's a little back
and forth we had going on but he's a p.i
just like we're here I'll say my knee I
wasn't i didn't say sorry what is that
you don't see the things I've ever heard
anyone know because they screw it up
hello mr. gbagbo goggle oh hahaha goggle
eyes put a G in there yeah and I was
like no judge its back a lawyer secre
I'm sorry I go it doesn't I'm like none
of it let's just get this over here's my
credit card charge what you want I'll be
on my merry way you know uh Jeff you
emailed me and Wilson to remind us that
you were gonna be in court for your
traffic ticket I forgot that you had
gotten that traffic ticket I thought you
were going to court to face the judge
about you beating up John Kerry had a
haha wait what yes did I saw the State
of the Union yesterday right so John
Kerry was there did you see his two
black eyes nanana yeah okay well he got
into a fistfight look at this picture no
way oh no my bud ice cream if you also
have ever scream during it looks like
Herman monster came back from the dead
freaking terrifying I wish there are
more photos um what happened to him he
was in a hockey something happened
during a hockey game and they're not a
lot anything about it but I looked it up
not the end no he doesn't play the
anybody good he doesn't you know this I
thought maybe he was at an NHL game he
said the wrong thing to somebody Jionni
he was laying a hockey game somehow got
two black eyes I mean I don't play the
game oh yeah well I was planning on
playing ah yeah that's pretty cool yeah
and uh oh you had a broken nose you can
see the bridges all bruised up not to
mention those two giant black eye well
when you're that I demolish when you're
that age your your your bruises show
yeah
what was that a fight you might
know it didn't say i don't know maybe
the hockey puck was the size of a
basketball or something for me i I don't
know me doesn't he just ate ate it yeah
fell or something I don't know you get
two black guys from adventure house I
don't know like he's got you it's either
play height right I don't know what the
circuit if he's playing street hockey
the other helmet may be gained in the
face it was bad I'm just saying like if
you found my back for this dude though
right little serious not battle smaller
I just mentioned like imagine John Kerry
like throwing down like pulling off the
face man like throwing his clothes down
just to be like this isn't the first
time confidus the cuffs yeah he's like
pulling John Boehner shirt over his head
there are the gloves down Dawson what
now what now who's and who says hockey
isn't an American sport it's classic I'm
I want to resend that like it would I
mean to be that he might have deserved
it who really knew I said you like maybe
maybe some slamming people into the wall
is that a minute boards with there's no
walls and all four I don't know I don't
know it may Jesus you're right let's get
back to the State of the Union though g
wilson i know you watched a lot i watch
the yeah would you think I result big
focus on technology this year right he
was talking about how he wanted to train
uh there's a Steve Jobs right more
Americans and technology yeah and then
they talked a lot about clean energy uh
I don't know is actually I more paid
attention to like to Twitter response it
was kind of crazy like you know Brock
would say something and immediately like
three seconds later I would see like
somebody we quote or retweeted
immediately on Twitter so that was it
was kind of surreal I was just like we
really got to that age or people just
stop watching this is like tweeting
whatever goes into their there's right
so that was kind of interesting but
beyond that um yes it was very
technology heavy and that like this is
what we should be doing right like this
is a week we need to create more
manufacturing jobs we need to be
reinvesting in technology right helping
people go to school for that that I that
I can definitely appreciate via that I
think that supersede politics in there
it's just smart I talk about education
at all he talked a lot about you know
just reeducation
industry's changed and you know factors
have moved of people can't do the same
job that they were doing 20 years ago or
even five years ago so we need to have
programs to train people to encourage
people to enter in different parts of
the work right he was also talking about
education in high school and saying that
no high schoolers should be able to drop
out and he's gonna propose no high
schools will drop out of school before
they turn 18 or or maybe they you should
have to pass this test well there's
already attacks I know the eggs right so
if you wanna drop it take the g right i
mean that's equal to gain high school
diploma yet that's exactly what he say
more eliminate that he know well right
now in in a lot of states yeah you can
drop out of high school I think it
depending on safer anywhere between the
age of 15 16 you could all you have to
do is get your parents sign off on yeah
I you go to jail any of your parents
sign off on that usually like to go
Jared yet we have to pay some ridiculous
something ridiculous yeah like fit like
a great your kid doesn't get a high
school diploma like what you know what
burden yet but right mine was like okay
Billy no problem yeah we're not ever
going back to high school you know a lot
of parents have kids that work full-time
in order to support their uh their
family better 14 yeah yeah you what your
mind that that price by the but I am
surprised by four full-time working yeah
absolutely and the unfortunate thing is
a lot of those kids end up being uh you
know illegal immigrants or they've you
know they're there they weren't born
here they don't have status or a
difficult for them to either get into a
school or yet they have to work because
that's the only way their family's gonna
get uh gonna be I'll feed them some so
it's just a really unfortunate situation
around but yeah I think that's great
policy to say like hey you live in
America you've been given this chance um
you have to take advantage right like
you have to be in school either get a
high school diploma GED or at least just
be there until the age of 18 right right
well another thing that's really
surprised me i heard twitter gasp when
he was yesterday obama's like uh made a
terrible milk joe he did make like one
really bad really awful show made a mill
like literally about a milk spilling
incident yeah apparently milk was
classified as like a oil or something
with then he made a awful literally like
when congress itself you can hear the
roles
like it's gotta be an awful job they cut
to a shot of a michelle obama after he
made that joke and even she was just
like all bad total fat joke thanks Liz
exactly was a stepdad yeah yeah like God
pretty bad uncle won't shut up is also
like it's not right when other countries
are able to pirate our music movies and
media and I feel like a lot of people on
Twitter were wondering if that was a
sope reference of prep if Obama was
gonna maybe flip flop on I know I was in
here on Monday when I you guys talked
about it but megavideo megaupload going
down you know I think a lot of people
like okay yeah that site the vast
majority of all the traffic in what
people using it for what's right
pirating I don't know the vast majority
I don't say you know what I think I'll
ever release the members you don't know
I don't know use best majority to me is
ninety percent you made you medicine the
vast majority of everyone that we know
that uses megaupload yeah yeah yeahs use
it may be the best people that you and I
i I've yet I have yet to see personally
I use made it link I am and I've ever
seen like on mega right that's just me
yeah I've used it for legitimate
purposes so via legitimate but the point
is um i think that the it's the fallout
from that um we're all these other sites
that were you know it either in similar
industries are related to like let's
just say pirated video right like a lot
of My Lai friends or like not too
particular like why can't I watch the
show online anymore it's out on SideReel
anymore right well here's another
handful of websites that do the exact
same yeah based in the US yeah yeah you
know it's just a lot of this stuff and I
and I the the radio hits I do every week
yesterday they everyone's like what's YY
sopa what is it it's just like you know
the the thing I try and break it down
the way I try and break it down is just
you know try you know how it's like this
zero tolerance policy which was a most
terrifying element of the entire
initiative as far as I'm concerned yeah
um and what you like are able to get
that point across people sort of get it
they're like oh that makes sense why
would we do why would we have
zero tolerance or anything like that
well I think it depends on who you're
talking to well tolerant I was talking
to a fox news radio station and they got
so come is it was okay was a good time
with in this country were zero
tolerances you know paraded in ya know I
know it's a dangerous two words back to
back um let's get into a couple maybe
headlines here before we hit our first
break ready or not guess what Facebook's
timeline is coming to your profile
whether or not you freakin wanna have
you enabled this I had not did you just
know and and Wilson you definitely I
tried it and then I found out of the
things right and then because I thought
that hey I could go back and apparently
can't you enable it well this is good
that I'm glad that happened because now
you can give us a review on what we
should look out for when we install okay
that I I think from like a user point of
view I I do I prefer the older boys just
because it's the thing that I hate the
most is having a look on two sides of
the screen yeah yeah it feels like
reading a comic book I don't know when
the dates lineup hey that sounds really
Tricia to be vertical maybe mark
zuckerberg too young to remember but his
website is starting to look a lot like
other sides that aren't around anymore
you gotta be careful brother are you
talking with my spam just talking about
the collective crap that we've all dealt
with writing Internet well Wilson you
talk about this all the times like the
your natural inclination is to read from
left to right then up to date yeah and
also to you fought you've been trained
all of your life to do things like
follow-up margin yeah and to have the
margin flip back and forth like they
usually it is a 'ok I'd I can't describe
what I don't I don't like that big photo
you put the photo I could tell like that
for there but it's just like a
surprising the whole thing in and I
thought the whole idea about Facebook
was like no we're not gonna let you you
know put all this garbage on your page
yeah well I don't I think that that is
one of personally one of the
improvements cuz it's another it's a is
a genuinely creative outlet I've seen
some really cool pages you know people
put some inventive things behind sure um
those are those are kind of nice when
you give that freedom to everybody is a
lot of other crap is gonna but the
somebody's gonna put up something
grossly offensive that's
don't answer that uh what I wanted to
talk about was the timeline is there a
way that you can just disable that all
together no there's no way you can
disallow other people from viewing your
timeline not as this week really yeah
like once they enable it uh that's
pretty much what every Facebook page
will look like no but I'm talking about
the actual timeline on the right panel
of your own the right panel yeah exactly
what this is what I'm talking about here
where displays every year that you've
been on facebook if you click on one of
those it shows all of your activity I'm
wondering if there's a way that you
carry customizing it so that people can
only see parts of your timeline that
goes back to the fundamental problem
that Facebook's always have it's like
how do you can howdy why do you you want
to spend all the time filtering out your
timeline right you've built over for
most people anywhere between five to ten
years facebook for certain groups of
people right right i I wish there was a
way for me to find out whether or not
what I'm doing on Facebook my activity
is even worth me being there we're I
mean I just I don't know why you see
like the dollar sign that yeah i really
want like an actual monetary you know a
song that i just show somewhere at
facebook there might be something
similar because i don't know man the
more and more this thing evolves the the
less I like it well yeah one thing that
we sort of we missed or we didn't get to
talk about last week was that Facebook
actually rolled out a bunch of new verbs
thing with small up talk about the apps
the Open Graph yes that was your friend
yeah so they they're referring to them
as verbs I apps that integrate into the
verbs verbs so you know before uh you
could poke someone before you could like
something right uh and then you know
Facebook would tell you if you were
listening to something right well
Facebook rolled out 60 new app partners
that integrate into the timeline and
they're gonna have similar verb action
so I ate you know x y&amp;amp;z meal you know I
thought people are were concerned about
this flooding their news feeds but I was
doing some research this morning and it
said that those graphic tivities those
open graph activities um won't actually
show up in your news feed those are only
in the timeline so you have to click on
that
nordost even cut it's not gonna clog up
your feet still pretty annoying yeah
yeah have you guys tested out the new
listen to feature where you can listen
with others in right yeah it's like the
turntable about FM I haven't tried that
I saw the news a piece about social
listening on face of you but it's not
convenient you know it's not like it
when you go to a site like turntable or
one of the competitors like you go there
with the intent of okay I'm gonna listen
to this like on facebook it's almost one
of those things where it's like oh you
happen to see someone listen to this one
song the right and alike right let me
listen to them we don't think it's meant
for extended listening and it's one of
those things that you know actually
Google+ does really well but hangouts
you know there's like designated areas
where you can go to if you want to
interact with a group of people right
but I think it's one of those things
that Facebook does kind of poorly is
like have an area are you know a
designated area on the page where you
know you're interacting with people
almost every part of the page right now
is is almost information overload yeah
no one add to that point you know I
really really love to see in the next
version of Facebook is a way to search
your friend status updates gosh darn it
now you know sometimes you be browsing
through ice book on your phone and
you'll see some like headline anybody
posted to a link right and uh you know
like your kind of glaze over it and then
later you want to come back and read it
again but you forget who posted it okay
does that ever happen to you if no but I
can appreciate your desire yeah it'd be
great if I could just search for that be
like oh here's that link again when I'm
positive it's browsing history I I
almost think that that so that's the
kruky part about facebook is you know
Google's stated mission is to organize
and collect all the world's information
that's that's creepy but at least they
outright go and say they were they were
on the sleeves and so when you use a
Google product you know they're gonna be
you know some algorithms reading your
email that happened to me the other day
so i use google maps and i guess i was
signed in these google maps to locate a
friend's apartment um because i needed
to get there so i looked up directions
yeah and then yesterday i was on
facebook and it had a recommended link
to open houses in that area in downtown
Brooklyn where I was trying to get to
interesting but how did it know that one
well I mean oh yeah like g gmail google
is is reading quote unquote like there's
an
rhythm reading your email that you
understand the thing with Facebook is it
like there's no warning like that ya
know everything you do on Facebook
whether you realize or not facebook is
trying to sell to somebody right that is
their business model they're watching
you they're learning what your habits
are exactly 21 day kill you wanna know
so i don't think the ultimate and yeah
maybe losing money yeah they don't want
they want actually keep you healthy I'm
surprised facebook has and you know
worked out some sort of dietary program
some sort of health care you're right
you'd you get facebook health care yeah
yeah they know everything about I want
you alive that's the only good thing
about our world is that the look it's in
their best interest to keep you alive
have you ever told somebody about the
whole open graph stuff on on facebook
oye like how my next novel yeah they
freaked out people don't realize that
Google and Facebook talk to each other
and use each other's services what they
know oh it's it's totally feel like I
literally remember you know like I was
sitting at a bar with a friend and oh he
works at cnet like all what do you do
and I'm like all talk about Google and
Facebook and like all that must be so
much fun I'm like no it's actually kind
of scary if you really think about it I
wake up every night adults what well I
mean like in then you explain to them oh
they're reading all this information
about you neglecting all the stuff they
yell at you get out of my head you know
I wish if there's one thing and I know
Facebook does this where they they give
you the option to see what your profile
looks to other yes looks like to other
people it's not good enough I want a
mode that I can click on that just says
every last thing I'm spitting out that
Facebook's spinning out okay I mean I
want to know every last it's an open
graph thing if it's some at something
else I want to know cuz I'm sick of it
doing stuff and not telling me I want
like a graph you know that shows exactly
where by information is like where why
and why and why is it there or it should
do it on other sites too we're facebook
yeah also locating you guys the filling
up addresses it should say hey we're
gonna use this information and show
average I've got no problem with the
level of intimacy Facebook would like
with room with me I understand they
really want everything but I want to
also have that information right up
there up for
that's going to be intimate let's get
sexy with Facebook as a customer my
policies but do you understand what I'm
saying I get and you and I would
appreciate that horse it's bottle
challenges will risk total transparency
transparency now that's the that's the
fighting Qalandia in the chat room is
like oh you mean an infographic me
understand information yeah no not it is
bro I'm not a normal graph I could use
school but they could display it in the
form of an infographic and I would be
digested I will take a break when we
come back more 40 for some voicemails
and all the good stuff we do on our show
stick around this is the 404 emer effers
the show where we all sing songs how did
you get started with a honey badger well
it was my assistant showed me the
original honey badger video uh-huh and I
was just like the narration is so
mundane and so stupid it's time to like
this animal is eating Cobras demolishing
animals in this narrator which is so
boring I say you know what we have to
spy some things up a bit so you know
I've always had a natural talent for
doing narration I figured what better
and we'll start with in the honey badger
seriously so why the honey badger
you know I think causing today's society
it's an animal that a lot of people I
feel can relate to I think a lot of
people are fed up I think a lot of
people want to be able to take what they
want and I believe firmly and Harvey can
tell you this i bet you harm people
would be the first one to tell you this
everyone inside of them has an inner
honey badger just waiting to get out
they don't care they want to take what
they want and now it's time to do it
it was hungry log back to the 404 show
uh z getting the internet scoot it was
crazy last video of of the his name's
Randall name is Randall that it releases
last name but he's the voice of the
honey badger in that youtube video that
thing's been everywhere it has I mean
it's been out for now what the honey
badger yeah a year oh yeah God dude
you're the curator of all things new
video you should know that but I only
keep track of them when they first come
out he's in the that pistachio
commercial use yeah yeah I don't care
look at though he looks creepy the best
part about all that yeah he does we're
looking dude the best part of that you
know I just in that my idea where I like
believe that you're a wig well he's
clearly trying to cover up his face so
that nobody knows who he is I would
imagine that's a real money thing
something like he's not a real buzz
that's a real mustache though yeah I
think everything a Ron Burgundy like
kind of a look it's a joke look at that
hair I it almost looks too good to be
true yeah anyway those are wearing a
turtleneck with a blazer in LA iid I
really do think though that honey bed
that's one of the funniest videos I've
seen on the internet pretty read and
that's a great video because it doesn't
matter who you show that video to
everyone find something funny about it
yes you know even my you know sweet lose
I'm like this is great is amazing of the
honey bed yeah everyone we get that guy
in a studio that would be great I would
love to hear him say you're listening to
the 40 I don't get hungry Greek well I
mean that's actually a really good
example to going back to what we're
talking about earlier about the sofa
thing that wouldn't exist if if so brass
right the debt that should have been the
whole campaign just a honey bunny guys
like a day money back haha this is a
world in this world inside the world
there are no honey bag true it's
provided me a lot of entertainment think
about what the kind of success this guy
I guess success is a and I mean I hated
that he got the the pistachio commercial
you know I'm sure they probably had a
pain that geo off for that too
but either way it created a semi
celebrity web star and uh you know good
memory more power to him yeah you know
how he's got the whole line of t-shirts
now people named hockey teams a pretty
great is that what you wanted me I do
still want to do uh my hockey i also
want to do now you wanna hear the new
one you gotta like this cuz you're we
talked about this there in the Yuletide
wanna call the team Great Scott Great
Scott and have locks capacitor on the
front like how emma brown with a great
starting down I can you know all your
teams like an expression yeah what no I
don't like that really know why I
feeling honey badgers works yeah no but
that's old man i know a lot back the
futures not all that that's that's way
over to the honey no but i'm saying it
even the flux capacitors rebirth in that
yeah all right I mean I delorean I don't
know I got a drawing board hahahahaha
let's hear what that would be cool great
Great Scott it would have been shut up
how about no shut up I was like name the
team the cools awesome just know you
better than that Wilson shut up my heart
too sure about like a hill valley with
something or other like the hill then go
back to the future reference a few guys
oh if you guys so hard Paul's time to
show the love a jig 6404 scenic camera
you're not gonna go away all right the
great Scots good no no no not really
good idea for a hockey not poor eyes and
that you're so clever you're not plural
izing that you're just saying uh great
great team does that mean so it's great
that's called Top Gun right that's how's
that work I don't know about stupid
right yeah the top guns now I'm not
plural izing what I like the best why
does a lot of teams aren't pluralized
you realize the heat right Miami Heat
they're just a freaking feeling but you
wouldn't say he this is a temperature
right I know heat is its own plural
right I get it yeah anyway haha like an
animal I'm not having new to guys tell
me what Ronnie's not feeling it either
man they can go to hell two eyes shut up
all of you the sheriff says the McFly's
dad I'll be good make fries see it's a
freaking work in progress back and forth
much better than oh don't you tell me
about your stupid hockey team I didn't

right well I heard that outgoing message
still gonna go ahead and my own message
because maybe they changed this is one
you know I mean she only hears a lot of
joke voicemails so maybe she thought
ours were you getting I'm just trying to
look into the mind of Daisy will she

she's like this isn't it yeah mmm good
smooth move lady man what's up with that
get it all right Mexico what's happening
for four guys it will hear from Rhode
Island and I was on a listen to your
show and you're talking about meses IDs
I profile back I didn't know how to
password on my SSID so i changed my past
i change my ecstasy yeah SSID to i log
your passwords never anyone connect
again internet precious little way
that's a that's funny so he changes as a
SSID to i love your password or i could
you could change it to free public Wi-Fi
you know that works whenever they all
trick when you have those nokia phones
cell phones i would always put like
battery low or like no signal matter
it's pretty fun you know yeah why not
that's really somebody send in a image
or something yeah we talked about that
what you guys really left those when you
left the show early we covered that left
the show yeah really arm so if you still
have a really funny SSID take a screen
grab and send it to us because these are
I don't know why I just find this very
funny yes you know it's just like a
weird sort of uh on police' Bowl
situation where it's like right I'm just
broadcasting a phrase that I radio and I
look on my you know available networks
when if there's literally 40 networks in
my area started work I'm not getting any
kind of wave radiation is I know they
give off a little bit but like I me
unless you sleep next to your Wi-Fi
router I I wouldn't really works under
my bed of course there's mad why would I
do that I'll look you know I and also
like this is super nerdy too but I feel
like there are I've seen some very
comical router locations like where
people decide to put them I've seen ones
in bathrooms
oh no way yeah so that's a matter of
where the guy understand what the guy
wouldn't put it in the back and they
leave you a little bit like you they
give you some slack you know so if you
have a funny story but that our photo
please share with us you know is also
thing like it's a really great way to
just offend someone or to just call
someone out like constantly you know
like with your SSID like if you really
hate if you acknowledge well the thing I
they hated someone just like changer
SSID to ba ba ba is smell yeah yeah you
that was the story we're talking about
this guy hurt kept hearing his neighbors
having sex and he wrote a we can hear
you yeah it is this is ID but what if
you like really just call one out for
you know just like be federally gee I
know you're still right now are like I
know what you did a one you know yeah
yeah attention apartment I'm not behind
you yeah when you smell that yeah you
know something that uh here's a call
very positive talking about the hour is
it is like that's so weird our tech
prowess and stuff like that uh let's
listen to this yeah Jeff you're going to
be on tech news today I hear that's
pretty good considering III guys are
supposed to be now the tech people at
seen that and you couldn't even figure
out what that Samsung machine was at CES
and Wilson which is supposed to be the
big tech person right you be decorator
and out so I'm glad you find this funny
sir do some little bit of studying
before you get our tech news today
because if not you know Wilson could
handle you know with all right you know
what's funny those that we get so many
voicemails from this same guy none of
them are positive the degree of venom in
his voice I mean like some people will
call but criticizes a joking way like
you guys have no idea which Otago's goes
because they can tell that we don't take
ourselves seriously either but this guy
is so serious he's like our hundred for
us but he keeps listening yeah that's
why he's my favorite college hi guy had
clear and cut definitive proof that good
yeah
but I will continue to listen I love so
much guys like something keeps them
coming back it's like that inner child
in him that it slightly loves the
bloodlust it's great it's like will say
like oh it has four gigs know it is six
gigs around whatever it doesn't matter
yeah I get like a very specific like
girlfriend's father feeling from him
haha cuz I know that he hates us but he
can't get away he's tethered regardless
of how he feels yeah but have you gone
back to his point how do you feel about
being on tech news today that yes like
hardware do why are you there all I mean
cuz Jason housing friend of mine I was
like he asked me if I want to do and I'm
like dude of course love you you huge
man you that and uh yeah so we talk at

like watch the show and I just want
people like fine choice moments of like
it Jeff reacting to yeah what they're
saying yeah I'm I don't just like this
is the kind of show that like you would
very much geek out about right to a

always be funny just watch you don't
know what to say just james how is your
mama baby thing Jason and Tom they know

little more hate well you know more how
you bring that to anyone you don't call
it hate call it taste you and that
collar should get together have a hater
