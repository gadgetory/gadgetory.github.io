Dre ain't the only one who could be
sly with marketing I'm Bridget Carey and
this is your cnet update digg has been
reborn it's been six weeks since beta
works bought up the news aggregation
site and it's pushed out a simple page
to highlight top stories and popular
stories you can also save articles to
read later on the new digg iphone app
but you'll have to log in with a
facebook account to do that there's been
some criticism from digg fans about how
the archives are gone but beta quirk
says this is just the first version of
the redesign it'll be continuing to roll
out new features over the next few
months including comments so you
remember this fella it's google's media
streaming device $300 Nexus Q after
tepid reviews google announced that it's
taking this back to development to add
more features because one of the biggest
gripes is that for 300 bucks it really
didn't have any features anyone who
pre-ordered this gets the model for free
though great for your Olympic shoplet
practice the Olympics have strict
marketing rules but the sneaky folks at
Beats Audio just happened to find a way
to give brand exposure without paying
the big sponsorship bucks if you've been
seeing athletes wearing monster
headphones before matches well that's
because Beats Audio just happened to
bump into athletes and hand them
headsets Amazon's getting more
competitive with Netflix now amazon
instant video is available to view as an
ipad app you don't have to be a prime
member to purchase or rent any of the
videos available but prime subscribers
do get the bonus of being able to stream
some titles for free Verizon Wireless
will no longer charge customers on ter
data plans who use third-party tethering
apps from a smartphone it's part of a
deal it struck with the FCC over how
spectrum can be used so what does it all
mean to you well if you have the new
sharing plan nothing changed tethering
is already included if you have an old
tier data plan and you were paying that
$20 tethering fee for a mobile broadband
connect well you need to be proactive
and cancel that plan you won't be hit
with a penalty fee but they'll keep
charging you unless you cancel if the
Olympics are taking up all your time at
work there's a tool to help you find
relief the browser add-on called
Olympics will block out a limb
key words from any page as you pull up
but if you're trying to keep yourself in
suspense for the NBC primetime tape
delay don't count on this to help you
avoid spoilers you can still see some
images it'll still show big names like
Michael Phelps so it's not perfect and
you can't block breaking news alerts in
your email and you'll still get smart
phone push notifications so resistance
to Olympic news is futile that's your
tech news update for today for more on
the stories mentioned in today's show
you can head on over to cnet com /
update from our studios in New York I'm
