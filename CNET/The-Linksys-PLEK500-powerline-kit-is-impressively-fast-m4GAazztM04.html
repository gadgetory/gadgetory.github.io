blow you away still there no not like
that but with this the all new links is
powerline home plug a V to one port
gigabit ethernet adapter kick oh it's a
kid because there are two adapter in
this case two identical adapter right
here now if you notice the adapter here
come with one network port the idea is
that instead of having to run a very
long network cable from one room to
another you use two of these and two
shorter cable which also come in a box
right here to create a Y connection
between the two room smart isn't it
that's right powerline networking means
that you use the powerline the light
that carries power to different outlet
in different rooms as network cable and
saving you from having to actually run
the cable itself so what's so special
about this kid well is very fast it's a
first kid that supported the new home
plug AV to desire to offer gigabit class
performance the kiddies said that's not
supporting gigabit yet only 500 megabits
per second but in my testing is offered
by far the fastest sustained real-world
performance about three times that of a
regular Ethernet connection that is
really impressive now the adapter comes
in the usual snap-on design but note it
has a three prong connector which is
different from other adapter which come
with only a two prong unless I hear
there's a secure button that helped
create secure connection between
earrings now that's very important
feature for those living apartment
building because otherwise those living
in different household from yours can
tap in your network by using their own
Apter on top here there are three usual
led status lights and one thing very
interesting that is the Cisco logo
interesting because Linksys is no longer
a cisco company it was bought by Belkin
back in March so we've seen that some
love lost between these companies love
are not is money that's important and
the question is how must that is cost
well it's not exactly cheap but it's not
expensive either cost
having $20 for the kid for this
performance though I do believe that is
totally worth it
the kid is also very easy to use it took
me just less than a minute to set it up
so for you you probably use at most 15
minutes for more information on this key
check out the full review SL calm and
then do not forget to tell me how
impressed you are via Twitter Facebook
or Google+
follow me anyway even if you're not
impressed at all because eventually I
will impress you big soon and that's
because I'm don't know and this has been
the first look not first look not the
full review at the link C's home plug AV
