for Apple's newest products let's get
right to the core of this week's Apple
news and rumors we begin our show with a
little product that hasn't gotten much
airtime this year but could soon be
getting its chance to shine
the air pods those tiny wireless earbuds
that we or at least I love to make fun
of when Apple first announced them about
two years ago and apparently now have
become a cultural phenomenon seriously I
am seeing these things everywhere in
fact they just shot to the top of Best
Buy's bestseller list for the month of
October this according to a report by
think gnam now the irony is that the
other product in this bestseller list is
that lightning to headphone adapter now
the latest leaks suggest we could see a
sequel very soon according to my smart
price Apple has just received a
mandatory certification from the
Bluetooth special interest group or cig
this is needed for any Bluetooth product
to exist now this would pretty much
confirms that there's a sequel in the
works so the question then becomes when
are we gonna see the sequel and what new
features will it bring so let's start
with that last one because we think we
know a lot about what the new air pods
would bring and it would be pretty much
a given based on the filing that they
would have bluetooth 5.0 which would
allow for longer range more reliability
and better battery life for the air pods
the other feature that Apple has pretty
much confirmed with its promotional
video of the air power mat is that they
will include a wireless charging case
other features could include hands-free
Siri waterproofing better noise
cancellation and maybe a matte black
version that would look sleek but
according to the filing there wasn't
just one but two models that were
approved so what would that second one
include we've also been hearing about
health features coming to the airport's
becoming gear bowls this can include a
heartrate monitor like what you find on
the Apple watch but in fact it might
even be more reliable in the ear than on
the wrists along with maybe other
biometric data that could work alongside
the Apple watch
now the other rumor about these other
ear pods is that they
could be over the ear kind of like the
beats and now the question about when so
the fact that they've received the
certification means it could be very
soon and while they did miss out on the
chance to launch them on the October
event they could still choose to release
them before the holiday shopping spree
but my money is on early 2019 maybe in a
spring event like what they did with the
new iPads or at the very latest by WWDC
I really don't think they would delay
them until a September iPhone launch
because in the meantime their
competitors have already started to
catch up nokia has launched a 79 version
of the air pods while Xiaomi just
launched a $30 version both with
bluetooth 5.0 plus they need to deliver
for all those people mourning the loss
of the headphone jack on the new iPads
and speaking of iPads the reviews are in
for Apple's latest batch of products
including those two new ipad pro's
netbook air and Mac Mini and as to be
expected it's kind of a mixed bag Apple
has obviously chosen to feature the
glowing reviews on its site but in terms
of the iPad pro at least according to
our own reviewer Scott Stein it is a
powerful and sleek new device but it's
not quite ready to replace a laptop now
in terms of the MacBook Air it has all
the updates that everybody wanted in
that thin little laptop but according to
our own Dan Ackerman it's also nothing
new really and it's Apple kind of plain
catch up to where laptops are in 2018
now with the Mac Mini it seems like the
new higher price is actually justified
based on all the things that this little
machine can do the higher price on the
other products though still on the
chopping block these new products hit
stores this week with users getting them
starting Wednesday and so far the iPads
are showing the longest delays with
expected arrival times of late November
into early December then the MacBook Air
and then that Mac Mini which is still on
track for a speedy delivery but to me
the best thing about these new products
is that they make last year's models
even cheaper and the Black Friday deals
have already started
meanwhile rumor has it the iPhone 10r
isn't selling out like hotcakes as many
including Apple expected now according
to a report in Japanese site Nikkei
Foxconn Apple's manufacture has only
been using 45 of the 60 assembly lines
it had prepared to produce the 10r
according to the same report that would
translate into about a hundred thousand
fewer devices Pegatron Apple's other
manufacturer is cited as having similar
issues as well but that doesn't mean
Apple won't sell iPhones this holiday
season by any means because the iPhone 8
and 8 plus seem to be in high demand
Nikkei also notes that Apple has ordered
more of these devices to be made to keep
up with demand
so either users still want that home
button or they're not willing to spend
as much on an iPhone eight costs a
hundred and fifty dollars less than the
10r and $400 less than the 10s and in
Apple watch news this week looks like
the bug in watch OS 5.1 that was
freaking some serious for watches has
been fixed as Apple this week released a
5.1.1 version to patch things up
now the original update was going to
bring better emergency response features
to the fall detection on the series 4
but it had to eliminate it almost
immediately following the release after
users were experiencing this problem now
the bad news for users who did report
the problem is that they had to send in
their device and receive a replacement
series 4 from Apple now another Apple
watch news it seems like Spotify could
be coming to a risk near you something
Apple watch users have been begging for
for a very long time now some users has
already started posting pictures of what
this would look like on the watch on
reddit and although not a lot of people
have the beta yet it means that it's
coming that does it first show this week
but I want to know what features you'd
most like to see on those air pod
sequels is it a matte black finish
waterproofing or heartrate leave your
answer on the comment section below or
hit me up on Twitter and come back next
week
or apple core</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
