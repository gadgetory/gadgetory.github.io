the Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy of
California for his statement welcome
well thank you mr. Goodlatte chairman
Goodlatte for working with me to
organize this hearing
I want to thank sundar pichai for
testifying on Capitol Hill we appreciate
a note your willingness to travel here
and answer our questions first in a
private setting in September and now in
a public setting Google is one of the
most valuable companies in America
because of what it does Google search
engine organizes the entire internet and
by extension almost all the information
in the world this is hardly an
exaggeration
here is a statistic you will hear a lot
today but it bears repeating according
to The Wall Street Journal ninety
percent of all internet searches go
through Google that is power and it
comes with responsibility mr. pachai it
is it was necessary to convene this
hearing because of the widening gap of
distrust between technology companies
and the American people for our country
and economy to grow stronger the
American people must be able to have
trust in the great companies of the 21st
century we can alleviate some of their
concerns today with transparency and
candor I hope we can begin to restore
trust in the technology companies that
shape our world but we need answers we
need to know first that Google is
committed to the free market ideals of
competition and entrepreneurship that
launched its revolutionary products to
begin with second we need to be sure
that any political bias within Google's
workforce does not creep into its search
products third we need to know that
Google is living up to the america's
belief in free expression and human
rights when it deals with foreign
governments now a word on the last
subject right now google reportedly is
developing a censored search engine with
the Chinese Communist Party it is also
developing next-generation technology on
Chinese soil and in conjunction with
Chinese national champ
viens liked inson technology that the
MINIX administration considers a
national priority now this news raises a
troubling possibility that Google is
being used to strengthen China's system
of surveillance repression and control
right this very second
China's authoritarian system detains
more than a million religious minorities
and re-education camps mister Pichai I
urge you to reflect on that fact and on
the promise your company made when it
pulled out of the China market in 2010
and I have plotted you for that move in
2010 back then Google promised it would
not censor its search results in China
or compromised its commitment to a free
and open Internet now in light of these
recent events I think the American
people deserve to know is something
changed and if so what all of these
topics competition censorship bias and
others point to one fundamental question
that demands the nation's attention are
America's technology companies serving
as instruments of freedom our
instruments of control are they
fulfilling the promise of the digital
age are they advancing the cause of
self-government or are they serving of
instruments of manipulation used by
powerful interests and foreign
governments to rob the people of their
power agency and dignity I believe we
need to grapple with these questions
together as a nation because the free
world depends on a free internet we need
to know that Google is on the side of
the free world and that it will provide
its services free of anti-competitive
behavior political bias and censorship I
want to thank you again for being here
and answering these questions I look
forward to listening to the answers with
a very open mind and I yield back
I now like to invite mr. pichai to take
his seat at the witness table
without objection
the chair now recognizes the ranking
member mr. Nadler for a point of
personal privilege to recognize a member
of his staff a very distinguished member
of his staff Thank You mr. chairman mr.
chairman I want to take a moment to
recognize Danielle Brown whose last
working day for the committee is
tomorrow danielle has served on the
Judiciary Committee Democratic staff for
more than a decade in a variety of roles
beginning a staff assistant and then
going to council parliamentarian chief
legislative counsel and most recently
deputy chief counsel danielle has been
essential to the operations of this
committee and she has been involved in
nearly every important piece of
committee business over the last decade
her interests and expertise range from
protecting vulnerable immigrants to
ensuring reproductive freedom and
preserving vital consumer protections
she is leaving us now unfortunately to
become general counsel and
parliamentarian of the Ways and Means
Committee our loss is surely their game
I wish you well I appreciate a wise
counsel I thank her for all of her years
of service to this committee and I hope
the committee will join me in thanking
her for her years of service to this
committee would the gentleman yield
I will yield to the Chairman I thank the
gentleman for yielding I would like to
join him in thanking Danielle for her
service to this committee she has worked
with members on both sides of the aisle
she has worked with the majority staff
very productively very cooperatively on
a great many issues that have made this
committee not only more productive but
also operating in a fashion that has
resulted in a number of bills getting
from this committee all the way to the
President's desk whether that president
be Barack Obama or Donald Trump that's
an accomplishment that this entire
committee should be proud of and
Danielle should be proud that she's
played an important part in doing that I
thank you
I now recognize myself for an opening
statement in the United States Google
operates the preeminent internet search
engine the leading email service
provider and the Android operating
system which runs most of its smart most
of the smart phones in the United States
when a consumer performs an internet
search sends an email or uses his or her
smartphone Google collects information
on that person in fact almost every
minute of every day the Android
operating system sends information about
the exact location temperature
barometric pressure and speed of
movement of every phone that runs on the
Android operating system with Americans
carrying their smartphones all day every
day Google is able to collect an amount
of information about its users that
would even make the NSA blush of course
when users click through the Terms of
Service for these services they do
consent to such collection but I think
it is fair to say that most Americans
have no idea the sheer volume of
detailed information that is collected
today I hope to get answers on the
extent of data collection and use by
Google in addition decades ago Congress
passed the Communications Decency Act
including section 230 of that act which
allows service providers to remove lewd
lascivious excessively violent or
otherwise objectionable content from
their platforms this law allows service
providers to remove illegal materials
including child pornography and content
that is illegal under our intellectual
property laws while meant to allow them
to block illegal obscene and harmful
materials there is some discretion that
service providers by necessity must use
to make decisions about what content is
harmful or objectionable given Google's
ubiquity in the search market Google is
often consumers first and last stop when
searching for information on the
Internet
as such this committee is very
interested in how Google makes decisions
about what constant
objectionable content that justifies
filtering and who at Google makes these
decisions given the revelation that top
executives at Google have discussed how
the results of the 2016 elections do
comply with Google's values these
questions have become all the more
important while it is true that Google
is not a government entity and so it
does not have to comply with the First
Amendment the American people deserve to
know what types of information they are
not getting when they perform searches
on the Internet the market works best
when information about products and
services is readily available and so
today on behalf of this committee and
the American consumer I hope to get
answers from mr. pachai regarding who at
Google makes the judgment calls on
whether to filter or block objectionable
content and what metrics Google uses to
make those decisions
I want to thank Google's CEO for his
willingness to testify today to answer
these and other questions with respect
to search results algorithmic screening
is the primary means through which
Google sorts data and information
Google's search algorithm for example
calculates what is presented to a user
based on the variables the user inputs
into the search bar at its best Google's
algorithm reaches the best answer in the
least amount of time while providing
choices to the user by ranking pages
most relevant to the search inquiry of
course by ranking pages Google search
always favors one page over another this
kind of bias appears harmless after all
the point of a search is to discriminate
among multiple relevant sources to find
the best answer this process however
turns much more sinister with
allegations that Google manipulates its
algorithm to favor the political party
it likes the ideas that it likes or the
products that it likes
there are numerous allegations in the
news that Google employees have thought
about doing this talked about doing this
and have done it the dangerous
implications to a fair
mccr attic process cannot be understated
one study performed by psychologist
Robert Epstein has revealed that
internet search rankings have a
significant impact on consumer choices
mainly because users trust and choose
higher ranked results more than lower
ranked results after performing five
relevant double-blind randomized
controlled experiments using a total of
forty five hundred and fifty six
undecided voters representing diverse
demographic characteristics of the
voting populations of the United States
and India the study revealed that biased
search rankings can shift the voting
preferences of undecided voters by
twenty percent or more the shift can be
much higher in some demographic groups
and search ranking bias can be masked so
that people show no awareness of the
manipulation the potential for this kind
of bias is clearly problematic and is
further compounded by the fact that
Google everyday collects mountains of
information about its users while they
are actively engaged with a Google
product or even when they are not
according to a study conducted by
Vanderbilt University a dormant
stationary Android phone with chrome
active in the background communicated
location information to Google three
hundred and forty times during a 24-hour
period or at an average of 14 data
communications per hour the locate the
collection of location data may be
obvious to most users but they are often
unaware of the many sensors that the
Android platform supports including an
accelerometer a barometer and a
photometer these photometer these
sensors in addition to the cameras and
microphone on a mobile device can
collate into a very accurate picture of
where a user is what they are doing and
who else is there
the shocking amount of information that
Google collects via its phones was
recently featured on Good Morning
America in which a reporter using an
Android phone with no SIM card that
wasn't connected to the Internet
discovered that the phone collected the
device
movement even identifying the mode of
transportation such as the subway or
even a bicycle and at times taking ten
sensor readings per minute
moreover Google's practice of
reinforcing its dominance in light of
allegations of self-serving bias creates
little choice for consumers across the
spectrum of internet-based products or
services given that Google's ads show up
on non Google websites and Google search
engine is being used as the default
search tool on other products such as
the Apple phone it is almost impossible
to avoid Google altogether Google in
many things that Google as many things
it's one of the largest data collectors
ever seen in human history
it's an advertiser that can get the
right product to the right customer at
precisely the right time Google is also
an Internet giant directing over 3.5
billion searches per day with this
massive Authority however comes the
potential for far-reaching abuse the
mere suspicion that Google manipulates
its products and features for
self-serving or even political purposes
raises serious concerns about its
business practices its impact on free
speech and our democratic process and
Americans trust that the information
gathered about them in their day-to-day
lives is done with their knowledge and
is not being used against them my hope
is that through our inquiries today we
will ensure more transparency and
accountability going forward last
despite the nature and scope of today's
hearing Google is still the story of the
American dream the company was started
by two individuals in a garage and grew
to be one of the most successful
companies in the world two decades ago
we could not fathom instantaneous access
to more information than that which is
contained in all the encyclopedias in
the world now we take that for granted
because of the innovative services
Google provides with that I want to
again thank our witness for his presence
here today I look forward to your
testimony it's now my pleasure to
recognize the ranking member of the
committee that
from New York mr. Nadler for his opening
statement
Thank You mr. chairman mr. chairman our
society has become increasingly reliant
on social media and other online
platforms to obtain create share and
sort information this information helps
us make decisions ranging in importance
from where to make dinner reservations
to which candidate to vote for in a
presidential election the public's
increasing use of these platforms has
generated many positive benefits for
society but it is it has also given rise
to some troubling trends google is among
the dominant firms in this field as such
given the public's widespread use and
reliance on its products and services
there are legitimate questions regarding
the company's policies and practices
including with respect to content
moderation and the protection of user
privacy but before we delve into these
questions I must first dispense with a
completely illegitimate issue which is
the fantasy dreamed up by some
conservatives that Google and other
online platforms have an anti
conservative bias as I have said
repeatedly no credible evidence supports
this right-wing conspiracy theory I have
little doubt that my Republican
colleagues will spend much of their time
presenting a laundry list of anecdotes
and that of context statements made by
Google employees as suppose in evidence
of anti conservative bias but none of
that will actually make it true but this
fact free propaganda does help generate
the mistrust that the majority leader
referred to a few moments ago and even
if Google were deliberately
discriminating against conservative
viewpoints just as Fox News and Sinclair
Broadcasting and conservative talk radio
hosts like Rush Limbaugh discriminate
against liberal points of view that
would be it's right as a private company
to do so not to be questioned by
government during the Reagan
administration about 35 years ago
the Federal Communications Commission
nurse appointed by Ronald Reagan
abolished what we used to have called
the Fairness Doctrine which placed an
obligation on broadcasters who use the
public airwaves to be fair to different
points of view this question might be
relevant if the Republican members
wanted to bring back the Fairness
Doctrine an expanded scope to social
media companies I doubt we will see any
interest in doing so but we should not
let the delusions of the far-right
distract us from the real issues that
should be the focus of today's hearing
for example we should examine what
Google is doing to stop hostile foreign
powers from using its platform to spread
false information in order to harm our
political discourse it's been more than
two years since the 2016 election yet
this committee has not held a single
hearing focused on Russia's campaign to
manipulate online platforms to undermine
American democracy despite the fact that
it is the consensus view of our
intelligence agencies that Russia
engaged in a massive disinformation
campaign to influence the 2016 election
I hope the mr. pitch I can tell us what
actions Google has taken to counter this
unprecedented attack and what gaps
remain is defenses without being so
specific as to give a a guidance to
foreign powers this may help Congress
determine what more can be done to
further insulate our democratic
processes from foreign interference we
should also examine how Google enforces
community standards that prohibit racist
or bigoted threats and other
inappropriate conduct while Internet
platforms have produced many societal
benefits they have also provided a new
tool for those seeking to stoke racial
and ethnic hatred the presence of
hateful conduct and content on these
platforms has been made all the more
alarming by the recent rise in hate
motivated violence according to
statistics really recently released by
the FBI reported incidents of hate
crimes rose by 17 percent last year
compared to 2016 marking the third
consecutive year that such reports have
increased the horrible massacre at the
Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh the
recent murder of an African American
couple in the Kentucky grocery store the
killing of an Indian engineer last year
in Kansas are sadly not isolated
outbursts of violence but the most
salient examples of a troubling trend we
should consider to what extent Google
and other online platforms may have been
used to foment and to disseminate such
hatred and how these platforms can play
a construct
role in combating is spread as the
dominant player in his field Google
possess a significant market power it is
also useful to examine its policies and
practices to ensure that other companies
are able to compete in an open and fair
marketplace there are also concerns
about the prevalence of pirated material
available on Google and other Internet
platforms at the expense of legitimate
content finally it is important to know
what Google is doing to protect this
users data privacy and data security The
Wall Street Journal recently reported
that Google discovered last March that a
bug in its social media platform Google+
had exposed the private profile data of
up to 500,000 users to third-party
developers but opted not to disclose the
issue publicly not even to those who may
have been affected at the time and just
yesterday the company announced that it
had discovered another Google+ bug that
may have exposed the private profile
data of millions of users while Google
has so far found no evidence that
developers have in fact abused these
bugs or that any use of profile data has
been misused in any way incidents like
this still raise legitimate questions
about what types of data exposures a
company is obligated to disclose
publicly it also raises questions about
how much control users should have over
their own data and how such control
should be regulated I am also disturbed
by recent reports that Google is
developing a search engine for the
Chinese mainland market according to
these reports the search engine would
not only accommodate Chinese government
censors it might allow the Chinese
government to track individuals by
linking search terms to the users mobile
phone number unfortunately in this our
fourth hearing devoted to entirely
fictitious allegations of conservative
anti conservative bias by Internet
companies we will waste more time and
more taxpayer money and elevating
well-worn right-wing conspiracy theories
instead of concentrating the substantive
questions and issues it should be the
focus of our hearings our committee can
and must and will do better our yield
back the balance of my time Thank You
mr. Nadler we welcome our distinguished
witness and if you would please rise
I'll begin by swearing you in
these raise your right hand do you swear
that the testimony that you are about to
give shall be the truth the whole truth
and nothing but the truth so help you
God thank you let the record show that
the witness answered in the affirmative
our only witness today is mr. sundar
Pichai chai is the chief executive
officer of Google's your written
statement will be entered into the
record in its entirety and we ask that
you summarize your testimony in five
minutes
to help you stay within that time
there's a timing light on your table
when the light switches from green to
yellow you have one minute to conclude
your testimony when the light turns red
it signals you or five minutes have
expired mr. peach I you are very welcome
and you may begin chairman Goodlatte
ranking women adler distinguished
members of the committee thank you for
the opportunity to be here today I
joined Google 15 years ago and I've been
privileged to serve as CEO for the past
three years but my love for information
and technology began long before that
it's been 25 years since I made the u.s.
my home growing up in India I have
distinct memories often my family got
its first phone and its first television
each new technology made a profound
difference in our lives getting the
phone meant I could call ahead to the
hospital to check that the blood results
were in instead of taking a two-hour
trip there and the television well it
only had one channel but I couldn't have
been more thrilled by its arrival those
experiences made me a technology
optimist and they remain one today not
only because I believe in technology but
because I believe in people and their
ability to use technology to improve
their lives I'm incredibly proud of what
Google does to empower people around the
world especially here in the u.s. I'd
like to take a moment to share a bit of
background on that twenty years ago two
students one from Michigan and one from
Maryland came together at Stanford with
a big idea to provide users with access
to the world's information that mission
still drives everything we do
whether that's saving a few minutes on
your morning commute or helping doctors
detect disease and save lives today
Google is more than a search engine we
are a global company that's committed to
building products for everyone that
means working with many industries from
education and healthcare to
manufacturing and entertainment even as
we expand into new markets we never
forget our American roots it's no
coincidence that a company dedicated to
free flow of information was founded
right here in the US as an American
company we cherish the values and
freedoms that have allowed us to grow
and serve so many users and I'm proud to
say we do and we will continue to work
with the government to keep our country
safe and secure over the years our
footprint has expanded far beyond
California to states such as Texas
Virginia Oklahoma and Alabama today in
the u.s. we are growing faster outside
of the Bay Area than within it I've had
that great opportunity to travel across
the country and see all the places that
are that are powering our digital
economy from Clarksville to Pittsburgh
to San Diego where we recently launched
a partnership with the USO to help
veterans and military families along the
way I met many people who depend on
Google to learn new skills find jobs or
new businesses over the past year we
have supported more than 1.5 million
American businesses and over the past
three years we have made direct
contributions of one hundred and fifty
billion dollars to the US economy added
more than 24,000 employees and paid over
forty three billion dollars to our us
partners across search YouTube and
Android these investments strengthen our
communities and support thousands of
American jobs they also allow us to
provide great services to our users to
help them through the day it's an honor
to play this role in people's lives it's
one we know comes with great
responsibility protecting the privacy
and security of our users has long been
an essential part of our mission even
mr. an enormous amount of work over the
years to bring choice transparency and
control to our users the
these values are built into every
product we mean we recognize the
important role of governments including
this committee in setting rules for the
development and use of technology to
that end we support federal privacy
legislation and proposed a legislative
framework for privacy
earlier this year users look look to us
to provide accurate trusted information
and we work hard to ensure the integrity
for products we have put a number of
checks and balances in place to ensure
they continue to live up to our
standards I lead this company without
political bias and work to ensure that
our products continue to operate that
way to do otherwise would be against our
core principles and our business
interests we are a company that provides
platforms for diverse perspectives and
opinions and there is no shortage of
them amongst our employees some Googlers
are former servicemen and women who have
risked much in defense of their country
some are civil libertarians who fiercely
defend freedom of expression some are
parents who worry about the role
technology plays in our households some
like me are immigrants who are
profoundly grateful to the freedoms and
opportunities it offers and some of us
are many of these things let me close by
saying that leading Google has been the
greatest professional honour of my life
it's a challenging moment for our
industry but I'm privileged to be here I
greatly appreciate you letting me share
the story of Google and our work to
build products worthy of the trust uses
place in US thank you for the
opportunity and I look forward to
answering your questions thank you will
now proceed under the five-minute rule
with questions and I'll begin by
recognizing myself mr. P chai is it true
that the Android operating system sends
Google information every few minutes
detailing the exact location of a
smartphone within a few feet the speed
of movement of the phone the altitude of
the phone sufficient to determine what
floor of a building the phone is on the
temperature surrounding the phone and
other readings and if so with Americans
carrying their phones with them
virtually at all times
the collection of this volume of
detailed information really mean that
Google is compiling information about
virtually every movement an individual
where the smartphone is making every
hour of every day mr. chairman thank you
for that question today for any service
we provide our users we go to great
lengths to protect our privacy and we
give them transparency choice and
control Android is a powerful platform
and and provide smartphone for over two
billion people and as part of that it
depends on the applications users choose
to use if you're using a fitness
application which is deducting the
number of steps you walk you expect it
to send that information but it's a
choice users make we make it clear and
and it depends on the use cases so the
the answer to my question my first
question is yes is that correct that the
information that I cited is gathered by
Google if the Google services you have a
choice of what information is collected
and we make it transparent transparent I
understand there are there are uses that
consumers make use of I use it to keep
track of the number of steps I walk I
understand that service that one of your
competitors provides so I understand
that purpose but do you think the
average consumer understands that Google
will collect this volume of detailed
information when they click through the
terms of service agreements in order to
use the Android operating system it's
really important for us that you know
that average users are able to
understand it this is why we do
something called privacy check average
users you read the Terms of Service and
the updates that are very frequently
sent to us beyond the Terms of Service
we actually offer we remind users to do
a privacy check up and we make it very
obvious every month in fact in the last
28 days 160 million uses vent event to
their my account settings where they can
clearly see what information we have we
actually give you no show it back to
them and we give clear talk
by category where they can decide
whether that information is collected
stored or more importantly if they
decide to stop using it we work hard to
make it possible for users to take their
data with them if they choose to use
another service let me switch to the
issue of section 230 of the
Communications Decency Act you heard me
say in my opening statement that this
provides broad liability protections for
you and other technology companies for
good-faith restrictions that when Google
thinks something is obscene lewd
lascivious filthy excessively violent
harassing or otherwise objectionable on
the other hand objectionable material by
whatever standard applied likely elicits
the most engagement from users on your
site and for Google increased engagement
potentially means increased revenue
however it is important for Google to
make very clear where it draws the line
and I don't believe Google has done its
best to make that clear so what I would
ask is the following would Google or
YouTube be willing to make changes in
support of a healthier civic dialogue if
doing so meant a drop in user engagement
metrics absolutely mr. chairman we have
a long track record of we've always
focused on long term goals to its user
satisfaction we focus on their knowledge
happiness success and and and that's
what we work hard to create it is
important to us that platforms like
YouTube are viable over the long run
it's in our natural incentive to do so
YouTube is a place where users
advertisers and content creators who
make their livelihoods use the platform
and so we want to make this work in a
sustainable way when it comes to
political advertising as you know some
of your competitors in other advertising
media are required by law to offer the
same rate the lowest rate as a matter of
fact to all political candidates so for
example that's true in television radio
would Google should competing political
candidates be charged the same effective
ad rates to
each prospective voters our advertising
products are built without any bias and
that and the rates are comparative set
by a live auction process so depending
on the keywords for which you are
bidding for depending on the demand that
is in the auction
the prices are automatically calculated
so you know the system decides that
deadlines automatically calculated but
could two competing political candidates
targeting the same audience see
different ad rates and if yes could that
disparity be substantial yeah
there wouldn't be a difference based on
you know any political reasons unless
there are keywords which are of
particular interest in the market
determines that so it's it's essentially
a supply demand equilibrium it can lead
to difference in rates but it will weigh
from time to time can those rates be
very substantial in difference there
could be occasions where yes
there could be difference in rates yeah
I haven't looked at the specifics of
that yeah so the result is different
than in other markets like television or
radio where every candidate is entitled
to the lowest rate that that television
station or radio station offers to any
political candidate for office we you
know there could be variations based on
the time of today the keywords you're
choosing to go for you know the
geographies you're advertising in but
it's decided by the system and it's a
process we have done for over 20 years
and let me assure you anything to do
with our civic process we made sure we
do so in a non-partisan way and it's
really important for us thank you the
chair recognizes the gentleman from New
York mr. Nadler for five Thank You mr.
Petri according to media reports Google
found evidence that well let me go
through the other one first Google found
a bug in his Google Plus a social media
platform that could have potentially
exposed the private data of up to half a
million users without their consent to
third-party developers Google however
did not disclose this bug until months
later after it was revealed by report in
the Wall Street Journal
yesterday as I mentioned before they
found that you announce another bug what
legal obligations is the company under
to disclose that exposures that do not
involve sensitive financial information
but still involve private personal data
like users name age email address or
phone number congressman we take privacy
seriously the read the bugs you
mentioned our bugs v we found them by
either doing an audit or you know using
our automated testing systems whenever
we find any bugs we follow you know it
gets escalated to our privacy and data
production office and we comply with I'm
not criticizing what you do I'm asking
what legal obligation is the company
under to disclose such such data
exposures that don't involve financial
information but still involve other
personal information it depends on the
situation we follow the requirements and
yeah and in that case in the first case
typically we look at our legal
requirements but we go above and beyond
to make sure we do the right thing for
our users in the first case both there
was no evidence data was misused and we
couldn't accurately did I understand all
that but my question is what legal
obligations are there you know today
right now if you found a bug you know
and you are certain once you have done
the investigation and you ascertain the
users who are eligible for notification
my understanding is you have 72 hours
and we both notify users as well as
regulators in that time frame okay thank
you
now according to media reports Google
found evidence that Russian agents spent
thousands of dollars to purchase ads on
its advertising platforms that spanned
multiple Google products as part of the
agents the Russian agents campaigned to
interfere in the election two years ago
additionally juniper Downs head of
global policy for YouTube testified in
July a YouTube had identified and shut
down multiple and shut down multiple
channels containing thousands of videos
associated with the Russian
misinformation campaign does Google now
know the full extent to which its online
platforms were exploited by Russian
actors in the election two years ago
you know we undertook a very thorough
investigation and in 2016 we we now know
that there were two main ad accounts
linked to Russia which which you know
advertised on Google for about forty
seven hundred dollars in advertising
we also found other limited evil over
forty seven hundred dollars that's right
which was you know no amount is okay
here but you know but we found limited
activity improper activity we have
learned a lot from that and we've you
know it dramatically increased the
production's we have around our election
offerings leading up to the current
elections we did we again found limited
activity both from the internet research
agency in Russia as well as accounts
linked to Iran and while what specific
steps have you taken including during
the recent 2018 elections to protect
against further interference by Russia
or other hostile foreign powers we have
undertaken a significant review of how
ads are bought you know we look for the
origin of these accounts we share and
collaborate with law enforcement other
technology companies and we've
essentially are investing a lot of
effort and oversight in this area
looking ahead to the next Congress I
assume we can have your assurances that
Google will work with this committee as
we examine the issue of how to better
secure our elections from future foreign
interference
congressman protecting our elections is
foundational to our democracy and you
you have my full commitment that will do
that okay my last question because we
time is running out what are you doing
what is Google doing to combat the
spread of white supremacy and right-wing
extremism of course YouTube congressmen
YouTube is an important platform we do
want to allow for diverse perspectives
and opinions but we have rules of the
road we have clear content policies and
we have policies against many categories
and we are transparent about these
policies and you know and when we find
violations on our policies we do remove
those videos and Handel can't
when you find violations you want off
your our policy for example we have
policies against hate speech and we
clearly define them and if we find any
violations there we do take down the
take down content when you take down the
content you know to who put it up so you
can flag future content from the same
sources we we on you know we look at it
on a video by video basis to the extent
that I repeat offenses from a same
account we do take into account and we
notify the content creator and we follow
up accordingly thank you very much I
yield back chair recognizes the
gentleman from Texas mr. Smith for five
minutes and Thank You mr. chairman
mr. chairman google has revolutionized
the world though not entirely in the way
I expected Americans deserve the facts
objectively reported the muting of
conservative voices by Internet
platforms has intensified especially
during the presidency of Donald Trump
more than 90% of all internet searches
take place on Google or its subsidiary
YouTube and they are curating what we
see google has long faced criticism for
manipulating search results to censor
conservatives conservative individuals
and organizations have had their pro
tunc content tagged as hate speech or
had their content reduced in search
results an enforcement of immigration
laws has been tagged as hate speech as
well such actions pose a grave threat to
our democratic form of government
Vijay media found that 92 6% of search
results for Trump were from liberal
media outlets in fact not a single
right-leaning site appeared on the first
page of search results this doesn't
happen by accident but is baked into the
algorithms those who write the
algorithms get the results they must
want
and apparently management allows it dr.
Robert Epstein a Harvard trained
psychologist Arthur to study recently
that showed Google's biased likely swung
two point six million votes to Hillary
Clinton in the
2016 election Google could well elect
the next president with dire
implications for our democracy this
should be a real concern to all but the
most politically partisan those at the
top set the tone
it will require a Herculean effort by
the chief executive and senior
management to change the political bias
now programmed into the company's
culture and mr. Ajay let me ask my first
question about those examples of
political bias that I just mentioned and
you're gonna hear others too in your
opening statement you mentioned your
desire to provide information that was
without political bias clearly that's
not working so what are you going to
improve that situation congressman
thanks for the question if I may some of
the studies you mentioned we have
investigated those there are there are
other studies which have looked at it we
have found issues with the methodology
and the sample size and so on but let me
step back and say providing users with
high-quality accurate and trusted
information is sacrosanct to us it's
what our principles are under business
interests or natural long-term
incentives are aligned with that we want
to serve users everywhere and we need to
earn their trust in doing so so so what
actions are you going to take to try to
counter the political bias and some of
those examples that I just gave I mean
they're irrefutable so it occurs you
have to take some responsibility for
that bias what do you intend to do about
it
congressman with respect a doctor
abstained study be investigated we don't
agree with the methodology happy to
follow up with your office and give our
findings eyes on that on the study but
when we look at it we evaluate our
studies to evaluate our search results
today we use a very robust methodology
and if we've been doing this for 20
years making sure the results are
accurate is what we need to do well and
we work hard to do that what his
methodology had to do with the fact that
96% of the references to Trump or from
liberal media there are always studies
you know which can show what one one set
of data and
arrived at conclusions but we have
looked at results on our top news
category we find that we have a wide
variety of sources including sources
from the left and sources from the right
and we are committed to making sure this
diverse perspectives by the way the
study that I referred to was done by a
self-proclaimed
Democrat who voted for Hillary Clinton
and said he regretted to find what he
found but he felt it was really futile
and no one has been able to disprove him
let me go to another question and that
is clearly there may be a difference of
opinion as to the degree or amount of
political bias would you agree to allow
an independent entity to study your
search results for political bias I know
you've have individuals studying that
now but you appointed them would you
allow and third-party independent
outside organization to study your
search results and cooperate with them
to determine the degree or if any of
political bias almost money if I may
make two points one is today there have
been independent third-party studies
looking at search results the economists
but you chose those third parties I'm
talking about someone truly independent
we didn't choose those third parties I
mean they completed those studies the
second is we are transparent as to how
we evaluate search we publish our rater
guidelines we publish it externally and
graters evaluate it and that's how we
you know we are trying hard to
understand what users want and and this
is something important to us to get
right I'm happy to follow up and explain
the methodology and the studies which
have been done by independent third
parties okay to my knowledge again you
have picked those third parties and I'd
like to have someone truly independent
study those results number one number
two also to my knowledge you've never
sanctioned any employee for any type of
manipulating the research results
whatsoever is that the case the time of
the gentleman has expired but mr. pitch
I will be allowed to answer the question
and very quickly it's not possible for
an individual employee or groups of
employee to manipulate our search
results you know we have a robust
framework including many steps in the
process and my time is up let me just
say I just
I think humans can manipulate the
process is a human process at his face
Thank You mr. chairman yield back chair
recognizes the gentlewoman from
California Miss Lofgren for five minutes
Thank You mr. chairman and thank you for
being here mr. Boucher
Google is located in Santa Clara County
my home and I've got to say that you
know in contrast to the recent Amazon
effort for a headquarters they are
proposing Google's proposing to
establish a facility in downtown San
Jose and they didn't ask for any tax
subsidies in fact they're purchasing the
land and paying the city gobs of money
I'm going to be parochial and ask a
question because I think most people in
San Jose are excited by the proposal but
there's anxiety about the impact on
housing and whether Google intends to be
a partner with the city of San Jose to
make sure that we accommodate the
housing that will be necessary for the
20,000 additional employees that are
proposed in San Jose sorry I missed the
last part of your question whether you
would be a partner with the city in
helping to provide additional housing to
accommodate these employees congressman
it's an important question we deeply
care about the community very very work
as part of this effort we have done wide
outreach and we have committed to making
sure there is affordable housing at
varying affordability levels as part of
as part of the development already in
touch with city leaders there thank you
so much you know there's so many
questions and we're not going to be able
to deal with them all today I'm hoping
in the next Congress we will be able to
visit with you and other tech companies
to go through issues of privacy data
localization and its relationship to
human rights competition policies the
issue of takedown requests by
authoritarian regimes encryption policy
and what's going on in Australia
filtering and confirmation bias and its
impact on society generally both
culturally and politically but we don't
can't do that in the five minutes we
here today so I would just like to
revisit some of the questions that have
already been asked the Chairman asked
about location policies in your Android
system and you pointed to various apps
that might provide information let's say
I got an Android phone but not unlike
most people I don't have a single app on
that phone what information would be
collected Congresswoman there is a there
is a device specific location setting
which which you can turn on or off and
say I turn it off turn it off there's no
location information sent from that
device okay but this is a complex area
there are times for example your IP
address may include some location
information correct it's an area we are
committed to doing more to make it
easier now manipulation of search
results I think it's important to talk
about how search works right now if you
google the word idiot under images a
picture of Donald Trump comes up I just
did that how would that happen how does
search work so that that would occur we
provide search tree for anytime you type
in a keyword we as Google we have
crawled we've gone out and crawled and
stored Billy copies of billions of their
pages in our index and we take the
keyword and match it against web pages
and rank them based on over 200 signals
things like relevance freshness
popularity how other people are using it
and based on that you know at any given
time we try to rank and find the best
results for that query and then we
evaluate them at external readers to
make sure that and they evaluate it to
objective guidelines and and that's how
we make sure the process is well it's
not some little man sitting behind the
curtain figuring out what
we're going to show the user it's
basically a compilation of what users
are generating and trying to sort
through that information last year we
sold over 3 trillion searches and just
just as a fact every single day 15% of
the searches Google sees we have never
seen them before
so so the this is working at scale and
you know we don't you know manually
intervene on any particular search
yourself I I would just like to note
from time to time my colleagues on the
other side of the aisle complained that
they hear an individual engineer appears
to be a Democrat and I just like to put
this in context in Santa Clara County
Donald Trump in the in the 2016 election
got 20% of the vote that's how much of
the vote he got so it's not a surprise
that the engineers who live in Santa
Clara County would reflect that general
political outcome that has nothing to do
with the algorithms and the really
automated process that is the search
engine that serves us you know if we
didn't have Google we wouldn't be able
to find any information in in the
efficient way that we do I look forward
next year to working with you on some of
the very serious questions that we face
it's pretty obvious that bias against
conservative voices is not one of them
thank you very much my time is expired
mr. Shi recognize the gentleman from
Ohio mr. Chabot for five minutes
Thank You mr. chairman and mr. Pichardo
me start out with something real quickly
we've heard several times this morning
the mention that 90% of the time that a
person he or she does an internet search
that it's true Google would you
basically agree that that's that's true
more than ever there are many ways users
access information just to give an
example if you if you're trying to shop
if you're trying to buy something more
than 50% of product searches originated
with Amazon in the u.s. today if you're
looking for information on on news today
you can get it from more sources than
ever before do you dispute
the 90% number you know our internal I
mean it's tough for us to assess the
numbers there are external studies which
have shown different numbers including
lower numbers than that okay now you've
heard the allegation this morning I know
you dispute it but you've heard the
allegation that there's a bias in favor
of liberal or progressive points of view
and against a more conservative point
you've heard that this morning already
is that correct yes I'm okay
let me tell you now about a first-hand
experience that that I've had I do a
weekly blog I've been doing it for the
better part of nine years now and a
while back Republicans in the House
passed legislation to repeal and replace
Obamacare our bill was called the
American Health Care Act or the AHCA
when I was writing my blog about that I
googled American Health Care Act and
virtually every article was an attack on
our bill article after article alleging
that our bill would result in millions
and millions of people losing the great
care that they were supposedly getting
under Obamacare I would argue that was
completely false but it wasn't until you
got to the third or fourth page of
search results before you found anything
remotely positive about our bill let me
give you a second example the Republican
tax cut bill was passed about a year ago
the tax cuts and Jobs Act same story
article after article attacking the
Republican tax cut plan alleging the tax
cuts only went to the rich when in
actuality about 85 percent of taxpayers
got their taxes cut including millions
and millions of middle-class taxpayers
and once again to find any article that
had anything remotely good to say about
our plan you had to go deep into the end
of the search results now I know
Google's attitude the algorithm made us
do it
but I don't know that I buy that how do
you explain this apparent bias on
Google's part against conservative
points of view against conservative
policies is it just the algorithm or
czar more happening there congressman I
understand the frustration at seeing
negative news and you know I see it on
me on Google's there are times you can
search on Google and page after page
there's negative news which feed reflect
but what what is important here is we
use a robust methodology to reflect what
is being said about any given topic at
any particular time and we try to do it
objectively using a set of rubrics it is
in our interest to make sure we reflect
what's happening out there
in the best objective manner possible I
can commit to you and I can assure you
we do it without regards to political
ideology our algorithms have no notion
of political center you know I'm gonna
run out of time here I apologize for
interrupting but and and I and I
sincerely believe that that you believe
what you're saying here but you've got
almost 90,000 employees somebody out
there is doing something that that just
isn't working if you're looking for
unbiased results and I've seen this
firsthand
time after time I just mentioned two of
the most obvious ones that people would
remember yell those bills heard about
those um so I've seen if what is what
I've described and some others I'm sure
you're getting here other example if it
is happening do you see how
conservatives believe that your company
is kind of putting their thumb on this
scale so to speak that you're in effect
picking winners and losers in political
discourse out there in America today and
therefore actually affecting elections
and and do you see why conservatives
would be concerned about this and why
we're asking these kinds of questions
today there's a lot of people that think
what I'm saying here is happening and I
think it's happening so I've only got
about 20 seconds to go but I'll you'll
look do you congressman it's important
to me that I understand these consents
this is why I've been trying to reach
out and meet people we've done outreach
we want to explain how these things work
we are happy to look at independent
studies
it's important to us to demonstrate that
our products work without any bias and
we build our products in a neutral way
and I'm happy to follow up and look
forward to you know getting a chance to
explain it better thank you very much
and I appreciate your willingness to
follow up because there's I think a lot
of people have a lot of questions and I
know I'm already out of time but let me
also thank Google for one thing and I
happen to be chair of the House Small
Business Committee and your company has
worked with an awful lot of small
businesses all across the country create
a lot of jobs and I commend you for that
yo back chair recognizes the gentleman
from Georgia
sorry the gentlewoman from Texas mr.
Jackson Lee for five minutes
good morning mr. burch I am I'm right
here it's a pleasure to have you here
this morning
I'm going to try and answer very or
offer to you questions initially that
require just say yes or no answer if you
would does google choose conservative
voices over liberal voices we approach a
work without any political bias we build
it in a neutral way answer is no yes or
no no
if hate speech provokes violence is that
the definition beyond other aspects that
you consider that you would take it down
I know there are other aspects but
particularly encouraging violence does
that get taken down in primary purpose
of inciting violence is what we consider
is hate speech yes congressman and it
would be taken down
yes we would remove I want to just take
note of the fact that I look forward to
best practices when we start the hundred
and sixteenth Congress in terms of
having more hearings my view is that
this committee has washed its hands
clean of engaging in meaningful
oversight of technology platform efforts
to sift through content being sold by
hostile foreign actors actors claiming
to heighten social division at the peril
of democracy I won't ask a question on
that but I will make mention of the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights
article 12 which says no one should be
subjected to arbitrary interference with
his privacy and has been noted that
Google does engage in reviewing emails
would you commit to it here
to article 12 of the Declaration of
Human Rights relates to protecting the
privacy of individual emails you know we
think privacy is an important individual
right it's an important human right and
and we have committed to upholding that
and happy to engage in any discussions
with respect to that I'd like to do so
we know that building the US economy
through innovation is very important I
would like to know whether or not you
would be open to Google involving the AI
economy to non-traditional areas of
social economic groups data shows the
impact of not having that access would
you be welcome or would you welcome
invitations to those communities to do
more than what has been done definitely
absolutely yes you received a letter
from the Senate a few weeks ago
regarding illegal drug sales it's quite
extensive and my question is have you
made any efforts to deal with the
facilitating of sale of counterfeit
substandard and falsified medicines sold
through illegal online pharmacies
congressman this is a national crisis we
have undertaken a lot of work in this
area we we just recently rolled out we
participated in national take back day
in Google Maps we show drop-off
locations we work with law enforcement
here and just last week we received a
corporate citizenship evolved from
partnership for drug-free America and we
are very committed to doing more work in
this area we applauded you in 2010 when
Google took a very powerful stand of
principled and democratic values over
profits and came out of China I am
concerned that you are now going back
into China and upholding the dragonfly
procedures which would help censor
Chinese persons seeking a lifeline of
democracy and freedom how can you do
that and what are you doing to minimize
or to indicate that this is not the best
practices congressman about said right
now we have no plans to launch in China
we have we don't have a search product
there our core mission is to provide
users access to information and getting
access to information is an important
human right so we are always compelled
across the world to try hard to provide
that information and but right now there
are no plans to launch search in China
I'm committed to being fully transparent
including with policymakers after the
extent we ever develop plans to do that
I'd like to pursue that with you and I
thank you for that I think there was an
important statement my community is
diverse as you well may have heard the
Congressional Black Caucus has been
working extensively with Google and
other search engines to recognize her
not enough individuals of diversity and
African Americans my district has a huge
number of musicians artists and
creatives from all areas of
entertainment I'd be interested in what
efforts are being taken by Google's
platform YouTube to promote diversity
inclusion with his employees what are
the demographics of u2's u.s. employees
and also how is YouTube currently
distributing resources for us diversity
but the focus is on diversity what are
you doing YouTube is a great message and
there is a whole population growing of
diverse persons including African
Americans diversities native we are very
committed to YouTube as you highlighted
is a platform where as we reach out to
content creators we want to ensure there
is diverse perspectives and we do reach
out to minority communities and we
engage with them to make sure they have
a voice on the platform it's something
we are committed to doing as a company
we are we have been undertaking a lot of
work we were one of the first to publish
a transparency report we publish our
representation numbers externally there
is a lot more work left to do we
acknowledge that but it's an area you
know we have engaged with the
Congressional Black Caucus and we are
committed to doing more let me invite
you to Texas and the 18th congressional
district on these very important issues
and I'd like to work with Google as we
go forward on some of the many issues
that I've raised here today it would be
a pleasure to do that thank you very
much mr. chairman I'd like to put into
the record a letter from epic org dated
December 10 2018 ask unanimous
mr. chairman out objection and let me
thank the witness for his testimony
thank you also for your work here thanks
gentlemen recognized the gentleman from
California mr. Eisler for five minutes
Thank You mr. chairman Chari I would
like to follow up on some of the
gentlemen that came before me on this
side of the dais who talked about the
the bias and and I know that the
gentlelady from Texas and some of the
others said there is no bias but I'd
like to to pick up where Sheila
jackson-lee just left off because I
think it's important she used numbers
and out outcome that she either has or
believes exist to say that you have to
do better in the minority community do
you agree with that as a company we are
committed to making sure no no but
statistically the outcome that she
measures is how she asks you to do
better because your outcome is
insufficient relative the size of her
community do you agree with that you
know I interpreted as we today don't
have enough representation internally
very good you got her point now here's
the point that I think we're giving if
you measure the outcome such as some of
those that were just listed by the
gentleman from Texas in Ohio what you
find is that there is an appearance of
bias including quite frankly the outcome
of search engines even the question of
whether if I pay for advertising and my
Democratic opponent pays for advertising
the if the characteristic of what we
happen to search for somehow is more
expensive if you're trying to get
conservative and Republican those are
outcome events will you commit to look
in the case of political potential
political bias in all aspects of your
very large company to look at the
outcome measure the outcome and see if
in fact there is evidence of bias using
that and then work backwards to see if
some of that can be evened to what would
appropriately be the outcome do you see
my point there
congressman I understand we don't want
any unconfident we don't approach our
work work with any political bias I
think it's important to me that we
always look at outcomes and the assess
to make sure there is no evidence of
bias and the reason I give you this
point for most of my adult life there
have been laws on the book to stop the
events that Miss Jackson Lee speaks of
we have had laws to protect minority
communities we have had laws to protect
against segregation and bias and yet
there are measurements that are still
being used including quite frankly we
create districts that are dedicated to
minorities in this country under federal
orders because of a history or a
measurement of outcome and I would ask
you to seriously come back commit to
measure and when you find an outcome
that is inconsistent with that which
would be ordinarily predictable I mean
we are two parties relatively tied in
the outcome of elections on a global on
a national basis if that outcome doesn't
come out similar that in fact you have
the evidence to work backwards and see
if in fact policies can be found which
are causing that artificially and which
by the way might include an overzealous
liberal crowd that simply spends more
time trashing Republicans than vice
versa that might be what you find but
unless you look at the outcome you're
always gonna say well we seem to be fair
but the outcome measured by my
colleagues will in fact not work out
congressman I I think it's a valid point
I appreciate it and happy to engage more
and follow up on it I want to get
through just two more quick things in
your opening statement and in the
questions you've asked you have talked
about turning off location and other
data collection and there are two things
that I'm concerned about can you commit
as you go through generation 15 16 17 of
your software to improve the dashboard
the transparency and the tools available
to teach people how
to protect their privacy how to offload
data how to in fact turn off things they
may not want to have in order to gain
privacy it's an area we want to do
better you know I wanna acknowledge just
as the company has grown a lot you know
there is there's complexity and you know
it's something I do think we can do
better you know more than other come we
do today show clear dashboards with the
data and give controls but we want to
simplify it make it easier for average
users to navigate these settings and and
it's something we are working on and I
will tell you each time I try to turn it
on it off refreshing my memory is a pain
because there is no simple place to go
to find out how to do it but the reality
is I agree that you do have a dashboard
most don't I ask unanimous consent now
that an article from The Wall Street
Journal October 8th of 2018 be placed in
the record out objection and in that
article it talks about that the user
data beet breach and it also makes us
aware that there's a memorandum at
Google and that memorandum has been
requested by multiple members of
Congress including Senator Thune would
you commit to provide that memorandum to
Congress so that we can know more about
the internal workings related to this
breach you know I'm happy to have my
office follow up on it I'm not fully
aware of all the specifics there but
definitely and commit to following up
with your office on it thank you
Thank You mr. chairman yield back thanks
gentleman recognizes the gentleman from
Tennessee mr. Cohen for five minutes
Thank You mr. chair howdy first I'd like
to follow up what was tri-c was talking
about I use your apparatus often or your
search engine and I don't understand all
of the different ways that you can turn
off the locations at there's so many
different things
have you considered having an online
school that people could go to with a
Google rep and you could kind of log in
and kind of ask questions or have Google
and and not like Comcast where you get
put on hold for 30 minutes and then find
somebody who you can't understand
something easy to talk to somebody and
say how do I do this or that congressman
we are constantly looking for better
ways to do it one of the areas is giving
online tutorials and we haven't
specifically looked at an option like
that but I'm happy to take that feedback
today we do remind people of privacy
checkups and we walk them through a flow
around 20 million people come to it
every day and so we do its online though
that's online but but you don't have
individuals I find it's a lot easier to
talk to somebody go this is what I want
because the other thing is frustrating
but if you could look into that I think
what help privacy is something I think
many people and myself included are
interested in but sometimes it's
difficult to use the device to get that
definitely you said that you can turn
off your location history but that still
your IP address will track your
information is that correct alignment
not just common to Google today many
Internet companies do collect and
sometimes store IP information for
security reasons for example we need to
know the language in which we serve your
search results there may be some
location information you know in their
location turns out to be in the fabric
of how people use Internet today I do
think it's important there is
legislation in this area as a company we
want to try and simplify things and be
state-of-the-art but it is a complex
area we realize we need to do better and
we are working on it question about
Russia in recent months authoritarian
regimes most prominently Vladimir
Putin's regime in Russia which seems to
have first place there the Heisman
winner of that have used BOTS to
manipulate YouTube's algorithms under
restricting the accessibility of online
content from democratic and human rights
where the gentleman suspend sure the
individual who has stopped the provided
us with a poster will remove that
immediately from the room or the could
we have the doors closed could we have
the doors closed that police will escort
the gentleman out of the building like
how many USC football game and shiver
them absolutely Thanks gentleman's
recognized and I get 20 more seconds
right yes without objection
all right so in recent months
authoritarian regimes most prominently
Vladimir Putin's regime in Russia have
used BOTS to manipulate YouTube's
algorithms and to restricting the
accessibility of online content from
democratic and human rights activists by
piling up tens of thousands of
artificial dislikes to their videos I'm
aware human rights activists had met
with representatives of Google to
discuss this problem and find a way of
amending the algorithms to prevent this
abuse authoritarian regimes but so far
no systemic solution has been found
YouTube is the main platform for
democratic and human rights activists
and authoritarian countries for the
mainstream media are controlled by the
governments this results in YouTube
algorithms as they currently operate
putting up barriers to the distribution
of such content what is YouTube and
Google currently doing to address this
problem
congressman both YouTube and Google are
really committed to freedom of
expression we do want to be a platform
by which people can get their messages
out and and and we work hard to do that
and you know I'm not sure if all the
specifics in that particular case but
happy to follow but in general we work
hard we operate around the world part of
the reason we do it is so that we can be
a platform by which people can get their
messages out and including human rights
activists there is there are ways that
BOTS could influence the algorithm by
going in and disliking or whatever not
right you know to out our systems we
deal with you know spam bots and
thoughts of many many kinds it's what we
have worked hard over 20 years to make
sure we can counter we have several
measures in place we deduct these
activities and we respond strongly or to
follow up on this should I thought I
heard on television this morning MSNBC
said you have almost 200 lobbyists and
it's amazing that they all look like
add-on but but should I just talk to one
of the add-ons and ask him to get with
you on this issue we'll definitely have
our office follow up thank you sir and
by the way as far as MSNBC would be a
news I mean if you're on MSNBC wouldn't
that be in your news it's MSNBC news
providers study Avastin so if you put it
like I put my name in here Rep Steve
Cohen that punch
News this weekend I was on MSNBC four
times and yet with first thing that
comes up is the Daily Caller not exactly
a liberal and I guess well-known group
dens roll called then Breitbart news in
the Memphis Business Journal then
Breitbart news then Breitbart so it
looks like you are overly using
conservative news organizations on your
news and I'd like you to look into over
use of conservative news organizations
to put on liberal people's news on
Google and if you'd let me know about
that I appreciate it you know we do get
concerns across both sides of the aisle
you know I can I can assure you we do
this in a neutral way and we do this
based on that specific keyword what we
are able to us assess the most relevant
information and I'm sure you try to it's
hard for me to fathom being on MSNBC for
like eight minutes each show four times
and there's there's more content on
Breitbart news than MSNBC that might say
something about well I'm not gonna say
that scary thank you sir chair
recognizes the gentleman from Ohio mr.
Jordan for five minutes Thank You mr.
chairman mr. Pichai in your opening
statement you said I lead this company
without political bias and work to
ensure that our products operate that
way
Ileana Murillo is Google's head of
multicultural marketing does miss
Murillo do good work
I'm not directly familiar with her work
but she's an employee of Google and you
know we're proud of her employees
well you praised her work the day after
the 2016 election in a four-page email
she wrote about her work with the Latino
vote she said even sundar gave our
effort a shout-out is she referring to
you there she was referring to my
communication around translation for a
different related effort okay well I'm
gonna look at two other sentences she
had that long email again recapping her
work in the 2016 election with the
Latino vote she said this we pushed to
get out the Latino vote with our
features a few lines down and her email
she qualified that sentence and she said
we pushed to get out the Latino vote
with our features in key states
and she specifically cites the states
Florida and Nevada near the end of her
email in a similar sentence she says we
supported partners like voto Latino to
pay for rides to the polls in key states
with me I want to kind of analyze those
two sentences we push to get out the
Latino vote with our features in key
states we supported partners like voto
Latino to pay for rides to the polls in
key states is a fair to say that we in
both sentences Mr Pichai refers to
Google congressman we we are very
concerned whenever there are allegations
like that we we are team look at that
question I'm asking is it fair to say
that we in both sentences refers to the
company Google as Google we wouldn't
participate in any partisan efforts
around any civic process so okay I don't
think so so this is so we pushed and we
supported partner like voted Latino to
paper rides and polls in key states and
we push to get out the Latino vote
during the 2016 election and how were
they getting that done they were getting
that done by according to miss Morello
your head of multicultural marketing by
altering your features or configuring
your features in such a way and for
paying for rides for people to get to
the polls is that an accurate reading of
those says that's all I'm asking is that
does that fair to say what those
sentences are talking about not about of
all the specifics but we did look into
it we found no evidence that you know
there were any activity like that from
Google towards said organization so
she's not telling the truth for sure we
didn't find any supporting evidence of
any such activity you said she paid for
rides to the polls and they configured
their features in such a way as to get
out the Latino vote and look I actually
think that's all okay right I think that
that's just a good corporate citizen
encouraging voter participation
encouraging people to participate in our
election process I think so far those
sentences are just fine but then there's
three words at the end of each sentence
that do cause me real concern and those
three words are we push to get out the
Latino vote with our features in key
states now suddenly it gets political
we supported partners like voto Latino
to pay for rides to the polls in key
states now that makes everything
different so I got really just one
question for you
why why why did Google configure its
features and pay for rides to the polls
to get out the Latino vote only in key
states congressman Issa said earlier we
found no evidence to substantiate those
claims the only effort we do around
elections though you're a head of
multicultural marketing who you praised
her work in this email gave her a shout
out was lying when she said you were
trying to get out the Latino vote in key
states we today in the u.s. around
elections we make it and this is what
users look to us for where to register
to vote where to find your nearest
polling place what are the hours they
are open and we do those things
effectively I appreciate that mr. pitch
I already I already said that's just
that's being a good good corporate
citizen what I'm asking is why did you
only do it in key states we didn't do
any such activity as Google on any of
these key states I mean there are
employees I think they are party did you
push to get out the Latino vote in all
states as Google we don't have goals
around pushing out to get any particular
segments we don't participate in
partisan activities we engage with both
campaigns we support and sponsor debates
across both sides of the aisle and we
provide users with information to get
tell your head of multicultural
marketing said you were pushing to get
out the Latino vote paying for ride to
the poll to the polls for the Latino
vote only in key states and you're
saying that's not accurate yes that's
right we haven't found any evidence to
substantiate if she just made it up out
of thin air the day after the election
who wrote this email to your top
executives and it's not true congressman
I'm happy to follow up but I think the
employees today do their own active we
don't want to follow up I want the real
answers right here in this committee as
I said earlier we've looked into it we
didn't find you push to get out the key
vote and and I would say the two most
populous states for Latinos would be
California and Texas did you push to get
out the Latino vote and pay for people
to go to the polls in California and
Texas
we as a company didn't have any effort
to push out words for any particular
demographic that would be against our
principles we participate in the Civic
process in an in a in a non-partisan way
and we think it's really important we do
it that way well I just think it's
interesting mr. chairman I know I'm over
time but I think it's interesting that
their head of multicultural marketing
writes an email the day after the
election where she talks about seventy
one percent of Latino votes voted for
Hillary but that wasn't enough and she
talks about paying for rides to the
polls in key states for Latino votes to
get out the Latino vote in key states
and the head of the company says that's
not accurate the time of the gentleman
has expired the witness may answer the
question chairman I think it's important
for us and we are happy to follow that
congressman there and we haven't found
any evidence to substantiate those
allegations but miss Murillo still work
for the company it's it's my
understanding she does yes sir she
recognizes the gentleman from Georgia
mr. Johnson for five minutes
Thank You mr. mr. Fisher have you ever
heard talk of this email that you were
just asked about by your head of
multicultural marketing not at that time
but later you know when when there was
concerns expressed around it I was made
aware of that is it is it true that she
said that email or could that be fake
news my understanding is that there were
emails which were sent like the
congressman referred to but it's your
testimony today that Google did not
configure its features to get out the
Latino vote in key states you know we
don't build partisan features or
features with any goals around affecting
elections in those ways we mainly focus
our efforts on helping people register
to vote and our you know we reach users
across the United States so anytime we
do these efforts informing people where
to vote these are used
in a very distributed way widely across
the entire country all right thank you
sir in Google's collection and use of
consumers data and its record of
protecting consumers and their data
appropriate areas of congressional
oversight but sadly this committee has
neglected consumer protection as an area
of oversight choosing instead to
squander their oversight
responsibilities and use its power so as
to bully Google and other technology
companies in to minimizing negative news
and comments about Republicans and most
importantly the Trump administration
yesterday Google disclosed that private
profile data of over 52 million users
users may have been exposed I understand
that you're phasing out the Google+
platform but many Americans trust your
email platform and countless other
products with their personal information
and you admit that you collect private
data for use in advertising how can we
be assured considering this new breach
that the personally identifiable
information of consumers is safe with
you congressman it's an important
question this is why we undertake all
these efforts we do operate important
products like Gmail the reasons you know
building software inevitably has bugs
associated as part of the process we
actually undertake a lot of efforts to
find bugs and so we find it we root it
out and we fix it and that's how we
constantly make our systems better and
you know the biggest area of risk we
normally you know we see for our users
is around security that you know their
account gets hacked or something that's
why we work hard Gmail is an area where
we've invested a lot we have an advanced
protection program
I would encourage members of the
Congress to sign up for it if you're
using Gmail it allows the second layer
of
into your account which makes it you
know much much harder to get your
account you know misappropriated in any
way alright thank you
yesterday the New York Times published
an in-depth investigation of your
location tracking applications that SIL
purportedly identified
excuse me personally identified data
Google has said that it doesn't sell
data but as a corporation deeply
involved in the business of consumer
data use in advertising your company
benefits from applications that track
consumer locations how do you
differentiate what Google does with
geolocation all data from companies with
applications that track and sylva data
it's a company we do not sell user data
that would be against our principles and
how we how do you differentiate what you
do with the geolocation data from
companies that do sell their data how do
you how do you differentiate what you do
with that data versus what these
applications that do track and sale that
data do important source of
differentiation we do not remove never
sell user data we do give consumers
preferences about how their data is used
for advertising
most of our user experience or we make
our advertising relevant based on the
keywords you type and that's where we
get most of our information we do you
can just type and control your ad
settings into Google and you can
actually change you know the use of your
personal data for advertising as well we
allow that as an option user time
expires let me ask you do you believe
Google has done enough to be transparent
in its data collecting policies you know
we we always think there is more to do
it's an area which is going to be an
ongoing area of effort for us but we
have invested a lot over the years and
we do make it very transparent
and we encourage users to go check it
out and in fact every day 20 million
users go and check it and over the last
month around 170 million users did check
it but we're going to continue and
invest more in this area thank you are
you bad the chair recognizes the
gentleman from Texas mr. Poe for five
minutes
Thank You mr. chairman I'm over here on
this side I have an iPhone and if I move
from here and go over there and sit with
my Democrat friends which will make them
real nervous
does Google track my movement does
Google through this phone know that I
have moved here and moved over to the
left it's either yes or no not by
default there may be a Google service
which you've opted in to use and if so
Google knows that I am moving over there
it's it's not a trick question you know
you make a hundred million dollars a
year you ought to be able to answer that
question does Google know through this
phone that I am moving over there and
sitting next to mr. Johnson which would
make him real nervous
it's his question its gesture nope
I wouldn't be able to answer without
looking at can't say yes or no without
knowing more details sir if I walk over
there and sit next to mr. Johnson and
carry my phone does Google know that I
was sitting here and then I moved over
there you're welcome anytime judge yes
or no I genuinely don't know without
knowing the shocks they don't know I
think Google obviously does are you
familiar with the general data
protection regulation by the European
Union very familiar we have looked over
18 months on it and the European Union
is protecting the right of privacy of
the people in Europe we don't have such
a law in the United States do it
congressman we've supported and we do
not have such a law in the United States
do we we don't have a comprehensive user
data privacy there are you familiar
without in resolution 1039 it's a
resolution that I've introduced that
would basically adopt some of the
peon practices in America and give
consumers in the United States the right
of privacy are you familiar with that
legislation
no but I'm how to give you a cop before
you leave it's ironic to me that the
United States supposed to be the the
country in the world that protects
privacy of individuals more than anybody
else we are playing second fiddle to the
Europeans they protect the privacy of
their folks more than we do and I think
the United States Congress needs to move
in a direction to to allow citizens to
opt in to the dissemination of their
information rather than opt out which
seems to be the current law as mr. Cohen
has stated I think most Americans don't
know all the things that this phone can
do and one thing that it can do is
disseminate information really that we
are unaware of to all different people
out there United States should change
the rules and make it so that we as
consumers opt in otherwise that
information is not disseminated that is
just just my opinion what does Google
view as objectionable I think there are
if you're referring to our content
policies we do we do publish there are
areas for example categories for YouTube
like violent extremism pornography child
safety fraudulent activities so we
define categories what are extreme
political views you you find those
objectionable not saying you shouldn't
I'm just saying what are those extreme
political views we don't we think it's
important Google and YouTube are
platforms which are which support what
are those extreme political views that
you find objectionable we don't define
any political views as objectionable you
let all political views come on even
objectionable or political views we have
areas which we have defined as not
allowed on our platforms for example on
YouTube there are clear definitions
around hate speech but
it's defined as speech with just a
primary goal of inciting hatred or
violence to its groups of people you
would agree that hate speech has many
different definitions depending on who's
doing the defining wouldn't you agree we
we understand it's a subjective area
could be open to interpretation but we
define it and we publish our definition
of it and we do you believe that Google
has been has been brought out here and
some question is biased congressman it's
really important to me that we approach
our work in an unbiased you believe that
Google is biased it's either yes or no
no not in our approach it is a private
company is it not yes it is it's not the
government
Google is not the government is it not
Allah state check no you want the
government to regulate Google today we
are subject to a lot of regulation
across many different agencies but
you're not subject to the definition of
what bias is by the government coming in
and saying Google cannot be bias and we
the government are going to decide
what's bias and what's not bias you're
not subject to that philosophy or you
know not today I hope we don't get to
that point where government tries to
come in and regulate what bias is and
because it is this is a an independent
free company I think that we're just you
know Google may have to me it's just the
part of it doing business like any other
media outlet they can say what they want
I've gone over time mr. chairman I have
some other questions I'd like to submit
for the record well mr. chairman if I
might
the gentleman is certainly welcome to
join me on this side of the aisle as
which part is at any time getting a
little late in his career right
I will just respond to the gentleman
from Texas and say that we will be
submitting questions in writing to you
mr. Boucher including the ones from the
gentleman from Texas and we would ask
that you answer them promptly be very
happy - thank you very much the chair
now recognizes gentleman from Florida
mr. Deutsch for five minutes
Thank You mr. chairman mr. Pichardo I
believe that the platform's can and
should do a better job preventing people
from using services to engage in illegal
activity Tim Cook recently said
platforms and algorithms that promise to
improve our lives can actually magnify
our worst human tendencies some of your
peers are publicly reckoning with the
ways their companies are not neutral
platforms and are accountable for the
content on the services in congressional
testimony mark zuckerberg said his
company is responsible for the content
on its platform and a washington post
interview uber CEO derrick ostrich ah he
said we have to stand for the content of
our platforms we can't just say we're a
platform and our job is done mr. H I
will you in front of our committee this
war --any join your peers and affirm
that Google is accountable for the
content on your platforms we are we have
a commitment to our users to provide
accurate and trustworthy information
high-quality information I worked up all
those commitments I'll take that as yes
I want to return to that privacy
discussion that's gone on and I wish I
went to the to do a privacy check out
while we're sitting here and you're
right it's it's quite good but I want to
talk about what it does and what it
doesn't do and and perhaps you can help
me work through this a bit I my settings
down on Google my location history is
paused my device information is paused
my voice and audio activity are paused
my YouTube watch history is paused
that's probably a good thing in my
youtube search history is paused that
said it doesn't mean that you're not
collecting data on me does it I think if
you follow those categories if you
possibly stop collecting I understand
but overall it doesn't mean that you're
not you've stopped collecting data
you're still collecting data on search
you're still collecting data on ways
that can that can help advertising and
help provide the services that you
provide
I appreciate that my question is
I wanted to focus also on the New York
Times article about the what they refer
to as the mobile location industry and
and I I understand the way that data is
collected when you talk on your website
about about searching Google getting
directions for maps or watch of it
watching videos and YouTube you collect
out it and make services work better I
understand that but data is also
collected to use in advertising and
according to the New York Times story
it's a hot market sales of location
targeted advertising reaching an
estimated 21 billion dollars this year
it talks about your company and Facebook
dominating the mobile ad market that
also lead in location-based advertising
and it says that Google also receives
precise location information from apps
that use its ad services can you explain
that to me is is the New York Times
saying that if there is any company that
uses your ad services and given the
dominant place that you play in
advertising that would be I would
imagine most if there is any company
that uses your advertising then that
data that they collect would also be
available to you ultimately the data
they collect on me is the question I'm
asking so we as a company and you know
we have commitments to you we view our
data as belonging to use as via stewards
of it so we don't transmit personal data
to advertisers if I know I understand
that I'm asking about the I'm asking
about the data that companies because
the the New York Times said that that
Google receives precise location
information from apps that use its ad
service my question is do you receive
information as New York Times right do
you receive information about the
locations that I travel from from
companies who use your advertising
service you know I just want to make
sure I understand the specifics but
there may be information so for example
if you are providing an ad
and and let's say it's for a restaurant
we normally would do it in a location
near you so that it's relevant for you
you have an option to turn that setting
off but if it is since we are providing
that information we would be aware of it
it's not coming from that company to us
but rapid it no no but that's what
that's what I want to understand if if
the ad if a company uses your
advertising does their location sharing
get to you and here's why let me just
cut cuz I have a lot of time
The Times talks about the information
isn't tied to someone's name or phone
number your personal information as you
define it seems to be name email address
and billing information the question a
lot of us have mr. Petrak I think you
can sense is that while that may be
personal information and you treat that
and you treat that the way we would
expect that there is a lot of
information about where we go and where
we are at any moment that can as the
Times points out allow someone with
access to the raw data including
employees or clients to identify a
person without their consent by
following someone the new pinpointing a
phone that regularly spent time at that
person's home address can you use the
locations that people go to identify to
back into who a person is you wouldn't
do it but could someone else do that
same thing we wouldn't do that without
use explicit user consent to answer your
question you know I'm happy to follow up
I want to make sure I address that it's
a specific question I think at a high
level I would say location is turning
out to be an important area ask me
consider privacy legislation I you know
I think it's important we give location
production for our users as a company we
want to lead the way and we are and I
have to give AI just one last question
mr. Shermer the time of the gentleman
has expired the chair recognizes the
gentleman from Pennsylvania mr. Marino
Thank You chairman and thank you for
being here all of you let me start out
by saying that sir you and your office
every company I think particularly you
because you are at the helm have a
tremendous responsibility responsibility
towards your employees
responsibilities towards your
stockholders to your company providing
jobs and we thank you for providing jobs
but I think you also have a much more
awesome responsibility to the American
people to make sure that you educate
accurately to make sure that you stay in
the middle of the road because I've
learned this over the years as a
prosecutor and more so as a member of
Congress there is a lot of people who
believe everything that's put out by
anyone we're a ten-second society now
and we can't hold conversations we can
only read you know 10 or 12 words and
that's supposedly the gospel you have a
responsibility to see that the truth is
out there and I hold you to doing that I
don't believe in government taking
control or defining as my friend the
judge says what is right and what is
wrong
I for one the less federal government in
my life the better so I am depending on
you and companies like your company help
us along the lines because if the
federal government does ever step in to
regulate you're not gonna like it
and that said I have a concern
concerning China in 2010 Google left the
Chinese market place due to concerns
over hack hacking attacks censorship and
how the Chinese government was possibly
gaining access to data I'm interested in
what has changed since 2010 and how
working with the Chinese government to
censor research results are part of
Google's core values do you understand
my question congressman we right now
there are no plans for us to launch a
search product in China we are in
general always looking to see how best
it's part of our
core mission and our principles to try
hard to provide users with information
we we always have evidence based on
every country we have operated in us
reaching out and giving users to more
information has a very positive impact
and and we feel that calling but right
now there are no plans to launch in
China to the extent that we we ever you
know approach a decision like that I I
will be fully transparent including with
policymakers here and and engage in
consult widely am I then to understand
that there's you have no plans to enter
into any agreements with China
concerning Google how it's used in China
we currently do not have a search
product there and so you know you plan
on having a search product there right
now there are no plans to launch a
search product in China let me ask it
this way if in the future you decide to
do that what information would you share
with the Chinese concerning other users
other countries any time we look to
operate in a country I mean we would you
know we would look at what what the
conditions are to operate there are
times in the past we have debated the
conditions to operate and and we explore
a wide range of possibilities currently
it is an effort only internally for us
the we are not doing this in China and
so you know but I happy to consult back
and be transparent direction we planned
something there I'm sure you are aware
that right now there are thousands maybe
hundreds of thousands of people that the
Chinese government has on computers
trying to hack in the US and any other
countries same thing taking place so to
a lesser degree in in Russia simply
because of the population what what can
google do to help curtail that if not
eliminate
countries from hacking into other
countries as a company we have faced
significant attacks before so you know
protecting the security of our uses is
what really keeps me up at night and
it's something we invest a lot over the
years we work with law enforcement
because we rely on their intelligence to
help us assess threats but it's a
comprehensive effort and and it's
something we take seriously thank you I
yield back but remember the
responsibility that I think you have she
recognized the gentlewoman from
California miss bass for five minutes
Thank You mr. chair and thank you for
coming today I wanted to follow up on
some questions that were asked of you
earlier specifically the use of BOTS by
authoritarian regimes and also the use
of troll farms by Russia and wanted to
know if you could be more specific in
terms of how Google is going to respond
in other words will you expand your
staff or modify their algorithms in an
effort to identify and eradicate the
online trolls and then in terms of the
flooding that takes place with BOTS what
specifically will you do to address this
this is something we actually face
across the set of products we do today
beat our ad systems beat our search
products people are trying to spam and
be it YouTube and so on so in general
we've built systems over the years to
detect anomalous traffic patterns and
and mitigate that and we also learned we
collaborate with others law enforcement
has been very helpful to us in this
regard so if they so the example of the
other bots where you have I mean I saw
one example where there was one day a
hundred and twenty five dislikes in the
next day there were 84,000 how do you
respond in a situation like that words
obviously it's done purposely so when we
see viewcount manipulation manipulation
of likes dislikes and either we get
reports or we deduct in our systems
spikes in those activities which you
know which make it clear that it's it's
not humans doing it you know we deducted
we treated as spam or abuse of our
systems you have
staff dedicated to looking at that yeah
both we have our algorithms AI systems
and manual reviewers and and we are
staffing up our manual reviewers
significantly over the past couple of
years and so we do it comprehensively
across all those things so anticipating
what took place in 2016 happening again
and and this is specifically regarding
what Russia did to foment racial
tensions in the United States and
wanting to know how you are responding
to that were they called for you know
fake protests either to get African
Americans to turn out to protest
something that was fake or to have white
supremists be gender to attack
communities of color so specifically
what is Google doing to respond to that
we mainly saw with respect to Russia
limited improper activity on our ad
platforms but in general you know we are
not a social networking company across
the products we do it's an area we
haven't done well as a company so we
typically aren't connecting groups of
people and that's not how Google mainly
works today
and so we haven't seen that kind of
activities on our platforms but we are
vigilant and you know and happy to share
any findings which come through as we
look into it more so I also wanted to
ask you a couple of question about
online creators of color where
mainstream media outlets often fail to
cater to communities of color with
relatable content or resolve lingering
issues of under-representation or
misrepresentation communities of color
have sought out digital mediums to tell
their stories and in some cases this has
been very successful and it's led to
larger networks recognizing the talent
and in other cases it's given a platform
to voices that would otherwise be
silenced so I wanted to know what
policies Google might be developing to
put in place to ensure that the voice of
online creators can expand youtuber has
a lot of community outreach programs we
partner with other organizations who do
important work in this area but today
you know when we look look at YouTube we
do see a platform with
very diverse set of perspectives and
opinions it's partly the strength of the
platform and and the reach it provides
to voices and then could I get the
information about your outreach
specifically who you do outreach to that
would be very helpful very happy to do
that now yield back my time to
representative Deutsch thanks I think my
friend from California mr. pitch I just
wanted to finish up again appreciate you
being here and I wanted to follow up on
something that the Chairman started our
hearing with and that was a question
about information collected by Google I
think the report that he referred to
talked about information collected
specifically on Android phones even if
those even if those phones aren't on
Wi-Fi or or the cell service isn't all I
know is that something that happens
congressman it's not clear to me how
something when there's no connectivity
would happen but you know so we haven't
I'm sorry some I'm aware of those
concerns but we haven't been able to
substantiate those specific findings
you're looking into those findings
though there's an area where we are you
know our goal is to you know we're
trying to help users with the
information they want today there are
many cases users give us feedback part
of part of what we are trying to do is
they want us to be location aware and
you know I I understand but but you're
not aware of data being collected while
the phone is not connected to either
cell service or Wi-Fi yeah there may be
specific instances for example GPS may
be working and so you know it depends on
the specifics and so that finally the
question is if that information is if if
that's possible if you learned that it
is happening and I would love you to
share that with us if you learn that's
happening and the information then when
the can the customer turns on his his or
her cell service if that information is
then sent back to your company on their
data plan a lot of people obviously have
limited data plans when you look at this
if you could also look at whether when
the information is sent back to the
extent it's happening that it might
cause some people to go
for their limits thereby costing them
more on their monthly bill that would be
helpful information as well that's a
good feedback we will okay Thank You mr.
Shah Thank You mr. chairman
cheering nice gentleman from Georgia mr.
Collins for five minutes
Thank You mr. chair and they miss being
here look there is an understanding I
think it's come across from everyone
here and it's saying that I've sort of
lived by most of my adult life and I
think most people get perception is
reality
now you can disagree with the perception
you can disagree with the reality but
it's a certain point in time as you've
even heard from many of the folks
discussing on both sides of the aisle
today
there's several perceptions that are
going on on what's being stored what's
not being stored and how that is or how
that date and that privacy issue and
also the effects or the outcomes of the
searches are made now one of the other
issues not just Google itself but also
YouTube there's another issue that I
will not touch today but probably will
do some questions on is the issue of
content and the issue of how that is
stolen in many cases and how that could
be worked on those issues will deal with
another setting we've talked about this
but I want to go through several
question because it's been discussed a
lot about what you collect and what you
don't collect so the next few questions
will be yes/no question they're not I'm
not trying to trick you here it's simply
what you collect and how do you collect
it okay
in dealing with Google do you or do not
collect identifiers like name age and
address yes or no if you're creating an
account yeah yes and using an account
yes specific search histories when
person types something into a search
more if you have search history turned
on yes device identifiers like IP
address or I am he depending on the
situation we could be collecting it yes
GPS signals Wi-Fi signals Bluetooth
beacons it would depend on the specifics
so but there may be situations yes GPS
yes yes if you have for some
conversations when using Google Voice
products we give an option to turn on or
often leave that if a person didn't know
a voice in conversations when using
Google Voice products we only record
when they initiated with okay Google and
then say the terms after contents of
emails and in Google Documents we store
the data but we don't read
look at your Gmail you have access to
them as a company we have access to them
yes so you could saying you don't heard
I'm not asking do you or don't I'm
saying you could though there is a
possibility we have clear established
policies on how he would do that data
and their privacy policy speaking of
that has changed 28 times including
eight times since January 2016 so I
think the policies are you know and this
is why I'm asking these questions is
there any type of or any type or origin
of data which Google would refuse to
collect that is not already prohibited
by laws like Coppa or HIPPA and there
are many categories of information today
you know via particular about anything
to do with health data those are covered
under those anything that you would not
collect outside of the two that I named
which are generally accepted as things
you cannot collect there are many things
which we don't collect for example we
don't collect you could have a product
like Google home you won't collect
conversations unless you specifically
ask us to so you ask a question and so
we definitely are very careful and
minimize the data we need to provide the
service back to our users I'm glad you
mentioned itemization we'll get to that
in just a second how long do you keep
the data that you have captured today we
give you the choice of whether you want
to store the data or not but if you
store the data from the time you turn it
on we store it for you okay well let me
ask a question here for all this has
been discussed I ate identifiers purged
histories all these things and for the
how many would you say only just that
you've interested might require how many
people actually understand that they can
actually cut this off we remind the
remain people and every day 20 million
people come and make changes in these
settings of ysidro that's not you
control 95% of searches you control this
in a very large way I would say the vast
majority not the most sophisticated not
the ones in a certain to age demographic
are not as familiar with this as say
some who work in the industry or at
least around the industry would that not
be a fair statement if you did it'd be
that congressmen to him I'll get back to
it earlier was said that identifiers
such as age name and address are treated
differently if that is true how are you
treating them differently and is the
same data collection process still done
how is it treated differently than maybe
some of these others that
we have spoke of a king I think from mr.
Dores discussions such as locators and
things like that we we offer different
controls for that so for example for
location we give specific controls for
your voice and voice activity we give
specific controls we are trying to meet
users expectations and so for example
some people may want their search
history to be available but they don't
want YouTube history to be recorded so
we give those choices to our users one
of the general dynamics of most of the
news tech industry and those who collect
data is data minimization you brought it
up just a few minutes ago the issue that
I have in there was in March of this
year a security researcher actually
downloaded his quote Google takeout this
is probably there it was 5.5 gigabyte
this is not a just a few names and
addresses and where you went
the why number one does Google need all
this information we can answer that in
the fact that 85 for safety six percent
of your revenue comes from advertising
so we know you manipulate the data in
some ways however can you explain what
you do to minimize this data which is
generally an accepted standard practice
among those who collect data you know
our goal is you know but we are
providing for example if we are
providing you a service like Gmail which
we have done for 15 years that data we
need to store it for our users so they
expect us to so we are trying hard to
match users expectations we don't need
you know our data for advertising as I
said earlier most of it comes from just
the keywords you type and so you know we
need minimal data to do advertising we
give you options to turn ads
personalization off we stole most of the
data we do today to help give users the
experience they want and that's what
we're trying to do I'm gonna go back to
where I started perception is reality
the amount of data being clicked here
the how it is being used how you
monetize the one at basically the flow
of information that you have and the
monetization of that is a concern I
think the perception of how it is used
and from what side of the aisle is
something that this committee I think
will take up and continue to process but
I think when most people deal with this
what I said earlier I'm not sure that in
the broad scope of things simply
clicking yes especially in a society
today in which some of these things and
especially there was talk about mobile
which we've not dealt into even further
is
to open up a much larger situation which
is not just simply monetizing data it's
actually using information that can be
then used by either law enforcement or
others in legal proceedings that can
then be used against them they're not
going to understand exactly what is
going on with that my time is expiring
all for you here thanks gentlemen
she recognized gentleman from Rhode
Island mr. Cicilline Thank You mr.
pichai for being here
in 2006 internet pioneer Vint Cerf
testified on behalf of Google that the
open Internet was designed so that no
central gatekeeper could exert his
control to discriminate against rivals
consumers or other businesses since then
it's become increasingly clear that this
virtuous cycle of innovation is
fundamentally threatened by the
dominance of a few powerful companies
Tim berners-lee the inventor of the
World Wide Web made this point clear in
an open letter earlier this year where
he warned that the open Internet has
been compressed under the weight of a
few dominant platforms that have the
ability to harm competition and control
which ideas and opinions are seen and
shared online along with 83% of
Americans I strongly support an open
decentralized Internet that is free of
powerful gatekeepers with the ability to
discriminate against rivals threaten
innovation or harm consumers with that
in mind I'm deeply concerned by reports
of Google's discriminatory conduct in
the market for internet search according
to findings by the European Commission
Google has harmed the competitive
process by favoring its own products and
services over rivals by de prioritizing
or delisting competitors content and so
my first question mr. Pachisia
as a proponent of internet openness will
Google commit to ending the
discrimination against rivals and other
businesses through Google's products
congressman with respect you know I
disagree with that characterization
we provide users with the best
experience they are looking for the most
relevant information and that's our true
north and that's how we approach our
products include the use of
discriminatory practices is that part of
your business model definitely not and
in the European Commission we are
appealing that decision when they looked
at shopping as a category they excluded
Amazon as a potential entrant in this
space so the specifics matter here we
are interested in providing users with
best information they are looking for
bead from another company and be it from
a competitor that that's what we are
interested in doing well I strongly
believe in structural antitrust
enforcement I also plan to work with the
Federal Trade Commission to develop a
legislation to address this type of
discriminatory conduct online will
Google commit to working together with
Congress on legislative proposals
designed to ensure that online firms
with significant market power are not
able to harm the competitive process to
discriminatory conduct you know we're
happy to engage constructively on on
legislation around any of these areas
thank you I like now to turn to the
question of China
mr. pitch I the operating environment in
China has deteriorated with respect to
surveillance censorship and the like
since Google first made the decision in
2010 to leave in September I sent you a
letter along with 15 other colleagues
raising serious concerns about reports
that Google is planning to re-enter the
Chinese market
with an app based search engine that
would likely have to comply with strict
censorship and surveillance requirements
imposed by the Chinese government
since then a widespread chorus of
opposition to such a move has emerged
including from lawmakers leading human
rights activists and a group of Google's
own employees that the environment has
deteriorated you're launching an app in
that environment would seem to be
completely inconsistent with Google's
recently launched AI principles which
say you will not design or deploy
technologies whose and I quote purpose
contravenes widely accepted principles
of international law and human rights
it's hard for me to imagine you could
operate in the Chinese market under the
current government framework and
maintain a commitment to universal
values such as freedom of expression and
personal privacy so I want to ask very
specifically are any employees currently
having product meetings on this quite on
this Chinese project and when if not
when did those end we have undertaken an
internal effort but right now there are
no plans to launch a search service in
China as I said earlier are there any
current discussions with any member of
the Chinese government on launching this
app
currently we are not in discussions
around launching a search product in
China are there any current discussions
with members of the Chinese government
about this yeah you know this effort
currently is an internal effort and you
know I'm happy to you know consult as
well as be transparent to the action we
take steps towards launching a product
in China and who at Google is leading
the dragonfly effort it's a you know our
efforts around building search you know
it's it's it's undertaken by our search
teams but these are distributed efforts
it's a limited effort internally
currently will you mister which I rule
out launching a tool for surveillance
and censorship in China while you are
CEO of Google congressman I commit to
engaging one of the things which is
important to us as a company we have a
stated mission of providing users with
information and so we always we think
it's in our duty to explore
possibilities to give users access to
information and you know I have that
commitment but you know as I said
earlier on this will be very thoughtful
and we will engage widely as we make
progress well I appreciate that and let
me be clear this goes beyond Google and
frankly beyond China at a moment of
rising authoritarianism around the world
when more leaders are using surveillance
censorship and repression against their
own people or in a moment that we must
reassert American moral leadership and I
think it's important that because other
countries will look at that relationship
and mr. chairman with that I would ask
unanimous consent to submit for the
record 15 the letter of 15 colleagues
and I sent to mr. pachai his response
and a letter from more than 50 human and
civil rights organizations opposing the
launch of a sensory google search engine
for the Chinese market and I would just
note mr. chairman that in the submission
of this for you know this consent the
NGO letter reports that and I quote the
Chinese government is actively promoting
its model of pervasive digital
censorship and surveillance around the
world many governments look to China's
example and a major industry leaders
acquiescence to such demands will likely
cause many other regimes to follow
China's lead provoking a race to the
bottom and standards
it would also undermine efforts by
Google and other companies to resist
government
this surveillance requests in order to
protect users privacy and security in
bold inning state intelligence and
security agencies to demand greater
access to user data so the implications
will be that objection so ordered here
now recognized as general Florida miss
to get Thank You mr. chairman
have you ever launched an investigation
into whether political bias is impacting
the consumer experience congressman we
we do to the extent that our consents we
look into them and you know have you
have you expressly launched an
investigation into political bias of
your employees on our employees you said
yes you know to the extent we know we
always take we take any allegations
around code of conduct across every
issue seriously and we look into them
you said to me yesterday that in as it
relates a political bias you haven't
launched those investigations because
there are so many redundancies and
there's so much peer review that that
would not be possible that's still your
testimony today congressman you see it's
it's the the way our processes work if
you need to make a change in our
algorithms there are several steps in
the process including launch committees
and and user testing and our rater
guideline evaluate your company your
employees can get together and chat in
groups right Google Groups yes they can
one of those groups is the civil rights
group right we have a many employees
esource groups on which they can
participate in conversations yes have
you ever looked into the conversation
into the resist group congressman no is
it does that strike is that a surprise
to you that there's a resist group I'm
not aware that if such a group exists or
not if there was a resist group would
that be the type of thing that you would
want to look into we have clear policies
around how our products are built and if
there's a resist you know that the
resist movement is a movement built to
resist the agenda of President Trump if
there's a resist group within your
company where groups of employees not
one are getting together within that
group to engage in discourse on company
time with company infrastructure does
that strike you as the type of thing you
would
investigate congressman not aware of any
such group now none like that has been
brought to my attention and you know
happy to follow up the you know and
understand the consent better yeah mr.
chairman I I seek unanimous consent to
enter into the record a document from
what purports to be Google employee
miles Boren's which is opposed to the
google group resist that objectives
order I'm also reading now from the
discussion that occurred over Breitbart
and Google ads and and I'm quoting from
one of your employees who purportedly
posted anyone want to hold their nose
and look through breitbart.com for hate
speech why would someone need to hold
their nose to do that work congressman
today we have we have 90,000 employees
and they they communicate in forums as a
company we have allowed freedom of
expression and we don't stand or condone
you know comments expressed in these
things we're very clear about our
policies as to how we build our products
and and you know we serve our publishers
that way well if if you haven't launched
an investigation and any of your
employees because it would take a group
of employees to engage in improper
conduct and if those groups of employees
are engaging in discussion on your
platform and if one of those platform
groups is resist and if on that resist
movement site or any other sites in your
platform there's discussion of
suppressing conservative speech why
would that not be something that you
would launch an internal investigation
in publish the reports sanction those
employees that may or may not be engaged
in improper conduct so that we can all
have greater comfort in the in the user
experience congressman first of all I
want our show you we have checks and
balances so that employees and we not
just on this issue across any issue we
protect the sanctity of our systems our
product development process and we would
do that how can I have confidence that
you're protecting the sanctity of your
system when you don't even know that
your employees are getting together on
your own company's infrastructure to
talk about political activity in general
we always assume our systems are
designed we assumed there could be bad
intent so we've designed from first
principles because you know for security
reasons both externally and internally
at
any given moment we we assume that
somebody may be acting in bad faith and
and that's how we have designed our
systems with all the productions in
place we need to do that for our
security of our systems and it's a first
principles approach so if your
assumption is that people can act in bad
faith why then have you not launched an
investigation into the communications
that seem to indicate a desire to
suppress conservative political
movements and conservative voices well
if there are allegations around you know
discussions which are specific with the
intent of manipulating our products we
would conduct an investigation well
that's good to hear The Wall Street
Journal reported that your workers were
discussing tweaking search terms to
frame the discussion over the travel ban
did you perform an investigation into
that allegation we looked into it there
was no attempt at you know anything to
influence our products there are at
times during important news events
important for example during events like
hurricanes etc we have a set of tools
crisis response tools during the travel
ban even the Department of Homeland
Security was looking to put out
information because there was some
confusion around the event so there was
some discussion around things like that
- and I would strongly suggest that one
of the crisis response tools that you
use is in an investigation into the
discourse of your employees on resisting
the trump presidency resisting the Trump
agenda and then smothering some of the
conservative outlets that seem to
amplify that content I yield back mr.
chair
gentleman yields back the chair now
recognizes gentleman miss Waller Thank
You mr. chairman welcome mr. pachai I
represent a congressional district in
the San Francisco Bay Area where a
number of my constituents work at Google
and I was hoping we could dive into some
concerns I hear from them but also that
I hear from constituents who just have
concerns about privacy does the United
States need a national privacy law
congressman I'm of the view given how
important privacy is that we are better
off with you know more of a single
overarching moving the microphone in
front of your mouth so we can hear you
better thank you thank you I'm off the
opinion that we are better off that with
more of a overarching you know data
production framework which for it uses
and I think that would be good to do and
you know in Europe just last year they
implemented the general data protection
regulation known as GD P R and the goals
were for consumers to know to understand
and consent and would you agree that if
there was a framework in the United
States to have a national privacy law
that would be the you know critical
framework to have no understanding
consent you know we've had quite a bit
of experience now working with GD P R
and we have done it for many many months
and you know I think there are you know
I think it's a well-thought-out crafted
piece of legislation I do think there's
some value for companies to have
consistent global regulations I think
it's also important for users as they
navigate services globally and so I do
see value in aligning where we can mr.
patria is part of Russia's attack on our
democracy in 2016 it used ads on your
platform on Facebook's platform on
Twitter's platform and money was
provided in rubles and from Russia
addresses what has Google done to make
sure this doesn't happen again and just
last week secretary mattis confirmed
that Russia continued its attack on our
democracy in the most recent midterm
elections a congressman has said earlier
it's never been missed a lot I mean we
did see limited improper activity and
you know obviously we learned from that
we've been very transparent with our
findings leading up over the past couple
of years anytime we have found other
activity you know which is material we
disclose it and we are constantly
evolving the practices we do but you
know I do say our efforts have been
pretty successful so far Google as a
whole through both our election cycles
but it's an area where it's never enough
and you know so you're constantly
vigilant and doing more in mr. pichai I
don't think anyone disagrees that seen
an answer on a results page for certain
queries can be useful for example if I
type in you know
what is 25 times 15 and Google spits out
375 that's useful but today you know if
my wife was to search for a pediatrician
in Dublin California instead of being
matched with the most relevant
information from across the web
according to Google's algorithms my wife
or any mom would see a map that is
powered by Google's ecosystem of local
reviews and in response to claims that
Google has put its own results ahead of
its competitors when its PageRank
algorithm believes the competitors
should be ranked higher Google has told
certain international enforcers that
local search results come from a
specialized index which is distinct from
its organic web indexed and I was hoping
today you could clarify for me is it
technically possible for Google to
compare local business content it
collects against that of content
collected by third-party services using
a PageRank like quality score you know
we employ a wide variety of signals we
are interested in providing users we
respond to user feedback so as a user
you could be on a mobile phone with very
limited connectivity you could be a busy
parent on your way and you're checking
for some information maybe trying to
find a doctor because your kid is sick
and so we are looking to see how we can
get that information to you as quickly
as possible that's the use case which
drives our product development and and
if that information is best available
from another company we make it
available there are times we are able to
provide that information because we have
better information and so we are
constantly looking and and and and we do
that to the best of our ability thank
you at this time the chair recognizes
the gentleman Anza
Thank You mr. chairman mr. Pichai we
want to thank you for appearing today
and for taking the time to answer and
meet with us individually answer our
questions I think you and I both agree
it's important for your company and for
the people for us to have this public
hearing and to get all this information
on the record so to speak so as we
discussed in my office yesterday my
conservative colleagues and I are fierce
advocates of limited government and
we're also committed guardians of free
speech in the free marketplace of ideas
we do not want to impose
some government regulations on your
industry however we do believe we have
an affirmative duty to ensure that the
engine that processes as much as we've
said today 90% of all internet searches
is never used to unfairly censor
conservative viewpoints or suppress
political views your challenge today and
in the days ahead is to convince the
members of this body that Google and
your industry peers will implement your
own sufficient safeguards and solutions
to this problem so that the government
doesn't have to intervene here's a
question in previous hearings and
discussions Google has described the
trusted flagger program as a source for
recommending content be removed from
your platform recently Google released a
transparency report on content removal
which revealed that out of the seven
point seven million automated flagging
removals from your platform YouTube
around 70 percent of that content was
removed before it had received any views
from the public here's the question how
does Google ensure that content removed
in the automated process is not merely
because of philosophical or political
differences congressman it's an
important question as you said YouTube
is committed to being a platform for
freedom of expression and you know we we
go to great lengths to do that
we only handle videos in the areas of
clearly defined policies we have we do
have automated systems but you know we
assess that we later spot check it to
make sure the system is working as
intended we respond to feedback as
content creators you can appeal if you
think something was remote erroneously
but it's really important to us that we
provide a platform for freedom of
expression but enforce the rules of the
road on areas where we have said and but
we are very transparent about the areas
and the clear policies with which we do
those things you've spoken a lot today
about objectivity that's the goal
we applaud and appreciate that as you
know alphabets Incubator jigsaw has
introduced perspective it's a tool that
uses machine learning to filter online
discussions for quote toxicity unquote
this to me raises issues of how Google's
parent company is using machine learning
to filter speech that is viewed as
unproductive such as ad hominem attacks
or offensive language or the like
when creating a tool like perspective
what steps is Google taking to protect
conservative viewpoints from being
considered toxic by subjective or
viewers as the program progresses almost
when perspective provided by one of our
sister organizations jigsaw it's a
platform for publishers to use so the
publishers get to define what they want
acceptable or not and and and then
that's what the - you know provides for
them but I think your point is valid I
mean we we don't want to be in the in
the position of just editorializing
publisher content and we're just
providing a tool for publishers to
better drive the content on their
platforms
you mentioned the appeals process if a
content provider has their material
flagged
how quick does that appeals process work
in other words what's the review period
I think it varies we prioritize areas
which are sensitive for example areas
like terrorism is something we
prioritize very significantly and higher
up in the queue but we are ramping up
our resources and our goal is to do it
as soon as possible but you know
sometimes it can be a matter of hours if
it's areas around copyright we have
implemented Content ID we have a system
by which we can automatically detect and
respond right away back to copyright
owners so it's a constant work in
progress in the committee's last hearing
with Google's mrs. Jennifer Downes we
discussed this I raised the case of the
Alliance defending freedom content being
removed after being reported by a
trusted flagger on YouTube the the
flagging organization where the sub was
the Southern Poverty Law Center which
has a kind of an infamous reputation for
being I would say radical left
organization that opposes conservative
viewpoints what criteria does Google use
when granting trusted flagger status to
third parties such as the SPLC you know
today we first want to clarify one thing
our clustered flavors don't remove
content they can flag content for us to
review and and we review flat content
it's mostly used by law enforcement many
many nonprofit agencies in in areas
important areas like child safety
terrorism and so on
Southern Poverty Law Center is a trusted
flattered
can't register last we checked they've
never flagged a single video on our
platform we have reached out to a wide
variety of organizations including
conservative organizations we would be
happy to take your suggestions to add
you know organizations as trusted
flaggers I appreciate that we need a
little objectivity and the reviewers and
I yield back
Joe masala is bar the chair now
recognizes gentleman from California mr.
Lu Thank You mr. chair this is now the
fourth hearing in a series of ridiculous
hearings on a free speech of Internet
companies a significant portion of this
hearing was a waste of time because the
First Amendment protects private
individuals and corporations free speech
rights now there are things that Google
does unrelated to speech that I disagree
with when comes to search algorithms
your prioritization what videos you want
to show the First Amendment protects you
so I'm going to ask you a series of
questions some of them are fairly basic
and I apologize but I feel like I have
to educate some of my colleagues and how
the US Constitution works and feel free
to answer yes or no so my first question
is we here on the Judiciary Committee or
the government and Google is a
corporation correct yes or no yes all
right the First Amendment limits what
government can do in regulating the
content of speech it does not limit
Google but Google does have to follow
corporate laws and other laws and under
those laws you and your board of
directors have a fiduciary duty to your
shareholders correct yes and one of the
ways that Google generates a profit is
when consumers use your search engine
they watch video some of them click on
ads they use your applications isn't
that one way you generate profit that's
one of the business models we hate and
if consumers were not getting the search
results they wanted or not
not getting the videos they wanted to
see they might start moving to your
competitors isn't that right every
Monday when I run my management meetings
yes we worry about the users have a lot
of choices so we work hard to earn their
trust every week and so that's how you
figure out
the number one thing users want to see
our dog and cat videos under the US
Constitution you have the absolute right
to promote dog and cat videos I'm not
saying you do that but you do have the
right to do that if you want to do isn't
that correct congressman you know I'm
not the expert on First Amendment but
generally I think that's right I thank
you so last week when I got noter it's
gonna have another one of these hearings
I did a search on Google I searched for
a Congressman Steve Scalise he has a
Republican and I hit the news tab and
the first four articles that come up or
generally pretty positive the first one
is from Town Hall a generally
conservative publication about his book
back in the game second article it's
also about his book back in the game
third is about him talking about he
lucky results forth is from Fox another
positive article about his book back in
the game you don't have a group of
people Google they're sitting there
thinking hey we like Steve Scalise so
we're going to generate positive
articles on these search results that's
not what's happening right you know Mary
glad to see Congressman Steve Scalise
fully record and back but we don't we
don't you know deal with individual
queries and you know if at any viewpoint
and so this fellow we're in your
programming code does Congressman Steve
Scalise even show up isn't that right
yes now I'm gonna do a real-time Google
search for a very similar term I'm gonna
change one word so I'm gonna search for
consequence Steve King I'm gonna hit the
news tab first or if that pops up from
ABC News
it says Steve King's racist immigration
talk prompts calls for congressional
censure that's a negative article but
you don't have a group of people Google
City they're thinking and trying to
modify search results every time Steve
King because it comes up a negative
article appears that's not what's
happening right always operate for any
query with the same set of principles we
are trying to reflect what is currently
you know for this newsworthy what is
currently being discussed about that
that that phrase thank you so let me
just conclude here by stating the
obvious
if you want positive search results do
positive things if you don't want nectar
search results don't do negative things
and to some of my colleagues across the
aisle if you're getting bad press
articles and bad search results don't
blame Google or Facebook or Twitter
consider blaming yourself I yield back
John's time has expired chair now
recognizes gentleman from Arizona mr.
Biggs Thank You mr. chairman thanks for
being here mr. Boucher I I don't
disagree with with one point made by the
last interrogative it let's calm
questioner that's easier to say in the
sense that I think you have a First
Amendment right to do what you guys want
to do it so your private company there's
very few constraints on the First
Amendment although there are lots of
constraints ultimately when we start
looking at everything from libel to
slander to threatening intimidating to
the only fire in the crowded theater
there's we have constraints on First
Amendment speech but you've seemed as
we've gone through here today to say
that Google doesn't have bias you
yourself have said you personally don't
have bias or animus and you've also
tried to implement policies to prevent
bias anonymous as well as that true yeah
we work hard to build our products in a
neutral way and I'm coming to doing it
that way all right and in some respects
we haven't heard much discussion about
the human intersection with the creation
or manipulation or editing of algorithms
but there is human interaction with the
create humans create the algorithms and
you might have some artificial
intelligence that might do some
additional information as it goes but
originally the creativity comes from the
humans right that's right well how can
we be assured that foreign adversaries
will not use your platform against
Americans or American national interest
and we we always worry about that that
has a threat vector and this is why we
make sure you know the best way we do it
when we are building our products
we don't rely on you know one person or
groups of people to be able to do it we
follow a set of robust process including
tests and validation both from users we
get feedback from users and we use
raters externally evaluate and we do
this for example our search Raiders in
the US are there in all the 50 states of
the u.s. we ja graphically distribute
them so that we really get the
perspectives of everyone around the
country
well that that doesn't really get to the
answering my question of security
assurance and so I guess if manipulation
of your information systems was not
possible or effective we would we would
not be seeing so many countries
investing in the capability of
manipulation whether it's Russians or
Chinese or Iranians or others that are
you know attempting to manipulate your
system and they may be there may be
attempts to use our products and
services so for example because we
provide advertising products you know
somebody and what we saw in the 2016
election was you know limited activity
but it's improper to accounts related to
Russia you know advertised using our
platforms that told 47 hundred bucks I
think you said yeah so that's an example
of you know the kind of threat we see
and you know it's something we're
working hard to mitigate and avoid and
so I I guess I would say that looks like
you guys have a policy of do no evil
right is that fair to say you do it's
not our official policy but you know
it's it's a statement which has been
communicated by us internally and and
other people have brought up the the the
work that you may or may not be doing in
China and I want a clarification of that
are you looking to expand in China and
cooperate with the Chinese government on
a platform release in China the question
it's about search right now we have no
plans to launch search in China we have
always over the years explored how best
we can continue to serve users in China
but that's what we're doing are you
doing anything with the data share with
Chinese government today we don't
operate our services which witch in
Wizard Atta
like Google search or Gmail in China and
so no so you tell me nothing at all then
with China we do provide you know for
example Android which is a operating
system we work with partners around the
world and and there are om manufactures
around the world including in China so
so manufacturers but beyond
manufacturers any any other platform use
we don't have any special agreements on
user data
today's government that's right okay do
you share the data that you collect on
civilians with the United States federal
government we comply with valid law
enforcement require request and you know
and we with due process we comply with
valid law and what's the extent of that
you know we publish a transparency
report in which we give insights into
the law enforcement requests we've
garden and our you know and and our
compliance there the last question I
have in real quickly in May 2016
Google banned all ads by payday lenders
even though it invested and Lind up
which is effectively a payday lender and
it banned ads by by competitors is that
a normal practice congressman we
undertook ad policies in that particular
area because we saw evidence of misuse
and we had gotten a lot of feedback and
that's what we reacted to did you did
you ban your own Lind up I don't think
Google is involved I think one of our
sister companies is a you know has has
an investment in Linda yeah I think
that's my understanding I can follow up
I'm not aware of the specifics they're
happy to follow Thank You mr. Raskin is
recognized Thank You mr. chair
welcome and thank you for your testimony
today do you know what frazzled drip is
I'm not aware of the specifics about it
I heard some references about it from
our from my team over the past 24 hours
um I just learned about in The
Washington Post this morning there's a
article with this headline a platform
for free speech that extremists
routinely exploit
and in it the article explains that the
recommendation engine for YouTube which
which is owned by Google correct yes the
recommendation engine for YouTube
recently suggested videos claiming that
politicians celebrities and other lead
figures were sexually abusing were
consuming the remains of children often
in satanic rituals according to watchdog
group algo transparency the claims echo
and often cite the discredited Pizza
Gate conspiracy which two years ago led
to a man firing shots into a Northwest
Washington DC pizzeria in search of
children he believed were being held as
sex slaves by Democratic Party leaders
one recent variation on the theory which
began spreading on YouTube this spring
claimed the Democrat Hillary Clinton in
her longtime aide Huma Abedin had
sexually assaulted a girl and drank her
blood a conspiracy theory its proponents
dubbed a frazzled drip now the article
goes on to describe how this frazzled
drip conspiracy is all over YouTube and
some of the frazzled drip clips purport
to show grainy images of Clinton and
Aberdeen committing crimes and speak of
invoking the death penalty in one video
which has been viewed seventy-seven
thousand times and remains online today
has a voice-over that says will these
children become the dessert the
conclusion of the meal so and this is
just one example that they use of
extreme right and paranoid conspiracy
groups using YouTube as a place to trade
their videos and to promote propaganda
what is your company policy on that and
are you trying to deal with it you know
we are we are constantly undertaking
effort to deal with misinformation but
you know we have clearly stated policies
and we have made lots of progress in
many of the areas where you know over
the past year so for example in areas
like terrorism child safety and so on we
are looking looking to do more you know
this was a recent thing but I'm
committed to following up on it and and
making sure we are evaluating these
against our policies but yes an area we
acknowledged there's more work to be
done and you know and we'll definitely
continue doing that one of the videos
discussed included images of a body on a
table before restrain children and of
Hillary Clinton with a bloodied mouth
and fangs claiming that she and Aberdeen
drank the blood of their victim that was
removed but then another consisting of
an exact copy of the video remained
online they're apparently remains online
so I mean is your basic position that
this is something you want to try to do
something about but basically there's
just an avalanche of such material and
there's really nothing that can be done
and it should be buyer beware or
consumer beware when you go on YouTube
you know if you do grapple with
difficulty issues maybe we have to look
at it on a video by video basis and we
have clearly stated policy so we would
need to evaluate whether the video the
specific video yeah while it's any of
our policies and we do strive to do it
for the volume of content we do get and
you know yeah around 400 hours of video
every minute but it's our responsibility
I think to make sure you know YouTube is
a platform for freedom of expression but
it's responsible and contributes
positively to society some of my
colleagues are upset about negative
references to Donald Trump not Hillary
Clinton or not Barack Obama and
obviously you know one potential
strategy today is to try to heckle you
into somehow playing favorites with
Donald Trump and Republicans I think
that that would be a silly and
ridiculous take away from this on the
other hand there is material which is a
true public danger you know you you've
got a right to have whatever politics
you have I mean we could we could
subpoena Fox News and bring them in here
and beat them up about how 90 percent of
the references on Fox News to Barack
Obama or Hillary Clinton are negative
but they've got that right under the
First Amendment you've got to write
under First Amendment to have whatever
political views you've got but I think
the point at which it becomes a matter
of serious public interest is
when your communications vehicle is
being used to promote propaganda that
leads to violent events like the guy
showing up within the pizza gate
conspiracy case and so I guess my
question is are you taking that threat
seriously I mean this time is experiment
you can ask the question Q we have very
clear policies against hate speech
things which could incite harm or hatred
or violence and you know that's an area
where we are clearly taking a lot of
action but I want to acknowledge there
is more work more work to be done and
you know with our growth comes more
responsibility and we are committed to
doing better as we invest more in this
area Thank You mr. chair now recognizes
gentlelady from Georgia mishandle Thank
You mr. chairman thank you very much for
being here mr. pachai four years of
Federal Trade Commission on a bipartisan
basis has affirmed that precise
geolocation information is considered
highly highly sensitive and that
consumers must opt in to that do you
agree with that yes I agree with that do
you think there's other information
privacy information of consumers that
should also be required to have opt in
versus opt out in general I think a
framework for privacy in which users
have a sense of transparency control and
choice and have clear understanding of
the trade-offs they need to make I think
is very good for consumers and we would
support that
and speaking of privacy and transparency
I'm trying to understand the difference
between I'm a paying customer for the
Google Suites versus the free Gmail so
when it comes to data collection are the
criteria and the rules the same if
you're on Google Suites versus Gmail
Gmail Google suite is a broader suite of
products than Gmail alone you know we
have very specific police policies
around Gmail in general we don't as a
company we don't read your Gmail unless
we have expressed consent from you for
example to investigate security or abuse
related to an account on Jay suite we
provide G suite across many instances we
have clear Paul
cease against that do we don't use it
but what I'm asking is are the policies
different we don't distinguish between
so for example today we provide G suite
for free to many educational
institutions we don't use that data for
from within G suite for our advertising
you collect it
well we store you know G suite involves
user documents speed documents or Gmail
so we store it for that for the user so
that they can access it and no one in
your company has access to it people
where they do have access your policies
that they cannot access it unless they
have specific consent from the user for
a specific situation well will be one of
those reasons for example you may want
to investigate fraudulent activity
related to your account and you know we
may ask for your permission to do that
do that there may be a valid law
enforcement requirement which we have to
comply with all right I'm gonna go back
to a Google takeout which my colleague
from Georgia asked about earlier I would
say that the average person probably has
never heard of Google takeout until
recently so when did it become available
we we we started this effort you know
I'm aware of it as early as over ten
years ago and we started building for
many of our products we started an
office in Chicago with the express goal
of providing users with this takeout
capabilities I think we were quite
unique and starting to work on that as a
company but there's more effort we plan
to do there who has access to it this is
for users so for example if you decide
to you know stop your gmail account and
you go with another email provider being
able to take your Gmail data with you
and that's what it's designed for
take orders for users here and but no
one from within Google or any other
place can come in to Google takeout and
get your information no it's it's
expressly designed for consumers to take
their data with them and understand what
it's designed for I'm asking who
practically can get access to it you
know we have very strict limitations on
access to sense its more than Joseph if
I were going to Google takeout for care
and handle I'm not the only person who
has acts
to my Google takeout you are the only
person who can take out your data but
I'm just saying you asked about internal
systems we have clear policies employees
can go looking at user data unless there
is a there are narrow set of
circumstances which may involve either
consent from the user or legal
situations etcetera all right is it free
yes so when a person takes their data
out or they want to go through and clean
up privacy and they delete is it really
deleted or is it just hidden if
depending on the service if you're
terminating your account and you you
delete the data it will take some time
and we communicate that to propagate
through our systems and and get removed
but we follow through on that
but it's deleted it's not just hidden
from sight it's deleted okay one last
question you said that your company
embarked on an initiative to register
people to vote how did you do that and
who did you target and in what States
all we you know so for example during
registration windows we you know we be
highlight we give people information
about where to register we do these
things representatively across for all
our users across the US and all
indications are that the participation
is uniformly high across our user base
so you know we do this with the express
goal of how did you do it did you send
out links did you send out voter
registration forms to people these time
inspire but you can ask the question for
example on on the Google homepage we may
say check where your polling places and
as a user you can click on it and we
give you the location of your closest
polling locations and the opening times
available to you that's following up on
that Thank You mr. chairman are you sure
and Eric is the gentlelady from
Washington State mr. job Thank You mr.
chairman and thank you mr. pachai for
coming to testify before us I for one
I'm thrilled that you as a company
encourage people to vote I think we
should all do that I'd love to see
Election Day as a holiday I've been
deeply concerned for some time about
employers mandating forced arbitration
rather than allowing for people to
pursue justice and forcing people into
arbitration when they've already
experienced
violation of their basic rights I think
is a deep injustice and it subjects
people who have already been victimized
to further victimization and we've seen
research that shows that it discourages
people from coming forward to report
abuses to begin with there are very
successful companies in your field
including companies like Salesforce that
have thrived while forgoing forced
arbitration contracts and clauses and I
think that we can all agree that the
argument that eliminating forced
arbitration threatens innovation should
be dismissed out of hand
eliminating forced arbitration has been
a shared priority by my colleagues on
this committee as evidenced by the fact
that our ranking member Jerry Nadler as
well as Hank Johnson David Cicilline and
I have all introduced legislation to end
the practice and I was very heartened to
see that Google ended forced arbitration
but only in the context of sexual
harassment and so I hope you agree with
me that upholding people's fundamental
right to safety in the workplace and
freedom from discrimination whether it's
based on gender or sexual orientation or
race or religion or any other metric
really benefits all of us and so I
wanted to point out that it's
particularly critical for companies like
Google to take that moral leadership in
this space since there are limitations
for affected people to pursue
system-wide change through tools like
class-action lawsuits and I recognize
that this is not exclusive to Google and
that it extends to many many other
employers but since you're here before
the committee today which has
jurisdiction over this issue I want to
ask you if you will voluntarily commit
to expanding the policy of ending forced
arbitration for any violation of a
person's rights not just around sexual
harassment but really for all of your
employers and your contractors
congresswoman thanks for the question
it's an important area one thing if I
could clarify today our arbitration
agreements don't require any
confidentiality provisions that's how we
have done it but but as you as you
mentioned for sexual harassment we
agreed that it should be up to the
employees and we gave them a choice we
are definitely looking into this further
it's an area where I've gotten feedback
personally from our employees so we are
currently reviewing what we could do and
you know I'm looking forward to
consulting and and happy to think about
more more changes here well we'd love to
work with you on that I think that this
really for people who are listening to
this hearing that may not understand
this basically when you sign a contract
as we saw with sexual harassment you
some some employees don't even know what
they're signing away but they're signing
away their ability to actually pursue
claims in the justice system by going to
forced arbitration and so I think that
this is very very important I think your
point about confidentiality is important
but that's not the issue here that is
about transparency but it's not about
the basic right of somebody to seek
access to due process and to justice in
the courts so what stage are you at in
advancing the issue of ending forced
arbitration both on the sexual
harassment side but also in terms of the
process for looking at it more broadly
how do we how do we have a timeline how
do we engage with you to make sure that
you endorse our legislation as we move
forward in the next Congress
we've already you know we've we've
already enacted the changes for forced
arbitration for giving arbitration as an
option for employees for sexual
harassment we are definitely reviewing
what more we could do in this area I'm
definitely happy to have my office
follow up as they're thinking about it
to get get your thoughts on it and we
are definitely committed to looking into
this more and making changes thank you
the other issue I wanted to just raise
in my last minute is moderating hate
speech and this has come up in a number
of different ways and we appreciate the
work that you have done particularly
with YouTube I know we had Alex Jones in
the room earlier but I think you know
promoting conspiracy theories that are
patently false and result in real harm
is a problem do you agree with the UN
High Commissioner for Human Rights
assessment that social media played a
role for example in perpetuate
perpetuating genocide against the Rho
hinga and what is Google's
responsibility to moderate hate speech
on on your platforms we feel a
tremendous sense of responsibility to
moderate hate speech you know define
we've defined hate speech clearly
inciting violence or hatred towards
groups of people it's absolutely
something which I think we need to take
a very strict line on and and we've
stated our policies clearly and we are
working hard to make our enforcement
better and and we have gotten a lot
better and but it's not enough and so we
are committed to doing more here well we
really look forward to working with you
on that and before I yield back mr.
chairman let me just take a point of
personal privilege to say I was born in
the same state as you in India and I'm
excited to see you leading a company and
continuing to show that immigrants to
this country contribute great value in
spite of some of the rhetoric we hear
Thank You mr. pitaya yield back
gentlemen's lady gentlelady's time has
expired now chair recognizes the
gentleman from Pennsylvania mr. office
Thank You mr. chairman Pichai thank you
for being here - appreciated the
reference to Pittsburgh in your opening
cesta money great to have you in a part
of our community there your company
really should be held out as a success
story of America's free enterprise
system Google has very powerful products
and services there is a saying that goes
with with great power comes great
responsibility I think he realized that
I want to talk a little bit about these
allegations of bias that have been out
there and you know I've seen the media
reports about a few Google engineers
lamenting the 2016 election results then
they discussed potentially manipulating
search results that would favor some
political viewpoints in the future on a
hypothetical level those Google
engineers believed that they had the
power to influence an election do you
think Google's products and services are
powerful enough that they can sway
public opinion to tilt enact an election
if the company wanted to are your
products that powerful congressman today
ABC uses get information from a wide
variety of sources and while Google is a
big player in search search is just one
of the ways in which people get
information they get it from social
networking sites use do you think that
your products are that powerful that's
not the way I think about it and we are
building building the products you know
we constantly worry about the area
where we are not doing well and we're
looking to do better we definitely see a
lot of innovation not just from within
the US but globally around the world and
and we do realize we are a large company
and with that comes scrutiny and we
think it's important to engage on that
you've testified about Google and its
algorithms working on a non-party in a
nine nonpartisan way and that you're
confident that Google does not approach
work with any political bias Zoe Lofgren
highlighted the vote in in Santa Clara
County does Google do anything to ensure
ideological diversity among its
employees and decision makers
congressman we've you know I've
communicated clearly to the company
that you know we need to welcome
viewpoints from across all sides as a
company we are you're right we are
definitely based in Northern California
and clearly you know there is a leaning
there but last year was the first year
we grew faster outside of California
than within California you also have
employees globally and I do see a wide
variety of opinions mr. Johnson asked a
question about the trusted flagger
program you said for us to review who's
the US who's doing the who's doing their
review we review things both with a
combination of our ottoman automated
systems as well as manual reviewers
these are people who are part of and how
many people is that how many is that a
committee is it you know in 20 committed
to scale up our manual reviewers to over
10,000 people and we're well underway to
do that and so there's a thousands of
people working 24/7 globally across
looking at content based on our policies
Google has described its ethic with
these pithy great statements don't be
evil do the right thing I'd like to
discuss these ideals in relation to
reports at Google that we've been
talking about with China the strict
authoritarianism the Chinese government
rules it's people has caused concern
around the globe for generations I
vividly recall their early days of June
1989 and Tiananmen Square
now reading reports recent reports about
crackdowns on Muslims Christians on
Falun Gong mass incarceration and human
rights abuses against people of faith
and China should be a major concern for
everyone around the world including your
company did Google design a prototype
for a search engine that could be used
in China to censor content congressman
we have undertaken an internal effort a
date did you create a prototype that
there was a report and the intercept
that says a prototype for the censored
search engine was designed we have a
world what search could look like if it
if it were to be launched in a country
like China and that's what we explored
and how many months was their project
ongoing we've had the project underway
for a while and there have been other
projects which we've undertaken for a
while and we've never launched them - so
it could be a constantly exploring how
many how many people the estimates you
know Chipman sorry the number of
Engineers on the project have varied
over time but then at one point we've
had over a hundred people working on it
it's my understanding I just want to
echo what my colleague miss Jo Powell
had had said you know yeah I'm glad
you're here at the committee but I'm
glad you're here in our country you are
the success story and I can just think
of you sitting as a teenager in India
thinking that this part was probably
never even on your your radar but you
came to this country because this
country had that promise out there and I
want to thank you for being here today
and encourage you to continue
collaborating with this committee thank
you the chair now recognizes the
gentlelady from Florida mr. Dimmick
thank you so much mr. chairman and mr.
Boucher I'm here thank you so much for
being here and enduring all that we have
heard and seen today as you know Google
certainly has significant influence over
the dissemination of information to the
American people
you have the ability to mold and shape
how we think the decisions we make what
we buy but let me just remind you and
others that America with all of his
greatness has enough problems and we
have to make sure that the gift of
Google is used the service that you
provide is a responsible one in your own
statement you said that the American
people have the ability to use
technology to improve their lives so
that tells me Google helps to solve
problems not create problems my concern
specifically centers around the
protection of the consumers because
Google certainly would not be anything
without the consumer so the protection
of the data their information the the
level of service that you provide and I
know we've talked a lot today about data
collection and how it's used and if the
settings are in place then it's not
collected so let me just understand
really starting with the Chairman's
questions which I thought was a good
opening for us if a consumer tells you
not to collect their data then you do
not collect the data is that correct
that's that's right okay and how does
Google or just Google allow advertisers
to target ads based on sensitive factors
like race ethnicity religious
affiliation currently if we don't have
those the ones you mentioned as factors
in our advertising product okay and what
is your policy regarding predatory
advertisements you know we have strict
policies against and you know we respond
to concerns there we've undertaken
significant changes to direction we find
predatory practices on our platform so
it's an area we are committed to doing
better and since we do represent
everybody
poor communities as well as affluent
communities how do you make sure that
the information that is received in
at-risk communities protects the
consumer if you will how are they
treated the same in terms of affluent
versus poor communities how do you make
sure that they are we do engage with
community organizations we do you know
our teams two wide outreach and to the
extent there are specific concerns which
you know there is an abuse of our
product or platform which affects you
know communities disparately we do
follow up and engage and take action and
how do you do that again please so for
example you know if there's a specific
category of a product where you know we
get clear feedback the baby of
implemented the product has a disparate
effect on some minority communities we
do engage and we understand and you know
make changes in our products or policies
so you get feedback so do you initiate
or do any checking or is does that
information have to come back to you or
are you proactive in terms of looking
for those type of vulnerabilities we do
both and you know but I do think there's
more we can do in being proactive and
it's something I'm happy to follow up
and I understand better but you know
it's an area we are committed to doing
well you talked quite a bit about
working more with law enforcement I
believe you've said that maybe four or
five times I'd like to hear more about
some of the things that you do with law
enforcement to protect the consumers as
well and protect our electoral process
and other things that we should care
about we we do this across a wide
variety of areas so for example and
there were concerns expressed about
election interference it's an area where
we looked a law enforcement for guidance
areas like child safety is an area where
we actively collaborate with law
enforcement agency so fraud malware and
you know depending on the area we engage
and we support them through efforts they
are trying to do the opioid crisis is a
good example of an area where we are
doing a lot of work with law enforcement
what do you think is the main area where
who could improve to better help the
consumer I always had to protect the
consumer I always think you know privacy
is an area where we think is sacrosanct
and we have done a lot for users over
the years but it's an area where
expectations are constantly evolving and
we are as a company needing to evolve
and adapt to it and so it's an area we
are committed to doing better but it's
an a I want to acknowledge that there's
more to do and it's never done and and
something we are committed to doing
better again thank you and mr. chairman
I yield back generally the yields back
the chair now recognizes the gentleman
from Texas mr. Gohmert for five minutes
mr. Jackson appreciate your being here
and I think most all of us agree on both
sides
we applaud great work for example Steven
Spielberg
despite politics he's provided my family
a lot of enjoyment entertainment you and
your colleagues at Google have created
an extraordinary vehicle for searching
out things it's fantastic and as mr. Lew
my friend across the I was pointing out
you know you've got government that's
not supposed to interfere in people's
civil rights and then you've got a
company of corporation like Google my
problem is when the government gives its
immunity from lawsuits over to a private
corporation that's the head of that
corporation doesn't even realize that
there is political bias run a monk in
his company and that's the problem I
don't want to see you over regulate I
don't want to see you regulated I want
to see others come up with brilliant
ways as you mr. brim and others did to
create something that makes life easier
but a good example you have a trusted
flagger you'd indicated called the
Southern Poverty Law Center the Southern
Poverty Law Center
really has stirred up more startup more
hate than about any other group I know
they stirred up one guy to the point
that he went to the Family Research
Council and I know those people and
they're Christians and they believe and
I believe that Christianity is really
more based on love than about any other
religion in history God so loved the
world he sent his son his son so loved
the world he gave His life and yet they
start up hate against the Family
Research Center and a guy goes in
shooting
you have let's see June 18th of this
year Southern Poverty Law Center
announced it reached a settlement with
Najib Nawaz and his organization kill
him for falsely labeling them as
anti-muslim hate group they were wrong
now you consider them a trusted flagger
yet they keep creating problems for
people that are not haters and in fact
they had to excuse me they had to pay
out three point three seven five million
my problem is when you put your moniker
on them a trusted flagger why aren't you
paying three point three seven five to
mr. namazi gina was that's my problem
you trust people that have stirred up a
lot of hate and another good example and
you don't you're so surrounded by
liberality that hates conservatism hates
people that really love our constitution
and the freedoms it's afforded people
like you that you don't even recognize
it is it's like a blind man not even
knowing what light looks like because
you're surrounded by darkness but if you
look let's see a good example after
President Trump one your co-founder mr.
Brent said quote most people here are
pretty
said--and pretty sad now a lot of us
seen the video we saw how upset the top
people at Google were and for you to
come in here and say there is no
political bias in Google tells us you
either are being dishonest I don't want
to think that or you don't have a clue
how politically biased Google is now
another example is Wikipedia we do a
search and what comes up as right there
is the knowledge panel on the right and
we hopefully will have a screenshot of
that we get Wikipedia my chief of staff
went on she told me every night for two
weeks and put proper honest information
in with proper annotations and
Wikipedia's liberal editors around the
world would knock it out every day and
instead put up a bunch of garbage like
Mark Levin has now been facing yet to
you they get a trusted spot and when
Wikipedia slanders or liable someone and
you're the one that has trusted them
above any other entity you ought to be
liable
you'll be liable and SPLC is liable you
ought to be liable when Wikipedia
demeans and uses their political bias
and I hope and encourage you to look
around and notice your runoff
conservatives you embrace liberals and
it's time Google was actually not immune
so that people can hold you accountable
and get a little better objectivity I
see my time to run out I give back Thank
You mr. chairman I appreciate your
testimony here today and I'm number
these questions follow to me even though
I may be repeating some of this but I'm
still not clear on how many staff and
who it is that
establishes the parameters by which the
algorithms are written can you tell me
about how many staff where that is and
and how that works
congressman today it's it's our search
team which which works on the core core
of our search teams and it's you know
well over a thousand people I can you
know I'm happy to elaborate more but
it's close enough conceptually and when
you hire them are there other people who
are coming in from the outside or they
brought up from internally what's a
typical path to this roughly a thousand
person search team it's a combination of
both but senior-most engineers on our
search team typically tend to have been
in the company for a very long time and
so most of the time you will know them
from having worked with them do you then
you go into their social media to try to
determine what they might be doing on
social media normally we don't you know
as a company we have allowed people to
express themselves but we we make it
clear that how we build our products is
done with great care and thought focused
on giving users the information they are
looking for but but these are this team
of roughly a thousand they're the people
that write the parameters by which those
who write the algorithms write the
algorithms that's roughly correct yeah
uh-huh and so there isn't really any and
any look at what their private lives are
even though over there are their public
social media has not examined by the
company and does anyone outside of
Google know who these thousand people
are you know we don't we don't examine
their personal activities and you know
there are some senior people are you
don't do participate in conferences and
meetings outside and they are known to
the outside community and we're watching
people whose social media has knocked
them out of some pretty high positions
in life almost every week there's one or
more whose social media this week a
couple of them that I can think of just
in the last 24 or 48 hours but I'm gonna
make this point and I believe I've made
it with
a number of the of the internet
companies that have been sitting here at
this table in the past well remember
situation here is that there's a very
strong conviction on this side of the
aisle that the algorithms are written
with a with a bias against conservatives
the people on the other side don't agree
with that because of course it benefits
them and but what we don't know are who
are these thousand people and we don't
know what their social media looks like
but we do know that the people that come
from that County were about 80 percent
supporters of Hillary Clinton if I
listen to the gentlelady from California
correctly and so that would be a
built-in bias if I know people from
California and know their politics from
California and I think I do
so we've got at least theoretically a
built-in bias that's here it's not being
examined and not examining the social
media how would you expect that you
could get to an objective result which
you said that you know we build our
products in a neutral way but that
doesn't mean that your product comes out
neutral so how would you expect to get
to unbiased result with a built in
formula that I've described that I don't
think you object to or disagree with
congressman it's an important question
but the way we rank our results is
essentially based on user feedback and
that's what drives the iterative loop in
our you know in what we put in so I do
understand how its prioritized that way
and I watch what's going on but I made
this point that if we don't know who the
thousand are and we can't look at their
social media and we can't see the
algorithms to understand their results
of the work they're doing behind closed
doors and yet the public believes that
it's an open forum where there is a
balanced exchange of open access for
information of course it's not and so I
have said we either need to know who
they are and look at their social media
and if that doesn't solve this problem
next step then is publish the algorithms
if that doesn't happen then the next
step on the line is section 230 the
amendments to section 230 and the step
on the line beyond that is a Teddy
Roosevelt step now I'm going from with
mr. Gohmert I don't want to regulate
anything but neither do I want to see a
society that's so polarized and so
divided and so loaded that the will of
the American people
can't be expressed in the ballot box
that looks like either where we are or
the direction we're going and I would
just finish it with this I have a seven
year old granddaughter who picked up her
phone before the election and she's
playing a little game kind of game a kid
would play and up on there pops a
picture of her grandfather and I'm not
gonna say into the record what the kind
of language was used around that picture
of her grandfather but I'd ask you how
does that show up on a seven-year-olds
iPhone who's playing a kids game
Congressman iPhone is made by a
different company and so you know I mean
it might have been an Android it's just
it was a hand-me-down or some kinda you
know I guess I'm happy to follow up and
understand the specifics it there may be
an application which was being used
which had a notification but I'm happy
to understand it better and clarify it
for you okay thank you for your
testimony and yield back the balance of
my time
what purpose does the gentleman from
Texas seek recognition to place three
questions on the record mr. chairman
we've already indicated we'll take all
questions submitted in writing if I can
thank you for the courtesy of the
gentlelady from Alabama I think it's her
time next there been several points made
and obviously algorithm has been
mentioned over and over again three
questions one the explaining how
algorithm may play into someone's
impression that conservative is over
liberal I think you're very clear on
that that it's not the case in addition
your clarification on China and engaging
in any activities to censor those
individuals and number three the
algorithms again about your products may
be a proprietary may be a priority over
others and any explanation as to how
that is in fact if you represent
be not true or how that might be
perceived that that happens your
products Google products over others and
how algorithms may play a part into that
and the gentlewoman will submit those in
writing to us so we can submit Thank You
mr. and I thank the gentleman and I
thank you for yielding thank you very
much thank you chair recognizes the
gentleman from Florida mr. Rutherford
for five minutes
Thank You mr. chairman mr. Boucher I
thank you very much for your testimony
today I'm gonna go back to the privacy
policy and talk about some of those
issues because I think it's very
important for the American public you
mentioned the transparency in your
policy but when you know I know your
policy is 20 pages long changes multiple
times a year I have to ask a couple
questions about the policy because I
quite frankly don't understand all of it
and that is the the policy states that
Google's data collection applies when
quote you use Google service and so most
consumers would think that means Google
search or Google Maps my question is
does the policy apply when a consumer
contacts a double-click cookie are you
then are they then under that policy or
not today our product there is called
Google Ad manager and in general when
users interact with our services we you
know we need their consent and by law we
need to apply our privacy policy so that
we can offer them the full productions
we can and and fulfill our obligations
and so as part of that I think if you're
interacting with our ads so this is
video but you know we do get your
content for your privacy policy so
that's written in the policy okay and
then and then secondly if a consumer
does not have a Google account but they
land on a web page that has Google ad
where again is that consumer using a
Google service under the privacy policy
my understanding would be yes if they
are interacting if they you know they
may be both subject to the privacy
policy of the publisher or the
application they are using as well as to
add platforms that work work on that
that product okay and then third and
finally your privacy policy says you
collect voice and audio information when
you use audio features however does this
mean Google assistant is recording our
voices in conversations how about when
just just using Google Voice or is that
actually being recorded today if you
invoke Google Voice by either using the
microphone or you say okay Google and
issue a command we treat it like a
search query and and and record that
activity but we have a we have a
separate setting which in which as a
user you can choose whether you want
these stored or not and so we give users
a choice and option you know when it
gets to transparency I think when you
realize you have these active you know
where I'm clicking and giving that
information and agreeing to it I think
people understand that information is is
going out and and they're giving that
permission it's these passive collection
points you know like like Android and
Chrome where they're picking up that
information and and the user I'm not
sure the user actually knows that and
and so you know one of my questions is
we're agreeing to a privacy policy but
we don't really know what information
were we're giving up because it there
are other groups that you are
contracting with Android and and Chrome
we're collecting passive information how
do you address that and and how do you
make that transparent for the consumer
our spend media is privacy policy
aloneness you know
not enough this is why we prompt and
give privacy checkups so let me stop you
there and ask you them because it you
know is it possible for Google to send
me a printout of all the information
that they have collected on me within
the last month and clicked what is all
that information you have all that
information that could be provided to me
right we do make it available to you
very easily you know we won't be a
concern about the security of the data
so we don't you know casually get it out
but right so so I would ask if time but
instead of instead of me as a consumer
or anyone as a consumer giving you the
privacy right up front why don't you why
don't you be more honest with me
tell me exactly what information is
being collected what information you
want to share and then allow me to
decide how much of that information I
would like to share as a consumer
congressman I agree with that sentiment
in fact what we precisely do is actually
be a very transparent and like we make
it very easy you go to your account
settings we clearly tell the categories
and you can click and see the
information we have you can turn it on
or off but we want to do better and yeah
but there are areas where information is
being collected even if I have I have
the particular sites turned off there's
still information being collected
through some of these other passive
systems you that you've contracted with
correct we we are pretty explicit about
data which we collect and we give
productions for you to turn them on or
off and even when you use a product like
Chrome or Gmail you know or Google home
we're very clear about the data we
collect and be reflected back to the
user the data we have on them and we try
to be transparent I can just say my
times out but I would tell you this I
would much rather be giving permission
after I know what information I'm giving
it so thank you very much again and I
appreciate time I yield back mr.
chairman sure thanks gentleman
recognizes the gentlewoman from Alabama
is Roby for five minutes
Thank You mr. chairman thank you I'm
just gonna build upon what my colleague
was just talking about he's a specific
example in June of 2016
Google changed its privacy policy to
allow for combining the double-click
cookie information with quote personal
identifiable information before this
change the cookies that track people
across the web we're not melded with
other consumer information Google got
from searches or Android phone use and
it's my understanding that when Google
purchased double-click representations
were made that Google would keep the
data separate the point here is you've
heard from many people concerns today
about the consumer and what the consumer
knows and I understand there's a
personal responsibility as a consumer to
do my part to try to understand this but
it's also very complicated stuff and so
I want to point to something positive
that Google is doing in March
you had the online safety Roadshow that
came through Alabama second
congressional district to a middle
school
Girard middle school in Dothan you're
you're being a corporate citizen by
trying to teach our young people how to
be smart and safe on the Internet and as
a mom of a 13-year old girl I appreciate
that very much
I think that is truly truly a good
example of what it means to be a
corporate citizen that these young
people can have the world in their hands
in recognizing that all the positive
things that can come from it there's
some dangers as well I would just say I
think what we would all benefit from is
is understanding as a corporate citizen
what are you doing
to educate the consumer about the
privacy policy you've heard many of my
colleagues point to the fact that you
have this 20 page privacy policy but it
changes multiple times during the year
or there's representations that are made
in 2016
about double-click that change and so
most of us don't have a way to
understand this in a way to know that
the data that's being collected on is
exactly how it's being used so iPod you
for the work that you're doing to
educate our young people but I would
just ask if you could provide us you
said you use the words evolve and adapt
when it comes to the policy but what are
you doing specifically to help educate
your consumers on how they can be aware
of when they click accept on the privacy
policy that they have a better
understanding of how their data is going
to be used congressman it's a good
question and for example we are sending
email reminders for certain types of
data that's being collected and asking
you to go review your settings and
that's an example of the kind of
evolution we are doing and we are
implementing we are looking at combining
settings where we can so that it's
easier for users so we want to minimize
the number of controls but we want to
match it with users have complex
expectations too for example they want
some of their devices to be private but
they are okay with some of their other
devices being able to be used where
location as a very etcetera so we are
trying to match users expectations users
do tell us and they search for weather
or restaurants they want restaurants
near their location and not somewhere
else and and and as you can imagine if
someone from Alabama is searching they
want information relevant to them so
that's what we are trying to meet but I
agree with you that we need to simply
simplify this even more and there's more
work to do and it's a constant effort we
are undertaking as I look into 2019
we'll be doing more changes to make
things work better and I'll take this
feedback to account well in just one
example amount legislative assistant was
showing me in the privacy policy where
it's redlined to show that with the
change ways but it's not pointed out to
that I'm aware of it's not pointed out
to the consumer when the policy is
updated for whatever reason what the
exact change is you have to go search
for it and find it
and so if I've got that correct you
correct me if I'm wrong but my
understanding is you would have to
scroll through the entire privacy polity
policy to see where the changes were
made is that correct
I'm happy to follow up on that I you
know I do think there are times we have
pointed out that updates in a blog post
or something and we make it clear what
the changes are but happy to follow up
and get the specific thing the more you
could streamline to the consumer how
their personal information will be used
is being used without the consumer
having I mean again there's a personal
responsibility there as well but I just
think you're doing some good things in
terms of educating folks about
particularly with the online safety
Roadshow I think that you could take
some of the work you're doing there and
hearing our concerns here today look for
ways that you could better educate the
consumer moving forward thank you I
yield back thank you very much mr. Chang
a couple of quick follow-ups here that I
don't think anybody asked who makes the
judgment calls regarding content
moderation at Google chairman it depends
on the area so for example if it's
YouTube we have you know very clear
teams which are responsible for YouTube
content policies and they identified is
it possible for a customer to write to
them and say hey here's here's a concern
I have we give clear channels for
content creators to you know to raise
concerns back and we have clear avenues
and and we also have had people who are
responsible for these platforms
including content moderation appear here
you know and and and I think they've
consulted widely here here - I have a
question about preloaded apps do you
have agreements with the companies that
I mean Amazon might have an app that
they put on your platform do you have a
data sharing agreement with them do they
get from
and you get the information that's
generated by their app as well how does
that work we don't have any special
agreements with respect to user data as
part of pre-loading any application so
if another somebody puts that app on
your platform they do it with your
permissions that correct not necessarily
you know so for example our a device
manufacturer can preload applications on
on Android and you know it's up to them
and the app developer to do so right if
they operate on your operating system do
you get the information as well as the
app owner of information about what's
happening within that application right
unless there may be specific cases where
the user has given us diagnostic
information so the answer will depend on
the context but in general no I mean the
relationship is between the user and the
app developer if you get an app that
gathers information on a specific thing
that's not also coming to Google as well
as to the developer of the app in a
general sense no and then finally and
this you can you can write to us a
written answer because it's a very
lengthy answer I believe but I'm
interested in knowing I know you've had
a lot of difficulties in Europe of late
and I'm interested in knowing how your
policy in Europe differs from your
policy the United States I'm happy to
have it for me I think it's a pretty
extensive topic I'm happy to have
follow-up on that that area back to back
to your office ok yes we would
appreciate that we'll give you some
written questions that other members
have provided we'll have some more of
our own and we would ask that you
respond to those promptly definitely
well thank you well you've gone for
about three and a half hours and it's
about what we predicted isn't it SJ when
we talked so we thank you very much for
your participation today this concludes
today's hearing and without objection
all members will have five legislative
days to submit written question for the
witness or additional materials for the
record and with
this hearing is adjourned
