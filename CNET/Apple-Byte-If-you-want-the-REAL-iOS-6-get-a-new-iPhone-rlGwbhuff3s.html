welcome to the apple byte it's all the
good and bad inside the world of Apple
and there's planning to talk about in
the aftermath of WWDC now you probably
know the big news so we'll go over it
briefly and then dig in because with all
things The Devil's in the details and we
start things off with the rock star of
the event and that was the all new
macbook pro with a Retina display think
of it as a hybrid like a quad core
macbook air with its great screen now I
got to play with it and it's already
earned seen its editors choice of words
so check this out from our laptop guru
dan ackerman i'm dan ackerman and we are
here taking a very first look at apple's
brand new macbook pro with retina
display this is a variation on the pro
available only for now in the 15 inch
size and of course it's that retina
display that makes it special it's got a
28 80 x 1800 resolution that is unheard
of in laptops and kind of like on the
latest iPhone and on the latest iPad it
makes text and images look very crisp on
the screen now read signs the big screen
the other big deal about this new system
is that it is much thinner and lighter
than your typical macbook pro it's got a
lot of the DNA of a macbook air in it
and I really thought it was almost 50 50
or 60 40 but now that they've got to see
it up close and handle it it definitely
leans much more towards the pro side
it's got these side speakers right here
like you have on a macbook pro it's
squared off and slab like instead of
tapered like a macbook air it's actually
just about to stick overall as the air
is on the thickest part at the back of
the air maybe just add hair thicker it
is however a little bit heavier than you
would expect looking at it and looking
at how thin it is it's about four and a
half pounds now a lot of things on here
are going to seem familiar they got the
same Apple keyboard that everybody likes
backlit of course and the big glass
touchpad I think the thing I'm most
excited about besides the dual USB 3.1
der bolt ports is something I never
thought I'd see on an apple laptop
that's HDMI I've been asking for this
for years it's finally here it makes it
so much easier to just take this and
plug this into a big TV or projector or
a monitor and now in order to get all
this you're going to have to
maybe save up a few pennies and they'd
be trade in your old macbook because it
starts that starts that 2199 that's
pretty darn expensive for just a 15 inch
laptop with only a 256 gig solid-state
drives you can trade up through a bigger
one of course that's going to cost even
more i'm dan ackerman and that is the
brand new apple macbook pro with retina
display alright thanks Dan now you guys
the retina display is nice but it's more
subtle than you think and it's not a
cheap machine starting at 2199 but more
than anything the 15-inch is a lot
heavier than it looks and trust me I
work out we also saw a revamp across the
line with new macbook pro 13-inch and
15-inch and MacBook Airs featuring Ivy
Bridge processors Thunderbolt usb3 a
slimmer MagSafe connector and 720p
FaceTime cameras which I'm excited about
for personal use now mountain lion won't
come pre-loaded on the machines but
apple says it's arriving in July for
1999 and if you buy a machine now you'll
get a free upgrade plus we didn't see
any other mac hardware and we told you
not to expect it but a lot of you were
frustrated about no imax now don't get
too worked up about it we still expect
to refresh this year and they've
released new iMacs a few weeks after a
keynote in the past on the other hand
the mac pro probably received the most
pathetic update in apple history they
didn't mention it in the keynote but
they released it on Apple's online store
with a new tag the only thing knew about
it was a speed bump no new Intel
processors no Thunderbolt usb3 say 23
note after almost two years it got speed
bump now a couple days later Apple then
remove that tag after the internet
ripped it apart and I get it desktops
are not where you're making a lot of
your money but come on son that's a bad
apple now there's light at the end of
this very long long tunnel after Apple
reps told us directly about the mac
pro's and Tim Cook publicly responded in
an email with our pro customers are
really important to us don't worry as
we're working on something really great
for later next year Apple has never
revealed product info like this and they
almost had to but to hold me over until
then I'm
kinda wishing Apple really did make that
refriger toaster froster after all iOS 6
also took center stage and the big a
showed up new features and improvements
that will be available in the fall
around the time we see the next-gen
iphone which may or may not look like
this now the biggest oohs and ahhs came
when Apple showed off their flyover
feature and the Maps app now our own
seen it expert audio engineer confirm
there wasn't a single female voice
recognized during that segment now
Apple's new maps will also include voice
turn-by-turn directions a feature
Android has had since day one series
getting the ability to check sports
scores movies launching apps are posting
to social media but Apple and talk about
how they would actually improve series
recognition or the long waits for
information to be interpreted now
Facebook is finally going to be
integrated into iOS and facetime calls
will now be able to be made over a
cellular connection in iOS 6 there's a
whole bunch of other features but just
because apple says they're coming in
Iowa 6 doesn't necessarily mean you're
going to get to use them all check out
this breakdown we have for you and even
though iOS 6 works on the iphone 4 and
the 3gs you'll need a 4s or higher to
get turn-by-turn directions and fly over
you also won't get facetime over
cellular connections with a four or even
an ipad 2 and you still won't get Siri
on that same iPad to Siri will only work
on a floor s or higher and on a
third-generation iPad and if you're on a
3gs don't look too carefully because you
will cry from that chart now people are
pissed off about this and you should be
I'm annoyed by it and it's more than
worthy of a nasty bad apple but this is
really par for the course for Apple they
did it with multimedia text messaging
they did it with Siri and we've known
this for years this is how apple rolls
I'm not saying it's right but the
reality is that there's plenty of other
great phones out there like the HTC One
X or Samsung's Galaxy s3 that's coming
to the US soon you guys you don't have
to be one hundred percent Apple
okay let's be honest a lot of you
watching are now there were a couple
products Apple announced that you didn't
hear about there's a new airport express
that's now shaped like an Apple TV with
an ethernet when and land port for 99
bucks an app will release their own
smart case for the ipad 2 and ipad 3
that covers the back side and still has
its foldable cover that protects the
front would you believe it a new apple
product that works on older models all
right guys now I know the Apple biters
didn't completely get what they wanted
to see at WWDC like an iPhone 5 even if
we told you it wasn't coming so to make
you feel better we're giving you guys
something it's mo fees $99 juice pack
plus that's a rechargeable external
battery case for the iPhone 4 and 4s and
more than doubles the life of your phone
all you have to do is tweet me at Brian
underscore Tom make me laugh or cry if
you really mean or just say hi send me
your first and last name so I can stock
you on facebook and we'll announce our
winners next week plus mophie is hooking
up the apple byte nation with a twenty
percent off coupon code for anything
from their online store that's good
through July first alright that's going
to do it for this week's show i'm brian
Tong email us at the apple by the cnet

Apple
