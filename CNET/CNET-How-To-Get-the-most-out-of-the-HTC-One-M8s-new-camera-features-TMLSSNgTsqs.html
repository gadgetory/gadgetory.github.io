latest flagship device the HTC One m8
this phone is faster has a bigger screen
and even more features than its
predecessor the HTC one one of the main
selling points is the rear camera unlike
Samsung Nokia and Sony who continue to
push megapixel counts
higher and higher HTC is banking on new
dual camera to win customers over the
HTC One m8 includes an updated ultra
pixel rear camera which in reality is a
4 megapixel camera with better low-light
performance it also has this a second
depth of field sensor that sits above
the main camera and allows you to
refocus your photos after you take them
after snapping a photo view the image in
the gallery click on the edit option on
the lower right hand side of the screen
and select you focus then just simply
click on the object you would like to
focus the foreground and seasons tools
use the depth of field sensor to
recognize the different layers in your
photo and apply special effects to them
the foreground tool has four options
sketch zoom blur cartoon and colorize
the sketch option will apply a graphite
sketch the background of your image the
zoom blur will dramatically blur
everything except for the focused object
the cartoon mode will make everything a
background look cartoonish and the
colorized mode will change the
background to black and white
the seasons feature adds a seasonal
flare to your images such as snowfall or
flowers while the dimension plus tool
uses the depth of field sensor to give
you a sort of 3d view of your images
tilting your phone will change the
perspective of the image and give you a
sense of depth it's similar to Apple's
parallax wallpaper in iOS 7 these images
can then be saved at a new angle or as a
dimension plus file for later viewing
unfortunately these features are not
available for burst photos while using
the Zowie camera or in modes like HDR
portrait or landscape in fact the you
focus foreground seasons and dimension
plus features are only available for
photos taken in auto mode the phone does
include a Photoshop s
touch up menu which includes a wide
range of options for editing photos of
people you can smooth out a person's
skin contour their face remove redeye
and more of course the m8 also includes
plenty of Instagram like filters and
frames as well as tools for cropping
rotating and flipping images for more
