team - count the L o'clock still
continues so what they launch - o'clock
were at 18 minutes 50 seconds until
liftoff this is the first interplanetary
launch for NASA from the west coast but
NASA is no stranger to the Atlas 5
rocket which you see on the screen in
fact this launch of insight on the Atlas
5 will be the 17th time nASA has flown a
spacecraft on this rocket all previous
NASA interplanetary missions have
launched from Florida's Atlantic coast
either Cape Canaveral Air Force Station
or the adjacent NASA's Kennedy Space
Center 25 go check go atlas go Center go
in sight we're at t-minus 15 seconds
eight seven six five four three two
liftoff of the Atlas 5 launching the
first interplanetary mission from the
west coast and NASA's insight the first
outer space robotic Explorer to study
the interior of Mars
the compadre rates continue look good
ah Quan the rocket is now traveling
faster than the speed of sound earn
altitude is 13 miles downrange distance
seven miles current velocity nineteen
hundred and sixty five miles per hour
current velocity four thousand five
hundred forty-two miles per hour you're
looking at a live view from the Atlas
five rocket the rd-180 engine continues
to burn good 3180 still performing well
and the second state stage engine that
our Elton has ignited and we have
indication of payload fairing jettison
such a good step and the payload fairing
that was encapsulating the inside
spacecraft has been jettisoned the rl10
sea engine the second stage of the
centaur continues to burn you're looking
at live animation telemetry very good of
the Centaur second stage on its flight
path rgn to purge firings underway
thermal conditioning and we have
indications spacecraft so that's
confirmation of spacecraft separation
behind us the Roma a lot of excited
people have a short coast of
approximately thirty four seconds or we
elaborate has a launch perfect I'm done
this will be the first pair of cube sets
to go to deep space they carry radio I
gain antenna and ocean system with the
goal to provide data relay to the earth
from the entry descent and landing phase
of the insight mission
and just moments away from the first two
cubes that's to deployed and we have the
first Arkell a spacecraft separation
Center is now spinning up first half of
the 180-degree turn
centaur has completed the turn now in an
attitude hold for spacecraft separation
and we have indication of our Kobe in
deployed and the second of two cube sets
has been deployed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
