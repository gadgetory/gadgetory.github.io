editor at cnet news and joining me on
stage is Republican congressman darrell
Issa he's one of the most outspoken
members on tech issues on the hill he
was an adviser to president elect Trump
on tech issues thank you for coming
thanks for having me here and thanks for
making CES show the largest show of its
kind anywhere in the world by two times
there you go yeah it is it is a crazy
large show every time I go to other
shows and I think oh my gosh CS is that
much bigger every time so there's only
one show that has similar square footage
it's over a million square feet and it's
a place where they show off earth moving
equipment yes okay also here in Vegas
yeah it's big but it's not big in the
same way yeah and it's not every year
and it's not every year yeah so um we're
going to start a little bit talking
about President like Trump because it's
just kind of one of the things in the
room we've heard lovely little from him
on tech issues and I was hoping maybe
you could give us a little bit of
insight as someone who was involved
about how he thinks about tech it's such
an important industry obviously it's
what's in the pulse here what are his
thoughts around some of these issues I
think one of the things you have to know
about Donald Trump is that he can take
anything and digest it quickly but you
have to deliver it quickly this is
somebody who wants to know in 30 seconds
what do I need to know or in five
minutes and he will take an hour
briefing but only if it really takes an
hour and so when you look at tech issues
what does he need to do he had about an
hour meeting with some of the foremost
authorities and technology including
Elon Musk including tim cook and others
and they had an hour to make their case
on what did they need and they did they
made their case that we need the best
and the brightest so we can grow an
economy in America we need to be able to
bring back stranded capital because it
doesn't make any sense that we get to
leave it over there and invested or we
can pay a third of it out if we want to
bring it back he got it he didn't need a
third item but the fact is the
technology here with a little as a few
items we need bandwidth we need some
things like that but that's in the weeds
when you look at Donald Trump we need
two things from him we need him to move
Congress to reform the tax laws so that
it encourages american dollars made
overseas to come back and we need to
have the best and the brightest be able
to get here so that whether it's h-1b or
other programs it means that that you
can create a job here because you can
get the person you need if they're not
available here that's it there is this
that's why that's why the beauty of
Trump is he doesn't want to run
technology he wants rhinology to run and
he's prepared to help in those ways got
it so I'm actually curious about you
brought up a couple of issues that are
really fascinating to me one of them is
the repatriation right Apple has been
hugely talkative about how important it
is to repatriate taxes and ours I type
the the money and have a tax holiday
it's something that I mean it's one of
their signature issues on Capitol Hill
it is and if we look historically one of
the concerns experts always bring up is
that the last time we did a tax holiday
that money was largely given to
shareholders it didn't create new jobs
it didn't really have that much impact
and it was it didn't really do what
Congress had hoped it would do when they
pass that you know Congress has a bad
habit of thinking that you have to be
able to take the money and put it in a
certain account or it doesn't get there
okay we've got a live studio audience
here just a show of hands how many of
you if you received money as
stockholders would put it to good use
okay the reality is is that money that
comes back here and goes to stockholders
will buy more stock make investments
maybe buy an extra iphone and by the way
when you dividend it out there's a tax
paid so the government gets an extra
benefit of its if it's distributed out
so even back in the bush administration
when they did that yes some of it got
paid out in dividends some of it got
invested and then some of it went to the
American people the stockholder who
guess what in
did it as a matter of fact one of the
interesting things is if you think about
Apple's stock holders largest
stockholders of Apple's stock of course
are large funds and large funds going to
bring up is right how are they going to
help well no American well the thing is
large funds if they get a distribution
they normally don't distribute it back
to their actual stockholders they in
reinvested so it didn't really dividend
out in the true sense to the public it
really went into a fund who then either
bought more apple stock or quite frankly
I might have bought other startups so
the first thing you have to do is not
assume that money has to be earmarked
for some use because if you do that what
happens is and i'll just take apple as
an example apple says yeah we're going
to put 10 billion dollars is going to
bring you back and spend it here which
we know in the quarters afterwards they
can take another 10 billion they would
have spent there and not spend it so
thinking you can ear market is a problem
so here's the other part of it the last
one was a bad program because it
basically said it's five percent take it
now it was a tax holiday what it did was
it encouraged people to do the same
thing again and build it up overseas
what Donald Trump knows the legislature
it Congress knows is we have to come up
with a permanent change that tells
people don't strand the money over there
bring it back if you bring it back we're
not going to penalize you but oh by the
way the deal we said today is the deal
that you're going to have in the weeks
and months on a permanent basis and
that's why real change rather than tax
holiday is president-elect Trump's goal
it's Congress's goal and that that makes
some sense I guess what the concern that
when when I hear from the experts on
this is that if we're going to talk
about meaningful impact from that money
coming back bringing it back and having
it kind of going to circle of Wall
Street is questionably impacting real
Americans but I mean will be but you
said Apple you know I'll give you a
little piece doesn't have to just the
Apple there are a lot of company I know
but but you know since you're a great
company when I pick on them and they're
very large their large but they also
pulled a trick Apple already brought
much of their money back they brought it
back and they dividend it out a couple
years ago just before taxes went out
and what they did was they borrowed
against the money that stranded overseas
then took the borrowed money and
dividend it out so in a sense Apple has
to unwind a situation in which they
already did a transaction you know it's
that kind of distortion where government
always calls it a loophole but the
reality is government has created a bad
idea corporations really don't pay taxes
we do if you take thirty five percent
off of a corporation and it pays a
dividend all it really does is reduce
your dividend by thirty five percent if
you don't take it from them and you pay
it out what happens is I pay more taxes
but at the end of the day if they
reinvest it and pay less taxes and
reinvest it actually that's where the
real magic is so if you look at a
company that is looking for money and
they've got let's just say many of the
Nasdaq don't pay any tax in some
rephrasing don't dividend at all and
what they do is reinvest every penny
they have but if they're growing fast
enough they're actually net borrowers
every year because even though they're
reinvesting every penny it's after-tax
pennies one of the questions in the tax
code is if a company is reinvesting in
expansions in the United States why not
give them a deferral on their taxes so
that we're not taxing them on exactly
the investment that's going to make them
more profitable than later quarters in
which they're going to pay us more and
again that's an investment act so
there's a lot of that moving around
Washington what we know now is we have a
partner that is willing to work with us
on how to do that and is not
automatically causing their to have to
be a tax increase to offset a tax cut
because yes we need to deal with the
corporate tax but I think everyone here
at the show doesn't want to pay some
large tax increase just to do that so
and just not to believe it I just want
to make sure I fully understand for you
that the concern is that it's a regular
program it's not a holiday and that you
know if it ends up going into the
investment you know kind of cycle of
Wall Street it's not as much a concern
versus helping create jobs by new
factories whatever
but as long as these companies got to
just choose what they want to do with it
corporations will invest at the highest
and best use we we are giving an
opportunity for them to make that
investment one of the important things
is that the repatriation has to be a
repatriation you can't say what we're
going to let you pay the tax and then
have it recapitalised overseas so there
have to be some protection from that
okay um let's move on to encryption I
think it's one of probably the hottest
topics of the tech industry in the last
year no that would keep us on the apples
yeah Apple will be a regular
conversation I think here so it's almost
been a year since that happened right
Apple versus the FBI I believe you said
that the FBI should have hacked the
phone before they tried to go through
the legal means to try and force Apple
to help them what I said was that pretty
much a freshman at MIT could have hacked
it anybody that ever worked for me as an
engineer could have hacked it I mean
we're not talking difficult just a few
minutes ago you had a taken apart
product here and what do you really do
well you open it up you look at the sub
components and you ask a question did we
have a non-volatile memory that could
have been replicated and then repeated
as many times as necessary to circumvent
the automatic destruction and the answer
was of course you did you only had to be
high school electronics kid not even a
college to do it and afterwards a number
of people showed they could do it for
less than two hundred dollars of odd
parts and it's on the internet you don't
have to believe me so one of the
questions was we who want encryption to
protect us where at we saw the FBI go to
a court and ask not ask but order a
company to create a backdoor that was
easy automated and repeatable remotely
now if I've got this phone and I can
hack it because I have possession of the
phone and it might take me an hour two
hours but I can do it you know what
that's good enough for the FBI's need
let's face it the guy was dead but they
asked for something that we should worry
you when somebody asks for some
thing that they can do on every phone
here in this at this show remotely you
say what is it you're asking for a tool
that has nothing to do with your current
need and that's what I told the FBI
director in live audience is I know how
I could open that phone so I want to
know why you're asking for a company to
do something to to its disadvantage and
to the people that it represents those
buyers if if if all of you wanted to buy
10,000 phones and said I want a back
door on the phone i buy I would support
that but not on the phone i buy so do
you think that the that let's take the
encryption part of the first i can write
ignore the the hacking and then kind of
all the mechanics there do you think the
government should have any sort of
access to these phones as a regular
course that there should be a rule that
you know encryptions fine but not when
it comes to national security well
that's you know that's that's
interesting that's sort of like saying
you you can have a boat with no holes in
it except for the one that's there of
course that's the argument in cook makes
it look Tim makes a good argument and
and the argument is simple encryption is
how i have my right to privacy a
backdoor on encryption is how you take
away my right to privacy and to believe
that that set of keys will not get
misused simply runs counter to actual
past experiences with law enforcement
including the FBI now having said that
I'm an approach you know I appropriate
money that's what Congress does we have
appropriated both in monies that you can
see and in monies you'll never see that
are in dark programs we've appropriated
money to allow our clandestine
industries to our CIA and NSA and so on
to do things that are really amazing
that in fact can circumvent protections
I'm willing to spend that so that our
national security so that our enemies
cannot safely do things I'm not willing
to order a company to do it work to
their disadvantage into their consumers
disadvantage
I don't use the off-the-shelf product
here i use what's out of i do that for a
reason which is I'm not available phone
let me see I can't talk right now the
but if you touch the phone it rings
that's that's because they're listening
ah but you know I want to protect it
yeah you know the fact is we all know
that for example the State Department's
email system was completely circumvented
and all the emails were pulled and for
30 days they were they were at a almost
shut down as far as operating we now
know that the Russians hacked the
Democratic National Committee a bit
rather mundane simple fishing expedition
my emails are encrypted there if they're
not going to get my key they can bet
they can go to my services I have
multiple accounts and they can do a
great job of getting some encrypted
files they're not going to get my emails
and that's my right to privacy and I I
think that's the greatest part about
being an American is I have a
constitutional right I've had for 240
years and the clandestine stuff you were
talking about when they find those
hacking holes it doesn't worry you that
they're doing that and not alerting
apple and closing those holes or
whatever ah well you know those those
entities are required to operate outside
the United States and so you know making
America safe has required spies since
George Washington hired a bunch of them
so I don't have a problem with that and
I think the important difference is
national defense and investing money in
figuring things out in World War two we
figured out how the rush or how the
Germans were encrypting in their cipher
and it helped win the war that's not new
but we're Americans and we have a right
an expectation of privacy not just
American citizens but anyone here in the
United States and to me that's more
important than a moment of catching a
bad guy and it doesn't worry you that
they might come back that those holes
might come back and if
does in the United States that's an
interesting question but do you really
hear what you're saying does it bother
me that we're investing money and trying
to figure out for example how we can
find out what the Russians are doing so
that we maybe can figure out that
they're hacking us before they hack us
no I'm okay with that okay I'm just
thinking clear like you said earlier the
keys that you don't want those keys to
be out there because they could be used
in the wrong way right and what I point
is is that even if its clandestine
overseas they could still end up being
used right i mean a key is a key it
doesn't matter whether its overseas or
not no no you don't understand okay the
arithmetic of of encryption is just that
it's it's arithmetic and so you can have
a very very long key that is not a
public key that cannot be found now
having said that we have clandestine
organizations and I've been briefed on
them over the years who find ways to get
information and i'll just give you one
that's legacy if you will when you have
a telephone conversation over a cellular
phone if you don't encrypt your signal
what happens is with cdma you can't just
grab the signal out and listen to it
however if you go to where the phone
goes to the ground line if it's not
end-to-end encrypted you can listen to
everything now that happens to be piece
of legacy information anyone that knows
cellular knows that that at the switch
most of our signals were unencrypted
historically so do i want my clandestine
agencies to know that and to try to get
the information sure you know anyone
that's watched a 30 year old james bond
movie has seen a long-range microphone
that can pick up what you're saying from
miles away there's a lot of techniques
and i'm not going to sit here and talk
about the techniques sure but we fund
our government making America safe we
also have a set of constitutional
protections that I think are not
fungible and one of them the apple case
made clear I will never
never support telling our companies or
our citizens that in fact they have to
have a back door so they can be a little
bit safe so the last question I'll ask
on this president elect Trump said that
he was going to boycott Apple's products
over the Apple versus FBI things he saw
him starting using Android wheats he
doesn't really use phones for much else
I understand but when he says things it
does have an impact right i mean he is
the president like the united states so
actually when he said it he wasn't the
president-elect okay but you get my
point right and I guess I look I get
your point that lots of people said a
lot of things Marco Rubio who I
supported initially for president in the
very beginning was strident in the same
way well Ted Cruz who I didn't support
was on my side um you know politics
often gets people making a statement
that when you really sit down I you
change your mind president elect Trump
in just a few days on january twentieth
at noon will raise his right hand and he
will swear allegiance to uphold and
defend the Constitution as long as the
Constitution is unchanged he will have
to defend the Fourth Amendment my right
to privacy my right not to have on
regional search and seizure and I think
he will do it and I know many of the
people that are going to be in the
administration and by the way if they
don't I can be his best friend I can be
his nemesis because I took that same
oath and I take it seriously all right
well um congressman thank you for taking
the time I appreciate it that's a wrap
for us actually that's the end of our
CES 2017 coverage from the stage thank
you all for joining us both here and
over the internet and check out all of
our coverage on cnet com and we'll see
you next year excellent
