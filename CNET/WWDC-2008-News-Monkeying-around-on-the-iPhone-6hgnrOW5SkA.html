on the iphone for the first time last
March our development team other ocean
were able to create four stages from
scratch in just two weeks of development
time eight weeks after that event they
were able to give us 110 stages for the
finished game which is a tremendous
amount of content for a handheld game
they were also able to give us all four
of the classic monkeys so we have I I me
me baby and Gong Gong today we're going
to play as baby there are five distinct
worlds to play in last time we showed
you the first world monkey Iowa this
time we're showing you the last world
space case the reason want to show you
that is because it's a terrific
opportunity to demonstrate just how well
the tilt control can keep up with the
game's most intricate challenges as you
can see this is a pretty tricky stage
that Josh was trying to get through and
to be able to do it you have to be able
to accelerate decelerate in terms with
pinpoint precision the iphones
accelerometers gives him the ability to
do that
you
so as a producer the best part of
working on this game has been to put the
game in people's hands for the first
time you've never played it because it's
just instantly fun the tilt control
works beautifully it's a fantastic
gaming experience for Sega the App Store
represents an amazing opportunity
because we can now be in the same place
where people are buying their music and
movies and they can take all that
content with them wherever they go we
love what we've been able to do with
super monkey ball we can't wait to see
what's possible with our other marquee
characters and this game is going to be
available at the launch of the app store
for 999</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
