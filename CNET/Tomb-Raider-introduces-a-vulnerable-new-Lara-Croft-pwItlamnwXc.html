recklessness laura is a strong
inspirational character he can shoot the
bow and arrow she can climb but she also
is smart and clever all that combined
makes for a really fascinating icon
how do you bring something new to an
iconic character you cast Alicia
vikander athletic there's a new lara
croft that we want to introduce to
audiences we wanted to create of course
this kick-ass female action hero
but she's also vulnerable and that was
important in this movie and then we of
course drew inspiration from both the
2013 we would gain from rise of the Tomb
Raider and also from previous
synchronizations can you tell me a
little bit about how you worked with
Alicia vikander on the stunts because
the work she does in the film is
incredible
she worked extremely hard in preparing
for this role both with our trainer and
also with our stunt coordinators to
learn the fights to learn the moves to
learn the archery to climb them to jump
and swim and or she was just a real
trouper living alone on an island for
years and years and that sort of sending
Walton Goggins character and Dominic
West's characters a bit Mads
seem to be key to the way the characters
were working oh it was really important
that for example for Matthias Vogel our
will and played by Walton Goggins he's
been on this island for seven years and
he is really tired and he just want to
find that tomb and get home and then
Lara Croft lands in his lab he shouldn't
come here I'm glad that you did how did
you come up with some of those puzzles
but they your design is not something
you're interested in it was a really
collaborative effort I knew I could
trust you to solve my puzzle
unfortunately if you're watching this
tape and it means that I must be dead
the puzzles are such an important part
of the games as well and you want to
create puzzles that isn't obvious and
that people can be a part of Lara
solving them
I thought it was interesting that Lara
doesn't really have a love interest in
the film the sort of hints of romance
there but she is not focused on that I
really feel that the emotional heart of
this movie is the father-daughter story
and we didn't want Laura to have other
relationships that would take away from
that between this and atomic blonde last
year do you think there's a new kind of
female action hero emerging I think we
were seeing it in like movies like
Wonder Woman there's really a thirst for
strong female characters on the big
screen and I'm really proud to have
helped Lara Croft come into that as well
don't be too careful these days the
world has gone bloody mad I'll take two</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
