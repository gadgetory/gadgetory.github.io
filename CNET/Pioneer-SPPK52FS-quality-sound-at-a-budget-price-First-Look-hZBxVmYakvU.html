and we're going to take a look at the
Pioneer s PPK 52 FS this is a budget
home theater speaker system and is
currently selling for six hundred and
thirty dollars now this is an update to
pioneers excellent budget speaker system
from last year and it's one of the best
values you're going to find in home
audio it's a 5.1 speaker system
comprised of two tower speakers in the
front a large center channel speaker 2
bookshelf speakers in the rear and the
subwoofer like any standalone speakers
you're going to need to pair this up
with an a/v receiver so it's not a fully
integrated system like a home theater in
a box or a sound bar the tower speakers
feature a removable grille in the front
and you can see they feature three five
and a quarter inch woofers plus a
one-inch tweeter on the top around back
there's also two ports so you want to
place these about a foot away from the
wall the center channel is unusually
large for a system like this which makes
placement a little difficult it doesn't
quite fit under most TVs without
blocking the screen so you need to
experiment with placement options
depending on your home set up the rear
speakers are pretty big as well so
you're going to need a lot of room for
this system in general the subwoofer has
an 8 inch down firing woofer on the
bottom a port on the front and an
onboard 100 watt amp all of the speakers
feature the same vinyl woodgrain finish
which looks decent but it's not quite as
nice as the finish on competing systems
like the energy take classic 5.1 the
system also only comes in black so it's
not going to be a great fit for every
decor what makes the system so
impressive is its sound quality we had a
resident audio file steve guttenberg
listen to the pioneers and he was blown
away finding the sound quality close to
our reference appeareance speakers that
cost over twice as much both music and
movies sounded outstanding and the
pioneers relatively compact subwoofer
really blended well with the full-size
tower speakers if your highest priority
is sound quality and you've got a
relatively modest budget these are the
speakers you want to get so overall our
only reservations about this system is
that it's big and the finish isn't going
to fit in every living room but if
you've got
space this is a phenomenal value and
you're getting the best sounding
speakers we've heard at this price I'm
