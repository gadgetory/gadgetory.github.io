from Google's headquarters in Mountain
View California where the company just
announced the Nexus One this is Google's
first phone but it's not really from
Google it's from HTC but it is running
the latest version of Android version
2.1 this comes with a bunch of new
features which we're gonna walk you
through in a second the device is
available today and could either be
bought for one hundred and seventy nine
dollars with a two-year contract from
t-mobile or you can buy it unlocked to
use with any carrier as long as it's G s
sounds so let's walk you through a
couple of the features like some other
Android phones it's a it's very slim
this is one of the slimmest phones
actually just eleven and a half
millimeters which is about the size of a
pencil along with that there's a five
megapixel camera with autofocus and
there's also something very interesting
a noise cancellation system which is
built in the phone so if you're talking
it'll kind of reduce background noise
other things a green apple your
headphone jack sleep button and a USB
port a little mini USB port for charging
the battery is removable it's also got a
volume rocker on the left side of thumb
and is it something interesting here
this is actually metal and when you buy
the phone you can get it engraved with
something personal so if you're getting
as a gift there's an option on Google's
website to you know get the name of the
person you're giving it to read on there
the phone comes with a four gigabytes of
memory you can also pop in an extra SD
card here in the back
there's also another interesting feature
this little rollerball here lights up
and as multiple colors so depending on
what application is giving you an alert
you can tell just by the color so that's
pretty cool that's that's something that
iPhone and a lot of other phones don't
have this is the first version of
Android that supports voice search with
navigation so you can actually do a lot
of things that you do with the keyboard
just with your voice
navigate to CNET so this is going to do
a Google search for that location and
then let me get driving directions from
here or wherever to that address
and then the new feature is something
Google is calling a live wallpapers so
if you just hold to choose wallpapers
there's a new option for live wallpapers
and these are kind of like Microsoft's
dream scene back in Windows Vista where
you just have something in the
background it that moves constantly so
if I set this is the wallpaper now every
time I touch it'll create one of these
little checkers so another new feature
is the gallery and this is a
android-specific not zone specific but
it does take advantage of some some some
of the hardware that's in this device
including the accelerometer so as you
roll and pitch the device these photos
go back and forth so this plugs right
into Google's Picasa service so you can
just grab your your photos right off the
web and they also said that they they
grab some of this technology from
Cooliris
so as you pull this wall you can see it
kind of tilt one way or the other there
we go
and that's something they borrowed from
Cooliris so this works in portrait and
landscape mode and depending on which
way you rock the phone your photos will
move so that's something cool so the
Nexus One is shipping out today from
Google you can find out more about it
from us and C net you can also check out
the sale page at google.com slash phone
