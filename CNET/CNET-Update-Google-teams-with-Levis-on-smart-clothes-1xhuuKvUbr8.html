rubbing your jeans I'm Bridget Carey
this is your CNET update Google teased
us that it would have a wearable that
would knock our socks off and it turns
out they really meant socks one of
Google's more exploratory divisions is
working on smart clothing as a way to
control your gadgets with the everyday
fabrics you wear now Google isn't gluing
on a touchscreen to assured this goes
way beyond that Google created its own
conductive yarn to be woven into any
fabric so it looks like normal yarn but
it senses touch and it can respond to
precise gestures the real challenge was
to get conductive yarn that would
withstand the process of making clothes
including stretching and heating and it
had to get it all controlled with a tiny
chip you can tuck away unseen in an
example we saw this fabric put into a
designer jacket and it could be
programmed to make a phone call by
simply swiping your finger across the
sleeve this is called Project jacquard
and Google is working with Levi's to
produce some of the first pieces of
clothing to move this beyond a novelty
and into something realistic one of the
motivations for creating smart fabric is
the fact that our screens are getting
smaller with smartwatches so we need to
think of new ways to interact with
devices and a sleeve certainly provides
more surface area to touch and scroll
but there's another angle to solving
this problem and that's creating
something that could detect your hand
gestures with project soli Google
created a tiny radar sensor that can
detect the slightest hand motions so you
can move your fingers in certain ways to
navigate a screen it's sensitive enough
to let you scroll with a roll of your
thumb like you were holding an invisible
smartphone or you can twist your fingers
like you're rolling an invisible watch
dial to set the time the chip sends out
a radar signal and the reflection of the
signal changes as the hand moves so it
interprets different poses
now Google just has to put that in a
watch and you have a way to control it
without actually touching it let's move
on to another side of tech companies
trying new things this time with food
coming soon to breakfast near you Amazon
flakes cereal to be served with cold
Amazon milk and a cup of freshly brewed
Amazon coffee that's right the online
store
sells everything wants to sell you its
own generic brand of food and household
products The Wall Street Journal reports
Amazon's preparing to add several types
of grocery items and cleaning products
to its generic store brand called
elements Amazon launched elements last
year to sell baby wipes and diapers to
Prime members but the diapers were
discontinued less than two months after
launching because of complaints Amazon
actually makes a few other cheap tech
accessories under the name Amazon basics
including HDMI cords and Bluetooth
speakers that's all for this tech news
update but there's more at cnet.com from
our studios in New York I'm Bridget
