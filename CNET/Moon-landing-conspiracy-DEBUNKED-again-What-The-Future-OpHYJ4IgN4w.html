theories out there nvidia has proved
that the moon landing was real by
generating a fake one welcome to what
the future
on today's show proof that the moon
landing happened if all the other proof
wasn't good enough for you a ridiculous
fire truck concept that might be crazy
enough to work and lastly Russia
releases dramatic video from a failed
manned rocket launch but first let's get
lunar and video was looking for a way to
show off Maxwell its new graphics
processing unit so it decided to take on
one of the most famous bits of evidence
that the moon landing was faked
conspiracy theorists have said that the
lighting in this photo taken by Neil
Armstrong was impossible since the Sun
was the only source of light and Buzz
Aldrin was in the shadow that sounds
like it could be true until you account
for the reflected light the Nvidia team
made an exact replica of the moon
landing using Unreal Engine 4 with that
model Maxwell was able to calculate the
light bounce using what's called voxel
based global illumination or VX GI the
xgi is basically a huge leap forward in
processing how light bounces off
surfaces in 3d renderings
the nvidia team discovered that Aldrin
had been lit by the sun's reflection off
the moon's surface
as well as by the sun's reflection off
of Armstrong spacesuit another famous
bit of evidence beloved by moon doubters
is the lack of stars in the sky NVIDIA
has an answer for that too it's
basically the same reason we can't see
stars during the day on earth the Sun
makes everything else too bright if you
wanted a picture of the stars in the sky
on the daylight side of the Moon this is
what you would get pretty ugly can you
imagine the kinds of comments the
astronauts would have got if they
brought back pictures like that this
fire truck concept seems like the
brainchild of a 12-year old Tony Stark
on a sugar high and I can't stop
watching it
when there's a fire in town you sure as
heck don't want your fire trucks to get
stuck in traffic but the twisted minds
over it too here in chat have a solution
the same engineering company that
brought you flying trains and the
drive-through supermarket wants to
revolutionize how we fight fires
this concept firetruck can sail over
traffic and when it arrives at the scene
firefighters ride a massive drone to the
upper floors to meet the fire the drone
is armed with cannons not sure what the
firefighters are loading into them but
I'm guessing it's some sort of flame
retardant once the fire has been doused
it's time to rescue the bystanders
ladders have their limitations
maybe drones really are the answer the
idea of fighting fires with drones isn't
new latvian company our own ace tested a
firefighting drone last year and it was
able to reach heights significantly
greater than those reachable by
firefighter ladders makes this concept
firetruck look a little less ridiculous
doesn't
Russia is preparing for its next crewed
rocket launch even though the last one
didn't go so well on October 11th a
Russian Soyuz rocket failed mid-flight
in an attempt to bring NASA astronaut
Nick Hague and Russian cosmonaut Alexei
of Chinon to the International Space
Station the failure occurred when one of
the strap-on booster blocks failed to
separate properly smacking into the
central core rocket stage of the Soyuz
resulting in decompression of the cores
fuel tank the rocket lost altitude
control and the escape system was
triggered automatically the escape
procedure has been described as being
launched sideways out of a shotgun the
two would-be space explorers landed in
Kazakhstan on relatively flat terrain
and were immediately sent for medical
evaluation thankfully both men were fine
and Nick Hague has said he's ready to
fly again Russian investigators have
since determined the failure was due to
a deformed sensor that was damaged
during assembly since the mission
failure on October 11th three Soyuz
Rockets have been successfully launched
and the date of the next crewed launch
has actually been moved up from December
20th to December 3rd we'll be watching
best wishes to offer a safe and
successful mission astronauts bravely
risk their lives pushing their bodies
and minds to extremes in an attempt to
expand the limits of human knowledge a
little bit farther with each mission
instead of doing a viewer question this
week I'd like to take a minute to
respond to the letter a' of comments
that we get doubting the accomplishments
of NASA and its scientists my late
grandfather was a solar physicist and a
veteran who dedicated his life to the
discovery of objective truth most people
who pursue science as a career are
interested in discovering objective
truths because that's what science is in
its most basic form if you doubt a
scientific truth that's great skepticism
is a huge part of science but skepticism
alone doesn't make truth and it
certainly doesn't make science the
scientific method has been the basis of
scientific advancement percent
here's how it works you have an idea the
moon landing is fake you turn that idea
into a question how did they fake it you
formulate a hypothesis I think this is
how they faked it
you make predictions this is what I
expect will happen when I test my
hypothesis now it's time to conduct your
experiments to minimize errors make sure
you have some sort of control group for
the thing that you're testing and make
sure that another scientist could
conduct the same experiment and achieve
the same results this is something
called peer review which is hugely
important in the scientific community
lastly analysis what do the results mean
do they support your hypothesis or not
if this sounds like a lot of work of
course it is
discovery of objective truth isn't easy
if it were easy we'd all be scientists
that's all I have to say on the matter
bring on the hate the love and the
harebrained hypotheses in the comments
thanks so much for watching what the
future I'm your host Jessie URL we'll
see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
