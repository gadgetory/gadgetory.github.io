flies and walks like a bat and his
name's not Val Kilmer and he wasn't in
batman forever if you hate ads as much
as me now you can block them just from
your everyday life and a very futuristic
grand piano that took 10 years to design
it looks like a spaceship it doesn't fly
though sorry tomorrow daily
greetings citizens of the Internet
welcome to tomorrow daily the best geek
talk show in the known universe you're
having a great day i'm your host Ashley
together joining me as always the man
the myth the legend the stake Kayla nog
the stake you seem like you're making me
I made of meat I'm very I'm very
medium-rare I'm not rare no but the
medium rare yeah I by the way thanks for
getting me in a Kickstarter after that
game yesterday something like an hour
and a half on kickstarter funding a
bunch of stuff that i'm not gonna get
for a year you're welcome kickstart your
welcome future kale yeah you're welcome
with your hoverboard and whatnot you
paid for the hoverboard I didn't know
you had ten grand just laying around
that's just how you do yeah that's
pretty good i have a lot of side gigs i
was gonna say any of you must have some
great financial advisor name's Eva Kane
it's time to make headlines all right
let's make some headlines here I don't
like this one I don't like this one
either freaks me out a little bit um I
actually really like bats I think
they're cool i like they're adorable I
like to go see him at the zoo I like
take pictures of them good little doggie
face yeah there's a real cute little
like half rat half doggy faces they're
kind of adorable however however this
not so adorable this is a robo bat this
is called dollar da lar and it stands
for deployable air land exploration
robot and yeah as you can see in this
video it has a completely flexible
little wing tips there and this comes
from the Swiss Federal Institute of
Technology lau xanh and the national
center of competence and research which
I like that Center sounds funny but it
looks like a little bat and it has some
interesting features so as you're seeing
in this video it has a foldable skeleton
under its wing so it can it can retract
its wings or spread them and then the
tips of the wings can rotate which
actually allows it to do a couple
different things not only can it fly and
sort of do that can also walk which this
is horrifying to me to watch this thing
like drag itself along the ground just
like a bat would it's super weird it can
go from flying to walking and back
without any human adjustments it can so
there it's going it's flying all around
it flies very very quickly faster than a
person can run
so at some point these will be hunting
us down and murdering us for sure
anything that goes fat runs faster than
a human being an average human being I
just assume will be killing us at some
point so here it is so there's the
transition it lands on the ground and
then all of a sudden up there it goes
its going to get it's a little bat wing
tips together and start walking a very
quick turnover straight to the walk
super quick turnaround so what's their
goal point of this it's proof of concept
right now but the point of this is maybe
it's used for things like search and
rescue so really always say that and
they say that they were supporting it
very suspicious about this whole search
and rescue purpose because I think it's
been used so much now that it's like oh
yeah it's a I know it as a Gatling gun
attached to its face but its search and
rescue yes but but to their point you
can fly to a place and without having
precision landed and then just go walk
the rest of the way and it's flexible so
it can kind of I'm sure it can maneuver
a little bit better than a rigid right
it was durable too yeah it had the thing
in the video or shockproof they were
like hitting in the wings and stuff so
that's fantastic and they said they were
actually inspired by vampire bats oh
good i'm assuming version to point out
will have blood draining of human blood
draining abilities yeah nightmares uh so
would you rather have this flying around
the drones well it seems like this is a
drone that could actually really harm
you on purpose so I'm gonna go with
regular drug don't have the hover
capability chase after you when it
crashes into the ground this is actually
I'm still actually really really
impressed with its versatility it is
super most of them are like yeah yeah
it's a drone but like if you do anything
but if you barely look at it the brain
pieces yeah exactly so kudos on that one
it's pretty cool but also a little
terrifying against care settings gear
sets gear siding okay please can please
get this is bonkers okay I don't know if
anybody has ever really had the problem
of looking out the window seeing an ad
or a billboard and just was like ah I
wish I didn't see that yeah well check
out brand kill okay this is a device
that a racism blocks brand names and
logos from your vision that let me
ridiculous at actual brands this is a
obviously this is a hack from a
hackathon from for student developers it
uses look it's very primitive it uses
car
Ward goggles webcam and a 7 inch display
with a webcam feeding your entire field
of view the whole fielding anything it's
just what well it's it's feeding ok so
the Eugene with the screen and that's at
the webcam is shoot exactly such a
little delayed so here's here's what it
does blurs logos that are pre-programmed
into your headset so the ones that they
have at the only pre-programmed ones
it's not gonna like sense with right
here's the ones a program Starbucks and
McDonald's see that a lot Facebook see
that a lot dr. pepper that's awfully
specific yeah and more uh do I just saw
lucky charms real quick I have an issue
with them blocking dr. pepper because it
looks like it's delicious first of all
shout at the dr pepper I general a black
Dr Pepper but also it looks like motor
oil so if they block out a motor oil
logo and you start drinking it thinking
it's dr. pepper anyway maybe sometimes
you need labels guises are saying back
back to the back to the jacket the
science inside computing is Python and
an open CV okay ready for the goal I
always break the goal exactly is the
point so here's their quote they want to
blind consumers to the surplus of
corporate branding I covered your you
paused it we want to blind kazoo please
if you want them it's just want to blind
them we want to blind consumers to the
court the surplus of corporate branding
and envision a future in which consumers
can augment reality to opt out of
corporate influence well maybe Microsoft
will buy this for hololens I was just
about to say that hollow lens that can
tote lisken totally totally I can
integrate yeah just blur out I have a
technology uh I don't really have this
issue but alright yeah i mean i know
some people complain like oh gosh it's
like all day long constant branding in
my face so I guess I mean I guess I got
it but it is it's interesting enough and
then I love dr. peppers yeah that's true
it brings us to our hashtag the day
which is hashtag TD block I love this
one I want to know what you wish you
could block out with technology and how
that would work so my thing is is I
would like a technology that would go
into my contact lenses and that would
blur out or otherwise remove like
annoying people like if I could just you
know like more specifically if I if I
to be more specific I would say people
who are rude to like servers people are
rude people back out rude people yeah
just they don't exist erase them that's
like uh that's like black mirror there's
an episode they block out and on the
holiday episode you can block out people
that are a Croma smilers no spoilers but
that's interesting don't give so anyway
uh my now yeah mines mines much simpler
okay it's more like in the adblock space
but I want to block people that have
bleeding hearts on facebook just people
that just complain about like I'm
playing about everything went well it's
just like thing fio deal with it
internally and figure it out maybe talk
to someone close create a real you know
connection with somebody rather than
just going and getting their artificial
you know praise that you become addicted
to when you feel like you have to keep
doing and I thought about this too much
I think that's already been real
deployment facebook I'm doing my
facebook today oh yeah but you can also
share and connect true you can make
clothes get party invites yeah events on
them feel those yet that's a good I like
that that's a good one just to get rid
of all the extra nonsense I like how
both of ours are we hate people just so
people I got it ready boys so annoying
all right well this they're not flying
robot bats that's true that is very true
okay sorry let's move on let's talk
about this future piano cuz it is really
cool looking and I can't wait to show
this you guys so this is from the this
is the lead designer his he's Hungarian
he's a piano player name gergely blog on
you Logano magana okay so we're seeing
some previews hear of this piano and
it's like I don't want to give it away
yet because it's very sleek so this
piano looks like a spaceship like I'm
not I'm not even kidding you guys this
piano is insane looking it took over ten
years to design around 8,000 engineering
hours it has over 18,000 parts it is
called a bogan ye oh my god just
revealed that they already oh wow yeah
there it is um it is extremely
attractive in terms of pianos it is
gorgeous it's like the first but it's
like the Maserati of it's a ridiculous
like expensive Aston Martin of pianos
cherry there you go wow that 10 years so
it has two legs instead of
this is very interesting the reason why
is because um there's a hollow under the
piano where a normal third leg would be
like in the back they see on like grand
pianos now that there's a hollow there
instead of a leg that allows the sound
to be conducted in a hollow that pushes
it clearer it has more clarity when the
sound comes out to the audience oh it
has a unique composite soundboard a ma
and a modified iron and wood frame so
the soundboard this is very interesting
is weather resistant and uninhibited by
humidity or dryness and some other
elemental kind of issues that a lot of
pianos have so for example if you travel
with the piano if you're a professional
and you have a piano that you either
travel with or otherwise let's say you
live in an area where there is a lot of
weather so New York for example and you
can't necessarily fully control the room
that your piano stored in uh that means
your piano might go out of tune I sooner
or you live in a house absolutely your
pianos out of tune sooner and what
they're saying is this because of the
soundboard that's extremely resistant to
elemental issues that it holds its tune
longer and it has less maintenance as
well so over time you'll have to
maintain this piano less I'm sure the
cost I was just about to actually
there's no horse no cost yet which means
we will never ever buy them but well no
no but I'm sure like Lady Gaga's already
like scoring one out and making like
some sort of sleep chamber yeah she
sleeps inside I'm sure she has one
already and like sleeps in it and
actually flew it here from whatever
planet she came from so I okay so super
fast yeah I know this is this is crazy
it why did it take ten years well
because he was saying it this was a
whole team of like dedicated engineers
designers musicians like people who came
through and and works on this project to
make sure that this was the most because
we haven't really seen if you think
about it we haven't really seen great
advances in the actual grand piano in a
really long time ver2 yeah all kind of
you know when you go back in time they
all look pretty much the same for like a
certain point forward and they've just
they've gotten better at different
things but never
are like two it's never changed this
drastically since the invention of the
grand PA it's it's really strange to me
that it doesn't it didn't sound like it
has a lot of like technology in it no I
like I think that they just really
worked on the design being really
beautiful and sort of futuristic looking
and then on top of that figuring out
exactly what parts and creating new
things like the sound board that would
enable the piano to have the best
possible sound hold its tune for the
longest amount of time have the least
amount of maintenance and also give the
clearest and most robust sound
experience to anybody listening to it
which i think is awesome very cool look
yeah so that's a that's the really
expensive spaceship piano that I just
want really bad it looks like the cars
and the Jetsons huge jump in and go poop
and I do a little bit I tried to teach
myself once my cousin got piano lessons
when I was a kid and I didn't so I was
kind of jealous and so I just started
like learning myself would you get
hosting lessons yeah yeah when I was
five it took hosting listen instead of a
so said of soccer all right here on the
scene where the dog is now I played
volleyball that was my that was my jam
sorry I tried waste your time I tried to
play I tried to play piano I could still
play a little bit but I never actually
like formally learned how good but I can
play like couple songs I don't know
anyway on that on that note do you see
it do you see what I did there on that
note we're gonna take a quick break I
know kale I know but we're going to be
back with new releases and of course
your user feedback and our phone tiger
for the day so don't click weights
tomorrow daily
welcome back to tomorrow daily uh it's
Tuesday which is always an exciting day
for you especially but both of us yeah
because well because it's the day that
we tell everybody all the great stuff
that's coming out oh yeah and what they
should be doing so this is new releases
all right first up I'm not gonna bury
the lead guys you gotta go bye Grim
Fandango remastered oh my god Ellis oh
that's right no I find you never have to
hear you'll never have to hear about me
saying I'm excited it's coming out again
because it's here it's out it is y ou G
a point click adventures right one of
the classics one of the classics are
classics you play Manny calavera you're
an agent and you sell like it's like
vacation packages for people to go to
like the land of the dead it's like a
four-year journey anyway you get 4 by 3
and the yeah of course it is cuz that's
how the game was made fair enough so um
yeah it's uh I'm just super excited
about this you got glottis I mean oh man
I'm just so jazzed I can't wait to play
it I already pre-ordered it it's over on
over on my playstation 4 what are they
what are they saying oh I want to know
how they're updating it look what's what
are the things better graphics the
controls are a little wonky back in the
90s um and then they're also doing all
kinds of stuff like they redid the they
redid the orchestral the music they did
I think they have like some special
features i'm not sure what they are
because i haven't downloaded the game
yet um but all of are you gonna replay
it of course yeah I already pre-ordered
it so I can't wait to replay it and xbox
got screwed on this one hey well the
thing is is I think Sony was more
willing to risk on it and so I think
that they worked with Tim on sort Tim
Schafer on bringing and the other thing
is is they had to get permission cuz
grim fandango is a Lucas arts game so
they had to get permission from Disney
now who owns Lucas so that was like a
whole big thing so I'm hoping though
that that means cuz they obviously are
now remastering day of the tentacle
which is huge yeah i'm really excited
like that one better no I like grim
fandango the best but right really like
i'm gonna try it i'm gonna try it out do
it it's like 15 bucks so it's it's not
even in you have to play fallout again
fallout 3 fallout 3 yeah there's no
other fallout i'm sorry oh i'll consider
these i'll consider these words oh boy i
have to fight will i have to be able
play it on my xbox one I don't have an
xbox 360 anymore what else is what else
is that ok so dying lights coming out I
thought this was very interesting game I
know I thought this was already have you
heard about no really
that's because people are already
playing on the otha yeah yeah so this is
okay so dying light is the first person
survival horror games yes and the the
thing that I thought was interesting
about this game is that like apparently
it's very realistic in the way that like
when you start your week and you like
you have like boards and stuffy it's
like fight off zombies with and then you
get better at actually fighting them off
later and you like makeshift things that
are actually cool and useful but not it
not at first who's the developer on this
but a pretty rough oh that's a really
good question and I don't have that off
top of my head oops sorry um but it's
it's gonna be available it's available
today the 27th on playstation 4 xbox one
and steam so really it's kind of just
choose your own choose your own console
and I just saw I've heard good things
about it i think a lot of people are
hoping that this is sort of a sort of it
not a substitute but sort of something
like a dead rising or you know game ya
know people are people are trying to get
away from Daisy and h10 so much more
expansive and I think this is sort of
like a short jaunt uh Techland Thecla
see that's why it is I don't know that
is um but dying light I'm pretty decent
like you can watch I'm sure she was
gonna be twitch like oh yeah yeah so you
can definitely check that out um and
then this was also a favorite thing for
me to read not necessarily new games but
older games available in a new way oh
yeah GOG has been releasing all kinds of
Star Wars games like older Star Wars
games and so now today star wars
republic commando star wars jedi knight
don't know you know Star Wars
Starfighter are all available as of
today joining joining i might add the
first two waves of games which were
galactic battlegrounds saga x-wing
alliance x-wing vs. TIE fighter one of
the greatest games of all time dark dark
forces Knights of the Old Republic to
the Sith Lords battlefront to Rogue
Squadron 3d rebellion and empire at war
gold pack so it's a pretty serious
collection of Star Wars games just make
another battle front please oh I really
like to have another battlefront that if
I was so fun don't even make the force
awakens we can I just make another
battlefront may
cuz star wars battlefront the force
awakens I give us a battlefront game set
in that universe I would totally play a
game George if you're listening I know
you're not involved in all I know but I
swear he could use a sneaky little fella
he can get him now they're gonna be they
should I think I shut the door and
George Lucas did you already said he's
like I gave my ideas to Disney I gave my
treatments for episode 7 through 9
basically threw them out haha as bold
Disney bulb will play they're like not
enough Avengers in it they don't see I
don't see iron man anywhere on this
script um alright so with that being
said it is time as we always do every
day for your user feedback you guys came
up with some really good answers for the
hashtag t DVR browse to say what brat
what site you'd want to look at in
virtual reality they stayed away from
the UK between the sexy prawns okay kept
a clean Fabio wrote to us and said well
the first thing I would do is probably
install adblock yeah look at that he's
got a futurama reference in there Leela
there oh you thought that to actually
use hashtag scare citing excuse adding
caution wrote to us and said any
high-end car manufacturers website
hashtag speed for days also what would
be are browsing due to hackers and
hacking I'm gonna tell you right now
what it's gonna do with hackers and
hacking roll that footage loganville
yes okie dokie battle that's that's what
it looks like and that is footage you
totally nailed it though nails it um can
I just say that's one more like my
favorite all time like it's so bad it's
good Johnny mnemonic do you remember it
from Back to the Future to that may have
the headsets to ya how did you do all
right I just said that's what it's gonna
look like just FYI this FYI and if you
want to see the future just watch Johnny
mnemonic cuz it's I mean pretty much ok
it's like one of the greatest films of
all time yeah can we quote you on that
put it on the poster put it I put it's a
pull quote you put it right on the DVD
right on the block cuz I'm sure it's not
out on blu-ray it's on the DVDs on the
VHS tape put my pull quote on the VHS
tape rotted fish wrote to us and said
hey Google Earth and Mars sites and the
Vatican archives Wow Google Earth was a
great idea a good call on that the
Vatican archives I thought was really
interesting because you're not allowed
in there unless you're like a super
theology historian person so and it
takes like a lot of doing to get special
access so i thought that it would be
really cool like things that most people
can't see because they're afraid of
destruction of property or otherwise
like harming so like a museum exhibits
that was another a good one you could
get up close and personal with something
get really close to it put some thought
into that one yeah a glenn and Stefan
see said the same thing but I use
Glenn's tweets and I keep it simple
Google Earth and street view I'd be
happy and fit if I could explore the
world on demand and NVR like that yeah
great great great choices I'm delay
wrote to us and said tvtropes would be
incredible swallow the red pill jump
down the road and lastly hay-soos road
Rosen said Wikipedia galaxy from a few
weeks ago oh yeah and V are the most
beautiful way to grasp can an
interconnectedness of knowledge they
like this a lot they really like this
one that's pretty cool so what was
someone this week uh the one that's for
today yeah today's is TD block ok TV but
do you want to get rid of yeah
how would you do it this is just gonna
be us being cranky that is everybody
pretty cranky about it uh Jeff like
those damn kids I would get those kids
off my lawn and erase them from my lawn
um all right guys it's time for our
photog refer of the day I'm sorry
