the Apple event taking a first look at
the Apple watch series for this is the
44 millimeter gold aluminum version that
Apple has just announced and let's take
a look at the design elements first the
watch screen is actually a lot bigger
and not just because the size is
increased but actually the bezels you
can see here are a lost slimmer I'm
wearing the series 3 alongside the new
series 4 and you can really see how much
screen real estate they have improved
now another thing I wanted to point out
in terms of design over here is the
digital crown which doesn't have that
red dot anymore it now signals LTE with
just an outline a red outline along the
digital crown the digital crown also now
has haptic feedback that will allow for
the ECG readings but I'll get to that
later on because that will be launching
right away it'll come later as an update
so my hand model over here is going to
help us with the watch complications you
can see it now supports eight eight
different complications on the screen so
you'll be able to see a lot more
information right at the watch face
along with these new cool effects like
the steam effect that we're showcasing
right here
it also has the new inch
notifications it's got a better
accelerometer which will be able to
detect Falls that also that feature is
also not going to be launching right
away with the watch but later on so
we're also going to see the low low
heart rate notification Apple already
the Apple watch with watch OS 4 already
had an elevated heart rate notification
but now you're going to get one when
it's dangerously or perceived
dangerously low the digital crown will
also serve as an LCD reader you're going
to be able to take your ECG by placing
your finger on the digital crown once
that feature launches and let's take a
look at the sensor that's gonna allow
for this to happen on the back of the
watch itself it's got a whole new
sensors over here on the back I'm going
to get really close for you guys to
check it out and it's completely
different from the series 3 that's
because it now measures electrical
impulses from the heart not just the
light based PPG system that the series 3
had so here you are here's the new
sensors on the back of the watch it's
also made with sapphire and ceramic
which means you're going to get a much
better signal when for LTE reception
which is another improvement over the
previous model so just taking a look at
that
series for design one last time taking a
look at how large and a kind of a
rounded the screen looks
just the edge to edge display that we
you didn't get before on the series
three or on the previous Apple watches
that actually hadn't changed much since
lunch and it actually is seems to be at
least slimmer than the previous models
you're seeing it here on the side I'm
going to take a look over here on my
wrist you can't really appreciate how
much thinner it is but actually this
sensor just it doesn't feel like it juts
out as much on my wrist again this is
kind of just a first look I'm actually
going to take them off and put them side
by side to give you a closer look</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
