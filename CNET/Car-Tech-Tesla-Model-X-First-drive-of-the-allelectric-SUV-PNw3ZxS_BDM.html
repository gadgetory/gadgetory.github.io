we go all right first impression behind
the wheel of the car is that it looks
and feels a lot like a Model S but your
perspective is higher you've got a
better visibility especially thanks to
the panoramic windscreen which goes all
the way up over your head
and then some performance of the car
feels very good ludicrous mode feels
very good indeed zero to 60 in 3.2
seconds that's just four tenths of a
second slower than the Model S and very
quick for a car of this size even the
slower cars will do 0 to 60 in under 4
seconds which is absolutely unheard of
in this category of car it handles very
well as well not quite as well as the
Model S but again compared to other SUVs
it feels really great on the road
especially going through the twisty bits
so the basic idea is that the doors open
really wide in high so if you need to
put someone in a child seat for example
you can reach in here really easily
without having to duck down or tuck
behind seats it's actually nice and easy
to to get in the seat back here on the
seats pushed up kind of far but I can
move it back this these are mounted on
central pillars which makes them easier
to get in and out there's also room
underneath the seat so you can run some
packages behind and when you're ready to
go just push this button and after the
beep doors start to come down just that
easily now in case you're worried about
these doors hitting the roof of your
parking garage or that kind of thing
there are ultrasonic sensors up there
much like a parking sensor they'll
detect if there's anything above that'll
keep the door from opening the doors
will always open to some degree so you
can always kind of sneak out but they
will at least not run in your ceiling
which is a good thing at tonight's event
the first five lucky mile X runners will
take home their SUVs right now Tesla's
only selling the Signature Edition
starting at a whopping 132 thousand
dollars the lower cost model we're going
to have to wait for that we're gonna
have to be waiting a long time before
you and I can buy one too they've got
some 30,000 pre-orders to get through
before anybody will be able to go into a
store and buy one but right now it's a
great start the car drives great it
feels great it's really high-end it's a
step forward I'm looking forward to
seeing more of these on the road
you
well the Headroom isn't so great but
what kind of cosy back here certainly
better than the station wagon my parents
had when I was a kid</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
