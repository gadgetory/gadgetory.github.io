Wi-Fi router EA night 200 from Linksys
now this one is a second tri-band router
on the market rivaling this Netgear or
8000 i have right here at the two of
them are very similar in a way that they
have a 3y 5 and 1 2.4 gig headbands and
to five big hood bed you can put the
tube and eat a single Wi-Fi network or
use them as two separate Wi-Fi networks
the idea is that by heading to five big
hood band you can handle more 5
gigahertz clients but most importantly
because they are fast client and slow
client the router can group the slow one
to one band and the fast one to the
other making sure that each client can
connect to the router as the fastest
possible speed and speaking speed this
router here support the three stream
setup of the 802 point you have an AC
Wi-Fi standard meaning that on the 2.4
gigahertz band it can handle up to 600
megabit per second and on the 5 headband
up to 1,300 megabit per second now
because the 3 band can work at the same
time you have the total combined
bandwidth of 3200 megabits per second
now in real life you can never achieve
that speed but in my testing the links
is here was actually very fast offering
the top sustained speed up some 600
megabits per second that is about almost
as fast as Wi-Fi can get for now the ei9
200 here shares a similar feature set as
other links is smart Wi-Fi routers this
include a nice network map that display
all connected clients a good QoS feature
an effective parental control that is
very easy to use and now the router can
support guest networking in both 2.4
gigahertz and 5 gigahertz band you can
even change the name of the guest
networks to whatever you like now
hardware wise the router here have 6
antenna even though only 3 of them can
be seen from outside here the other 3
are hidden inside the chassis on the
back it has the usual four Gigabit LAN
or an one gigabit one or Internet port
there's also one USB 3.0 port and one
USB 2.0 port to host a storage device or
a printer now when hosting a storage
device the rare can also work as a very
good network attached storage server it
doesn't support Time Machine backup
however all right so in short this
legacy has a very good writer even
though it's kind of overkill for most
home it doesn't hurt to have it though
if you can afford the $300 price tag for
more on this one here check out my full
review at cnet.com again it's a great
router but not exactly $300 great but
that means you get it people know you're
rich not for me though because I got it
for free this is better than being rich
and I like it very much and that's
because I'm don't know and this has been
the first look at the AC 3200 smart
Wi-Fi router public sees</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
