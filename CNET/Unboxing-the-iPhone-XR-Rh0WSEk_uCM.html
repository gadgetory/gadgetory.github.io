phone tennis max
and there's the iPhone 10 our apples
releasing his third iPhone of the fall
the iPhone 10 are cost less than the 10s
and 10's max and it's also in the middle
of the two phones in size although it
has the same processor it doesn't have a
second camera on the back but a lot of
the stuff seems similar and we've got an
iPhone 10 are right here in white that I
got to review and I'm gonna unbox it for
you now keep in mind when I get a review
unit they are wrapped up but the box
itself is not sealed so you'll see that
when I open it up here we go this is
what's inside the iPhone 10 our box
packaging looks pretty similar 200 50 60
gigabyte is the capacity on this one it
actually goes from 64 to 128 to 256 so
each one has its own little color scheme
on the box white is a silver type design
and let's open it up now pretty similar
to other iPhone boxes they're designed
by Apple in California
paperwork and inside here is the ten are
wrapped in plastic so let's take care of
that slowly there's the white glass back
this is also available in black it's
also available in coral blue yellow and
red so a lot of color choices take that
off
all right put that off to the side and
this has an LCD display and aluminum
sides versus the steel side on the
iPhone 10 s 10 and 10 s max it kind of
feels like a hybrid between the 8/8 plus
and the iPhone 10 it does have a
front-facing face ID true depth camera
also in the box same 5 watt phone
charger as always Wired Lightning
earpods
as always no headphone adapter for 3.5
this started happening with the iPhone
10 s so just a heads up you have to buy
that separately frustrating because
there is no headphone jack on this phone
and lightning cable can also charge the
iPhone 10 are wirelessly so let's turn
it on take a little quick guided tour so
power button on the side the feel of
this phone really does feel like it's in
between the 10s and the 10s Maxx or the
eight and the eight plus so the hand
feel is pretty good it doesn't feel like
it's pushing as the edges of my palm
where I feel like he eight plus always
did it is bigger than the eight so it's
a tweener size I think it kind of feels
like the pixel three XL will do some
comparisons so looking at the display
it's got the same edge to edge type feel
though it's LCD curved edges around the
the corners and the cutout for a true
depth you see the bezels here or a
little bit bigger
noticeably so than the iPhone 10s and
10's max anyway there's a number of
steps in order to set this up but the
phone feels good it feels a little bit
thicker than the iPhone 10s and 10's max
it is a little bit thicker the size of
it you can see here is the SIM card slot
this also supports dual SIM that's
coming in a software update where the
second SIM is in E SIM so you can add
two sims to it make sure that your phone
is unlocked versus being a locked model
power button over here
and if you go to the other side the
volume buttons the silenced rocker on
the bottom here are the speaker holes
there's lightning now if you're really
in the details the iPhone 10s and 10's
max had a a symmetrical design here just
doesn't have that because that had an
extra antenna element on the 10s and
10's max this does not this is LTE
advanced it does not have the extra
gigabit LTE that the 10s and 10's max
have but still a teeny advanced should
give you equivalent network speeds to
what you could get last year the glass
back a word on that apple says the
durability on this is better than the
iPhone 10 but not quite the durability
of the 10s and 10's max stay tuned for
drop testing in the future the front
glass is the same as the 10s and 10's
max which is great news because the 10s
took a lot of drops before it finally
broke we'll have to see how this one
handles this is also water-resistant
it's not quite to two meters it's one
meter but it can take spills it can do
all that again one of the things is how
it handles portrait photos using that
single rear lens stay tuned for a lot
more as we test this look at our review
I'm Scott Stein at C net talk to you
soon well in that final thing were you
like you know when they Motion Picture
Association of America logo and all that
stuff will do this and now this will be
the extra scene it'll come back and I'll
be like wait there's a hint what new
characters being announced it's Captain
Marvel he's opening the headphones what</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
