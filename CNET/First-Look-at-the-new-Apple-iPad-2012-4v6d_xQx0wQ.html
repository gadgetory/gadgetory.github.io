at apple's ipad launch event for the new
ipad we're we're thinking this is going
to call the ipad 3 ipad HD it's just the
new ipad in fact the ipad 2 is sticking
around at a lower price point but if you
want the new ipad you're going to be
paying the same 499 base price for a 16
gigabyte model up a hundred dollars for
32 and another hundred dollars for a 64
gigabyte model so those prices are the
same also the same pricing for the
carrier enabled models so for 130
dollars extra you can get a 4g enabled
ipad with either AT&amp;amp;T or verizon as your
carrier so the big deal here is the new
screen this is a screen that has four
times the pixels as the as the last
generation of the ipad or the original
generation 2 so you're getting an
amazing image quality on here arguably
better pixel density picture quality
than you would be getting on a 1080p
television in your home if you've ever
looked up close to the ipad and you've
seen what almost looks like a like a
grid or a chain-link fence of pixels
that is gone now you're looking at this
and it just looks like photorealistic it
looks like the games books text looks a
lot crisper and clearer you're not
getting that same kind of gritty image
quality that you were getting on the
ipad 2 so that was a prediction that
came true another prediction that came
true is a better camera quality there is
now a 5 megapixel camera on the back of
this that's capable of 1080p video with
built-in image stabilization you're
getting the same vga camera on the front
for facetime chat so that hasn't changed
the actual position of the camera
doesn't seem to have changed much at all
either that was a question that we were
thinking about going into this whether
or not people have to buy new cases
doesn't seem like you will although it
is slightly thicker to the point you
really wouldn't notice it but if you're
going to break out the calipers and
really measure it you'd notice a slight
slightly thicker iPad they've also
introduced a few new ilife apps
including I photo
so now if you want to do your photo
editing on the iPad you can do that
which is a better proposition now that
the camera on the back is actually
capable of shooting some great pictures
so i'm donna bell christina calm and
that was a first look at the new ipad</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
