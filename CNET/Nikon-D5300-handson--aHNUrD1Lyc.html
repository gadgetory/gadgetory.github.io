CNET and this is the nikon d50 300 the
replacement for its popular d50 200 the
Nikon d50 300 delivers a slightly
redesigned and noticeably smaller and
lighter body the incorporation of a
sensor without an optical low-pass
filter bigger and better viewfinder in
LCD and an expanded feature set which
now includes Wi-Fi and geo-tagging built
right into the camera combined with the
new 18 to 140 millimeter lens kit you
get a more expensive but still a great
option for the family photographer
enthusiast the design and interface are
fundamentally the same as the d50 200
while it's smaller and lighter
it still feels comfortable to use and
reasonably well built the grips
redesigned to increase the clearance
between your hand in the lens it really
does feel more comfortable the drive
mode button had to be relocated to the
side in order to make room for the Wi-Fi
and GPS antennas and I actually prefer
it there the LCD and viewfinder are both
bigger and a bit nicer it also has a
stereo microphone now my only real
complaint is about the multi controller
it feels a little too flat and hard to
maneuver precisely the camera
incorporates a new version of Nikon's X
speed image processor which allows for
the addition of 1080 60 P video and
better battery life although the camera
does have a new battery
the GPS intermittently failed to tag
images though even when I hadn't moved
connecting to mobile devices via Wi-Fi
works relatively seamlessly though the
camera doesn't have NFC to smooth the
kinks of connecting and Nikon's app has
limited tethered shooting capabilities
you can't change any settings but you
can touch focus I don't like that the
app stays loaded in memory on Android
when you disconnect it's performance
remains roughly the same as the d50 200
which is pretty good for this class live
view shooting is still on the slow
disappointing side but by all other
measures including its 5.1 frame per
second JPEG burst I think most people
will be pretty happy with it
if you shoot RAW it's still insufficient
for continuous shooting since it still
only has
six frame bursts buffer the
anti-aliasing filter free sensor
produces great photos and the extra
sharpness it provides plus the excellent
JPEG processing results in useable
images as high as ISO 6400 in a body
less than $1,000 that's really really
good even shooting in 14 bit raw doesn't
seem to preserve a lot of highlight
detail but the camera tends to
underexpose as a rule and you can
recover a lot of shadow detail without
introducing a lot of noise I'm not crazy
about the cameras default settings
they include normal image quality rather
than fine which is a higher compression
level manual adjustments during movie
shooting are turned off and what's a
real pain for me sequential file
numbering defaults to off with the d50
300 Nikon remains at the head of the
class of sub 1000 dslr's
I'm Lauri grinning and this is the Nikon
d50</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
