exoskeleton for use by paralyzed
patients so they can walk again which is
awesome spider-man is back with marble
finally I kind of I've got more details
but very exciting and a new hotel will
be employing robots almost exclusively
and you're never gonna guess where the
hotel is Japan why do you ruin all my
good surprises tomorrow daily
greetings citizens the Internet welcome
to tomorrow daily the best geek talk
show in the known universe I'm your host
Ashley Skeletor me as always spider-man
himself kill anonymous you don't know
that you're not supposed to reveal your
secret identity that's right is very
true and about man I think the Internet
collectively exploded yesterday when
that news broke so well it's between
that the fallout kind of 0 which thanks
for not putting that on here on a story
short route up Bethesda announced and a
fallout press conference for e3 which
they've never done before they've never
had their own event which is leading a
lot of people including mr. anonymous
over here to to believe that fallout 4
is going to be announced yeah because
like I know there are some people that
were like Dishonored 2 yes it's like
come on what were you doing come on what
are you doing with your lights get
excited I thought so anyway we got a lot
of good see where yeah we got some great
stuff so let's hit the headlines
dishonored shut up going to go
toe-to-toe against fallout I get
aggravated to kill if you were cheering
for dis honor dukale's gonna get our
newspaper roll it up and just Bop you in
the nose I love the game but let's move
on alright so let's talk about ReWalk I
don't know if you guys have heard of
ReWalk but it is an exoskeleton and it
is being used to help paralyzed people
walk again which is pretty cool but the
big news is is that is now fda approved
oh so this is now a thing that is
fda-approved people can you can
prescribe it you can you know hopefully
go through your insurance and it'll
cover some of it it's pretty pricey I'll
get to that in a minute but here it is
I'm here if you're just listening it is
an exoskeleton that goes around the
outside of the legs and you have these
carbon fiber foot plates that you put
your shoes in two and then you're
actually able to walk it will move the
hips in the knees well and it's sort of
like having a pair of robot legs and
then some crutches to help you sort of
balance yourself oh that's pretty it's
got an eight hour battery life so it'll
last you most today but then there's
also backup battery so you can swap it
out if it dies just like it's like your
favorite android phone um and it's it's
kind of amazing so it's got this is the
thing I really like does not only can it
walk and turn you
also climb stairs in it which is pretty
amazing in and of itself and then also
it works with motion sensors so when
you're in it and you lean forward it
knows you want to start walking so it
starts walking but credible but if it
doesn't if like for some reason you're
leaning for it it's not recognizing that
there's actually a wearable like a
SmartWatch that you can tell it hey I
want to climb stairs or hey I want to
walk right now hey I want to do this um
so like super impressed crazy amazing I
don't I don't know anything about like
medical insurance or anything but
there's an fda approval me now that that
you can get it through it's possible you
can get it like maybe some some you know
up to a certain amount covered by your
insurance well yeah because it's FDA
approved it's a good thing that's like
uh what is it like a try like trial
therapies that are not covered by
insurance so it's possible that some
people might be able to get some at
least some relief on the price tag which
is pretty steep it's seventy thousand
dollars but can you put a price tag on
walking again I guess not I guess not I
mean it's like one of those things were
it's like it seems really expensive
hopefully it'll come way down in price
as we get better at making these things
yeah um but but I mean for somebody to
be able to get up and walk again I know
they interviewed the article i dread
they interviewed a woman who has been
paralyzed from the waist down for i
think 12 years and she said this is
amazing i get to you and she's just
right up and walking and she's like I
just I never thought I'd feel like this
again and it was just so cool like I
just I I thought that was the greatest
thing and I technology just get better
and better and better yeah and cheaper
and cheaper and cheaper so that
everybody who has had you know these
types of accidents like whether it's you
know less the guy who got to to robot
arms to control his mind or people who
are paralyzed use these exoskeletons
like so cool very cool nice I love it so
what a great story all right tell me I
know we're dying to just get right into
this okay so this was a big this was the
big internet thing this week as far as
nerds are concerned because sony has
struck a deal with Marvel to have them
co-produce the next spider-man movie and
the spider-man universe for kind of the
foreseeable future yes the spider-man is
back Marvel kind of all right I already
knew that Spiderman was going to make an
appearance in the next Avengers movie or
Avengers infinity war but now marvel
uh has signed up has allowed yeah Kevin
Fahey Kevin foggy to work with Sony to
kind of hold their hand and help them
walk on through the prize season eight
the spider-man franchise with the whole
Marvel mentality I'll be real here the
last class few spider-man's were okay
yeah so they're going with a new
direction that's gonna kind of like seep
in with the Marvel Universe Oh which is
a good thing but what is this mean girl
said an old man in a shack on top of
Mount Baldy so you said kind of like so
they kind of have cuz they didn't like
it's not yet i'll get to that I'll get
to that I'm forgetting I know I know
that's the breakdown part okay but this
is what does this mean Campbell that
means Andrew Garfield's out he's not
gonna be spider-man anymore which means
and more or less that we're gonna see a
whole new start with yeah it's gonna be
it may be a renewed origins gay yeah
maybe a reboot but it's totally in a
time of the universe also no sinister
sex movie like somebody had all these
plants make a sinister six movie an
all-woman spider-man oh and they've this
they're just we're not gonna do any of
these we're just gonna see what Kevin if
I he comes up with and we're gonna work
together and that's so good they shell
um yes I didn't know that okay so here's
kind of here's kind of should we be
excited okay Alice has decreed the
excitations here so the right still
belong to Sony so it's not Marvel's
property they're still gonna belong to
Sony somebody's gonna put it putting the
money they're gonna do the distribution
and unfortunately they're gonna get
final creative control which so it's not
like Marvel is gonna be like all right
here it is yeah but Sony could just be
like well we want them to be fluffy or
whatever I don't um but with Marvel now
being engaged with this there is a
possibility that Marvel characters will
spill over into the spider-man universe
so maybe Wolverine comes in like cuts is
wet so max that's fine yeah that deal
work yeah you know what I mean what's
all because you were so uh yeah Iron Man
or whatever you're in man so so so yeah
there you go it's a they're gonna be
co-producing it at Kevin foggy and also
Amy Pascal step down as the Sony Tony
see you but started her own
auction company that is still funded and
run under the Sony umbrella so it's sort
of like a Kansas City shuffle like she's
still kind of it Sony but not
technically with side it's kind of a
thing so she's got a little bit of a
tude if you remember the emails so I'm
gonna I'm gonna hold reserved and just
see what happens there's a there's a
quote from the CEO of sony which i
wanted to okay this is the right
decision for the franchise for our
business for Marvel and for the fans and
we're like duh yeah I think people been
so there you go the next spider-man
movie is set to come out in summer of
2017 so that's presumably one will see
him but also he'll be a committee award
what they move back a bunch of the
Marvel movies so they they took that
slate I was reading about this today
they took that I think it's july twenty
eight twenty seventeen or whatever and
they moved back like black panther I
think Thor they moved Marvel properties
yeah yeah because it's part of like that
part of their thing and humans got moved
back to like 20 19 now it's like it's
shifted anything beyond that got shifted
forward so it's like black panther
Captain Marvel in humans like there's a
few Marvel movies that got pushed back
because of them saying oh well we got
spider-man now so here's where he's
gonna be like right in the middle of
everything right in the mix not not
before Avengers 3 but definitely after
civil war captain america civil war
which means we may see civil war we just
said you're just saying a lot of things
a lot of nerd but yeah so it's we'll see
spider-man marvel and who knows what the
future holds for spider-man ya know if
it's gonna be rebooted absolutely will
be a Saltine I heard it I heard a rumor
today um a couple of inside sources haha
say telling me that uh studio is looking
for someone around the age of 19 on a
play spider-man so someone young they're
looking for a young guy that would be
awesome so which would you play really
great I think against the older Avengers
like you're looking at a whole group
people are quite a bit older and not
only that we've only had like older ish
spider-man like andy barfie was pretty
he did was it like like you belong nice
like better leader do you know where
they're like 30 years old but playing
high schoolers it was like that anyway
so there you go there's your exciting
news
nerd news I mustn't nudes so there you
go yeah we're very exciting um and
that's our hashtag of the day to as
speaking of which is TD Spidey and we
want to know who you think should put on
tights next who should be the next
spider-man get creative with it don't
don't go mainstream find somebody really
like you know who I think my little
brother I don't know lil bruh I don't
have a little brother I think that miles
teller that's what I was actually what
is that really you were gonna say miles
teller her I'd like him or Ben Barnes
maybe yeah that would be a good choice
I'd like either well models tellers got
enough like cocky but like awkward and I
yeah just and he's kind of like not
beautiful but right but he's got like
that sort of fate like he's got that
endearing sort of face and personality
like I feel like I could really like him
as Peter Parker it's like I could really
like him that's where I'm saying so we
say miles tell her so I can't believe we
both agreed on miles LOL that we didn't
we did not plan that it's perfectly so
he's a perfectly sassy young man yes
perfectly sassy young man write that
down Sony and give him give his agents a
call uh Kayla can I tell you about the
robot hotels yeah I was waiting for that
okay so uh the hen nah hotel is ok where
do I even begin with this the huis ten
Bosch theme park has a hotel opening
this summer and that theme park is
netherlands themed but it's in japan so
it's in nagasaki prefecture and it's
like netherlands theme so you can get a
taste of the netherlands from Japan
anyway okay they're opening this hotel
called the hen na hotel on on the
property and it's going to have robot
staff members so here's some of the
rooms like we're seeing some of the
pictures here from inside the hotel but
the cool thing is is that you're going
to have yeah there they are gonna have
some robots some act toid right right up
front at the reception desk and they're
going to be able to help you out and and
this is we have some we have some
footage of these actual robots that are
act towards these are the ones and funny
these robots are made by the same sort
of umbrella company that also handles
sanrio so this is the company that's
like responsible for hello kitty uh but
so this is a unreal
like well looking at this act toy yeah
that's her she is slightly terrifying
but they're gonna have these at the
front desk like checking you in to the
hotel and then there's going to be
robots to take your luggage up to the
room like it's going to deliver your
luggage just put bag porters and then
there's also going to be a room room
cleaning you're gonna have a room
cleaning robot come in clean your room a
little bit like and then leave and then
oh the locks on the doors are gonna be
completely there's not going to be keys
it's all face recognition so you just
walk up to the door and it recognize
your face and then you go in your room
Kelly you're gonna stay there I want to
try it out but like in the middle of the
night if all of sudden Skynet takes over
working you are hos oh boy I don't know
I mean what's what's the goal they just
don't like people like if you don't like
people what's the deal well so the one
thing is is that obviously people in
Japan are a little bit more welcoming of
robot says like service right and humans
I know this is a really interesting sort
of little factoid so in Japan right now
they're having kind of a crisis of
population so this huge section of the
population is getting elderly so they're
retiring they're passing away like
they're just getting older and they're
not working they're leaving the
workforce but there's not enough people
being born in Japan to fill that those
gaps of the people who are working so
they're basically like robotics is this
there's this big push by obey who is
there like running the country he's
saying like we need have this robotics
revolution where we're filling these
holes where we need workers and we just
don't have them like so that's it that's
an actual thing that's happening in
Japan right now is that their their
their population is not keeping up with
the amount of people they need to like
have basic services I don't think that
really changes my question I thought the
way hey people don't know I think when
people go to a hotel it's the luxury of
having people like wait on you and like
genuinely want to make your experience
good but with a robot it's cold it's
it's all formulaic in their program to
do it and it's not really genuine per se
yeah that's true me you don't you
definitely don't get the human touch
like when you're you know talking to it
doesn't sound like someone's taking care
of you just feels like this this robotic
entities taking care of you
doesn't seem I think they're still going
to be people in the hotel like they said
they want to have it's only they're only
gonna have like 10 robots on staff when
they launched but they want to hit
ninety percent robot staff by like a
certain period of time like in the
future but I would imagine like
sorceress I mean all that other stuff
that you can't have a robot do like give
you a massage or whatever it's only a
matter of time um but yeah I have a
feeling that it's a little bit of both
so they're gonna try to kind of keep
those personal touches where they feel
they're necessary but not necessarily
out like a front desk like a human reply
would be like a like a grumpy old
repairman andrew luck's gonna fix the
robot feeding people too much food
I don't know what do you want to know
how much it costs to stay there night
you want to guess so it's in yen it's
yeah let's say yeah I it opens its like
they're 70 times in normal I do okay
I'll let saw four hundred a night it's
really high I'm hi you yes and what is
it it's just under sixty dollars a night
what yeah they keep costs down I don't
have to pay it people yeah but they have
to build robots and make him look like
humans and then repair robot they don't
have to pay them up in the oil and
electricity and oil give them a little
like giving a little computer chips is
like snacks in dollars and where's this
again because I want to do it nagasaki
prefecture and it's at the it's called
the hen hen na hotel h en n na hotel I
want to stay there anime eyes open now
july they're gonna open in july alright
guys we're gonna go set up our
reservations for the head na hotel

delightful and we'll be right back after
