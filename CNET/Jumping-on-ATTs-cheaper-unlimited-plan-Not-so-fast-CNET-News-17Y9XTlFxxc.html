data plan carriers keep firing off new
prices and offerings every other week it
could be hard to keep track of which has
the better deal but relax we'll keep it
simple for you here's the breakdown of
the current unlimited plans for the
major US carriers on Verizon $80 gets
you one unlimited plan for one line and
you can get this on four lines for a
hundred and eighty dollars
t-mobile's unlimited plan starts at $70
and for lion's cost one hundred and
sixty dollars Sprint's unlimited starts
at just fifty dollars and five lines not
for is only $90 in total that's
obviously the cheapest but this is only
a promotional price after March or 2018
the plan starts at $60 still very cheap
18t is a little more confusing than the
others it has two different types of
unlimited plans the unlimited Plus plan
is the most expensive of the bunch it
starts at around $90 for one line and
four lines will be 185 dollars but to
entice you to also subscribe to a
television service this plan will knock
25 bucks off your Direct TV or u-verse
TV built now AT&amp;amp;T also offers a second
much cheaper plan called the unlimited
choice
it starts at $60 for one line and it's
cheaper because you're getting less than
every other plan out there your speed
will not be the fastest 4G can offer
it's limited to just three megabits per
second max you also will not be
streaming video in high-definition
everything is 480p tops and you cannot
use the phone as a mobile hotspot now
all the other plans include 10 gigs of
data to share as a hotspot and you get
HD quality video so you have to consider
if missing those things as worth the
savings when Sprint's gonna cost the
same and does
those limitations now when you're
comparing prices remember there will be
additional fees and taxes added to your
bill
except for t-mobile they fold that into
their advertised prices of course you
also have to take network quality into
consideration Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T are the
largest but depending on where you live
it doesn't always mean they are the best
t-mobile is ranking high in many reports
these days and keep in mind Unlimited
never really means unlimited the fact is
if you gobble up data all of these
networks are gonna slow you down for
example on Verizon if you use 22
gigabytes of data your speed is gonna
take a hit and other customers will be
given preference over you if the network
is congested throttling limits are about
the same for every carrier but t-mobile
offers the most leeway and waits until
you hit 28 gigs before it slows you down
as competition heats up let's hope the
deals get even better networks are
growing to handle more capacity and
consumers are hungry for better
unlimited deals as are apps these
streaming habits demand more data
