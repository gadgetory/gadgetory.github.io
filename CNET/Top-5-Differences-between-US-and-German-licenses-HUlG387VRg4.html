they're in awe of the Autobahn when
Germans come to America they're in awe
too and although we haven't killed each
other with our lousy driving i'm brian
coolie with the top 5 reasons there's
such a difference the top 5 differences
between us and german driver's licenses
number 5 there's a first-aid course see
we're not talking about the US we're
being prepared means knowing how to
punch the numbers 9-1-1 you need to pass
a real first aid course in germany eight
hours of it that's like getting an MD in
Somalia part of the course also teaches
you how to secure the accident scene in
America we just call OnStar and start
crying number 4 you learn theory us
driver training isn't training so much
as muscle memory German training gets
into the essence of driving there are at
least 14 and possibly 20 or more hours
of this theory training to get ready for
a theoretical exam and that consists of
30 multiple-choice questions but unlike
here in the US there can be multiple
correct answers for each one you need to
nail them number three you really learn
driving you'll need a minimum of 12 90
minute on the road training sessions
four of which have to be on the Autobahn
and at speed and about three of those
have to be at night by the way if you
take your training in an automatic
transmission you'll only be licensed to
drive that driving a manual with that
same license is considered driving
without a license if your instructor
detects that you suck you could be in
for up to twenty or even thirty of those
training sessions in the US that would
qualify you to fly for Southwest number
two it takes time and money three to six
months is what you need to a lot to get
your first driver's license in Germany
and that's not time just waiting to turn
a certain age it's real work unlike the
US you don't learn to drive by having
your parents take you out to a parking
lot for a couple of hours you go to a
far Shula and it can easily cost you
something in the region of two thousand
euros this is real school the number one
reason a german license means a little
more than one in the US is that a test
is a test three wrong answers on
the German test and you failed that's
nearly twice as stringent as here in
California fail three times and you have
to go back to that school viewer as Kay
wrote in and told me when my parents
lived in Germany they said if you failed
the driver written exam three times they
sent you for a psych evaluation to see
what's wrong with you and questions like
what is the maximum speed you're allowed
to drive a truck with a permissible
total mass of three tons on a road with
one marked lane for each direction
outside built-up areas will make you
seriously consider getting a bus pass
instead you also have to open the hood
during your driver's test and identify
for the instructor the major visible
components where you would check the oil
how would you top up the coolant in
America you could weld most people's
hoods shut then wait a year or two and
see if they've noticed high-tech cars
and modern driving that's all we do at
CNET on cars.com i'm brian coulis thanks
for watching
