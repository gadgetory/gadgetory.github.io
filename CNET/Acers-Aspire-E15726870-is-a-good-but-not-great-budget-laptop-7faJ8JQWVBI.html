is what happens when you mix old and new
components in a laptop the Acer Aspire
II one 572 6874 around four hundred and
fifty dollars it's the least expensive
15-inch Windows 8 laptop we've seen with
a fourth generation Core i5 processor
and Intel HD 4400 integrated graphics
those respects we've seen in several
higher-end ultra books we've tested but
the rest of the e1 is pretty low-end the
shell is plastic and has considerable
flex outside it inside the glossy 15.6
inch LCD doesn't get all that bright and
has a 1366 by 768 resolution and isn't a
touchscreen the touchpad is okay but
it's buttons are only clickable on the
ends and similarly its speakers are good
but fired downwards so whatever surface
you're on lap or desk the sound is
muffled there's no optical drive even
though there's a spot for one and
despite the new power-saving processor
its battery life taps out between three
to four hours now that stuff is pretty
minor and not unexpected given its price
and there are some positives here that
plastic body saves some weight it's less
than five pounds which is light
considering its size unlike an ultrabook
the battery is removable and getting
inside to add more to its four gigs of
memory or swap out it's slow spinning
500 gig hard drive for an SSD only
requires a screwdriver the keyboard
though not backlit is big and
comfortable and has good key travel and
it even boots quickly so while it might
not have the long battery life we've
come to expect from as well laptop or
impressive performance it's a solid
budget-friendly laptop I'm Josh Goldman
and that's the Acer Aspire e1
