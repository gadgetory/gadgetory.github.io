little bit of metal and a little
synthetic rubber you can buy a whole box
of them for a few dollars this pencil on
the other hand costs $99 and I have no
idea what's inside it let's find out I'm
bill Detweiler and this is cracking open
released alongside the iPad pro the
Apple pencil lets you draw take notes
mark up documents annotate photos and do
basically anything you can do with a
traditional pencil it's also an
excellent precision input device for the
iPad pro and it makes it easy to select
small menu items or to make fine
adjustments to app controls the pencil
connects to the iPad pro via bluetooth
and charges via a lightning connector
it's hidden under a magnetic cap now
according to Apple a full charge will
last about 12 hours now thanks to a
series of internal sensors the pencil
can detect how hard the tip is pressed
against the tablet and the tips angle as
you move it across the screen this
allows you to make light lines make
thick lines and to shade the areas
you're working with now included with
the pencil is a spare tip as well as a
lightning to lightning adapter that lets
you charge the pencil with a regular
iPad or iPhone charger with all the
specs out of the way let's get cracking
before cracking open our Apple pencil
the first thing we're going to do is
remove the magnetic cap that covers the
lightning connector and then we're going
to unscrew the tip now at first we tried
to use a heat gun to remove the interior
components by loosening the adhesive and
then pulling them out the back of the
pen when that didn't work we moved on to
a rotary cutting tool to actually cut
through the plastic and expose the
interior components
all right so finally once we're through
cutting the plastic shell we can try and
remove it here and if we lift it off
very gently and pry it off there's still
adhesive in here you can hear it kind of
separate boom there we go and we can
lift that off and we can actually see
the metal cylinder that's inside the
plastic cylinder
so after cutting and a little bit of
prying we were able to remove both the
plastic shell and the inner metal shell
and expose the internal components of
the Apple pencil we have these sensors
associated with the tip these will be
the pressure and the angle sensors and
we also have the main circuit board here
the battery up here and then the
Bluetooth probably antenna and then the
lightning connector here on the end so
what did we learn from cracking open the
Apple pencil
well for starters this thing is not
meant to be taken apart which is a real
shame because other styluses like the
pencil from 53 can be disassembled and
that brings me to my second observation
if the pencil wasn't designed to be
repaired why you screws inside the thing
six of them maybe Apple just loves
screws as for the brains of the pencil
there's a 32-bit risc ARM based cortex
m3 MCU from ST micro a Bluetooth chip
from Cambridge silicon radio which is
now part of Qualcomm and at least five
other chips with unknown markings now
powering all this is a tiny three point
eight two volt 0.329 watt hour battery
now there's also an antenna and the
pressure and angle sensors near the tip
despite being one of the more
destructive tear downs I've done lately
it was also a lot of fun now for more
information on the iPad pro and the
Apple pencil including real world tests
