Maybach s600 in 10 seconds it's an 8
inch longer fully loaded s-class 600 and
the 8 inches longer gives you a whole
bunch more room in the back that's where
the focus is on the extra length notably
it doesn't pick up a whole lot of extra
weight it only weighs about 230 pounds
more than the short s-class otherwise
the sheet metal on an s-class versus a
Maybach is so similar you should look
for the badges the one here on the sale
panel and the one on the rump you won't
find those on any other Mercedes now
getting into a Maybach s600 is not
shockingly different than an s-class
room first thing your eyes were drawn to
are the dual 12-point three inch
widescreen LCD I don't think I've got
that much LCD real estate in my TV room
the one on the left of course are your
virtual gauges which occasionally move
out of the way to allow night vision to
take over the centre this big screen
we've seen before it's the command
system that has navigation that is well
rendered but doesn't strike any new
ground beyond all the in-car broadcast
satellite and external media sources
you've also got the ability to have
tuned in as a streaming radio choice and
an in-car hotspot but that's part of a
telematics subscription at 450 a year
now all of this is driven by two
controllers no touch
German remember I must say you might
think this trackpad is gilding the lily
with a control knob right near it but
this does wonders that touchpad is also
good for handwriting and pinch and zoom
on the map it's right about now diving
into all the menus you can access with
these controls that you realize there's
too damn much going on in this car if
you are working hard enough to afford
this you don't have time to be playing
with your car's menus you're making
money
chief example go to the HVAC ribbon of
buttons here and just press the one that
says menu then spend the next afternoon
or so figuring out all the ways you can
set up the climate in this car from the
temperature to the air distribution to
the air flow you can blow hard softer
moderate 2-foot well airflow climate
mode the air freshener which is separate
from the ionizer really and similar
layers and layers and layers of
possibility occur on almost every system
in the infotainment head unit you don't
need a loan to buy this or you need a
degree in engineering and you know
you're not an Alexis in this car
completely different design language of
course but the seats are hard Alexis
always has plush seats this one does not
now let's talk about some visual tech
going on in this car I told you about
the night vision that we had in between
the main gauges we've also got the best
360 bird's-eye view camera in the
business look how beautifully it
stitches the four cameras together it
doesn't even appear to be four angles
that's pretty slick and we've got the
magic sky control sunroof front and rear
hit this little button right by the
sunroof control and it goes from dark
blue to nearly clear electronically they
apply high voltage to a crystalline
structure inside the glass panel to have
it either reflect or pass light I bet
your Hyundai doesn't have that and my
last visual trick to show you is this
one you find that little icon looks like
a book and now you've enabled split view
on the passenger side right now I'm
seeing media from the driver's side
right now you might be seeing the
navigation same screen same time but at
this 45-degree angle it feeds two
different displays that's pretty hot the
audio in this car is off the charts and
that's bass fifteen hundred and forty
watts twenty four speakers from Burma
stir it was even a ceiling speaker in
the rear and a separate sub in the trunk
that gets its own 400 watt feed the
tweeters even rotate I'm not sure why
and this is low tech but really cool the
hinge on the console changes depending
on where you open it
I couldn't get enough of this I played
with it all day now driving the my box
not much different than any other
s-class you've got this sort of
old-school electronic column shifter
here paddles on the wheel by the way
over here in the center console you've
got a sport or economy mode for the
powertrain and below that is a BC not a
spelling lesson that's automatic body
control that's the active suspension
either sport or comfort the adaptive
suspension on this car is not just
mechanically based it uses a camera to
look at the road and to know when
there's a big bump or divot coming and
pre adjust the suspension not wait for
the impact to happen this drives me nuts
though about the rear compartment and
the front for that matter you don't have
infinite door checks you got old-school
three position notched hinges this thing
is gonna cut your shin off and did it to
me several times that since you have to
work 18 hours a day to afford one of
these they give you some nice tables to
do your work upon and what's interesting
about these compared to some other cars
of this luxury category is that these
are pretty darn good this is like what
you get in the airplane aluminized and
they come to the right place
dual tablet-like screen these are not
iPads these are Mercedes proprietary
screens that can be playing either
plugged in media DVD or get you access
to almost anything at the front or let
you bring up media that gets sent to the
front for Master System distribution let
me tell you is it better than my office
cupholders are so passe instead you want
a heated and cooled cup holder just
press the button for which you want the
little lightning side changes
accordingly as well people are nuts
and of course in the car like this you
got to offer the coup de Gras of luxury
silliness the bottle cooler the fridge
right here behind your elbow holds a
couple of what it looks like to be
full-size bottles of champagne though
I'm sure they don't officially endorse
that problem is look how much room in
the trunk it takes up there's barely
enough room for the owners ego in there
anymore the Maybach s 600 shares an
engine with a standard s 600 luckily
it's a lot of engine a six-litre
twin-turbo v12 doing 523 horsepower and
612 pound-feet of torque rear wheel
drive only through a 7-speed automatic
zero to sixty and five seconds is only a
half a second slower than a short
s-class and the weight at 50 to 69 is
only 28 more pounds per inch of added
length 13 20 mpg escapes single digits
but not by enough to escape a gas
guzzler tax first thing I noticed in
terms of its driving behavior though is
if you have it in this economy mode and
if you have auto start/stop enabled this
may be the most raggedly driving
experience on the road part of that is
to make it a more comfortable less
transitional ride between stop and go
when you put it in sport mode though and
trounce it grief how can something this
big go that fast is what you think we do
have a head-up display on this car which
is nothing necessarily new for Mercedes
but I will say they need to go take some
lessons from BMW that's not real
satisfying the overall smoothness is
incredible as you'd expect partly
because we've got over 5,000 pounds to
dampen out row and undulation in all the
power that is available varied as it may
be the heaviness the adaptive ride
control and of course who knows how many
hundreds or thousands of sound deadening
and insulation add up to a sublime
driving experience
okay base if you can call it that a
Maybach s 600 is about a hundred and
ninety-three thousand dollar proposition
but of course we got to go CNET style
we're gonna add a few grand to that in
the following fashion those rear tables
and heated and cooled cup holder got to
have those for two grand the fridge is
1,100
skip that all day long and get some
trunk space split view I love it 700
bucks magic sky control is a pricey
overhead toy 5000 but boy is that slick
and of course the gas guzzler tax that's
1,700 bucks you could have spent in a
lot better ways all in about two hundred
and three grand the way we would do it
now if you're going to buy a car like
this you sure don't need my opinion
whether you need it or not it's not a
need product but it's a whole lot less
ostentatious and over-the-top than the
old maybach 57 s and 62 s it utterly
separates driving from the chore driving
or cars driven C next style standing by
