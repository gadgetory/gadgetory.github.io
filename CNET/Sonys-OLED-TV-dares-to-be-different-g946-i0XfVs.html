TV think again this ultra expensive OLED
TV from Sony is one-of-a-kind it has
unique stunning style thanks to this
giant kickstand its speakers are
actually part of the TV screen itself
and best of all they look some of the
best picture quality of any TV we've
ever tested let's take a closer look the
first thing you notice from the front is
that it doesn't appear to be any stand
at all the bottom edge of the TV rests
directly on the table or other furniture
for a look that's basically all picture
from the side you can see it leans back
slightly supported by this big kickstand
which have a heavy weight at the bottom
so it doesn't tip forward the panel
itself is ultra thin typical of OLED so
all the connections the power supply and
even a subwoofer housing the kickstand
can hide behind this panel for a clean
look a locking hinge lets you fold the
kickstand flat for wall mounting in a
first for any TV we tested the rest the
sound actually comes through the TV
screen itself the little actuators
behind the TV actually vibrate the LCD
screen to deliver dialogue and most of
the other noises we hear in our
listening test that Sony sounded better
than a traditional flat panel TV but
still couldn't compete with inexpensive
sound bars the sound might be no big
deal but the picture on the sony is
phenomenal it uses the same OLED panels
as LG and in our side-by-side comparison
it ran neck and neck with that company's
27 OLED TVs black panels are perfect and
combined with bright highlights to
deliver unbelievable contrast handily
beating the LCD TVs we compared it to
differences between the Sony and LG OLED
were minor however and overall picture
quality was essentially a tie the main
reason to pay extra for the Sony would
be to get its unique styling or if you
really like its Android TV powered
operating system that's a quick look at
the sony xba-1 e OLED TV I'm David Katz
