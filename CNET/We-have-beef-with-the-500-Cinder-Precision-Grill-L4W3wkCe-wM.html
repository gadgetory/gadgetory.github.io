grill make a lofty claim that this 500
dollar countertop grill can cook food
with the same accuracy as sous-vide
cooking a method in which you cook your
food in a water bath
thus endeth ditches the pot of water for
two removable plates that you can heat
to the exact temperature that you want
for your food whether it's a medium-rare
steak or a juicy chicken breast here's
how it works you use the app or the knob
on the sender to set the temperature at
what you want to cook you put your food
on the grill and close the lid the
sender measures the thickness of your
food to figure out how long it will take
to cook it if you use the app to set the
temperature you'll receive a
notification on your phone when the
food's right then you can turn up the
temperature to sear your food for the
most part the center did a good job at
bringing foods to the temperature I
wanted it to during cook tests but there
were too many little problems for a
machine that costs five hundred dollars
first the bottom tray isn't tilted
enough for grease to spill into the
built-in drip tray and since the sender
calibrates the time to cook based on the
thickness of your food you only get an
estimate of when your food will be ready
which makes it hard to plan for your
meal and while you can make a mean
panini in the center the lids just too
heavy for a humble grilled cheese
sandwich now the center grill is
supposed to replace sous vide cooking
but at $500 it's an expensive
replacement especially when you consider
the other systems that are out there
that do the same for a lot cheaper like
this Paragon induction cooktop from
first build or an immersion circulator
like this one from Innova again you can
end it all in a casserole
even though the sender can cook great
food it's not worth a $500 investment
stick with sous-vide devices that have
similar results for a much friendlier
price</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
