weighs about Oh 3500 pounds it's not
entirely unlikely as more and more
technology companies are deciding the
inside of a car can be a wellness
monitoring tool for SIA here is a good
example they call this their active
wellness seat technology I am right now
sitting on a sensor it looks like a seat
but in the bottom cushion is a sensor
you can call it a butt sensor because
it's using my rump to figure out my
heart rate and my respiration and then
the tricky part is doing a very
complicated signal-to-noise process to
take out all the vehicles vibration and
thumping it all gets reported up
somewhere in the dash like on this
mock-up there's my heart rate there's my
respiration rate right there below that
they're able to use another algorithm to
figure out if I'm stressed right now or
if I'm sleeping in the metals fine but
either those extremes it can then do
some kind of seat therapy on me a
combination of massage heat and cooling
could be used to wake me up if it's a
really vigorous massage with cooling or
calm me down maybe if it's a more calm
massage some other factors that you can
deal with once you have this data
captured you can send that off to a
medical professional you can also MUX
that data together with what's coming
off your Fitbit for example to get more
accurate data overall interesting
wrinkle on crash detection what if one a
collision is detected they don't just
send the severity of the crash on the
location but they can also send my heart
rate and respiration to emergency
responders they know a little bit more
but what they're going to get into when
they arrive here then if they don't have
that data and then from this of course
automakers can decide to extend that
more they can tap into a sensing seat
like this to do their own sort of
response systems for different moods
also make it part of a holistic almost
intuitive sport mode or comfort mode for
the overall drivetrain depending on what
mood you bring to the car that would be
on the OEMs plate to do that by the way
the medical grade sensor is behind this
technology are already in use in
hospital beds to measure certain patient
per
jaguar cease using them as part of a
platform called mind sense in addition
to reading brainwaves it also envisions
a biometric seat to read heart rate and
respiration rate particularly to better
know how to alert the driver of a future
autonomous Jaguar when they need to take
control again the advanced institute of
industrial technology in tokyo was
several years ago working on a seat tech
that reads the contours of your rump to
identify you basically a butt print to
get access to the car and a few years
ago Ferrari applied for a patent on seat
technology that would go beyond
measuring heart and respiration by
adding brainwaves measured by a headrest
sensors in the aim of better tailoring
the cars drive mode to the drivers
mental hook clearly the day is coming
when car seats will do a lot more than
just keep you off the floor more car
