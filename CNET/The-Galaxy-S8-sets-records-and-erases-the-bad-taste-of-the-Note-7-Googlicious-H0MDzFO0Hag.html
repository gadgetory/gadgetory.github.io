welcome to Google issues for all the
Google you could think of the s8 is
officially on sale and we have stories
around that but let's start off with
some Google News first all right the
next generation of Google's jumped
camera rig for 3d 360-degree video is
here and it's called halo it's a
partnership between Google and the
Xiaomi back brand Yi the halo features
17 4k cameras weighing 8 pounds with 100
minutes of battery life now there are 16
cameras on the rig and one facing upward
to fully capture a scene and an Android
app acts as the remote control and
includes a live preview now Google
introduced its first jump rig with the
help of GoPro cameras back in 2015 the
Yi halo will go on sale this summer
there's also a jump start program to get
free access to the rig from 100 creators
with an application process that closes
May 22nd now VR content is still
evolving and content is always king with
any new platform but Google Play is
celebrating content of their own with
their 2017 nominees for the Google Play
award categories range from best
standout in the best VR experience to
standard stuff like your best app and
best game for something more meaningful
like best social impact and no snapchat
is not one of the nominees now the
winners will be announced at Google i/o
which happens on may 17 to 19th this
year ok this is Google related kind of
ok not really but this is just plain
awesome a new startup named Kitty Hawk
is showing off its first flying car and
the word car is a very liberal
description alphabet CEO Larry Page is
one of the company's Vegas backers
it's really more like a hovercraft
that's a recreational toy but the Kitty
Hawk flyer has already been approved
under the ultralight category for FAA
regulations and can be used in areas
that are considered uncongested like an
open lake now you don't even need a
pilot's license and they say you can
learn to fly it in minutes
I want this wee Kitty Hawk says you can
pitch in 100 dollars to get a 2000
dollar discount when it comes out before
the end of the year but no actual
price has been announced yet okay we
talked about how the Galaxy s8
pre-orders were looking good in Korea
and now Samsung US has said that
pre-orders for the s8 and si plus have
topped the s7 by 30% that's a huge
turnaround since the note 7 disaster and
they deserve the credit for the Tehran
with you know what a pretty kick-ass
phone but it's still not without its
blemishes Samsung went all-in for Bixby
their virtual assistant even dedicating
a specific button just for it now you
already know about its delayed release
here in the US but CNET has found one of
its other features Bixby vision which
can identify products with its camera
and send you to Amazon to purchase them
has been delayed on Verizon phones it's
not even operational right now
so no Bixby voice and no Bixby vision
and a physical button on the side that
was unnecessary to really just activate
it now it's still a great phone really
the best phone of the year so far but
they double down hard on Bixby it's not
even close to being ready for primetime
yet and for those of you who are dealing
with the red tinted screen issue on the
s8 and s8 plus a fix for that screen is
coming with a software update that is
expected to roll out next week the
galaxy s 8 line also made an interesting
move and maybe it's something to come in
the future we know how much they're
married to their TouchWiz interface and
it's the cleanest it's been this time
around but the default music player on
the s8 is the Google Play Music app and
it has shown that maybe Samsung could
change its tune and rely more on pure
Android based apps from Google maybe
and the last s8 story of the week if a
new phone is finally available for sale
then rumors for the next one have to be
out by now right according to the Oz new
business daily Qualcomm's next gen
chipset will likely be called the
snapdragon 845 and they are currently
already working on the chip that will
make its debut in the samsung galaxy s 9
the chip name may change but it will
potentially include enhancements for VR
and AR support and that's a story we
could have all made up on our own that's
still most likely true all right that's
going to do it for this week you can
email me at Google issues at cnet.com or
tweet me at brian Tong they so much for
watching we'll catch y'all next time for
some more of
two voyages give licious</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
