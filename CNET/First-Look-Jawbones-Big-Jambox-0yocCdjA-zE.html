cnet.com and I'm here with the new job
owned big Jambox that's right jaw bone
kept it simple and simply called it the
big Jambox it's about three times the
size of the original jam box which is a
Bluetooth speaker this is also a
Bluetooth speaker it's obviously not as
portable as the original jam box but
this one is designed to be portable and
offer better sound it does definitely
offer bigger richer and better sound a
bigger bass more detailed obviously when
you go to a bigger speaker size you can
get better sound this one does not come
with any sort of carrying case or
anything like that it does come with an
AC adapter for charging you do need to
use that AC adapter the smaller model
can be charged via USB this one also has
a USB connection but that is simply for
firmware updates this one charges at
about two and a half hours to get a full
charge and it goes for up to 12 hours on
a single charge
the big jambox weighs in at 2.7 pounds
but jawbone did want to be able to carry
it with one hand it comes in this
graphite color here as well as a white
version and a red version like the
original jam box this is a feature
called live audio you enable it by
pressing the volume up and down buttons
together and that feature is enabled and
it basically widens the soundstage it's
a bit of digital trickery that makes the
speaker sound a little bit more
3-dimensional and have that wider
soundstage you can use your smartphone
or tablet as a remote when you're using
this with Bluetooth to stream audio or
your movies there are also some buttons
on top that allow you to skip tracks
forward and back and new to this model
is a dedicated pairing button you press
that button to set the speaker into
pairing mode that's really all there is
to it except for the price point this
one is rather expensive at $299 that
puts it right up there with the Bose
Soundlink Wireless another very good
performing portable Bluetooth speaker
well I can't say it's a bargain at that
price point I can certainly say that it
is a very well-designed speaker that
also sounds very good for its size and
this is a premium Bluetooth portable
speaker so if you're looking for
something like that this certainly fits
the bill I'm David Carr noise and that's
the jawbone big Jambox bluetooth speaker</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
