buy a smart speaker Apple just
introduced the world to its home pod a
speaker that focuses on music first
along with Siri
it's up against Amazon and Google but
here's the thing there are plenty of
reasons to stay away from smart speakers
in general let's get to it
and number five you're paranoid yeah you
a lot of people get hurt when they find
out a device is constantly listening to
them sure the speaker only starts
talking to you when you use the
activation word but it's microphones are
on unless you mute them but speaker with
ears scares you avoid smart speakers and
number four the money the Amazon echo
dot is a very low cost
smart speaker at fifty dollars however
it can easily become a gateway to
spending a bunch of money on other smart
devices just of your smart speaker seems
more useful hmm be nice to control my TV
with an echo maybe I need to get a
Harmony remote oh maybe I need a bunch
of smart balls while I'm at it what
about some smart outlets I should get
some of those too and number three it's
still awkward
do you like yelling at tech because
you'll be yelling at your smart speaker
I'm not saying the home or echo have
problems hearing in my experience the
problem comes in the understanding part
getting wrong answers from a smart
speaker is less than ideal and before
you know it you're yelling at your
speaker to stop giving you useless
responses and number two you've got
Bluetooth speakers there's your favorite
music service work on that piece of
hardware who cares if you just have a
regular Bluetooth speaker if whatever
service you like runs on your computer
tablet or phone you can just send that
audio over without much difficulty
Bluetooth is standard and good Bluetooth
speakers are pretty cheap these days and
the number one you've got a phone if
you've got a bunch of smart home tech in
your home odds are you can control your
whole house using apps on your phone now
the question becomes do you have a smart
phone of course you do interacting with
your phone it's relatively simple and it
usually works as you think it would want
to ask about sports scores or get other
information fire up a browser or search
on your phone and the crazy thing is
you'll probably get all the information
you need
what's that you don't care you still
want a smart speaker check out our
