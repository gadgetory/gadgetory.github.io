of CES and I have two of my most
favorite people here because they run
the companies that make the 3d printers
as you might know the two 3d printer
companies 3d systems and MakerBot we're
finalists in our best of CES Awards
MakerBot actually won the emerging tech
congratulations thank you very much Bree
Pettis here very funny repented here is
the CEO of MakerBot and Thingiverse yep
Cathy Lowe's here is at three 3d systems
and I gotta both hear and we're gonna
talk about this incredible technology
which is just so cool so first of all I
want to ask you guys how do these things
work I mean we're both of them but we're
having a print off right now I don't
know what they're making actually I do
you're making Bri is making a cupcake or
supposed to be surprised a red velvet
cupcake with icing on it I am so hungry
good and Cathy here from 3d systems is
making one of these yes look at this
look how cool this is and you're wearing
did you make that there we didn't make
it on this machine okay we have a whole
series of units that can produce in the
cloud yeah anything you want anytime you
want
now what's cool about this is that this
is like mail train yeah that's exactly
this plastic mail and all these pieces
are interconnected I don't know how else
you what makes us aside from well
hammering links together like if you
were in the medieval times right that's
very cool
all right how do these things work
where's the magic pull the magic
yeah so what we've got here is a machine
that can make you almost anything and it
starts with the raw feedstock we've got
it back here you can see it it's ABS
plastic this is the same thing Lego is
made out of you can all see you as PLA
which is made from corn which is pretty
cool
then it goes through these tubes to the
extruder and it prints it out it draws a
picture in molten plastic and lifts up a
little bit and draws another picture and
then layer by layer your object emerges
and BAM so I've got something where
there was nothing
four and we made it he who brought this
in this is by though of course negative
demerit everybody anybody who doesn't
recognize this from portal how long does
it take to make something like this this
companion cube this is a full-day print
this is like a 10 or 11-hour print off
so you can't it's not like printing out
a resume you get it wrong you go do it
again well actually that's exactly what
it's like the beauty of having your own
3d printer and is if you if you make it
you're like you know I need a bigger you
just print it again and then you just
there you go you're all set to go okay
and Kathy here from 3d systems your
system looks a little slicker I say you
know that's got the the the laser cut
balsa frame this is all plastic what is
this one how does this way this one
works pretty much the same way at any
special differences here effectively
they all work the same way
3d printing is about laying down your
object whatever it happens to be layer
by layer by layer and what we've done
simply is say we want to bring a
different kind of experience for the
consumer market where they don't have to
be technical they don't have to build it
it's all about sort of a mash-up of
iTunes and Facebook where you socialize
you trade ideas and designs and then you
simply download and print it on your own
3d printer or you ask us to print it for
you in the cloud and we can print
anything you can design anything you can
imagine
because we think the consumer experience
needs to be coloring books simple so
what are people going to be printing
with these things I mean so far I see
some pretty unusual products but Bri is
pointing to a radio to a car yeah which
is four colors plus has a motor and
electronics so that's not completely
printable but talked to me about that
car there what's up with it so this is a
MakerBot project what you do is you
order this and you get the Wii of the
tires which are rubber and the batteries
and servo and they like
seanix and a motor and everything else
you print so the body the whole steering
section the wheels the tires even the
gears are printed and you put it
together and you get a it comes with one
of those a remote control controller and
bam you've got a remote-control car that
you made yourself hmm now why not just
go to RadioShack and buy one for 25
bucks because you can make this yourself
and you think you can actually customize
this if you don't like the buggy you can
make a V dubbing okay you don't like a V
dot van you could make a tank and how do
you design these things I mean I suppose
with that or with with any of these
things if you want to do them you get
the plans the files and and how do you
modify or create those files yourself so
one of the things we're obsessed with
we're an open-source machine you can
download all the designs for this the
schematics all that kind of stuff we
share everything and we have a site
called Thingiverse where we share all
the designs for free and the cool thing
about that this project is you can just
download this and it's under an open
license so you can modify it change it
and make it yours the the and that's
just really cool like though it means
that if you see a doorknob you like on
Thingiverse you can change it add your
initials to it we upload it and it
automatically attributes it to the
original user see one of the things
we've done on Cuba sicom is create an
environment where it's coloring book
simplicity total ease of use the
customer the consumer just goes online
if they see something they like they
don't have to particularly put it
together they could simply download the
file and start printing or they can
upload their rockband character and ask
us to print it in full-color we'll print
it and send it to them over the cloud so
we think the consumer really wants
something very straightforward and easy
to use they're not going to actually
want to build something or design
something all the time they're gonna
want to have access to great content so
our content idea is to invite all the
apps developers
to provide applications to make
capturing content very very simple very
easy you can customize and personalize
based on the apps we have already 6000
artists that are going to come online
and share their creations then all you
have to do is download the creation and
make it yours so I have this idea for my
my plan B is is a piece of hardware so
I'm not going to tell anybody what it is
because it's so stupidly simple that it
could be stolen but I need to prototype
it yeah so if I prototype on one of
these things then what then I want to
say I want to print 5000 of them or
create 5000 and then they do I just take
the exact same plans and send it some
factory in China and they make it on a
brass or or what you can it really
depends on how many you're gonna run we
have systems that will actually create
the mold for you to go into tooling you
can actually use one of our services to
create up to five thousand there's sort
of a break-even when you get into a
certain number you're gonna want to go
to real tooling and do the long runs
but somewhere less than five thousand or
in that vicinity you can actually afford
a 3d print them yeah I mean our material
is this much this is a kilogram 2.2
pounds it was 50 but this is actually
like 42 pound $42 2.2 pounds $42 it's
cheap this is heavy like you can make a
lot of things with that and but it's
slow I mean if I wanted to make a 5,000
widgets and it would take me a while
with a big platform like this you might
be able to pin 10 or 12 off at a time
oh okay okay and I just break them apart
yeah okay let's see now I you know I'm
poor enough with design as it is that's
why we have artists over it seen it
could I learn how to do my own 3d
designs or and what program do I need to
learn or and are there opportunities for
better apps
you know we believe that the average
Zoomer isn't gonna want to learn cat
there are a number of affordable cab
packages and we happen to own one of
them but our idea is to give you
coloring book simplicity make sure that
you're able to just go and mash up your
own design based on what's already there
if you do want to create that's another
opportunity you can actually upload your
design and merchandise it online and
we'll help you sell it to others and
provide you revenue so you can earn
money actually by creating so we don't
really care about crayon simplicity we
want to teach you how to we want to get
you started at the easy level you can
use Google Sketchup which is free and
easy to use and then you'll get hooked
and the next thing you know you're going
to be building the next bridge or the
next solution to the global challenge
what you're seeing here is two different
approach it looks like it one for the
technic Pratt which is a lot I disagree
with that actually no I disagree with
that too we need this everyone it comes
it out comes off together you put it you
get it and take it out the box you can
make awesome things for cheap I disagree
that's what he needs to do we can help
you with that but I will tell you where
we're going with this it's customization
and personalization and self-expression
if you can help someone unleash their
creativity imagine how many advocates
we're gonna find that can create new
content and really revolutionize the way
we create product in this country in
this world and have fun doing it there's
nothing like it
right realistically though I mean there
are there's two different attitudes
during idea which I think it's kind of
cool I mean that one cause if my
grandmother was into 3d printing that
you know for you know what
look you know obviously a little bit it
looks a little bit rougher even though
they do pretty much the same thing all
that one does to colors which is cool by
the way you get to three colors in any
color you know it's funny we got here
and with two colors yeah yeah big big
upgrade big challenge we've got it
running in two colors first thing people
ask us is what can I add more colors the
cool things about what we do is we make
it modular so if you're if you are a
tinkerer we made it so that anybody can
use it and so it's really simple it's
really friendly but if you are tinkerer
you can just add on another two
extruders and see if you can make it
work and then license it back to you
yeah is about thirty nine hundred
dollars fully assembled and ready to
print out of the box okay so this
product one of the advantages of this
one of course is that it is a few
hundred dollars less than that one
that's true but your than that one how
much is that this is gonna retail for
$12.99
okay so $12.99 for a product that most
people don't think they it's really fun
but do you need it that product that is
what the this MakerBot is starts to 1749
okay what the point is when are these
products going to be in the more I'm
gonna buy one for my kid for Christmas
stage which will be maybe 300 bucks
something that or less how long how long
do we get down to that level well you
know the barrier and I think we would
agree with this it's not the technology
price it's how you're going to use it
it's the content it's making know it's
the technology price because when I'm
looking at a Christmas present I twelve
hundred dollars is outside of my budget
so how long until this is inside the
realistic parent budget you know we're
going to we have the
there's no technology barrier but we
believe as a company and as someone
who's been in the industry for 25 years
that you have to match up content
creativity ease-of-use
and an experience that the consumer
likes to go with the product that
they're going to use in their home and
oh by the way provide them with an
ability to print without having a
printer because remember when they were
going to sell us the photographic
furnace we're going to have them in our
home and then we all went back to
Walmart to get our prints done that's
what simplicity is all about if it's not
simple people going to it so provide the
service as well okay go ahead Bri with a
MakerBot you can make another 3d printer
how much of it can you make you can make
all the plastic parts yeah you need some
rods you need some motors of Enhancement
electronics and you're good to go the
riprap project has been around for a
while we actually started on this
project and people use MakerBot's
all the time to make 3d printers for
their friends but that's we're really
low cost with plastic now and one of the
other things here is both of these
products are using pretty much the same
raw material which is this plastic
tubing can you are there other materials
that you can use I mean suppose I want
to make a ring for my wife and can I can
I make something out of brass or
something we we did this we make things
all the time and if I had one here I'll
show you and then we go to a foundry in
Manhattan and we give them the plastic
object and a few days later they come
back and we've got it out of brass or
aluminum really and there's actually
really high-end 3d printers do you think
metal printers or do you just have them
in your cloud service printers and we
also print mode so you can get to it
finish product that's made out of metal
but in terms of metal in the home that's
probably gonna be a couple of additional
days a couple of one additional day yeah
okay what else we want to know about
these things so yeah hopefully the
coolest thing this year is that there's
not just one 3d printer company
and you know the thing is is 3d printing
has been around for a long time but it
hasn't been accessible you know we
started a couple years coming to see us
with our kids now we've got a full-on
you know assembled then you can buy and
just yet they've got a machine you can
just buy your dad and that means that
there's a there's a there's and and
people are excited people are swarming
around these booths and it shows that
there's something going on here where
consumers want to take control of the
things they have in their life and this
is really different from a lot of the
things here where you know you look at
your phone you look at your tablet you
look at your TV these things are
empowering tools that are going to
change the future so there's something
going on give me your science-fiction
vision this your diamond age vision here
so I've made a kitchen one of my knobs
breaks I take a knob from another thing
I drop it in somewhere and scans it and
prints me a copy of it yeah we have 3d
copies that when I mean when how how
much you know so there's people doing
that right now you can use the Kinect
which is a it's a it's a Microsoft
product that has been hacked to be a
scanner it's really easy to use there's
some software we've been doing this for
a while it's really fun - yeah take a
scan of yourself MakerBot it I'm sure
you can do that on your your you're
doing that as well it's that's really
fun and so we're in this kind of flight
we're in this time where it's the
beginning kind of like when the Apple 2
came out and an industry was born and
there's people being like do I really
need a 3d printer ask somebody who's got
a machine like this if they want if
they're enjoying life and they're
they're gonna just be like oh my gosh
it's so cool what's the weirdest thing
you or the most interesting thing you've
seen somebody print out so most
interesting thing I've seen somebody
print out is we've got a guy named miles
Lightwood who is doing project shelter
which is doing eco eco ecology
conservation for hermit crabs printing
out hermit crab shells because hermit
crabs have a like a housing choice so
turns out you can't make you can't make
shells in any other way than with a
machine like these
why not because of the yeah cuz they're
not illicit you couldn't mold that okay
that's pretty cool
the most interesting thing aside from
the shoe phone here you know
able to print almost anything over the
last 25 years we've revolutionized any
our hearing aids so that they were more
comfortable we've changed the way people
straighten their teeth we've seen
implants that change the way people live
so we've had an amazing impact on
humankind and we think that by enabling
the consumer to take advantage of this
kind of create and make environment this
coloring book simplicity we're gonna
find creations and creativity we haven't
seen before
and it's really all about the 3d
experience and while not everyone's
ready race we think there are a number
of people because I think both brie and
I would like to take a day off and relax
given how much excitement we've created
here at CES oh I definitely want one or
both of these in my house I don't know
why but I do listen
Kathy lose from 3d systems thank you so
much for coming in Reap Edison CEO of
MakerBot and thank you very much for
bringing your toys and your toy makers
with you
where are you guys located for people
who are watching this live outside of
Charlotte no no I mean in here all the
way to Charlotte see the thing no no you
don't we're in 3d at home who's 13 345
come see us which is okay and we're just
at the door just at the middle of top
floor self middle top floor spouts and I
don't know where that booth was
Hollywood central hub natural hall by
the way thank you CES and seeing it we
love being a finalist yes
congratulations congratulations thank
you very much thanks everyone be here
thank you
we're out thanks we'll see you guys soon
