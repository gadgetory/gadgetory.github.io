Samsung Galaxy s6 or the galaxy s6 edge
it keeps you up at night tossing and
turning but never for your friends I'm
Jessica's all-court with CNN and I will
save you from the anguish of debating
which galaxy s6 to buy both phones are
made of metal and glass they're slim
sleek and rather sexy
they boast 5.1 inch displays with
incredible 2650 by 1440 pixels
resolution x' a 16 megapixel camera
Gerdes each one with shooting modes and
editing tricks and inside an octa-core
processor revs up your movies and
streaming videos these phones are in a
word awesome now take out really good
base model s6 and add chocolate sauce
and a cherry on top
that's the galaxy s6 edge there are two
general things that make this phone
different the phone shape and also what
you can do with it shape first it's got
two rounded sides that curve down and
form an edge along the back some people
say it feels a little sharp I love it
and it's more balanced than you might
think we all agree though that the
screen becomes more immersive and pulls
you in next up is the extra edge
software seriously guys it was like 6
things I mean it's cool and all you can
view some notifications from your
friends and from social networks you can
also quickly see missed calls and texts
for your 5 favorite people and call them
back
and sometimes when they call a ribbon of
light appears ooh oh and you can turn it
into a neat little night clock too but
it's not like you don't see alerts at
the top of your phone anyway or missed
calls for that matter and the night
clock please there are apps for that so
what I'm saying is the edge displays
tricks are pretty cool but let's face it
they're also non-essential so at the end
of the day the s6 edge is like any other
designer product is it worth the 17 ish
percent extra for you to be the cool kid
with the hot piece of tech or would you
rather take that dough and level up on
storage capacity with the s6 or buy
something else completely like a new
pair of kicks or 20 beers so here's what
I think if you love the design you go
out and you buy that galaxy s6 edge and
you use that night puck proudly you
the heck out of that people edge or if
you're more fiscally conservative you
happily get the S six and get on with
your life the bottom line is both phones
will get you what you need with style
and class either way you can't go wrong
I'm Jessica's all court read all about
it
