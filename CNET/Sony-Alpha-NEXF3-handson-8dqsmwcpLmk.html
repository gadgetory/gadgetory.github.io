interchangeable lens camera isn't a
drastic departure from the c3 which it
replaces but it does add a built-in
flash and has a slightly bulkier more
workman like design it's also got a new
sensor although the same resolution and
a new metering system though it's a
little bigger and heavier than the c3 I
like the extra bulk of the f3 it's got a
deeper grip for one thing which makes it
easier to shoot single-handed the body
is made of polycarbonate and feels a
little cheaper than previous models but
it's still pretty well constructed the
camera uses the typical NEX design with
programmable controls that are
contextually labeled on the LCD I really
like this interface though I'd love just
one more button I hate having to
sacrifice the main button which defaults
to pulling up the virtual mode dial in
order to comfortably streamline the
controls for my shooting needs like
Panasonic's ILCs
the flash can be tilted backwards for
bounced indirect lighting in order to
produce a much better job on the other
hand there's a lip around the record
button that's probably designed to
prevent you from pressing and get
accidentally but I find it makes it
annoyingly difficult to stop and start
video recording the tilting LCD is the
same one as the C 3 but Sony's added a
new twist you can flip it straight up
for self-portraits and when it's in that
position it automatically goes into a
self-timer mode with a countdown display
appearing on the LCD it then flips the
photo automatically so that it's
normally oriented rather than mirror
oriented this is a really nifty feature
if you're the self photographing sort if
you use a tripod with any regularity
I suggest you pass on the f3 though
while I appreciate that Sony moved the
SD card slot out of the battery
compartment I think the new location
which is right next to the tripod mount
becomes equally as problematic new in
this generation of cameras is the auto
portrait framing feature in superior
auto mode when you frame a picture of a
person in a white orientation it
automatically creates a crop that more
attractively positions the person in the
photo and it'll save both the original
and the crop this is really clever and
useful idea for
new photographers if you're looking for
a camera with better low-light photo
quality than a point-and-shoot the f3
definitely qualifies while the f3 is
generally pretty fast and faster than
the c3
it can also be exome ly inconsistent
continuous shooting is a bit sluggish
but overall the camera should be able to
keep up with the toddler and bright
sunlight
well the Alpha any xf3 doesn't Wow me
for any particular aspect of the camera
overall it's a nice package that should
suit many point-and-shoot upgraders
looking for the versatility and photo
quality of a DSLR without the bulk I'm
Lori grinning and this is the sony alpha
any accessory</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
