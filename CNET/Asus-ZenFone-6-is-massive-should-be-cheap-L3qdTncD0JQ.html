CES 2014 we're taking a look at this
it's the asus zenfone 6 a massive
smartphone with all the trimmings so
let's talk through the tech that's
onboard here this 6 inch display has a
720p resolution if you flip this phone
around on the back it's got a 13
megapixel camera I'm not blown away by
how light and thin it is but I do like
the design and it comes in a range of
lovely bright colors it's running on
Android version 4.3 which isn't the very
latest version but ASA says that an
update will be coming something quite
interesting is that this phone is
powered by an intel atom chip I'll be
interested to see how that processor
performs in our benchmark tests if you
happen to love the design but don't want
to phone in this big then asus has also
made the zenfone 5 and the zenfone 4 in
the series and they're 5 inch and 4-inch
phones respectively do be aware though
that as you go down in size the
specifications become less impressive
asus says the zenfone 6 should be coming
out in Asia in the next few months but
unfortunately there's no US release date
yet I'm not blown away by any particular
aspect of this smartphone but what my
asus could give it an edge is to make it
very very cheap and having spoken to
them I think it really could be quite
affordable let me know if you're
interested and check out Cesc netcom for
more
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
