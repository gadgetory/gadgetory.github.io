workstations these days the struggle to
find a bag that fits all your equipment
is real incomes Moshe's arcus bag this
is the clown car of laptop bags rather a
very organized clown car with
compartments for just about everything
you'll need at least as a journalist on
the road or at CES the largest and most
protected is the camera compartment that
can be accessed from the side it can fit
your camera lenses plates cables and
then some any other large item leftover
can fit on the top in my case my tennis
shoes and they're not exactly dainty so
that's already fitting a lot on the top
of that is a hardshell compartment with
my makeup wallet and glasses and plenty
of hidden compartments on the back for
essentials like passports and travel
documents and then there's the back
compartment which managed to fit my 15
inch macbook pro cables old-school
notepad and then some and of course a
hydration station on the side that hugs
your water bottle tightly so you won't
have any rollaways i'm sure maybe i
could fit all this in a regular backpack
but it would literally be bursting at
the seams my dirty shoes would be all
over my lens and I would have to dump
everything out to get something from the
bottom this is not the lightest bag I've
ever packed but it's by no means the
heaviest on my back and the weight seems
evenly distributed plus it looks good
the arcus comes in gray or black and
retails for about two hundred and thirty
five dollars with the camera insert
which can also be purchased separately
for $30</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
