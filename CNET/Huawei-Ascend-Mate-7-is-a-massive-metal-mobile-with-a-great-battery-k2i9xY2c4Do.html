the go then you'll need a screen big
enough to do them justice with a
high-definition 6-inch display Kuwaitis
tantrum 8 7 certainly ticks that box
with such a big screen it should be no
surprise that this phone is physically
in massive it's slim sure but it's
basically impossible to use with just
one hand although the camera on their
back is a fingerprint sensor now that is
positioned exactly where your index
finger will naturally sit and it was
able to recognize my prints with a very
high level of accuracy making an
actually useful security addition
instead of just being a gimmick the
benefit of its vast size is that there's
so much screen real estate to really
show off your videos has a full HD
resolution and it's bright and bold
making glossy videos look great
it runs the older Android 4.4.2 kitkat
software but Huawei has made so many
changes you probably won't notice that
you're not on the latest version of
Android the biggest change is that
there's no app tray so all your apps and
widgets are stored across the multiple
home screens now I personally don't like
this if I find it tough to keep it
looking neat and organized and it's very
easy to misplace apps there are some
nice tweaks including selectable themes
which changed everything down to the app
icons themselves and a phone manager
that helps you clear out old files and
even block calls from unwanted numbers
the big letdown however is the vast
amounts of pre-installed bloat where
you'll find a bunch of games on board
like asphalt 8 and something called
bubble bash mania along with various
other tools which apart from cluttering
up the interface before you've even
downloaded your first app also makes the
phone that bit more confusing for new
Android users to get to grips with the
other benefit of the huge size of the
phone is that Huawei has had room to
squeeze in a massive battery and put in
a brilliant performance on our battery
test and will easily last the whole day
if not - if you're more careful about
how you use it the camera on the back
has a 13 megapixel resolution and it's
capable of taking some great shots with
even exposure and plenty of detail
although colors can be a bit muted at
times if you're really into videos and
gaming on the go the meet seventh
gigantic size will be a real advantage
it's strong battery life is a big plus
point - and it
reasonably-priced it's clunky bloated
software is a letdown but it's still a
good choice if you can't afford both a
new phone and a new tablet
