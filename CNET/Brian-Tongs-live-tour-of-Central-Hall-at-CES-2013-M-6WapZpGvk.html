back live from the CES show floor still
one day before the official floor opens
up and you know nothing says CEO set up
like a bunch of boxes and maybe this
little sprint hashtag sweepstakes I know
we're pimping it but hey you guys all
you have to do is follow at cnet on
Twitter then send a tweet with that
hashtag and it answers you in a contest
to potentially win a samsung galaxy 2
tab to 10.1 inch because you know we're
gonna take care of you now we are
nowhere near Samsung's booth we're going
to go there a little later today but
we're here in front of Panasonic's booth
we don't have access to this one
specifically right now but we just
wanted to show you as we know that
Panasonic is a huge player when it comes
down to televisions set-top boxes
blu-ray players home theaters system so
we're going to see a lot of that over
here you kind of see again stuff covered
up this is Panasonic's kind of new
concept of their design philosophy with
glass and metal my design philosophy is
to make a TV with a thin bezel that
looks sexy you don't just make it hot
all right so Panasonic booth we're gonna
be able to get in here and show you a
lot of the new TVs and technology that
they have going on later in the show
we'll have a lot of first looks at that
stuff but we wanted to give you just an
idea of how big it is even in this far
corner over here this is where Panasonic
typically has like a stadium where they
have all these different flat panel
displays and TVs they do a lot of their
presentations from there probably
expecting to see a few things out there
a couple years ago they had like the
star wars blu ray that was announced as
well as other big ones like the bond
announcement was last year I'm banda on
blu-ray so we might see some of those
media content partnership deals with
Panasonic show up here so what we're
gonna do is we're gonna keep on walking
around the central hall and show you
guys a little bit a little more other
stuff might not be the sexiest because
you know we're in Sony's moved last time
but this is kind of keep on walking
through here and again throughout the
course of all of our coverage right we
have our live press conferences and we'd
like to thank Lexus for that really long
press conference but now I'm just
playing all right so let's just come
over here and this just kind of really
the center of the central hall that
we're going to be checking out here you
may not say oh these aren't the biggest
of players but right now this is the
acoustic research RCA booth RCA those
are a lot of those antennas over-the-air
antennas
a lot of people still have been a little
resistant to be to go over the air with
their television set right you can get
these digital stations in full
high-definition your local broadcast
using those antennas so that's something
that you know I don't I still see people
catching on for especially for your
cable cord cutters you should look into
that all right now also here this is
from acoustic research these look like
you know thermoses or coolers these are
their MVP portable wireless speaker
systems a lot of people have jumped on
to the whole Bluetooth portable wireless
speaker bandwagon right we saw
everything from like the jam box and
other products so those guys you can
like customize and skin wait actually
Charlie let me show you this one you see
the giants baby we're from San Francisco
that's that's the one that I want or you
know maybe we could put like my own
lovely face on one of those coolers or
whatever speaker systems all right let's
keep on walking out this way down here
my best friend's little soft carpet with
that Kickstarter project that was called
the pebble watch they're gonna finally
make their announcement of the hopefully
the debut of the pebble watch here we
know it's supposed to it was supposed to
come out in 2012 but the dude
announcement here at CES but i think you
know look out for the watch space there
are also rumblings of an Apple watch who
knows we'll see what happens there but
that's another place where you know
we're gonna start seeing technology move
into ok so we can keep on going here
Cassio's over this way but just to kind
of get a big scope of everything here
this is just again the center of the
central hall you'll still kind of catch
glimpses of people setting up the
different booths in the displays it's a
lot a lot a lot of colors in the open
space right now I can't tell you right
now though that it'll never be this
clear or this wide open here at CES it
never will I'm this you can't walk look
at this it's like clear path alright
let's come over here and check out
sharps booth now we saw sharp make some
announcements today so we know we're
gonna walk in there and see what we can
do or what will happen right cuz this is
all live on the fly right so here at
sharps booth we're going to set up
around here sharp has really been
continued to up their game in the flat
panel and TV space so what we have here
is we have like their 90 their 90 inch
LED series they just recently announced
those here is
there are aqua series is there Syria
eight series they're really showing long
big large TV displays that are pretty
much is this thing taller than me if I
Tom bigger than me probably is what
sharp is doing some other really cool
stuff is well we're gonna kind of show
you this is their setup and the display
I like that they aren't trying to pack
in too many things here again we're
seeing a lot more open displays here at
CES again more 90 inch LED TVs which are
pretty pretty darn impressive just from
the size and the scope of it here at
sharps booth and i'm going to show you
one thing we're gonna come over here
everyone every company has like a
concept TV that they really want to show
to showcase what's coming down the road
so come follow me I this is one TV that
it's again it's a prototype and it's a
concept but it's worth checking out so
check this out over here and you can get
in type this Charlie this is their 85
inch 8k TV now you guys have heard of 4k
television that's obviously the big buzz
here but what we have here is this is
their own proprietary content on their
own proprietary cameras that are
capturing this footage I mean you might
not be able to see this at home but you
can catch every fine grain of detail the
best way that I can describe this AK TV
is it looks like digital pictures from a
DSLR in mohnton motion so again it's
only a concept we aren't expecting to
see this anytime soon you've heard a 4k
this is sharps 8k concept so you know
guys we're going to keep on going
throughout the show floor and show you
more stuff again you know check out look
out for our sprint hashtag sweepstakes
will have more press conferences for you
we're gonna wrap things up here go back
to a break and you know we'll we'll see
what else we can find for you okay see
you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
