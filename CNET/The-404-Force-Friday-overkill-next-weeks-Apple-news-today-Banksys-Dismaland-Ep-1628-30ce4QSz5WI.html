it would even up to and I think are you
can you stop that I knew you're gonna
bring that up start the show Chris Rusin
engage yeah I know thanks a lot another
one bites it does no it's perfect so so
yeah what's your what's your deal with
the has life been no I was gonna say
life has been pretty good i've been on a
mission of personal wellness lately I've
been really trying to improve my a
couple things about myself physically
are you juicing yeah I'm shooting no
juice fasting oh that kind of just like
yeah I'm shooting steroids into my bath
uh no no I've been doing yoga lately oh
yeah I've been trying to really improve
my posture I got a visit from my cousin
who's from who came from California last
week and he's in PT school up at USF I
don't know what that stands for his
physical therapist got it and he made a
lot of comments about
how crappy my posture he just kept
bringing it out which is true I've had
scoliosis you know when they did that
test in the I school in middle school
everybody has scoliosis is gonna be
worse over the years yeah you did they
didn't say you have scoliosis no I think
not we all look like mr. burns yeah but
they would say get a brace yeah not that
bad maybe I'd better see you you
actually had it um I didn't have like 0
up 0 you look great yeah posture I
didn't realize hold on I move myself oh
yeah right I mean it's very difficult
none of the chairs that we have in the
office or the subway seats none of them
really when themselves too bad yeah so
I've been really trying to focus more on
just standing up straight and even when
I'm in my seat at the computer I won't
lean over because it's a bad look yeah I
don't know if you've ever I saw a few
photos of myself too and that's kind of
what triggered it for me just looking at
myself and big oh god that yeah okay a
Tyrannosaurus Rex so I've been enrolling
in some yoga classes lately just started
that last hot yoga no just regular
normal so so hot yoga's when they like
make you sweat yeah yeah I'm trying to
improve my posture or not but yeah it's
like normal yoga you you'll get that out
of just like doing the standard car yeah
do you do it you guys do I have done
actually the most recent time that I
went to yoga was on the beach in Long a
Long Beach Long Island and I went out
with v friends and my girlfriend and one
of my friends was like hey they're doing
a free beach yoga class and I look great
so we go out there it's 5pm we're doing
yoga it's very chill it's on the beach
and the beach garbage truck no joke
parks three feet behind where we're
doing yoga and parks there and starts
like grinding trash for about a half so
it's like hot garbage yoga it was not
the most relaxing experience I know
that's the thing about doing it in New
York to anywhere you go yeah right when
I lived in the city i would go to yoga
for the people and the address was on
666 broadway yeah which is on broadway
and bleecker like you know right in the
middle of Soho and there's cars honking
and stuff it's just a very jarring
experience to come out of that yeah
class and right onto the street again
but now that I'm living in park slope I
found one that's kind of in the
neighborhood it's very chilling a fire
and wow man now my thing is that I
understand the I understand the benefits
of meditating and feeling peaceful but
i'm not a spiritual person sure so it's
really difficult to not feel like that's
kind of corny for myself like i'm
forcing myself to adopt another person's
culture almost yet but it almost feels
co-opted this is amazing because I see
you all the time yeah and we talk a lot
right and this is never come out I did
not know this about you that's my fault
what I said it was recent those it was
asked it's within the last month month
okay but I only go maybe once or twice a
week so you've been three times yeah
haven't gone yet action just planning on
the role that's amazing good for you and
very happy for you you do have this I
want to say positive aura about you
while I'm trying yeah that's amazing you
know we have yoga in the office Jeff
you're welcome to sign up I haven't done
it yet but there's a sign-up sheet there
is and we're doing it next friday so so
i am not a flexible man no neither am i
that's what I'm doing me doing yoga is
like you know making an action figure
like contortion like that it just won't
work yeah like his arm just simply won't
extend that far yeah I'll say you're
like fart a lot yeah I would imagine
some of the poses squeeze that as much
I've had I've had worrying moments in
doing it what's the there's this there's
a sketch out there where someone's like
pushing their legs back and like the
yoga instructors pushing someone's legs
back a person just right there it's
common that's a normal because they're
doing so much bending and your I
contestants are moving around you just
fart a lot of them are supposed to sort
of engage your digestive system Mel with
that so maybe that is what yoga is about
maybe that was just like lost in
translation over the centuries taken
helps just fart release like sort of
meditation I mean that's good to a lot
of people have bad gas which yes to
gastrointestinal issues man that's gonna
be a very educational show I think so
we've got a lot to talk about i want to
congratulate you on your shoulders back
a little bit you know you arch your back
yet you know pretty our guys know i'm
just gonna say like so i make a
conscious effort while I'm walk
down the street to have better posture I
don't have the caveman posture whilst
walking down the street I think it looks
weak and unhealthy so I make a conscious
effort to like really look ahead yet my
head up the hard part is because we use
our phone so much always looking down
right so I've started holding the phone
above my god really no just like a
psychopath like a crazy person like an
old person huh yeah Wow alright well the
best of luck to you in this new endeavor
you know let me know if you do really
inspired me as Mark you ever see more
rounded up Susan yeah so for his
shoulders are back but you gotta be
honest yet that s shape to his own so
here's the deal with that though mark is
constantly in pain select whatever he
whenever he walks around like he's he's
grunting on the end because he's been
work that he worked out like 30 minutes
or so mark will never be the one to
admit this but he's constantly hurting
himself tearing workouts I think he just
pushes himself too hard out look he's in
perfect shape yeah I mean you can't
really say you can't criticize his his
you know sort of well-being but he does
kind of overwork himself and he he's
constantly throwing out his back off his
knees are all jacked up and I'm like
dude I can tell you're wincing as you
walk she doing that like I helped him
pick a box up the other day and he was
like they're like Mark you know you're
like a double black belt in tae kwon but
the outside looks good the outside looks
great you know when you stand like that
you kind of give off this air of
confidence yeah that I think is in total
stancil urban it's uh it's a it's
definitely a good look that's for sure
our we've got a lot to talk about on the
show today um let's get to it right away
I want to just kind of dissect / unpack
deconstruct this whole force Friday star
wars that sense I'm so like I am NOT a
Star Wars guy at all I I casually enjoy
the first six films what sick I'm sorry
first three and then I'd like I like the
Darth Vader one I like episode 3 okay
okay okay it's best out of the first
well sure does not know at a free
piles of
take this far the most corn in it yeah
so so yeah so now with uh what's
a--what's a call the force on wake
awaken the force awakens force awakens
with this film coming out which is not
out til December sandberg it's only
September yeah and already the marketing
merchandising floodgates have opened and
it's become this phenomenon and yes the
bb-8 the rolling Android the little coy
it's it's cute it's undeniably and fifty
dollars it's a hundred fifty bucks and
it's basically this product that that
company spero made just with the head on
it zero it makes you wonder like hey how
much was like Sphero and Disney in
cahoots where it's like hey put in a
freaking rolling Android movie will make
millions of them will sell I'm like yeah
it just feels weird I wasn't that
impressed by it we had on the office
yesterday people were I mean it's okay
it just looks like an RC car worth about
150 buckle my should ask me for that at
slapping well yeah I guess so the
coolest thing is the head because it can
roll but keep its head right right to me
that's a fun but it doesn't really do it
looks drunk it looks like it's had a few
too many so I searched it sphero to
point out which is the latest version of
the normal one that's not painted is a
hundred and twenty eight dollars and the
BBA yeah is 150 but get this there's
also the Sphero alley which is sort of
shaped like a cylinder and it jumps you
can roll it around I've shown that and
that's a hundred bucks I saw that a toy
fair I think you should that is probably
that's the one to get ya on you control
that with your phone yeah I'm gonna take
the bb-8 home with me this weekend and
screw with me a party will be really
obsessions let's see who wins in a fight
party or the bb-8 uh but what is force
fried is that were they just release a
so that's like the right that's the
branding you know disaster that they've
come up with okay we're like last night
at midnight or ever was all these star
wars the force awakens products were
released gotcha or announced or whatever
the hell it is and it's such as toys I
saw a Chewbacca coffee creamer sting
from like coffee mate and I wanted to
jump off a building and there is a
certain point where all this keeps going
and I kind of kind of want the movie to
suck because of it sees because it's
like
I did enough yeah I I don't think the
movie's gonna suck I don't think so
either I don't think it's gonna suck
that bb-8 everyone's gonna fall in love
with that thing but here's the really
funny thing people literally the amount
of time that you've seen bb-8 is about a
second and a half that's literally like
all you see him in the trailer that's it
he's gonna face adversity he's gonna
what if she's super racist is all
exactly like he shows up he's like an
you know those black people it's just
completely racist in a galaxy far far
away you know what Scott trust that
Lando Star Wars does have a history of
like super kind of racy seriously just
sorta Star Wars so I think JJ Abrams is
smart enough to avoid that what's the
what's like the slimy mechanic what was
his name the flying by konoba yes but
noticeable was the bad guy yeah it was
in the Padres yeah but everyone's like
oh that's the Jewish right it was joy
wait well here's your only like Arabs to
I've ever heard misters like a stereo
like a gypsy what can you bring him a
photo of him uh he looks like Gandhi is
that either looks like that all those
you sort of does I don't they said that
charger was supposed to his accent sort
of sounded like like patois like a
Jamaican pack yeah it's like Jamaican
which is certainly accurate yeah i mean
that i can see that it just kind of
readjust did not it was not necessary
any and the oh wat oh you got all right
and also weren't the Trade Federation
guys they're like really asian and like
to the point of not yeah I never got to
I think people will just needed more
ways to hate on them there's no shortage
of really I feel like oh that's my bed
with the end here Oh play some water
sound effects in a second listen to this
we have that sedation I remember no
parkin it oh dear wait I feel like
that's someone doing his voice no I
think that's him so bad hey maybe you
could help with some deadbeats who owe
me a lot of money I mean
look like you that's good and he's
talking about like getting money back
yeah he's a loan shark he was yeah he
was coming it was pretty safe is a
grease man yeah like this he's like a
sketchy slimy think of all the coded
language that must have been in the
script for George Lucas to write and be
like well he's got a big nose and he's
green don't you think laterz their word
like throne yeah like there was thrown
out dialogue like some droids trying to
gym last or next week I don't know man
but there's some just not right about
about water yeah so I agree I think JJ
Abrams will avoid I do I think I think I
mean Adam driver is clearly belongs in
the Star Wars universe yes they won't
need to put any makeup on it so ever
uh-uh no I do think is a fantastic actor
I mean it's amazing like you know
there's somebody out there collecting
all this stuff like buying up all the
Chewbacca coffee creamers from the
ground or met in 20 years i'll sell it
on ebay for millions of drug that
doesn't happen like BBH already going
for 359 days yeah but selling or
actually selling I saw offered I saw one
auction end at 272 or 378 I they sold
out in stores I don't know apparently
they're at bed bath and beyond yeah I
was like sweet Bed Bath finally get
music beyond checking that box we're
checking that box with the bb-8 I don't
know I don't know it's it's worrying I
die I think the movie will be very good
I think he makes good first movies the
star trek movie was great the first one
at least yeah and the first season of
lost is very good I think seconds Star
Trek's good to the second one it wasn't
bad I wasn't like snow fine yeah it was
uh he i think he is he's he's not like
we don't need JJ abrams but like I'm
glad he's here but I was would do it
right and I think like someone else in
his spot I think he's doing exactly what
he needs to be doing and he's feeling
that hole yeah you know god you're
standing at you're sitting up so
straight make you feel self you like a
dick yeah punching over damn it all
right speaking of non-stop
disappointment Apple is getting ready to
have an event next week and this
you know yes usually things leak out but
we know every single goddamn thing
they're doing next week we we we know
like what the keynote looks like pretty
much at this point we know what outfit
Tim Cook's gonna be wearing it's
ridiculous arm so yeah there's uh
there's been that happening all week new
Apple TV we're probably gonna see an
iPad pro like a 12 superb a guy super
big ipad pro 12.9 inch I don't know who
the people that were like the the way
normal ipad is not big enough yeah
what's the regular iPad so I think
that's nine yeah I want to say it's like
ian is like that so it's Louie let's
it's much bigger like it's considerably
bigger and I just don't know who that I
guess artists maybe we're like it needs
to be even bigger yeah that kinda cool
game you could have two browser windows
up open at the same yeah I think that
it's a rationale for it so I mean what
did you that yeah I mean I don't want to
go down this road again be like this all
pros never good work people aren't gonna
buy that yeah they will I personally I
mean everything they make is so big now
yet the iphone iphone 6 plus is enormous
um you know I don't know I feel like an
iPad pro like that's a third thing about
the 13-inch because this is 12 9 what
the how big is this 13 right so that's a
13-inch MacBook Air we're looking at
right here so imagine just the screen
enormous how do you even hold this with
one hand and like do stuff it's got to
be a pound right they can't make it more
than a pound like whatever threshold
probably I don't know yeah I know also a
new Apple TV I'm excited about the
Abbott was what do they said about the
Apple TV so the apple TV is likely going
to have an a8 chip your side which is
essentially with the iphone 6 so are you
able to run iOS apps on it yeah so it
sounds like it's gonna have an iOS 9
core go side which I guess means yeah
sure it'll have and that's exciting
because you functional II like if you
went out it's probably gonna be 150
bucks you went out let's say you wanted
a gaming console for your TV you could
buy this thing 450 bucks and play iOS
games that either a you bought already
cuz on your phone right or be you just
won a new game oh it's three dollars and
you can versus like a 60-hour game for
your TV yeah they're also expecting
another IP
mini refresh and I'm excited Apple watch
accessories um and obviously then the
phones ooh I think it's funny cuz that
really has taken a backseat because
everyone considers this an S year yeah
it's you just gonna get a success in a
success pro yeah plus whatever the hell
it'll have forced touch it will have
some other stuff but for such thing I
don't know man I don't get that either
yeah it's just like it's it's a
sensitivity feedback thing uh yeah if
you push extra hard you'll feel
something come back on yeah yeah and it
like yeah it's it's got to watch right
yes six will the watch the watch hazard
watch as yeah yeah yeah it's like the
lunch so that's that's your that's your
Apple preview for next week yeah it's
not I don't think it's an
earth-shattering year but there are
products that I think people are like so
they have a lot of stata though I mean
and and I would imagine this is covering
everything I can't imagine them being
like oh right and then we also have like
a new I mean the probably of new imacs
to like that what is that a Steve Jobs
move except steve jobs movie with
Fassbender is coming up pretty soon this
week that comes out next month oh yeah
okay uh anh tuan was on wednesday i
interviewed alex gibney for CBS oh yeah
who directed this documentary yeah he
did going clear all clear did i
interviewed the scientology director on
he made an i don't have this guy makes
all these movies he made another movie
about Steve Jobs but it's like oh right
Steve Jobs the total f an asshole and
all right and I think that's what the
Fassbender movie probably goes into a
lot right but like my first question for
him was like all right and this like
students legit one Oscar sure he knows
what's up I'm like why does everyone try
and tell this story and like no one
really ever able to like permeate
through his establishment Eve jobs and I
don't think more than half of them know
that i'll give you a perfect example why
this happens ok John Lennon John Lennon
was a huge asshole wife or my father
horrible
they're real asshole right and yes and
things that he produced became more
important than the things that he did as
a man so I guess it only happened so the
only the opposite is only true if you're
Bill Cosby yes well his comedy clearly
didn't overcome his raping of 30 women
well he in some circles made Kim laughs
after that sentence but yes I mean it's
absolutely awful what he did I don't
think Steve Jobs or uh John Lennon
achieved the horrific pneus that yeah I
mean yes we need like a Venn diagram
just like three circles of perfectness
yeah um yeah What did he say anything he
is like he was just very blown away as
to why no one really understands this
and he's like but I get it you know he
gets credit for revolutionising the
technological world and you know you ask
like a 15 year old about Steve Jobs and
that kid says oh he invented the iPod
iTunes ipad apple TV like he is a God
and on one hand it's like yeah he did a
lot of great stuff but he did it at the
sacrifice of like hundreds of people he
in the movie I didn't get to see the
movie unfortunately but I saw the
trailer watch a lot of interviews about
it he like straight-up destroyed a few
people's lives in the wake of his
success there's there's like weirdness
about like you know weird sex scandals
also he had like a movie child isn't
like supporting very like yeah the
rabbit hole goes freaking deep on this
yeah so anyway the film is called the
men in the machine and i believe it's
out in theaters and on-demand today if
you want to go check that out ah but
anyway we'll have live coverage of Abby
with the very innocent Tim Cook on
Tuesday so follow along with that he
seems like a nice he does seem like a
nice guy I got nothing against mr. cook
um alright before we hit the brake
monster selfie case is this the monster
this is monster the company that makes
this of 70 hundred seven hundred dollar
like hdmi cable
right so just as a shattered passed with
no this splash page with the website is
horribly looks like a Prada yeah
advertise yes super so I brought a
magazine advertising when you go to
monster safety kake.com yeah explain
this beautiful disaster so monster known
the world over for ripping people off
for crappy hdmi cables has made a selfie
case for your phone Oh disagree there's
a visa nada well I got it attractive
people on here anyway oh yeah yeah so
they made this selfie case for your
phone and it's a phone case that's
sticky on the back that you stick to a
wall I guess glass so that you can take
sexually suggestive sometimes photos of
yourself and maybe your mate in the
boudoir yeah now what's weird there's so
many layers of weirdness to this yeah
first of all who wants a sticky phone
case that you put in your pocket than it
sticks that sucks it's your phone
covered in dust and pocket girl right
especially if you're bringing into the
bedroom god knows what its gonna get
stuck too oh but secondly who is gonna
spend the money for this and third how
much is it I have no idea it doesn't
matter doesn't matter it really done
here is good and how much is it too much
how do you not have a shelf just put
your phone on a shelf what is specific
case for any platform will hold it hold
your phone in place and it seems like
it's only gonna stick to very specific
yeah it seems like they were using auto
glass yeah you know what it reminds me
of it's one of those reusable sticky
lint rollers yes they were advertising
on TV this that's pretty much the same
technology right you just wash it when
it gets dirty yeah I get sticky again
the price is actually provide dollars
yeah the price is pretty surprising it
starts at 30 bucks which is that's a
normal case it's actually not okay what
do you mean it start because we'll the
plus is five bucks more got that'll cost
you 35 but it's still a hunk of joe like
who wants this thing I just don't know
if I would trust this to not just fall
down and I'm saying like you're
essentially put giving everyone a case
where it's like yeah this could fall
pretty easily I also don't think that's
a selfie at that point it's not your
window is taking a photo of you yeah is
what that's like people were saying that
Pluto had a selfie but it didn't of
course
cuz the satellite sector o know exactly
what there was a segment on John
Oliver's like people referring to
selfies that are clearly not selfies and
it's just good are you doing now doesn't
it make you mad yeah it's really mad
just walking around because you know how
many people take selfies while they're
walking up the stairs to the subway that
I just want to really don't understand
you seen that right I've never see the
light of that yeah I guess so or are
just on the subway and I saw it the
other day I saw um a girl taking what
had to be 25 self I know that's that's
residents a one selfie is okay yeah but
like she was and she not hosing and
choose it and I don't know why it
infuriates me like it does you like you
can't put into words like we were
talking about this uh the other day like
why is a selfie stick so awful like what
now I I agree it is and you got to take
a deep breath but like and you know
because why is it so bad i know i don't
actually agree with you I think it's
great I don't think it's so bad and
here's why here's why I don't think it's
so bad even though I agree they look
obnoxious and they're terrible to look
at and you people look like jerks and
you admit you do have that that feeling
of a sort of resentment anger yeah I
totally get it I feel the same thing
when I see people wearing Google glass
yeah but with the selfie stick if you're
traveling let's say you're in Thailand
with your significant other and you're
traveling around with just you two and
you don't want to constantly give your
phone decided that yeah I get it so for
from a tourism perspective I'm not
totally against it the reason it's so
off-putting it's because it's so
narcissistic it's like the autonomy of
narcissism yeah because you're just
constantly like a little good and you're
just in your normal you just do that in
the mirror at home but now everyone's
just doing in public and it's like it's
a shame feeling where you catch somebody
trying on clothes in the dressing room
you know kind of like do a bunch of
poses and it's just something that
should be private you're right but it's
really not supposed to look over the

didn't pull your hair out during the
first segment of our program a lot a lot
of you know cringe-worthy stuff we
discussed it's a pretty piece that I
felt before coming into this show now my
shoulders are all high look you
shriveled up bring out the yo you just
you raisin Donna just getting mad um I
so Russ walks in this morning and he's
in like Beach clothes and flip flops and
I'm like wow I'm like I know you have to
dress up to come on the show the way the
gingham on top and plaid on bottled very
bold I not plaid that's mattress Oh
Madras I'm sorry I do like that no look
mixing I guidance so before we talk
about your attire and why it's related
yeah it's related i also want to like
let you know so that's madras so that's
like a very fine flannel is like a
fossil record oh the shorts is called
madras yeah what's the top this is game
gingham yeah do you know that yeah I
just said it I don't know what any of
that is it's a pattern anyway when I
look at that pattern gingham Kingdom
dots in between no I see it moves it
vibrates yeah we're def ivory for you
kind of oh yeah I think that's it's
supposed to be kind of that's actually
my nipple it's like right here in
between like your clavicle yeah that's
moving at a very fast rate for me it's
like vibrating yeah I can't look away
from it is it what does that mean you're
dying or you're high no I'm both um yeah
like why does that happen I don't know I
don't know it's anyway it's a mystery
comes in like all your in flip flops
aren't you casual Dan here yeah I
usually try to anyways I work from home
so I can wear whatever I want it work
but when I do come into the office I try
to like not you know wear underwear yeah
i mean just lay it up lay it all out
there sure and i look at his feet no
Michael yeah look at this guy's feet
yeah but your feet up on that chair no I
don't ya so to see it you want to see
this you broke his toe
so you broke which your pinkham the
pinky day oh you broke your right pinky
toe has that happened what are you doing
well I just step did you step on like a
tennis ball may feel like that's what
would do it I'm very dainty in this
instance I was walking back from dinner
with my girlfriend i was wearing these
flip-flops i could see on say yeah they
do it yeah pre wife and she was one she
walked we were crossing the street and
she was walking slightly ahead of me and
I just walked into the back of her ankle
and it was another way that's the right
way now here's the string class so I'm
gonna put my I'm gonna put my my other
foot up here whole no bones dude what is
that if you'll notice my toes are very
long they are except either they're
weird look oh right where does your pit
your pinky no no I'm sorry your second
toe and your what does that mean to your
big big toe are the same light yeah
that's that's creepy super smart I don't
like the people who have the the mill to
that second total and it's longer don't
ya does that come up a lot that's a
problem so I this happens to me once
every five years or so just cuz the toes
are so long just because the toes are so
long and if I slam it into something
hard enough how many times you've broken
it down probably five or six times you
gotta go to the doctor and be like oh
there's nothing you can do yeah so I've
gone to the I went to the doctor the
first time or tail and every single time
they're like mitt nothing we can do not
i mean you can go on the internet they
say the same thing cuzzo I you know I
just put an ace bandage around it you
know essentially buddy taping it so you
can't do anything um well you can't run
no I can't run but not that I do a lot
of running in general yeah sure but it
sucks but I you know it heals after a
couple weeks it's just of all the limb
breaks is probably the most humbling
like you don't get a lot of sympathy for
a tow break yeah um and it's just a
little embarrassing and annoying and I
made some noises after like what would
happen to know the street because I like
it happened literally in the middle of
the street I was crossing the street and
had to like hop to the other side were
you I was on like 20 second and broadway
yeah and had to walk a hop to the other
side and then like sit down in front of
a store where there was like a couple
and I'm this like scream like yelling
chicken ambulance right we can you I
don't want you trying I'm not below at
the my head don't do that but just like
would it sound like what what kind of
noises were you making they weren't like
girl cuz i make startled girly noises as
you all know we can share that story
another open you are about that but in
this instance it was more because i've
done this before wasn't surprising so
why it was just like a ah but more
emotion behind it and I was like ah that
sucks that sucks it's what you normally
wear sandals um if it's nice out i try
to not when am I going out what I feel
like is I you know I'm jealous of men
that are able to do that what is it I
just can't I don't know I i doing yoga
now you have two words there's no no I
wear sneakers to the studio and then I
take them off while I'm in there but i
think it's just my own
self-consciousness maybe about my own
feet or like to roofie no not at all but
i just have never done that before I
never worn sandals outside like to the
beach yet to the beach I grew up and it
must feel really good but I never really
had opportunity to do it I wear them
like whenever I'm walking for more than
five minutes yeah I wear sneakers right
yeah I think it is I feel like it's
subconscious worry that I'll have to run
and you know maybe something will happen
and I will be able to jump over a fence
or like outrun a murderer or something
like that yeah it you know we're in New
York anything could happen all right and
it's an errata one I don't want my
downfall to be a flip-flop that's in a
rational way but it's a rational that's
like you know yeah that'll crazy up but
yeah I guess I'm sure we come from like
I I've transitioned I used to wear
flip-flops pretty much all summer long
never with jeans cuz I'm not of yeah not
a total ass what are you doing but but I
would wear like if I wore shorts and
it's a summer and I don't have to be
dressed up I'm wearing flip flop but um
yes socks are horrible in the summer
yeah yeah never wear and you also can
put foot box on without bending down you
don't need to like exactly it's great
you're like ready on the dog oh no no
two ways about it you know but the
second I have like a more than like a
five minute walk ahead of me you need
that support in your foot yeah i'm the
same way I don't go
long huge walks and lots not sandals
right look we can all agree sand and
sandals are bad like jellies any kind of
not foot what is the determining factor
is like a like a woven sandal yeah or um
you know like a banana republic sure oh
yeah like super fruit yeah you have a
linen suit right exact exact we're
talking flip-flops that make the flip
flop right noise slaps very important
that you assholes that's what that's
what we're talking about all right
getting through a lot today yeah whole
gamut of topics do you want to go
through my other brief malady which is
also maybe a little more disturbing
absolutely have to do with your body
yeah it does I went to the dermatologist
recently cuz i don't know i'm wrong with
you God guess I had like that too I had
like a weird-looking mole thing and I
got it I checked and it's fine this is
pale white people very very typical have
you ever been to a dermatologist what is
mole yeah been determined okay so it's a
it's a skin doctor yeah yeah yeah so
agree when you don't have like your skin
to know but like you know you're not
susceptible to awful Sun right over here
yeah but anyway go on so I went and and
so it was fine but while I was there he
did like a full mole check and there was
a mole on bike up it wasn't an
inappropriate place but it was a place
that I couldn't personally check how do
OLX old you about it no heats he did a
formal charity side it's like you did a
full mole check well they do have that
glow body body yeah get you get but
nique my doctor like it never had that
before see is that a white person's
gotta be I mean I'm sure Asians get skin
cancer yeah but you know you have a
darker complexion yeah your body's
cooler with the Sun then then Russ or
mine yes where was the mall uh on the
back of my left thigh so your butt like
just below below it was like it between
my butt and my knee essentially on the
back nine so like really not easy to
look at sure you could not see it
without a mirror so he's like well
everything looks fine this one looks a
little weird we could I
remove it right here is that son of a
bitch off and he's like you know it's
very easy remove we use this device
actually one second I'll go get it for
you hmm and worried about that thing
that's nothing so he comes back and he's
like okay so this is called the punch oh
the clutch and we just punch out the
mole old like it's a freaking piece of
paper and I was like I'll just keep an
eye on it how does that work can you
google that oh no I'm not yeah do it do
it he that instrument I mean it looked I
was like a oh he kind of described as a
cookie cutter oh my god okay and it was
it was just really now you can't freeze
that that's not that's not using the
freezing situation you that's like sort
like not serious surgery but it would
need stitches it's a punch excision
excising incision and see no yes no
sighs I yeah yes I don't want a light
switch is I see what it is so it's
essentially imagine like a clicky pen
yeah but instead of like a pen colors
ago it grabs a late right horrifying and
comes in a circular blade that's funded
that you can probably do that yourself
okay but the second he said oh we call
it the punch I was like no I would I
would let him do it why not it's it's
scared so I have a lot of um they're
called cherry um this is maybe we're
doing TMI uh what do you they're like
little red dots yeah they're called it's
called like MBO embryos something like
that okay totally benign sharp they're
totally fine were like super white
people get them to pop up um I only have
like one really big one on my front
thigh okay like where your quad is yeah
okay so I have one that's got like a
little bigger and I was just at the
dermo no Mike hey turbo he even has an
abbreviation yeah I'm like hey you know
this thing's kind of getting like in my
way yeah it's like pretty much rests on
my phone when it's mike weir maybe the
radiation is like gross india
maybe maybe it's going like antenna
anyway so aha other guys she said no
it's not like it's not it's not gross at
all it's like a red bike Dome looks like
a ladybug yeah that pulsates named it ok
it's Beverly so justice is always like
hey get rid of Beverly I'm like I don't
know it you know I is it cuz you you say
you're bothered by it or she bothers
she's bothered by it I'm worried or
gross though she's not worried it's
gross that is completely benign later
they're totally comment say was rubbing
against it was like turning on your
phone and slightly over like it rests in
the camera sense ok i just did that to
make it oh my god ok no it actually
turns my screen on yeah um so yeah so
it's just like kind of sitting there and
i asked the derma time with it is she
said well first off it'll probably like
300 bucks cuz it's acid attack cutter
yeah because it's not a cancerous or
anything like that so I'm like all right
that sucks go on how to hear it in this
yeah and they freeze it they inject it
with like a little bit of like liquid
nitrogen or something like that and then
they just like cut it off with like a
plastic knife yep a plastic knife yeah
like she showed me the tool they use and
it looked like the kit you get with like
takeout they don't shatter it like tyra
to know so she cuts it off and then and
then it got gross and she's like and
then we just kinda we just kind of
scrape out everything else I'm like well
I don't really need you to do that for
300 bucks I don't I kind of don't need
to pay you to do yeah why cuz you're
gonna do it yourself because I'm gonna
go home and do it go for it on my own
time still a technology podcast or when
you guys sort of pivot science
technology okay yeah medical technology
yeah this is all consummated and just
talking about a plastic knife that's
technology and beyond technology India
and Beyond speaking of other things that
aren't technology we got wind of this
Banksy exhibit in England a couple weeks
ago when they were setting it up and by
now you probably know about it it's
called dismaland it's a parody on
Disneyland and you know you see like
what's going on here it just feels like
maybe the worst Banksy effort in a while
and I'm not it feels a little on the
nose yeah and a little maybe it's how
overproduced it is that it's kind of cuz
his stuff is obviously very well
produced but like it almost feels I
don't know what it is I yeah it just
feels off I can't like it's too clean I
guess it's almost like someone else
trying to be banks which let's be clear
Banksy is not necessarily it might have
started as a person but right now Banksy
is a team of people probably a team of
what do you think Justin okay so this is
basically a theme park that was put up
by banksy right yeah and it has a bunch
of what like he likes all of our pieces
inside there's a fake carousel speaker
so everything is like very dis it's a
disappointing Disneyland is like
Cinderella is like in a car or a
terrible care horse carriage crack right
well it's not just Banksy which is I'm
reading it here there's fifty eight
artists that okay okay sorry so that's
even trig Lee and a lot of like ESPO and
stuff right so there's so that's not
just so he kind of organized it yeah and
it's a and it's a gallery an outdoor
gallery right it actually looks kind of
cool if I if I were in the area I
probably good I would definitely go to
it I think maybe just sound like the
surface may be looking on the outside
looking in it just sort of feels
like like MIT Russa like it just feels
maybe a little overproduced I don't
think it's I think it's you know I
remember what he did two years ago here
in New York that was kind of fun yeah I
feel like that the Wonder Banksy is
always just stumbling upon it you know I
mean or there that surprise element of
where you know when he sold art to
random people right natural park right
that was cool because they didn't know
that they were buying a Banksy right you
know uh telephone booth pops up out of
nowhere what is this and then you find
out later it's Banksy write this yeah it
feels weird because there's probably a
press release that went out with it
right right yeah I guess I guess that's
the I I think you put the put into words
perfectly we were trying to say it's
just it just seems a little like
corporate corporate know anyway ironic
charging to let people in I think they
are see that's because I think you
tickets I don't know for sure I don't
want to say you it was probably very
expensive to put on yeah but I don't I
don't think I mean all this stuff seems
expensive oh but Fatboy Slim is playing
there so that's low paying for all right
back there we go help him pay him pay
the bills sign me up all right moving
along we want to do a segment of our
show we're going to called really bed
explain like I'm fives so as people
might know sometimes we bring explain
like I'm fives to the show and we query
each other to see if we know the answer
and I looked online today specifically
on the on the reddit explain explain
like I'm five reddit which is quite good
usually and there was kind of a lack of
good questions actually so few good
questions that I decided to be better to
list all the bad questions that i
stumbled upon so here are four bad
explain me like I'm five s that
questions that I really didn't need the
answer to write like why are you even
asking that yes cuz usually those
questions submitted or are like oh yeah
I never thought about that but yeah so
question number one why is it so
important to take a body a bullet out of
the body why is it so important to take
a bullet out of the body lead poisoning
me of I mean it's probably pretty
damaging and yeah
there are a number of reasons I'm sure
there's a very specific medical reason
but the big one is there's a bullet in
your body I weren't born with it doesn't
was it there this morning nope okay
maybe get rid of it yeah Wow explain
that like I'm five here's another one
why do dogs seem happier after haircuts
I seem happier after haircut so I do you
feel bad for a lot of dogs in the
summertime walking around in New York
yeah they just and this vest they can't
take off and then they get a haircut and
they're happier pretty clear uh this one
I like why do you have to flush some
urinals while others are automatically
time that's their different urinal as
long as erectors is seriously what the
hell is wrong with people I don't know
how do you put that under that's the
internet who flushes a urinal by the way
what only anyone do that timeout what
you don't flush not a urinal why do you
think there's a flushing handle tube you
watch you just let it sit there well it
really depends on how high the flush is
and if I'm able to kick it with my foot
ticket I never touch handles especially
you're gonna then wash your hands
immediately after that you're here yeah
washed right after that interaction
that's true but I still kick it anyway I
still do a crescent kick I kick the
toilet yeah I kick the toilet brush so
I'm not I don't completely unafraid what
you can give it the old like yeah I'm
not dirtying up my for I'm just to flush
some other dudes p you bite your peer to
flush the urinal yeah yeah you're in all
i'm talking about you a urinal i know
the difference yeah you're in no google
a fiction you know why that's disgusting
for everyone else in the world right
drains right there no no no not those
holes in it nobody the no holes are not
placed to and I pee on the cake the
first of all I'm talking about the ones
we have a hundred feet away I mean the
ones i have the sign above that says
flush the year they put that up there
because I sign my name those are little
pools at the bottom that don't
automatically green there are no pun is
gonna be without the water there's gonna
be remnants of your piece staying in the
urinals thinking it up
um yeah I guess that's a Pawnee go ahead
of this just can't be bothered with that
stuff them no well maybe with your new
yoga attitude you'll think a little bit
more flexible enough right that's true I
get it you're at a sports arena I don't
care yeah yeah if it's a trough to shy
or imagined yeah but the White House of
flushing the toilet and your though I
don't think they have yours White House
don't does he know how come nobody has
urinals installed in their house I'm
gonna do that are you you definitely
should you a totally because they're the
best what their eyes Pete standing up no
because sometimes even when you pee into
the toilet water what are we talking
about right even when you pee into the
toilet water sometimes the splash will
come over the standing of all being in a
toilet is the dumbest thing we do that
is because as men it is the dumbest
thing we did I get it but that's what
makes a bathroom smell when you guess
you're never gonna install a urinal in
your house after my toilet is freshly
cleaned yeah right yeah I get it I'm
like man I'm gonna ruin this thing right
now or do that sit down you should sit
down yeah let's start sitting down if
you put him in the house my house I'll
get a checker up well I would get a
second shower head installed in my
shower before getting a urinal though I
don't like the other side of your other
side of the show there's no space that's
not covered by water right or a double
shower what happens if you turn the
water on too hot and then there's
nowhere to escape these riots too i
guess you'd have to have a second water
main yeah yeah uh that has been a
fantasy of mine a sort of like chest to
floor I like the 10 all the way down
those are gross no what yeah as you get
dirt in there in the gross I'll clean it
okay you really you're gonna get down
there and clean I don't know either way
urinals in the back of our house when I
when I move into a house yeah okay
happening of the dream wait there was
one more explain like I'm I've will wrap
it up here why does time flows only in
one direction probably a good stoner
question ignoring the grammatical issues
I'll give you this it's the least stupid
out of all that because like guess it's
it's a little ridiculous but it's also
like stoner Iwo
yeah as I'll give them a little bit of
creditor can you guys answer it arm yeah
that's the thing like I don't
necessarily have an answer I think the
answers like it just does well time
isn't necessarily linear so you can't
say it's in one direction right I think
it's pretty linear I think time has been
traveling in one direction yeah whatever
yes about 14 billion years yeah is that
the answer that is the answer yeah but
you I mean anytime can't just go
backwards unless you travel faster than
the speed of light and then x not going
backwards you're just not traveling
through time the same way we all are you
get that here I just didn't stroke like
just like where are we great yeah would
you know yeah I get it but that's are
just interesting questionable yeah I
don't think that's a bad is not the word
how it was written that's it out it's
how off how romantical yeah why does
time flows only one direction that's a
good that's a good segment though what
what other l.i five of you guys discuss
I think we like something we did the
five six seven eight 10 right but this
that's not a stupid one why do dancers
count off five six seven eight said oh
that's a great question and it was the
answer the answer was because they
started they want to all start on one
uh-huh so they count five six seven
eight back it so they can all start at
one at the same time because the it's an
eight bar count oh all right that makes
sense no steve told me a really
interesting fact yesterday steve
guttenberg i was talking to him about
records and he said the reason why they
call them albums is because back in the
day when they were only 78 you could
only have you know two or three songs in
a 78 they were really short and so if
you wanted to buy a full record then you
would have to buy literally an album
full of 78 crazy like a bike that's
thing and that went away when you could
fit a lot more on but sorry lady then
the word album still applies to that
kind yeah yeah that's that's pretty neat
huh good look at us cuz it today hang up
the phone yeah seriously like that um
let's get
to our product hunt game of the week gee
I'm surprised you even are allowed to do
this what I mean like I get it this game
is the most popular game of the month /
summer yeah let's get to it Metal Gear
Solid V V see the video about 5 SB it's
v good marketing yeah yeah is Israeli I
yeah yeah you're so you you're where
metal gear yeah but are they on the
fifth game yes so are I mean they are in
the numbering the numbering yet the
metal gear solid right yeah it is but it
would be five and Hideo Kojima's like a
kind of obsessed with this whole V thing
it's it's complicated yeah trying to
understand the Metal Gear narrative is
like the easy answer is like well they
just want to use metal gear solid 5
because it's an easier get name to sell
right but that he's a crazy person and
like was like well you know it's v
because his code name is V and Bobo on
and it really has nothing to do with
like the events of metal gear solid four
really I mean it does because it also
takes place before it yeah yeah like I
very removed so like every metal gear
game and I and I barely scratched the
surface when it comes to comprehending
this whole narrative yeah but like every
metal gear game takes place in a
different time okay and they're all like
clones of each other to like snake is
constantly getting cloned right is that
yet also true big boss was cloned isn't
big boss snake big boss was the first
one and then and then yeah did you play
the first Metal Gear yeah I did and you
like that position one yeah I did that's
a pretty good stuff so it's I mean the
story is totally incomprehensible but
this game is quite good it's very open
worlds really good and it doesn't have
the like 45 minute long cutscenes like
make the other game such a drag you play
through yeah and you can attach a
balloon to a sheep and send it up into
the sky can do that to anybody anybody
isn't that weird why would you want to
do that to like bring them back to your
base yeah so then you have a sheep at
your base it's very weird like your blue
there's just this amazing juxtaposition
of like Espeon like stealth espionage
were serious and then it's like all
touch of balloon to a bear need to go
away you're like or like I just unlock
the ability to make a horse poop yeah
and then the horse poop makes enemies
spin out if it's on the road oh I will
it's all around weird but it's
undeniably fun it is very cool uh just
switching gears real quick to the
subreddit I wanted to call out DJ snypa
