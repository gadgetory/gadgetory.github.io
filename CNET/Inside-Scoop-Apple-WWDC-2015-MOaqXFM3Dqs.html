here with Scott sign we just finished
the apple keynote at the moscone center
in san francisco i think the biggest
news from today was the revamp of the
beets subscription music service Apple's
calling it Apple music appropriately
what do you think of what they're doing
I've played around a lot of streaming
services it sounds like what they're
offering and a lot of ways seems similar
to the head ten dollars a month but they
are offering the entire itunes music
catalog which in some ways parts of that
feel a lot deeper than what I'd seen
diving into something like Spotify it's
just different types of music and it'll
be very fitting to see if that how big
an appeal that is and people may not
have a streaming music yeah so exactly i
mean you know there's hundreds of
millions of people who have itunes
accounts but not all of those people
subscribe to to a music service this is
going to be preloaded it's going to be
on your phone so you're going to see it
all the time they're hoping that it just
makes it easy for you to say okay you
know i'll pay 10 bucks a month to get
access to the whole itunes library so
let's talk about iOS 9 iOS some was head
of Google now type flavor yeah exactly
yeah I think that they were doing a lot
of trying to incorporate a lot of the
things is like predictive and you know
trying to make series smarter that we've
already seen from google it looked like
it was trying to do that but Google is
just very very good at those types of
services and so you know how much will
be able to get there they'll beg they're
trying to improve maps they're moving
notes to look more like Evernote so I
want to show you what happens when i
switch apps I'm just gonna move over
here I thought it was interesting though
looking at the ipad a couple years now
I've been wanting I've had to be
improved and the kiddos glossing over us
say oh no news on the iPad they made a
big deal this time that the ipad will
function differently particularly stuff
for the ipad air 2 for a split-screen
multitasking and a trackpad it's a
software trackpad on the keyboard but i
feel like the dot-dot-dot is to finally
release a keyboard or the ipad that will
have this exists already the microsoft
surface and the blackberry where the
keys act as a trackpad and you could do
that and then you could do so many more
things or the ipad we believe in
technology designed for the wrist Apple
watch off like that is leading up to it
almost a relaunch in the fall because
now they're gonna be native apps and
they're going to be doing a whole new
version of the OS which is surprising in
one year but a lot of people can't get
their hands on the app
watch yet so it seems like it's finding
their sink to like coming in a couple
weeks for today and now it looks like
all the timing is gonna hit alongside
the new iphone which makes sense because
it's an iphone accessory thanks for
tuning in you guys we're signing off
