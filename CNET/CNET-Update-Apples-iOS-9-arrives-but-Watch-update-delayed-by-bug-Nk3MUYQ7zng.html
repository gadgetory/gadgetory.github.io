Apple watch software well apple says it
needs a little more time I'm Bridget
Carey this is your cnet update apple has
released a new version of the mobile
operating system iOS 9 and it gives
iPhones and iPads new features like the
ability to doodle in your notes get
transit directions and maps but only in
some cities and on newer iPads you can
multi-task with two apps open at once
the free update to iOS 9 is available to
download inside of your Settings app
Apple was supposed to also release an
operating system update to the watch on
Wednesday but Apple delay the update
because of a bug in a statement apple
says it is taking a bit longer than
expected to fix the bug and the watch
os2 will be released shortly the update
would give watch wraps more freedom to
tap into the data collected by the
sensors and yes that means watch apps
would be more useful as for iOS 9 you'll
find small improvements in battery life
with settings to help you manage which
apps are draining your power there's
also a low-power mode in case your phone
is hanging on to its last drops of juice
you'll find a news app that pulls in top
stories picked by Apple editors but you
can also set what types of stories you
want to read search is better and you
can ask Siri to pull up specific types
of photos like photos taken last week or
if you're writing about an email and you
can't finish it just yet ask Siri to
remind you about it later when you
select photos you can select several at
once by tapping and dragging your finger
across to highlight a selection it makes
the leading faster in video settings you
can choose to record at different frame
rates if you want to save space the
keyboard displays lower case letters on
the keys to now show when you don't have
the caps lock on if you're jumping
between apps there's now a back button
that takes you back to the last screen
you were looking at so you don't need to
keep pressing that home button and you
can do it Ilana image attachment sent
through an email just open the message
tap and hold the image and select markup
and reply to start drawing this looks to
be a solid update but you may want to
wait a day or two to download in case
there were any major bugs discovered and
sometimes there are you can let others
be the guinea pig first
and be sure to backup files before
downloading the upgrade in case anything
goes wrong in the installation and
there's some good news for 18t customers
still hanging on to old unlimited data
plans after all these years you won't be
slowed down now after going over five
gigs of data a month now ATT gives you
22 gigs of data to use before slowing
down your speed in high demand areas the
FCC hit AT&amp;amp;T with a hundred million
dollar fine in June for slowing down
unlimited customers to a crawl after
they used five gigs because it's not
limited if there are limits that's it
for this tech news update you can keep
up with all the latest at cnet com from
our studios in New York I'm Bridget
