to tell the fact from the fool I'm
Bridget Carey and this is your scene at
update on April Fool's Day every
technology company wants to seem fun and
clever by announcing fake news Google
tends to be the king clown with several
joke products but these fake
announcements fall flat when today's
technology is so experimental and
bizarre the real products are not too
different from the gags so to
demonstrate let's play a game of fact or
fool I'll give you a recent tech news
announcement and you'll have to guess if
it's real or an April Fool's hoax this
week at the New York Auto Show Honda
introduced the 2016 HRVs LF selfie
edition there are cameras in the visor
and - to share your selfie behind the
wheel so is it factored full well this
one is a fool but not too far from being
fact hurts rental cars have been under
fire for installing cameras inside the
navigation device Hertz installed the
cameras in case you wanted to have a
video chat with customer service do we
really need that among the many apps
being created for the upcoming Apple
watch the New York Times announced it
will have a news alert app with editors
staffed around the clock to craft
one-sentence stories for the small
screen factor fool one sentence
journalism for your wrist is a fact you
can now make Facebook pages just for
photos of your baby since baby photos
are taking over Facebook the social
network launched a new tool to put all
the photos of your precious little drill
monster in one place and people can
subscribe to follow Facebook baby
scrapbook is a fact rolling out now in
the u.s. HTC has introduced a new
wearable a smart sock it comes with GPS
pairs with both left and right feet and
has a small screen on the top as your
interface that of course makes it hard
to wash this is a fool but a fail of a
fool because smart socks in doing this
to give you feedback on your running
technique texting while walking can be
dangerous but Volvo and Japan created
airbags for smartphone users to protect
against dangerous collisions yes Volvo
is a fool but they're more foolish
products on Kickstarter for people that
run into things while texting the flick
case has a mirror
so the camera can record straight ahead
and the app lets you text while also
viewing a video feed of what's in front
of you there's a new Angry Birds
spin-off game this time the feather
flock is running a farm and they're
armed with guns you can personalize
their outfits just like in the sims I'm
sure people would love to play it but it
is a fool and for the tinder generation
rogue who has a new channel for online
dating
it's called roku rendezvous so you can
find a date that shares your same
streaming tastes it is a pool but there
was once an app called yolk that matched
you based on your Netflix profiles the
couple that streams together stays
together
that's your tech news update no foolin
from our studios in New York I'm Bridget
