towards the launch the big VR headsets
oculus rift and the HTC vive you're
going to see a lot more deaths house
built around that this is one that is
actually specifically built around that
it's the Origin PC Chronos VR built from
the ground up for virtual reality aimed
at VR enthusiasts and also VR developers
and it's also one of the most compact
systems that we've seen that will
support it using the special desktop
part so that you need to run one of
these VR headsets even though it's very
small the GPU and the RAM the storage
are all upgradable what I like most
about this custom chassis is the rubber
feet they're magnetic and they pop off
so you can set it up either horizontally
or vertically you just pop the feet off
to take them on the other side
set it down whatever fits best on your
desk
of course because its origin you get
free lifetime labor and 24/7 us-based
support that's very important you pay a
little extra for that this system starts
at $17.99
but for that you get an overclock Intel
Core i7 you get an NVIDIA GeForce 970
GPU you have to get faster video cards
you can go all the way up to a Titan X
in this guy and it's liquid cooled which
is both hard to do in a small case like
this but also very important to do
because all the parts are in there
pressed very tightly together and the
system can get very hot when it comes to
VR we ran all of the standard tests
there's a valve version and in oculus
version and the valve version we got a
fairly enthusiastic rating for VR report
in the oculus version we got the green
checkmark which means that the parts
here meet the minimum required specs for
the oculus rift on top of that it's just
a great all-around compact woman almost
a portable gaming system that is the
origin pc Chronos VR</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
