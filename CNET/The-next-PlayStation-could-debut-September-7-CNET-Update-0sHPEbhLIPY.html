September 7th Sony sent out invites to a
press event in New York City for
September 7th the invitation itself is
pretty stark there's a PlayStation logo
with a blue to Black Radiance background
below that is the phrase PlayStation
meeting underneath that is the time and
the place of the event below that info
is a color spectrum this isn't like one
of those nutty Apple invites with a cute
little clue like hey Siri give us a hint
nope so instead of trying to look for
hidden meanings in the blue Sony invites
let's tell you what we think we're going
to see CNET is pretty sure that we will
see an upgraded version of the
PlayStation 4 at this upcoming event
recently the president and CEO of Sony
Interactive confirmed Sony's working on
a new version of the PlayStation 4
it's rumored codename is the Neo which
was confirmed by Sony as well so let's
talk about the new PlayStation based on
what we've heard so far first up this
new console would not be a PlayStation 5
this new console is still a PlayStation
4 but with a vastly improved processor
and more RAM the Neo would be able to
pump out games at 4k Ultra HD and
playback 4k Ultra HD blu-ray discs since
the console would be a new version of
the PlayStation 4 the majority of
PlayStation 4 games should work fine in
the Neo Sony said the new PlayStation 4
would be more expensive than the current
version by the way the current version
of the ps4 is not going anywhere
sony plans to sell both versions as long
as it sells PlayStation fours that's it
