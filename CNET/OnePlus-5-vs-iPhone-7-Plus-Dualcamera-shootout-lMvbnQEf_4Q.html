phones have two rear cameras one that is
standard angle the other a telephoto
this gives both phones a 2 times optical
zoom and a nifty feature called portrait
mode but how do they compare
we took the dual camera twins out in the
mission here in San Francisco for an
old-fashioned camera Battle Royale even
though they have two rear cameras the
standard angle will be the one used most
images from both phones are really good
and yet each has its own character
pictures from the iPhone look more
natural and had a cooler tone images
from the oneplus had a bit more contrast
in saturation the oneplus had more
detail but suffers a bit from motion
blur the iPhone with this optical image
stabilization shot images that were
consistently sharper and InFocus so both
phones have dual cameras and use them to
simulate background blur also known as
portrait mode neither phone was perfect
but the iPhone yielded better results
especially for pictures of people's
portraits look natural and had better
fall off from in focus to out-of-focus
areas the 1+5 portraits had less
background blur and sometimes looked
patchy when it did dalish shot images
were flat though the oneplus 5 let's use
portrait mode much closer to a subject
which led to lots of nice shots of food
and inanimate object
the iPhone and 1+5 offer two times
optical zoom the 20 megapixel resolution
of the oneplus gives it the edge here
with zoomed in images looking a tad
sharper and having more detail than
those on the iPhone when shooting a
burst mode the iPhone was the energized
Bunny and kept going and going the
oneplus on the other hand stopped after
20 images and I missed important moments
when the bursts ran out both phones take
wonderful macro photos but the oneplus
has the slight edge because it's minimum
focus distance is 3 inches instead of 3
and a half on the iPhone so you can
really see the detail and that's more
you're about to eat both phones shoot
slow-motion and 4k video but I gotta
give the edge to the iPhone it can shoot
a hundred and 20 frames per second at
1080 the oneplus only 60 frames per
second and the iPhone has optical image
stabilization which takes the bounce and
shakes out of your videos it looks like
a dolly shot we took the phones into
indoor mini golf to test low-light and
hands down
the oneplus took much better low-light
pictures than the iPhone its images had
more contrast and less visible noise
at the end of the day you can see that
both phones are neck-and-neck in the
images they take but there's one more
factor to keep in mind the oneplus 5
we've done on cost three hundred and
thirty dollars less than the iPhone 7
plus so yeah there's that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
