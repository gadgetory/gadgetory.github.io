a look at the Acer Aspire s7 now if this
looks familiar or sounds familiar that's
because the s7 was one of the first
Windows 8 laptops that we saw that was
specifically built with windows 8 in
mind because it was very thin and had a
touchscreen built in it was one of our
favorites because it really had a cool
unique look especially because on the
back of the lid instead of aluminum or
plastic it was actually a big gorilla
glass panel which was kind of funky and
made a little bit lighter and was still
very sturdy even though it was glass
this new version of the s7 looks pretty
much identical the big change here is
that it has one of Intel's new
fourth-generation core i series
processors in it also known by the code
name has well when that gives you is not
so much increased performance I mean
that's fine but it gives you much better
battery life in fact in systems like the
macbook air which I would consider
pretty direct competitor to this we got
12 hours of battery life on our tests
this guy got a little bit about seven
but that's still better than the
original s Evan that we saw last year
the rest of it is made out of aluminum a
little bit of plastic the keyboard still
a bit on the shallow side i like the
large touchpad however if you're looking
for a laptop that's really going to
stand out in the crowd but still be
fairly useful and be super thin and
light if you're willing to pay a little
bit more this guy is 39 for core i5
that's what i have here the first
version we looked at was I think a core
i7 for about 16 or 17 hundred dollars
then you definitely want to take a look
at the s7 there are some other very nice
thin ultrabooks out there as well like
the sony vaio pro series and of course
any of those really do get compared to
the macbook air i love the design on
this guy i'm not sure i'd pay this much
for it but i'm glad i get to play around
it for a little while I'm the enactment
and that is the acer aspire as</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
