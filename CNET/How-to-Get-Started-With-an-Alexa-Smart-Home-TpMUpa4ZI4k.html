centered around Alexa is simple buy an
Alexa the $50 echo dot is the most
affordable option but if you rather not
spend anything at all
you can just download the free Amazon
app tap the microphone on the top right
corner and boom you have Alexa access on
your phone next decide where you want to
set up your echo device you can set it
up in your bedroom if you want to use
Alexa's alarm clock or you can set it up
in your living room to turn on your TV
just make sure you set it up in an area
where you'll get the most use out of it
now in order to use the smart
capabilities of Alexa you need a smart
home device a good starting point would
be the Belkin Wemo mini smart plug which
cost us 35 bucks plug it into your wall
socket then plug in a lamp or any device
you want to turn on and off using alexa
as you follow your device's setup
instructions be sure to choose a name
that's natural and easy to remember
Alexa will use whatever name you pick so
keep it simple something like bedroom
lamp or desk fan once all your devices
are up and running you'll need to sync
them up of Alexa in most cases you'll
just say Alexa discover new devices for
other times you may need to use the
Alexa app and punch in your login info
to get everything linked up if you've
got a lot of devices consider putting
them into groups to activate multiple
gadgets simultaneously another option is
to create a scene scenes or
pre-established settings that allow you
to group different devices to achieve
certain effects these connected lands
for example have a scene called July 4th
which turns the lights red and blue so
when I say Alexa turn on July 4th
okay it activates the scene so start
simple take your time and don't feel
like you have to automate everything in
your house at once</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
