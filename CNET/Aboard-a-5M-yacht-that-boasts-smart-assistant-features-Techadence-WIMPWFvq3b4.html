a way it'll tell you about the weather
and remind you of your upcoming
appointments but wouldn't it be even
better if instead of this black plastic
shell it came wrapped up in a luxury
multi-million pound yacht yes it would
so cast your eyes then on the Adonis an
extremely smart yacht and welcome to
techadon 78 feet the Adonis may not be
the biggest yacht in the world but what
it lacks in sheer size it makes up for
in on-board smarts the hub of those
smarts is an artificial intelligence
system called angel as well as giving
you weather updates for whatever
glorious Caribbean location you're in
presumably that's just glorious sunshine
it also allows you to order food from
the yachts kitchen made by the fancy
chef you've brought along of course as
well as control your music and even
guide you through yoga workouts in your
bedroom or even better out on deck so
you can do a very real Sun Salutation
the assistant uses facial recognition
enabled by a fleet of onboard cameras
which not only personalizes the
recommendations for whoever's around but
can also recommend new clothes for you
based on your sizes and your shopping
preferences because apparently being
style shamed by your own boat is
something that all rich people want
those onboard cameras also act as
security surveillance pinging you if it
detects anybody who shouldn't be on
board and if that's not enough of the
boat can automatically deploy a drone
for the top deck to scan the surrounding
area for bad guys of course you can also
ask the boat to use the drone take
pretty photos of the area which seems
like a better use of the equipment
but if barking orders at your own boat
isn't your thing you can interact with
it instead using the smart mirrors
they're essentially giant touchscreen
tablets which is where they're showing
you your own beautiful yacht owning face
will also show on screen any upcoming
appointments nearby points of interest
or even have it play videos for you
while you make your hair even more
immaculate dude honest was shown off at
this year's CES in Las Vegas and while
it's still in a bit of a concept form
manufacturer fury on did tell us that if
this goes on sale you can probably
expect it to be around a five million
pound bar and if five million is a
little bit too rich then you could just
get yourself in a lexer and put it on a
rowing boats and roll yourself into the
Montecarlo Bay hoping that you could
strike it big on the roulette tables so
what do you think of the Adonis is five
million pounds for essentially a
glorified water-going Hamazon Alexa a
little bit too much do let us know your
