taking a look at the soiree p8 it's
always latest affordable flagship phone
that squashes a full HD display and a
good camera into a solid skinny metal
body the design is certainly the
headline feature of this phone come on
it's extremely slim and it's made
entirely from metal with a one-piece
design now that helps make the p8 feel
very secure when you're holding it in
one hand not to mention it makes it feel
a whole lot more premium than a lot of
Huawei's other phones it's quite
attractive to look at - although doesn't
quite have the same luxury appeal as the
curve in galaxy s6 5.2 inch screen has a
full HD resolution which makes techsan
icons look crisp and it has good colors
- it's a great screen for multimedia and
is certainly among the best displays
available in the mid price range turning
on the latest Android lollipop software
but Huawei has customized it so heavily
you really can't tell Huawei has changed
everything from the color schemes and
the fonts to the app icons as well but
the biggest change is that there's no
app tray instead all your apps are
scattered among multiple home screens
amongst your widgets I don't like this
as it's very easy for it to become quite
cluttered a 13 megapixel camera sits on
the back of the phone which I found
capable of taking some really good
looking shots down low range and colors
are both nicely balanced although there
is a lack of detail when you zoom in the
Facebook and Instagram snaps though it's
more than fine it also has a cool night
mode for taking shots of light trails in
the dark the p8 delivers a solid
all-round experience with a good camera
and a vibrant display all wrapped up in
an attractive metal body and it doesn't
charge the air for it either if you've
been eyeing up the latest crop of
flagship phones but can't quite sum up
the high prices the p8 is a much more
affordable option that doesn't force you
to compromise on features or performance
