two mins the 44 show on cnet TV I'm Jeff
Bakalar I'm Wilson tang I'm Justin you
this is the show where we're trapped in
a queue but yes we are and we actually
are traffic oh my god that's my life
yeah and to complement our cube is
sphere himself I am the gut man you're
gonna geometry on today's show scream is
padded you could like bang your head
against the wall it's an asylum that's
what it does scream would I hear it
outside yes they will actually this is
not one of those sound proofing is
actually if we do happen to bang our
heads against the wall we're protected
yeah we can't sue CBS that's why it's
here thanks for coming in man it's been
a been a little bit right since before
just before I see ya how about that you
running for president again anytime soon
uh 20 16 2016 alright well you can get
in the slate of people go clear out this
time yeah let's let the chips fall where
they may oh you know it's pretty crazy
it is pretty crazy right now i think you
mean between rival and yeah i think you
got a better chance than Romney or
Santorum over here man sounds good to me
over the town i would definitely sphere
26 is the regular man candidate were you
really i can ever lay my pitch so you're
independent yeah i redshirted that you
ran an independent party or yours and i
have people i had one delegate its
democratic convention oh no way oh don't
be like symbolically all change their
vote at the very end like do whatever
they want Oh pound I think that for the
first vote which hasn't happened in ages
they have to stay with their assigned
mmm things but if for some reason was
close then it's a free-for-all oh wow I
didn't know that but it you know that
hasn't happened in like 50 years all
right did you have a slogan for your
campaign was it like that the volume is
too damn high detective years I was the
regular guy was there to represent like
the average Joe yeah the average every
man de proletariat the sphere you're the
original ones around
so I was you were i was actually a
registered communist oh really anyone
I'm documenting all I mean not only that
but I am NOT surprised John McCrae a
girlfriend and you and what that turned
you into a commie honesty was it was
Russian she was a guy how did this
happen because she had you know weird
I'll pet parents and stuff yeah oky
hands but that a neighbor communist and
somehow this resulted in you becoming a
con you know I don't guys do what they
ought yeah we all got it oh you gotta do
what you guys he's it it for other
reasons hungry hungry can't blame but
here later on tonight much you know ten
years later I had this girlfriend who
was also a different girlfriend it was a
communist yeah and she was a junior high
school teacher yeah and she was
indoctrinating her students no oh you
did it to separate communist yeah so r
years was that because you are already
exchanged you and look they don't shave
yeah anything oh hello what are you what
are we talking about okay all right this
is we i mean three gato we I don't know
what happened three minutes into the
show I did not expect us to be where we
currently are gonna lie where did you
switch parties kid eight different
people is that pretty much he's a
flip-flopper that's what you are she had
a beard look I'm good communist your
damn flip-flopper alright Steve you
wanted to talk about watches cuz you
talk about why Jesus I heard you talking
about watches and I was shocked didn't
you guys yeah don't worry we're watches
and I'm think but I don't wear a watch i
mean i never wore watch because I well I
almost never did cuz I you used to use a
pocket watch right because you hated it
haven't having it on my wrist right I'm
the same way I just don't like having
something on my wrist I don't wear rings
I'm wet I'm Mariana but wedding ring no
I wanna be incumbent on any accessories
at all put you got glasses on readiness
I know I don't think that's my choice
yeah what about the context I used to I
told you but not even worse used to make
contact what in your laboratory
then I'm a contact I what I am I was a
contact lens technician I used to crime
okay okay not in like your basement this
is a this is a profession would he get
what you may be back should cry to
manufacture I handmade because in those
days you made them by hand hit well and
they were gonna leave Polly with a glass
and they were actually glad I asked no
they were realistic I'm so blown away
something every time he's on the show
why is K so it goes from me like I guess
the reason I'm like even the finger
myself is even remotely plausible yeah I
can be made of glass is that like you go
from my communist do like you and then
you make it contact right you're a
projection is ran for president yeah
your life is a lot of interesting this
is why we have Steve on yeah because
he's an amazing wealth of just random
nonsense but it doesn't look for this
incredibly bizarre man yeah who had this
thing in the 60s of me inventing contact
lenses that change the color of your
eyes okay other people had been thats
nice but he was like one of the first
people to do that to do that and he you
know we had to make plastic and grind it
into these things sure it was really
amazing it sounds amazing i thought like
machines did that like or now they be
the guy that presses the button or what
no no I was grinding their finding them
in polishing yeah duh laughter ringing
off try you so these guys talking about
watches and the reason is because yes it
gotta be you always hoggin I try to it's
Friday sidetrack Guttenberg you mix when
you have a little bit of friday and you
sprinkle Steve in it it's all good my
mind laughs someone needs to make a
graph of our conversation all the
changes yet it it's great so we're
talking about how on you know a lot I
would shock that you guys are you right
just because as soon as I could I you
know I use my well you don't wear
watches now but would you if it could do
more than tell time like we were talking
about smartwatches yesterday tracking
your biometrics and um you know I don't
know your heart is knee tracking I don't
know
you have good night your metrics don't
need track well see what the government
tracking years that would yeah I don't
really want me to I turn off my phone a
lot of the time here you do huh you know
not sure I'm on board with that what do
you have to hide I don't I mean not to
not to follow not to relate you to my
father sweet Lou but he's got this thing
where he turns his phone on my mom to me
hmm that defeats the purpose of having a
phone i think right people trying to get
in touch with you unless you just want
to want to be touched i understand that
but you realize if it's an emergency
yeah my mom we can wait going on but
they'd have it outside of her room where
she right which doesn't make sense
either because you can't hear it anyway
yeah I I I do that you know it in one of
the seasons of mad men I'm goes to
California yeah and when he's in
California they didn't have cellphones
and people just didn't call each other
that much they were in New York he's in
calif way they don't and but nothing got
done I mean nothing gets done now but at
least we don't have an excuse now all
work was done in pay phones exactly I
like that idea that he's there and
they're here and you just completely add
a touch like yoga you know i'll let you
know how it's going when he feels like
right for emergencies great yeah ever
see someone who's leading a pay phone
yeah these days yeah you ever just like
what a great thing wonder what's going
on yeah wonder what happened yeah maybe
they're uh no i mean they they none of
them look like reputable you know like
when you what will see doing good yeah
it just like girl what are you doing sir
what do you need to pay phone well i
can't imagine you like every like if you
run a life-and-death situation i can't
imagine you ever picking up a phone just
cuz like you're so terms yeah like
they're drunk well no life and death and
probably pick it up I don't really ask
to borrow somebody else's before you has
anyone ever come to you and ask you use
your mobile phone yes never now look you
don't have a bad thing I'll just
incredibly I just run the risk of
someone grabbing in a ring on you know
like you get a position where you like
our time I'm gonna see if I could have
to take off right I will trip you if you
try to run away
it's something that and Steve's like I
lend it out all the time I never have
but I always wondered if someone asked
me if I would do it now you're telling
me that's enough smart thing to do well
it's just a very personal item that is
very portable you know was in distress
and like hey I need to account I'm sorry
but you stand over there let me make the
call for you do you have to call i will
try will be the do you know the
middleman my phones being so expensive
these days it's not like a you know 50
dolla burner phone yeah it's not asking
for you know a cigarette there's
actually brings up something I was gonna
win veil okay this is a show of
unveiling ooh exciting yeah so I may be
ready it may be ready for for an iphone
no Steve the gut man with an iphone ask
a little pressure partially because of
the reviewing and stuff that if I had a
phone that some things need apps right
now now you know that once the iphone
gets turned on you can't turn it off
there's no way to turn it off so if
you're into that whole feature you might
not have anything I think you now
forgive me and we bring this up every
now and then we know your eyesight isn't
the price I'm concerned about I'm
concerned about that too how are you
gonna come with a damn thing no I don't
make it too small screen it's a one-year
Taylor I uh is it a bigger right they
can make the yeah there's a big high
contrast mode and some accessory let's
watch Steve look how close you are to
make these things smaller I mean I can't
even eager no there should be here's a
holiday this accessibility more you can
zoom into icons and stuff this is really
good for blind people like there's a
little tete it'll tell you what your
tapping on okay like a voiceover fine
that's very nice I know OSX does that I
think that I didn't okay you should I
think you'll be all right you might only
be able to fit you know two apps on a
screen that's how many apps do I need if
as many as your little heart desires sir
there's a bunch of music at a nap you're
not you can I do that thing that does
like um real-time analysis of like you
know what are they closer an RTA aren't
you like a thing of like it displays the
frequency researcher right the manual
I think that's all you need noise
pressure low you know there are apps
like they're all right yeah you'll
you'll dig that oh I'll be this I'm
excited the milk synthesizer that I'd
blogged about a couple right I like
making music uh-huh his garage band for
the iphone I'm sorry if you want to
write a song to be addicted so when's
the big day at cuz I cannot wait to see
this think well you're a headphone
editor would you be using the iphone as
a music player because I think it sounds
pretty good that sounds as good as my
ipod class mm-hmm that's yet to be
deterred I've seen comments where they
use a slightly lower low quality DAC
right like a digital analog converter
but um I mean it did unless you're I
feel like unless you're running what
white noise and you've got like a
spectrum analyzer going comparing the
frequency responses like it you you
couldn't tell I'm about to find we're
all gonna find out yeah yeah speaking of
headphones though you sent us an email
with a couple headphones that you wanted
to talk yeah the noise I I'm gonna be an
investigative reporter hmm we've seen it
oh really honey don't worry what are you
investigating I'm like I was gonna say
I'm a cub reporter I'm less the outside
of a cub I'm a gumshoe you're a gumshoe
yeah because I'm going to compare the
most famous noise cancelling headphone
the bows yeah to a bunch of in ear
headphones okay so here's the bose we
have am on screen right now these are
the quietcomfort 15 s right um these are
the ones that you see everybody wearing
on the airplane and they're actually
they're active they're having battery
power and then take out the middle
battery known sound okay alright so
David chronometers yeah and I went on
the subway yesterday and I want on buses
yesterday and compared that just the
noise can't I wasn't listening to music
on right compared to three different in
ear headphones that Justin's going to
show you but a West tone okay yes five
which is a custom molded in ear he's
always on the orange one okay and those
aren't okay and then the one in the
center or these these are velodyne sort
of universal fit one okay and then the
one on the left is the etymotic in here
now the etymotic has a really big deep
flange you have to stick it in your ear
really bad those
like they go pretty deep dled not super
comfortable I say it looks like it's up
against your ear drum like that's what
yeah yeah you're pretty far in there for
it but they still look a little too in
truth they're most comfortable have yeah
I you can buy d like when I really if I
ripped it out too quick something else
would go my brain but anyway they did
the the aura tone yeah I'm sorry the
etymotic on the on the left yeah and the
West tone on the right word had pretty
much equal noise isolating ability as
the bows okay and they don't have
batteries and they also sound a lot
better right so that's sort of what this
piece is going to be about alright cool
I'm excited to read that so yeah it's
interesting though is that listening to
these headphones in a quiet room hmm
they sound completely different than
they do on the subway or bus or out in
the world what do you mean by that
because there's so much noise out there
even noise canceling or noise isolate
there's a lot of noise it gets through
anyway sure so that noise is masking
certain parts of the music because it's
louder than so are you saying like
should you use noise cancelling in a
quiet you know room which you turn yeah
you definitely turn it off okay we were
talking about this before the show and I
think the most crucial thing for noise
cancellation isn't I mean the biggest
difference between the earbuds in the
over years obviously is like the seal
right and that's why with the custom
here but you have a perfect seal kiss
bowl to your ears but you could also
achieve a really good fit with a proper
seal on a headphone it's just a matter
of finding the right size and the type
of flan it's our best read stuff i
struggle with like these ear tips right
here on the left hand side the conical
shaped ones those are a little bit
uncomfortable right I prefer the foam
ones because you could squeeze them put
them in your ear and then it'll expand
to shake your eardrum exactly it's just
a matter of like playing around what's
with the sizes right Ariel so but anyway
so what I learned is is that the Bose is
what it's cracked up to be it really
does noise cancelling although I that
term kind of bugs me because it's like
canceling noise it's reducing right
noise reduction cancelling applies if
the noise is completely gone right right
was canceled its misinformation and it
comes with sacrifice and all
yes yes doesn't and and the pose was
definitely not as good sounding right is
the is the animatic we have mentioned
this before was anybody like spotting
you while you're walking around the
street like these noise-cancelling
headphones I'm gonna get jumped well no
I mean like a which is I might hear the
box that's coming yeah like or the car
that's about to hit you there anything
it's dangerous I survived he did this to
fight another day that really has an
issue like they've been numerous
articles written especially living in
New York City walking around the street
with noise canceling headphones in that
seat is it is kind of freaky I'm walking
around was mostly on Manhattan is the
has the most pedestrian vehicle
accidents in the in the country and
where did that pedestrian bicycle
accident I'm sure he's all gotta be
there really afraid of getting hit by by
cuz there's one know why cuz you know
you're not gonna die in there you're
just gonna get really hurt he's just
gonna not gonna hear it yeah yeah and
when I look in their direction they
think I can see them but I can't well
some of them right because and you know
well some of them are big a holes
because they go again like the wrong way
with traffic you know like I have one
guy coming I'm looking down till the
food delivery and happens mostly one-way
streets right so I'm looking down the
way cars are supposed to going up
there's not a car coming and I step on
and then one of these a-holes comes out
from the wrong way yells at you and he's
like what you I'm like you know drive
down a sewer share when you're five
years old I'm sure somebody told you to
look both ways not just into the way
that traffic rides right oh no you're
right yeah I even look both ways getting
back to him he's wrong and I'm right
enough for the cyclist hey oh it's like
this I people get killed by cars every
single day zero a lot alright so with
the noise cancelling stuff I feel like
if you're walking around maybe the bows
over yours will be better cuz those only
cancel out the lower frequencies right
like you got you'll hear people talking
to you are you can hear but no it's
pretty pretty isolated no I wouldn't be
walking around man yeah I I walk around
with my custom here abouts do I have the
ue 18s from ultimate ears I can't hear
anything oh I just take one out if I'm
walking around oh how could you do that
to yourself yeah that's so awkward
listening to music in one year I hate
that I don't want to get creamed I
understand but it's worth it sir please
make a stereo like single your buds
though that you can we watch
never play around with yeah what is the
purpose of that because they're you want
oh I don't know that it's scary well it
takes or two channels and puts it in 20
years no no yeah get some I am Otto and
welcoming years though yeah what is the
application of that I think it's for
musicians okay um what else do you got
in your little chicken scratch oh you
know they were what's his name greg did
a post on Sandoval yeah okay about the
Paul McCartney pulling his music off
Spotify yeah lot of bands are doing this
actually yeah cuz they're getting a
couple cents like every 10 couple cents
like fractions productions of days
that's sounds play so so we have to say
about Paul so well he just said the pole
was doing it and you know but I'm just
amazed that people get so bent out of
shape about this yeah like how dare he
you know I have a right to her to hear
anybody's music on Spotify right or
something it's like well it's his music
doesn't really want to participate yeah
you know you don't have a right to it of
course yeah but it just brings this out
in people that you know I don't know
maybe it's cuz like we we ourselves or
content creators like I don't see
anything wrong with that but like I do
hear that from people who don't make
right means media yeah well it's being
promoted that we're excuses it's more I
might buy it right but you know somebody
gave me a great line a couple of months
ago they said buying music paying for
music is a purely voluntary act it is
and most people like eighty or ninety
percent of people don't I I don't know
how can you say this baby's day but we
don't know that for sure I know have you
guys on recording saying that you guys
don't buying you right I've rented okay
you rented a room the internet tomorrow
tomorrow I'm gonna give it that
understanding it and alone ya know I
think a lot of to look at itunes man I
dude skills it what is no recorded way
to tell who's downloading there's no
looking no way to know there's no way to
know so we got to think the best and
give humanity the benefit of the doubt
wow look at Jesse
the saying that i know people I I know
out of my friends I would say the
majority of my friends dubai music they
do you are so full why would I make that
up what do I have to gain by making that
I believe yeah yeah you're respectful
friend but on the other hand Paul was
premiering his new record last night
yeah he did a live concert at Capitol
Records in LA yeah it's he's got to give
it up you think he's dead ya can't sing
yeah really you don't think he could see
no he can't say I didn't he had a new
record but like 23 years ago right like
that was it was different the different
he doesn't even write the tune yeah
these are all Americans classic style
he's at that age where he's just like we
doing out of ideas he's kind of he's she
noted you to the John Lennon song book
before he ran out it was Ringo song
written up obviously Paul's from your
generation yes right you're younger than
him right young so you asked us earlier
I think of an artist that would maybe
try to call this kind of crap when we
turn your age yes arf arf arf are in a
few well yeah I'd say you're about twice
our age wise give or take yeah uh yeah I
don't know wouldn't I be Justin Bieber
new come on she's not gonna be around
much longer what's that she was like
everybody is hating Lana Del Rey I
wanted to bring this up you Steve so
Lana Del Rey is a singer-songwriter she
was on SNL and got reamed for it right
afterward because apparently her
performance wasn't very wise idea but I
think she's okay yeah okay so which she
got reamed because of her bed perform is
it one of those were saying that she's
won it was one of the worst performances
it wasn't lip synced it was just very
dry and unexcited well does her music
suck or how the music on that it's kind
of got like a 20 like Kate Bush is like
oh my god you know also ragan are just
because like she's changed her sound she
went for like a kind of a poppy thing
into like a raspy you know more sultry
kind of a sound and then she's like
manufactured and like that but that's
the point for all right right oh yeah I
mean yeah like when Lady Gaga whips out
like a virgin mobile phone that right
because she's like oh I love this
oh because she pay two million dollars
to do no yeah I mean yeah and don't
forget that lana del right i think is
the least of SNL's music issues right I
move what other what is what is actually
this talk about being old it's not the
show's not very good oh they had like
kesha perform on SNL and I just Anders
very nice another picking on her yeah
exactly that's what I'm saying music
popular music today is just god-awful
and you're pointing a girl you pointed
the finger eyes this person we don't
need to play with Matt but anyway but
pick people that you like yeah I'm
trying to fool who would be in Paul's
patient no nothing will be impossible
what doing what you think no no not even
that that you would be listening to
their music over the over the coming
decades yeah if these people would
continue to be you know making music
that you would care about in 10 years in
20 years and 30 years and four years
that's cool among the people you listen
to could you imagine I don't know you're
not like grunge doesn't really work
would you keep your 92 yeah I'm just
saying like water that kind of uh is 20
years old doesn't work necessarily when
you're like 60 so I don't know about
that cuz Steve looking pretty heavy
stuff man but someone you may forming
the same thing what sleeveless is the
pretty heavy stuff still he's still very
much into that every also feel like a
lot of music now has a throwback vibe
and they're trying to replicate bands
that they were inspired from whereas
with Paul McCartney he was a original
creator yeah so maybe that's why they
don't have the legs I don't know Steve I
mean I don't like i said i don't think
music like from these pop artists will
withstand the test of time I don't think
anyone's gonna be listening to justin
bieber in 20 years and being like off
remember the good old days yeah
something is gonna happen seriously I
gotta take something that there's some
people like loudon wainwright he's a
folk singer yeah I've been listening to
him since the 70s yeah and he really his
songs are very personal mm-hmm and it's
like we're aging together it's like
we're on this parallel path so as he
brings out her new record and he's
talking about new things in his life
it's really kind of it's a nice thing to
have listened to someone that long yeah
that's pretty cool you know they're
relevant that's cool what I think is
pretty telling is a you know like
there's there's sixties radio stations
there's seven
these radio stations there's a tease
uses those nineties radio stations
nothing in two thousand you would never
ever see like a 02 thousands radio
station like the nineties radio stations
popped up literally when the millennium
change yeah but I don't think that'll
ever happen they just like I musics that
mare interesting it's an interesting uh
observation I mean could like you look
in itunes you don't ever see like a 2000
watts yeah and we know how you love that
and there's no all there's no lighting
is the player glasses from the 70s 80s
90s and you know everything that came at
the situation yeah right you know us
2012 now like the music is I was a music
definitely has changed pop music anyways
it's still changed from you know night
2009 22 2012 so like there's definitely
a vibe change with a music but it's
still not good is more fragmented it
gets me and more is less of like a thing
that's happening at a given time and a
lot of different things absolutely none
of them were big enough except for Dell
to gain any momentum I agree i'm saying
a delay is a good example I'm sorry
Adele the word that don't mean this I
always just mispronounced it Steve
literally just said yeah right yeah
sorry but it's okay at least you didn't
say grunge again that's you know Adele
is very good did she uh she just got
like surgery on her throat too yeah
really yeah i think some singers have
like new voice module issues and stuff
like that she happens to be very good
corn corn no not one yeah Charles not
popular now no no because it's never
like never was I don't know why the
Chairman's beast man i'm actually
getting kind of depressed right now I
remember after when Michael Jackson died
I was talking my mom about her history
with him and she was saying that they
grew up together it was really nice to
see him progress from yeah being enjoyed
by two solo stuff there around the same
age um I can't think of an artist that I
grew up with like that you know the
Berlin oh my god think of one yeah this
is gonna sense to I mean like sting with
you know I grew up listening some of the
police yeah
then he did his own thing and then he's
like back with them now that's a
terrible that's if that's the best I've
got sting but I do I mean the police is
awesome these are awesome i love you
guys heard that band the magnetic field
yeah like so magnetic fields is going
out with another album right now and
that's a band that i grew up with low
middle school high school I just don't
know if they're gonna be lasting long
enough to I think he will Steve merit
right right i thank you for stephen
malkmus um with payment okay that's a
possibility sonic use for advance cuz
bands come freaking sure sure individual
artists look at ok a lil camper like red
hot chili peppers yeah been for 30 years
now you know they've been doing it
that's an exception you know like there
except you know bands like even uh even
bad religion's 30 years old now right
they really key ways up Sonic Youth
broke up on a Keith problem shows that
REM is done never was never big fan REM
uh yeah like just said green day green
day's been a band there for well over 20
okay so maybe some of those guys well I
think Green Day has daddy for your I
think they're slowly becoming like a
sort of situation right you know like
the who their Broadway show they're sort
of like rock opera sort of thing I think
that's what they're for where they're
falling in yeah so that's a few yeah
Pearl Jam's an obe in a band for a while
now don't hate that they so i don't
really like Pearl Jam I'll be the first
I like like three songs are there not a
big Pearl Jam fan yeah you know what
about you you know I protein yeah you
don't think the kid 20 you think the
garden sing that's like that's
ultimately question do you like them I
don't like his warning yeah any better
just doesn't I don't really do it for me
uh no chairman brings up a good point a
lot of hip hop artists are also
reinventing themselves like jay-z I grew
up with common they say in the chat how
long as jay-z been doing it been around
since like the early nineties okay
retired like four times and come out all
right album he's been progressing so
that's someone I found he vigil members
of wu-tang have their own albums now are
going back to jay-z like he has adjusted
it sound like every time he comes out
yeah actually you know the I hope he
forgot about this Madonna still around
i'm still the kana two point oh right
like six point own it done
what the hell's going on with her with
their new stuff but anyway musician I
mean you see an artist was just a
celebrity I think she's just sticker
there she's just there and we have to
love it or hate it she's just there at
the rocky mountain yeah I'm not we're
not gonna take a break today cuz we only
have a little thing let's get into
austin calls from the public time to
show the love 86 404 cnet found out the
hard way that we could probably talk
about music for 14 hours that's not
gonna do that though instead we got a
call for Steve let's look this is we're
gonna laugh a little at this hey guys
what's up this is a Des Moines from
Shannon set a quick question for the gut
man since you're going to be on today
I'm in Tahoe and then you guys hear any
ideas i'm looking for a pretty hard to
find CD from one of my favorite bands um
12 hour early cities okay i'll see it
come up on ebay occasionally but i'm
pretty sure those are legs and not the
actual CD it was a pretty limited run
yeah my local record shop near des
moines they recommended discogs.com i
don't have a lot of luck there so i just
wanted to see if you get any other ideas
any places to look online hard to find
yeah yeah thanks a lot was a show dude
don't be embarrassing definitely
starting up there's and call back and
let us know yeah call back and let us
know I mean I know he's probably just
fishing for a resource especially if
you're looking for a CD that might be a
little bit harder to track down I feel
like yeah you can need to get a record
for it you know but the thing is a great
place on st. marks place in the city
called the rocket scientists yes in
music isn't Rockets are right and that
the guy that owns that shop knows every
night so he should align in Oklahoma
kool Moe I would also recommend going on
message boards online it's not around
anymore but there used to be this site
called viva la vinyl yes and it was a
record trading site has sands which go
online that was more like a punk
resource but I'm sure there are other
message boards online for that
particular job and a lot of people do
this to getting rid of like you know all
media is going digital arm check ebay
like seriously like a lot of people
that's what he said he said he found a
lot of uh counter for
counterfeit bootleg ones a lot of people
put up with books I know that you buy
like uh you know people are dumping
their books I westerly 20 buck Amir PHS
their respect to this guy for actually
trying to track down a physical copy
Irish online to buy music and I'm
curious I want to know what it is he's
part of the one percent it sounds like
chat rooms recommending discogs he did
mention that I've never used that
resource I'm gonna check that out though
oh this is kenny g it's not Kenny G like
his stuff would be hard to track down
he's around still just call me oh my god
Gary video yeah maybe can you change the
answer to that question that's why you
didn't say we were no other Kenny G has
never been the answer to anything except
what are we gonna play in this dentist's
office what is the worst yeah that's it
the only answer is yes the one they
pointed to the drilling sounds good Oh
garrison by comparison Union yeah uh
here's someone talking about drilling
please I preferred really thank you the
PlayStation Vita is coming out the 22nd
here is someone talking about lack of
commercials hey guys this is South
Dakota from Jason hey I was just
wondering if Sony's forgot about the
upcoming PS vita launch because the
sides at taco bell at I am seeing
absolutely no marketing on it um and not
even a Super Bowl ad which blew my mind
so just wondering what you guys have
thoughts are about the launch and what
to expect because I'm seeing nothing and
then also thanks adjusting for the
recommendation on the Porta pros I just
ordered my new headphones thanks yeah
right nice job port approaches came out
our cost just came out with the porter
pro Katie sees that's the updated
version that has a microphone on the
others require but look brush things
when right now right now he's rocking a
model then he's a retro you can barely
even see them on you great night and
comfy they look great on you but they
sound just like I'm not wearing
headphones I feel like I'm just hearing
you without any how so he's talked about
the Vita so steve is a new portable
gaming system from sony and everyone's
like I know it's right up your alley
everyone's I was a little surprised that
they didn't have a Super Bowl ad they
missed the US holiday release of time
window they didn't come out with
anything over sweetie they forgot the
guy suggested they may have
pretty sure that company didn't just
forget about it a lot going on they do
have a lot going on well the amazing
spider-man's coming out another between
the cushion yes like loose change well I
the the CEO uh the new CEO of sony you
know seem like everything's on the
chopping board and you know I people
been you know harping on the vita i'm
pretty sure it's still going to come out
but it's really gonna come out Wilson
yeah I mean it's gonna come out but
whether it has a long life that's a no
that's that's up near it's going to get
a good review I'm telling you that right
now I know it's a embargo till Monday
don't I love the tape Sony was that
bring back the trinitron ooh yeah the
brand or this the actual yeah the brand
TV you remember that oh yeah I had one
growing up in my my house yeah there's
nobody else there was no number two I
may own the TV that was it no go with
the blue green and red write the log on
and they are a hundred pounds it was
terrible they always had that silver
grill on the side I'm throw golf balls
at it dented up real nice Phil yeah well
I I feel like Sony's biggest problem is
like you walk into a store you see the
bravia tv right next to the samsung TV
you wonder why the bravi cost 300
dollars more when it looks exactly the
same as the samsung TV mm that's just
fundamentally samsung it's got like a
nice silver bezel or something like that
but yeah that's it the playing the game
of uh you know pricing things higher
than they should be right might not be
around forever what's up just really
quick um so Shannon in the chat room was
the one who called about the CD that
he's known for and he said that the
album is by something corporate reading
some rank or that is not a difficult to
find just call up the record label I'm
sure they'll send you when it's still in
print it's not like it's a rare show the
coincidence here is remarkable I was not
only really reason a wedding last week
and that something corporate sit there
these they're like a piano rock band
they're pretty good I met someone who
works with them two weeks ago to wedding
so I'm gonna get in touch with this
person yeah where did it dude as far as
so amazing and she did the girl that
knows the band got the groom got the
what bride and groom I signed poster
grab something corporate hmm which was
very ironic
because we're in the queue yes the cube
that's all the kids today I did
curiosity what was the last time any of
you guys actually stepped inside of like
a real record store like a music store
no I look him yesterday for sure jayna I
know you there's a bunch of them on st.
marks next to my house that I go I you
sugar generation records a lot down on
oh yeah where the hell's that in like
the West Village leaker around there is
a place out in ford's new jersey called
vintage flower city you ever hear a
vintage vinyl in Jersey no but I go to
Princeton record exchange ok gimme
greater good too I like gimme gimme
there's a lot of them also are and
you'll just thought of a few more bands
and that's something like in New York
like that Mike I'm wondering like Middle
America tark whether there's actually
nothing left I don't know proudly well
you know when you find outside like a
Best Buy know when you find out about
all those record stores on record store
day yeah it's right because they just
come out of the woodwork and they're all
over the Internet yep because if you go
to those record stores you buy stuff I
have special records for day things that
I'm psyched about that day because
that's the day that mastodons and feist
are covering each other song and then
i'll be on that's gonna be really might
be around fight i can imagine is being
maybe have for sure she's don't what
were the other bands you were saying
let's say like I think like the older
folk rock bands like uh I don't maybe
not folk but like yo la tengo for
example code enter levitra no yes but it
just made just regular rock you think
the spill is definitely gonna be around
making music yeah sure like the living
like a Radiohead sort of thing radio and
for sure we'll call Shelby oh yeah yeah
it'll be interesting to think about it
all right cool it's being of retro yeah
I did win little other plugs she did a
blog about this guy Dominic odd bird he
makes old suitcases into boom box of the
high school and he's things are called
boom cases any only he prefers to do
with really old suitcases from the 30s
and 40s because they're made out of wood
okay I knew yeah and he come everyone is
like he has to make them one at a time
and design basically fine speakers it
will fit in this case they look awesome
they look really cool they're entirely
handmade very if you're listening it's a
amazing very unique design like almost
like wood is that real what is its real
wood yeah some of them are covered I
wish let's go say I wish they had like
the old uh you know
of stamps like the passport stamps you
know where they've been where that's
been i love that whole DIY aspect i
blogged about a similar thing where it
was a seller on etsy like handmade
marketplace online it was a seller who
would take old radios from the 30s and
convert them into stereos with a 3.5 you
could just plug into any audio summers
really go out like i like seeing stuff
like this rather than new brands trying
to make it look like old stuff I
appreciate that it actually builds each
one each one is unique it's not like you
a lot like that one a lot of money right
sorry that's they start at three hundred
dollars okay it's not awful but you're
the only one that would have one that's
true remember each piece is unique make
sure you read steve's blog on scene at
the audio filia and follow me on twitter
