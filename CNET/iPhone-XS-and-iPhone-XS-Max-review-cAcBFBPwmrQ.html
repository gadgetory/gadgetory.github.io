the design of the iPhone this year
things are pretty much all iPhone tens
and that's a thing Apple has blown up
the entire line to become iPhone tens
and though there's an iPhone 10
explosion that's happened between the
iPhone 10s the iPhone 10s Max and the
upcoming iPhone 10 are so what do you do
how do you make a decision here
well Eklund 10r doesn't come out until
late October but I've been using the
iPhone 10s and the 10s Macs and I can at
least tell you how those work now one of
the biggest features in the 10s and the
10s max is the camera
in fact we shot this intro on it so
what's changed in cameras this year well
for portraits front and rear Apple has a
way to finally adjust portrait effects
or bokeh inside both modes so it's
supposed to not just create better
looking portraits but also you can
adjust them it looks good I still think
there are some things that look a little
bit fuzzy about it
there's also added Smart HD arm what
that is is basically a way that HDR
photos can have a greater range and
still look crisp and I found that a lot
of my photos when taking your really
bright light versus the iPhone 10 have a
lot more detail in those bright light
areas without looking as blown out and
it also helps at the the speed is better
in the image single-processor so that
the photos do end up looking sharper
with a little less blur Apple is also
claiming lower light photography with
higher quality and so far that's held up
the competition is really fierce when it
comes to phones so stay tuned for a
really deep comparison to find out which
one is now the best
yes Apple put new processors on these
phones the a12 Bionic which sounds
dramatic and is supposed to offer
advances especially in machine learning
and AI and augmented reality these are
future technologies built for the stuff
to come but you may not necessarily need
all that stuff right now and phones are
already really fast in fact last year's
iPhone 10 and the iPhone 8 had a really
nice jump in speed so far the a12 is not
that dramatic a speed leap in everyday
uses but it's still a little early to
tell so stay tuned the biggest leaps
could come in those future technologies
that could play out in apps down the
road these phones also have a few more
features that could be of interest and
come into play for you one is that these
phones support dual sim in addition to
gigabit LTE now dual SIM card support
won't come to later this year you're one
of them will be an e sim and one of them
will be a physical sim but that could
matter if you're traveling also these
phones are supposed to charge faster
using wireless qi chargers now stay
tuned for more testing on that these
phones also have better speakers so I
noticed that when you're playing music
on them or movies it definitely sounds
crisper stereo sound sounds a little bit
better these phones also have added
water resistance and dust resistance
ip68
now the real difference there is two
meters for 30 minutes versus last year's
one meter which really only comes into
play if you've dropped your phones into
a really deep pool in case you've never
used an iPhone 10 before all of these
iPhone 10s models and the 10 are a face
ID the face ID is the best facial
recognition system for unlocking and
security that's out there on smartphones
but still it replaces the home button
and when I used it last year there were
a lot of times that I felt it was too
slow or just sometimes didn't work and
this year face ID is faster on all the
models which is nice and so far using it
logging in feels a lot quicker it's
basically unlocked and ready by the time
I lift the phone I'd still say that
there are times that the face ID doesn't
exactly recognize me by design because
maybe I'm too close or maybe I've got my
head on my pillow or my hand to my face
now the fact that the iPhone 10 has been
improved with two new models in less
than a year since the debut to November
is great and these are a little faster
and they're also got better cameras and
they feel good and face ideas faster but
they're not the only game in town the
iPhone 10 R is coming in October and
that cost less has a screen that falls
in between the size of these two
although it's lower resolution and has a
lot of the same camera features not dual
camera but maybe a lot of what makes
these photos look so good maybe even
better battery life now that one we
haven't reviewed yet and it's impossible
to really tell how good it is but is it
worth waiting absolutely especially when
these phones are so expensive and that's
the thing wait for the other shoe to
drop because right now the iPhone has
three models and your best bet might be
the one that I don't have</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
