yourself for Facebook I'm Bridget Carey
this is your CNET update the amazing
super computers in our pockets allow us
to communicate with anyone around the
globe in ways we've never imagined like
with taco emojis and one second looping
videos yeah so not only did iPhone users
get a bunch of new emoji icons in a
software update this week but Instagram
has gifted mankind with a new app called
boomerang it's on both iOS and Android
you create these super short videos
they're just one second long without
sound and they loop forward and backward
forever like a gif
why because clearly we're not satisfied
with still photos anymore Facebook
profile pictures can animate and the
iPhone 6s has live photos that move and
this excites people because maybe we
spend too much time sitting still for
hours staring at our phones which brings
me to new emoji iPhone owners you'll
find 150 new emoji characters in the iOS
9.1 software update among the new icons
are several foods like a taco and a
chili pepper and animals like a unicorn
and a lion and some weird Smiley's like
the money mouthface and yes there's even
a middle finger if you send it to
someone who did an update or someone
with an Android or Windows Phone they
won't likely be able to see the icons
until those operating systems update to
support the new Unicode symbols and
there's one emoji in particular that has
an interesting story behind it the eye
inside of a speech bubble is not an
official approved unicode symbol so did
Apple just make it up no in fact it was
created by the Ad Council the same folks
who created Smokey the Bear and McGruff
the Crime Dog created this simple to
represent an anti-bullying campaign and
the group asked Apple to include it with
other emoji it means I am a witness a
witness to bullying and the hope is that
it will be used to empower people to
send it to stand up to online bullies
and support their friends to not listen
to the hate those that don't have iOS 9
can also get icons to copy and paste as
photos from a separate keyboard app
called I am a witness and there's a
pretty big change over at you
the online giant unveiled a new service
that costs $10 a month so you can watch
videos without advertisements and with
that fee you also can watch some videos
that other people cannot popular YouTube
stars are going to create videos only
subscribers can see it's called YouTube
red and it launches October 28th with a
free one-month trial there are so many
paid services these days Netflix Amazon
Prime Spotify Apple music HBO now so
YouTube will have to make those new
perks pretty exciting for people to want
to pay for YouTube which has been free
for 10 years that's it for this tech
news update and there's more cnet.com
from our studios in New York I'm Bridget
