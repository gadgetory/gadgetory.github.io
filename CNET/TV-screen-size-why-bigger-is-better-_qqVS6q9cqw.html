offensive linemen and TVs the bigger the
better correct absolutely all right
David Katz Meyer is here our senior
editor at C net and television experts
I'm Jamie our dog with CBS sports.com so
let's go bigger the better especially
for football fans when they go to
purchase a TV
why does size matter the main reason is
because with today's HDTV broadcasts
they really look spectacular at large
screen sizes I say buy the biggest TV
you can get into your room and then buy
a bigger one because really is unless
you're sitting you know really close to
the TV screen you're really going to
appreciate this exercise you can see
details on the field you can read the
names you can see when they do close up
so the quarterbacks you can see
everything so I really appreciate the
large screen size especially for sports
central alright so your average living
room setup what size would you recommend
people starting at and working upwards
from there I say if you're buying a TV
football start at 60 inches and unless
you have a really small apartment that's
going to be great for immersion you're
sitting 8 feet away from 16 TV it's
going to look spectacular then go up
from there there's 65 70 inch TVs that
can really give you an extra impact and
again if you have a large room you got
the room for it you might as well and
you add studio apartments you got dorm
room so there are some people to qualify
for those smaller TVs but really how big
is too big when it comes to certain
dynamics again the general rule is 1.5 X
you're skating distance if you have like
a 60-inch TV you want to sit 90 inches
away from it or more sometimes you get a
little too close to TV like for example
you sit in the front row of movie
theater but at home you can always move
the couch back a little bit get all your
friends in there and see that great big
TV and it really does make a huge
difference yeah sometimes with certain
football fans you just don't need to see
things so close like the but fumble with
the New York Jets
oh we have to bring that I did I'm sorry
all right really according to David Katz
wire the bigger the better when it comes
to buying your TVs
