already know by now I'm not all that
easily impressed by supercars 80% of
them go to customers who use maybe 20%
of what they can do and I'm not sure I
would do much more but McLaren promises
to get my attention with this guy which
they say is not just super high
performance but super livable let's find
out as we drive the mp4-12c and check
the tech if you're not into car racing
or Formula One in particular here's a
short course on McLaren they're serious
but with this in elegantly named mp4-12c
they've achieved a very elegant balance
of street car and track car now the
biggest technology in this car is the
active suspension it creates both the
Jekyll and the hide parts of this
vehicle okay this rolling chassis shows
us some of the magic of the mp4-12c
first of all this is a carbon tub it
weighs about a hundred and sixty hundred
and seventy pounds that's it and it is
the primary piece of this car structure
front and rear aluminum subframes in the
front you hang the suspension off and it
brings the front of the car to life in
the rear you've got the engine mounted
back there now your typical car is gonna
have a sway bar running across here and
all the suspension components are
largely being driven by gravity the
vehicles weight and the wheels across
the car kind of tied together fighting
each other but this McLaren does is this
elaborate system a rather pretty
plumbing pushing fluid back and forth
under pressure varying pressure by the
millisecond to these what appear to be
coil struts but in fact what they're
able to do is two things they can push
back in corners to keep the car level
doing what a sway bar does but smart and
they can also change the shock rate the
damper rate so the shock absorbers can
go from being very firm to very soft
depending what kind of driving you're
doing after all that the engine is
almost conventional almost 3.8 liter
twin-turbo v8 doing 592 horsepower 443
foot-pounds of torque 0 to 60 in about
three and a third seconds or less if you
know what you're doing and yet 15 22 mpg
told you had a split personality
one gearbox a 7-speed dual-clutch
automated manual controlling all that
power are these two switches that move
the handling or the powertrain from
normal to sport to track I suspect
you've noticed that LCD and wondered how
it got that way while McLaren mounted it
in portrait mode to allow for a narrower
console to that same end they moved the
climate controls out to the doors
navigation will be available along with
all the modern audio sources but that
kind of tech isn't paramount here this
is that won't always pose me I'd be that
guy you see on the television broadcast
in the wall
but a lot of cars can go fast around a
track peeling off onto local streets
that's really eye-opening and it's got
many modes that go beyond the most
comfortable I mean what's called the
normal mode I'm letting it do everything
automatically click press the little
button that says inactive and maybe
you've got a whole new world of
possibilities it's all over here called
agents your handling system you've got
normal sport and track pretty
self-explanatory their levels of
aggression for how the adaptive
suspension works and then over here the
one called pious performance or
powertrain actually normal sport and
tracked again that's gonna map your
throttle and change how the gearbox
operates there's something else in this
card as part of these controls that you
haven't seen before uniquely McLaren
it's called the isg the intake sound
generator and check this out when you
builder the more aggressive modes like
sport or tracked it's going to vent in
some of that
raspy blood-curdling hair standing
exhaustion just to remind you that you
are driving a very impressive view now
the cars got high-tech written
throughout it but not in the most
extreme way they still have a good
old-fashioned analogue speedometer a
rounded though our full video gauges bar
graphs for oil pressure water
temperature fuel level and such and all
kinds of powertrain indications inside
this cars bleed am comfortable for a car
of its size and I can't say that about
every car in the supercar class some of
them feel like you're driving a supercar
all the time which is cool except you're
not going to want to
that much a car like this I think you
would David E Davis once said that
anybody worth anything at all and he
still owned a 12-cylinder car once in
their lifetime because that's a real
sound he said it was nothing else quite
like it well this is an eight cylinder
car but I can guarantee you it's also a
real sound and a real operatic
experience we're about to enjoy that as
we have one of the great look-at-me
experiences of life in Los Angeles on a
busy freeway with everyone looking this
guy is set to track the exhaust flowing
in and out of the car and we're gonna
hit it if you like to turn heads this is
your rock here in the market for a two
hundred thirty thousand dollar car it's
probably not your only car but the 12c
has a wide enough range of personalities
that it could be both your second and
third cars it is utterly impractical the
DCT gearbox occasionally gets that
confused look around town they all do
and I could actually do without the
exhaust noise feature aimed at the back
of my head
it's throaty enough without but I think
a few years from now you'll find 12 C's
on the resale market with some decently
high numbers on the odometer and for a
car like this that's the ultimate
compliment</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
