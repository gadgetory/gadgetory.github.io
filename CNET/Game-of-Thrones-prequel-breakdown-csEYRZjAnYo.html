the studio and I am more than excited to
talk about this week's topic we are
discussing the Game of Thrones prequel
on HBO so let's get started
last week george RR martin posted a blog
naming the show the long night and
saying that actress Naomi Watts had been
cast to star in the prequel Naomi Watts
getting cast is a real thing but HBO
didn't exactly like that he posted the
long night as the title because a week
later he went back to his blog and said
about that HBO says it's not the
official title it's a working title
Michael but my bad uh but we know a lot
about it because it's called the long
night or has something to do with the
long night so we're gonna get into it
now before we get started I will tell
you there will be spoilers from Game of
Thrones the TV show and also some of the
books I don't get your boxers in a bunch
if I don't pick the Canon that you like
best this is not a Lady Stoneheart
debate alright this is stream economy
not book economy let's get started let's
take our time machines and go all the
way back to season 1 episode 3 where old
man talks about the long night spill
that T old man thousands of years ago
that came a night that lasted a
generation Kings froze to death in their
castles same as the Shepherd's in their
words and women smothered their babies
rather than see them starve and wept and
felt the tears freeze on their cheeks so
is this the sort of story that you like
well well well Nana's awful lot of
information about the long night
happened thousands of years ago and had
a very crucial event occur in that
timeframe which is the creation of White
Walkers we already know that children of
the forest made the White Walkers we
found that out in season six episode
five
they were so fed up with humans coming
in chopping down their trees and kicking
them off the land that they created
freaking ice zombies and according to
old nan they also made spiders as big as
hounds no not that hound lowercase
hounds anyway HBO's rundown also
suggests that this show will take place
during the Age of Heroes which is the
timeframe many Great Houses in Game of
Thrones were founded so will likely meet
bran the Builder who obviously found it
House Stark and built the wall which is
a very important part of Game of Thrones
lore and will also likely meet Lann the
clever who founded House Lannister how
much money he got on him always paying
his debts as Game of Thrones the TV
series comes to an end
all of this information is giving me
something to live for so that's what we
already know
now let's speculate a little bit if
we're already meeting people like bran
the Builder and land the clever why not
meet the leaders of the Valyrian
freehold for example that's the Empire
across the Narrow Sea and Essos that
House Targaryen came from we may also
meet the ancestors of the Dothraki I
mean there could be a new call in
Khaleesi in town everybody and I am
excited about it now one figure we do
have to talk about is the last hero
nobody really knows who this person is
but in Westeros eel or the last hero is
a figure who allies with the children of
the forest to help stop the White
Walkers now I don't know if this is the
same person as a Zora hi or better known
as the prince that was promised a
prophecy were familiar with from
Melisandre and the rest of the Lord of
Light believers in Game of Thrones I'm
gonna put my money on these being two
separate characters for one the prince
that was promised supposedly comes from
the Far East and the last hero is a
westerosi legend
so narrative Lee it
so makes sense for them to be two
separate people because that means they
can come together at some point during
the show and work to end the long and
night side by side think of all those
battles you guys I can't wait
finally it's gonna be so good but let's
talk about one person who has been cast
but we don't quite know what her role is
and that is Naomi Watts going back to
the beginning so Naomi Watts is blonde
she's a very good actress who could she
possibly be played
could she be one of the earliest members
of House Lannister or perhaps a citizen
of the Valyrian freehold or a member of
the earliest parts of House Targaryen oh
it doesn't matter what she's gonna play
it's gonna be so awesome I cannot wait
to see this prequel george RR martin
says the casting team is neck-deep in
work right now trying to get the entire
prequel cast set ready to go I do have
one request though and that is cast
Issac hemstead write plays bran in the
current Game of Thrones series as bran
the Builder I mean this will be crazy
awesome to maybe age him up a little bit
or somehow distinguish him from his
descendant bran Stark but have the same
guy play his own ancestor I mean if all
those fan theories are right it would
make a lot of sense
yeah hey Sarah what do you think of the
Game of Thrones prequel George RR
Martin's ha how many else's you want
have these past or film I'm pissed off
him actually you know wild even kid I
boom I tried to read the book I love
this sure so I watched the show and
things were hard ah psycho I either had
to be the head catch up there at the
boot and then there was one chapter I've
got a castle old chard or maybe the
polygraph a paragraph or two a chapter
just bring the castle disk leaving the
castle Mesa Castle all it's just the
castle 1john store de Guiche stop in by
a dragon because that's the one the
George alarm on beast himself would
george RR martin to make himself like
skelion like handsome gonna be me the
miss Borden kite that lasted a big sense
that makes sense
he's a fiction wound he's he's been a
whole chapter in about Castle no I mean
thanks so much for watching you can
