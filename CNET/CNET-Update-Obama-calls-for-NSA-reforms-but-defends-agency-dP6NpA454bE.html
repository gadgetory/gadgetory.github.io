while Google makes your contact lenses
smarter I'm sharra tip cannon for
Bridget Carey this is your cnet update
we finally learned what changes
President Obama has in store for the NSA
in a speech on Friday Obama said the
secretive spy agency will need court
permission to access telephone records
it also won't collect and store the
information on its own instead a third
party is going to do that but don't
think this means the NSA is going to
stop spying Obama suggested changes but
he also defended what the NSA does and
he also said there's no evidence it
abused its power some proposals need to
go through Congress so we're sure to
hear more about this in the weeks to
come google is taking wearables to a
whole new level the online giant said
it's working on smart contact lenses
embedded with sensors that are so small
they look like bits of glitter they also
have an antenna that's thinner than a
human hair these lenses won't let us see
through walls but they could help
diabetics monitor their glucose levels
this secret google x project has gone
through multiple clinical research
studies and google has even met with the
US Food and Drug Administration it's now
looking for partners to bring the
product to market one thing's for sure
we're getting a lot closer to a cyborg

iOS one phone we could soon see is a
bigger HTC One the company is prepping
an updated model for late march

specs include a 5-inch display and a
high-end Qualcomm Snapdragon processor
