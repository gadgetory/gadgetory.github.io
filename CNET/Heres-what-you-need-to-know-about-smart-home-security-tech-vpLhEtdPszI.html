you're shopping for a home security
system that's because it's a huge
category that covers everything from
professional firms like ADT to DIY style
products like cameras sensors and lofts
fortunately we're here to help you're
probably already familiar with the
traditional home security model
it's the ABT's and vivint's of the world
basically brands that offer a ton of
services and products like sensors
cameras sirens and even professional
monitoring DIY kits like simply safe are
actually really similar to ADT they have
sensors and sirens they offer
professional monitoring and have a
monthly fee but it's on a month-to-month
basis so you aren't locked into a
contract in the same way
cameras are another major DIY home
security category and there are a ton of
different varieties they offer live
streaming motion and sound related
alerts night-vision cloud storage local
storage and a whole lot more there are
some that are even available for free
like presents many thing and salient I
these are free apps that convert spare
Android and iOS devices into security
cameras for free locks are another
growing smart home security category
we've reviewed a bunch of Bluetooth
enabled models including the August
smart lock here Polly controls Danah log
and the quick set key bow the August
smart lock and the Danah lock actually
installed over an existing deadbolt
whereas the quick set kevo has its own
smart key deadbolt a deadbolt that had a
major security vulnerability that our
technical editor Steve Conaway hacked in
seconds flat this covers a lot of what's
available on the market today but a lot
is changing to third-party integrations
integrations with your car wearables and
a whole lot more are emerging on the
scene and it isn't just DIY companies
that are getting in on the
action professional security firms are
actually partnering with a bunch of
these startups so that they can be more
appealing to people interested in DIY
products making home security a really
interesting category to keep an eye on
