collect new toys I'm Bridget Carey and
this is your cnet update the moto x
marks the first time that you can
customize your smartphone in different
color combinations but you can only do
that if you're with ATT that's because
AT&amp;amp;T has the exclusive rights to the
moto maker online store where you can
pick different colors for the back the
camera rim and buttons and you also have
the option to add textures or have a
phrase printed on it you can put special
text on the screen when it boots up or
for fifty dollars more increase the
storage to 32 gigs we got an early sneak
peek at the moto maker site which you
can read more about on cnet com the Moto
X arrives august twenty-third at AT&amp;amp;T
for two hundred dollars under contract
and those that by the Moto X through the
moto maker get a free accessory called
the skip it's an NFC clip that you
attach to a shirt or pocket and if you
tap the phone to the clip it'll unlock
without you having to enter in a
password other carriers will sell the
phone in stores in the coming weeks but
they'll only have the option of black
and white and that clip will cost you
extra we're keeping our eye on samsung
which is said to debut its new
SmartWatch on sep tember fourth two days
before a tech event in Berlin both
Bloomberg and the site Sam mobile have
reported that the SmartWatch will be
revealed the same day that Samsung shows
off the Galaxy Note 3 earlier this month
Samsung did file a trademark for a
SmartWatch and called it Galaxy gear
disney infinity is arriving in stores
and this new video game combines real
world toy figurines of Disney's movie
characters like Mike Wazowski from
monsters inc and Jack Sparrow from
Pirates of the Caribbean much like
Skylanders she put the toy on the
scanner to play that character in the
game each character has a game based on
their own universe but in toy box mode
all characters can play in one open
world that you build you haven't seen
Disney mash up multiple franchises in
one game before like this it's launching
with 18 collectible figures at first but
there are many more to come including
sorcerer Mickey and there are 21 power
discs which costs five dollars for a
mystery pack or two the star
to pack with the game costs $75 this is
a big deal for Disney which has
struggled in its video game division
Disney infinity has the potential to be
huge considered just how many characters
can be programmed into this with kids
trading or collecting them all for
thirteen dollars a pop and what if
Disney starts to add in Marvel and Star
Wars characters to promote it Disney's
also launching mobile apps with Disney
infinity action players can make movies
that feature the game characters and
props the app is available for Windows
and iOS and soon Android that's your
tech news update and you can read more
