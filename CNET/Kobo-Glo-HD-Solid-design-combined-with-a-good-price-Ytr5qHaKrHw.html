dollars in the US and 110 pounds in the
UK the Kobo Glo HD is a slick crisp
eReader with some great features I'm
Nikki Lee senior editor for Senate cobos
latest model in its long long range of
readers is not only slimmer and lighter
than its predecessor it also as the name
suggests packs in an impressive 1448 by
1072 pixel resolution on its six-inch
card at 8 inch screen that's 300 pixels
per inch up from 213 on the original
glow the glow HD is just nine point two
millimeters thick or 0.3 of an inch and
weighs just 180 grams or six point three
ounces the design goes even more
minimalist with only a single button and
a micro USB port that functions for both
PC connectivity and charging this means
the backlight button that was on older
Kobo e-reader is gone with brightness
now controlled by the touch screen the
light itself is uniform across the
screen and makes for a very pleasant
nighttime reading experience the Glo HD
features a now standard one gigahertz
processor which makes very very smooth
experience with your changing pages or
just zipping around the interface
there's no microSD port so you're stuck
with a full gigabyte of internal memory
which is actually pretty good when you
think about the average size of an
e-book the Kobo Glo HD has a tidy and
clean design with a great run of
features all at a really good price it's
an excellent upgrade from the globe but
if you're already using a Kindle you'll
need to have a big think about the
Kindle voyage before you consider
swapping manufacturers and ecosystems
