it's currently on Kickstarter right now
okay here pong yes oh my god so so it's
it's it's like beer pong just you load
the cups in stop it your load you load
it with your blob OH this simply came to
be after a drunken night of you load up
your favorite alcoholic beverage you you
can make it beer if you if you're
underage you can make it fruit punch
fruit punch oh oh it actually has two
modes if you move that if you toggle
switch to the right it puts it in an
automatic mode which pills rattle move
around on it and then you can detect a
can detect the edges or you can go in
manual mode where when your opponent
shooting you can move it around and yes
you cannot run off yet so you can mess
with somebody and see if they can get in
that is so see I have loved to have this
so now though one thing I will have my
gun crazy well that's the one thing i
will say with pong by pong bot will not
fall off the table but it will knock it
will knock the ball couple off the table
because it's got another day yesterday a
laser shooting down but not on the side
so yes and you can control it with the
little remote oh that's cool boat pawpaw
where were you 10 years ago so cool two
years ago persons go the pool I mean one
cool thing I wish they would do and I
hope they do it in the final is maybe
have it come in different colors so you
can have a match for college
um license out like all the colors it's
very it's very simple you know I see
that happen whoa don't want to drop it
don't drop the ball this is this is more
