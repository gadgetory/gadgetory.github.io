welcome to the show floor of the New
York International Auto Show I'm
standing in front of one of the
best-looking cars here on the show floor
and certainly the most aggressive
looking car on the show floors the 2015
Corvette Stingray zo6 convertible and
the zo6 is a 625 horsepower supercharged
v8 version of the Corvette Stingray here
in New York Chevrolet unveiled the
convertible version of the car which you
can see behind me it looks quite nice
actually a lot of convertibles look a
little bit hokey when they lop the roof
off but this car actually was designed
to be a convertible in the first place
so it looks quite nice the body really
seamlessly wraps around the back end and
it looks really good this has got the
zo7 package on it which gives you a
little bit more carbon fiber and a
little bit more aggressiveness again
we've got 625 horses under the hood here
which is a ridiculous amounts one of the
fastest Corvettes ever made including
all the special editions that have come
before in fact this is the fastest
Corvette around GM's test track fastest
car they've ever made around that test
track GM finally gave us 0 to 60 times
3.5 seconds for this car in statistics
view which is pretty ridiculous against
625 horsepower I'm gonna say that a lot
just because that's a really big number
let's take a look at the interior which
is also improved now Corvettes have
traditionally been all about what's
under the hood and while this car
certainly has plenty to offer there
we've got a nice interior for a change
which is not again something we've come
to expect from Corvettes in the past
nice Alcantara wrap steering wheel this
Corvettes got a carbon fiber interior
which has got a nice sporty look overall
the materials in the fit and finish are
a huge step up from what we've come to
expect Corvettes in the past now of
course it's a very open airfield because
we're in a convertible the controls are
down here on the left so it's a full
power top very quick and easy to operate
and again nice and airy way to cruise
your way through the mountains or indeed
around a track now Chevy hasn't said how
much this cars gonna weigh it should be
a little bit more than the standard zero
six but they did say it won't be that
much in fact this car was designed
side-by-side with a normal Corvette
Stingray so the difference really isn't
that great between the two this car also
has the zo7 package which gives you some
extra body kutrimmer a cruising this a
wicker bill on the back which is
actually adjustable so if any more
downforce you can move this up manually
if you like there's a lip on the front
and some carbon-fiber on the side making
it
really really clean we also don't have a
price for the zo6 either in convertible
or standard form we should expect them
hit dealers sometime toward the end of
this year so you should save your
pennies I know that I am again this is
