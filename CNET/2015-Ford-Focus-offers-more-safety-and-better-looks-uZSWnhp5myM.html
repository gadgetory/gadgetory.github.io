standing next to the biggest product
launch here at Mobile World Congress
2014 literally and perhaps figuratively
as well this is the 2015 Ford Focus in
2012 Ford sold over a million of these
things making it the best-selling car in
the world and Ford shows Mobile Congress
to be the place to unveil the next
generation of that car
rather than waiting for Geneva next week
which is a much bigger Auto Show
why well Ford wants to get ahead of the
churn of news it's going to be coming
out next week and also because there's a
lot of cool technology that we're going
to talk about in just a minute but first
let's start with the exterior this is a
slightly refreshed version of the
current Ford Focus it's available right
now at your dealerships biggest change
up front is with a new corporate Ford
grille looks a lot like an Aston Martin
you seeing it on the edge and a couple
of other Ford products to new headlights
as well and overall all the greater fuel
efficiency from more aerodynamics which
is certainly going to be good but the
biggest change in fuel efficiency will
come from the 1.0 litre EcoBoost engine
we've seen that in the Fiesta it's going
to be coming to the Ford Focus as well
only with a 6-speed manual transmission
we're told it will be only with a
6-speed manual in the US as well which
may make some US buyers a little bit
cautious some bigger changes on the
inside so let's take a look in there
inside we have a revised layout that's a
little bit clean a little bit nicer than
before not radically different but it is
improved we got a larger display here in
the center for the my Ford touch
interface as well as the new Sync
interface sync 3.0 which has some nice
improvements the UI is a little bit
cleaner biggest changes are in the
navigation system the interface is much
prettier we've also got the Michelin
Guide built in a sequence of restaurant
reviews there you've also got an
integrated rear view camera which is now
standard plus it's got cameras pointing
out the sides that will tell you if
you're backing out of a tight parking
spot whether or not you maybe need to
wait a few minutes for some traffic to
go by we've also got some upgraded
improvements here for driver assists
they'll help you to avoid crashes as
well up to 50 km/h that's much faster
than before it can also swerve around
other cars automatically before it would
just stop now can actually drive around
them for you
so if you're not paying attention this
might just saved your bacon I can also
parallel park itself and it can
perpendicularly park itself as well
which is new and
it'll even back itself out of parking
spots which is also something never
again this is the 2015 Ford Focus it
should be hitting dealers sometime
toward the end of the year for hasn't
given us any specific pricing just yet
business we're not talking about any
radical changes expected to fall in line
more or less with what the current Ford
Focus calls again I'm Tim Stevens with
