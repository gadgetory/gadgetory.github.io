hands-on first look at the Canon Rebel
t5 otherwise known as the Canon EOS 1200
Z in other markets around the world but
no matter what you call it it's only the
badge on the front that's going to be
different apart from that all the inside
and the outside are identical in the
hand this is canons entry-level SLR
model and it feels nice and light
accordingly so if you're just stepping
up from your first compact maybe even a
smart phone it's not going to be too
bulky to scare you away inside is an 18
megapixel aps-c CMOS sensor it's pretty
much the same sensor as been seen on a
couple of the other older canon models
from a few years ago around the back you
get a nice big 3-inch LCD screen about
460,000 dots so it's not a hugely high
resolution but it's definitely enough to
compose your photos and review them with
speaking or composing your photos of
course being an SLR you get an optical
viewfinder when it comes to exposure
modes the 1200 d or Rebel t5 has as many
as you can throw at it pretty much the
same as any other SLR on the market you
get full program aperture shutter and
manual exposure modes including a full
automatic mode if you're not quite ready
to delve into manual exposures just yet
and a couple of other scene modes such
as portrait landscape and no flash when
it comes to video recording this camera
definitely has the chops to keep up at
1080p however there is no external
microphone jack so if you do want to get
better quality external audio you're out
of luck with the internal mic this
camera comes in a couple of different
kick configurations depending on where
you buy it but the 18 to 55 millimeter
lens is pretty standard however you have
the option of getting it with or without
image stabilization I strongly suggest
you get image stabilization on this lens
especially if you want to be recording
video because otherwise you're going to
be really shaky and the camera is going
to pick up every single vibration you
definitely notice the difference between
and is lens and a non is lens especially
if you're shooting video so check out
seen it very soon for the full review in
the meantime I'm Lexi city
cnet this has been a hands-on look at
the Canon Rebel t5 or a US 1200 day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
