beloved characters on smart devices it's
exciting news for gamers but here are
the things I want to see from Nintendo's
gaming apps first to do in-app payments
right Nintendo's game apps could well be
like candy crush free to download but
then charging you for in-game items some
free-to-play games make it way too hard
to progress without paying real money
but others like blizzards hearts don't
earn cash for their makers and are still
fun for gamers whom never spend a penny
because the advantages that real-world
money gets you are limited nintendo
needs to strike that balance secondly
don't kill the console Nintendo's
history lies with dedicated gaming
machines but by making mobile games it
runs the risk of removing any temptation
to buy it's bigger expensive home
systems Nintendo needs to make its
mobile games great but ensure its
console still offer something different
otherwise it could end up in trouble
thirdly think about the medium phones
and tablets are different devices to
consoles and handhelds and Nintendo
needs to make sure its games are suited
to them Nintendo has already said it
won't be porting console games to mobile
which is a good start but great control
without physical buttons and games that
work for quick 30 second bursts of
gameplay are a must
Nintendo has plenty of great franchises
but mobile gamers could feel ripped off
if they denied Nintendo's most famous
characters we want to see Mario Zelda
and Metroid on smartphones so Nintendo
has its work cut out but it has the
power and the personality to create the
best mobile games around if it wants to
don't let us down Mario</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
