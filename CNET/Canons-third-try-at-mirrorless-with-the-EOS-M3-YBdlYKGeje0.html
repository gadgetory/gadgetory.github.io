interchangeable lens cameras back to the
US with the m3 but it's not the breakout
model I'd hoped for in fact its
strengths and weaknesses relative to
competitors seem unchanged from two
generations ago I'm Laura green for CNET
and this is the Canon EOS m3 its design
remains its strongest asset with a
somewhat heavy but tank like body and
substantial grip the control layout and
menus are straightforward and it is
perks like a flash that you can tilt
back for better illumination quality and
a flip-up touch screen for selfies it
also supports a very nice hot shoe based
electronic viewfinder though that will
cost you extra
between 200 and 250 of us UK or
Australian currencies photo and video
quality also stack up well versus its
strongest competitors not better overall
but not worse either unfortunately
though it might be an improvement for
its series it's still the slowest of the
pack and doesn't have any continuous
shooting mode that supports continuous
autofocus or auto exposure all of that
limits its versatility the feature set
is about the same as less expensive
models and for people who care about
lens options there's only a handful of
native EFM mount lenses priced at $800
for the kit with the 18 to 55 millimeter
STM lens it's also a lot more expensive
than models with similar feature sets in
the US and UK cameras like the samsung
nx500 and the sony a 5100 which both
have the same aps-c size sensor and no
viewfinder oddly though the price is
relatively a better deal in Australia
it's a perfectly competent camera but it
doesn't stand out from an increasingly
crowded field read why in my room
