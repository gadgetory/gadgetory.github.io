cnet com and we know a lot of you have
iPads so what we wanted to do is really
show you some unique offerings of
accessories we know there's a lot out
there but these three really send out
for different reasons I will start off
with someone who loves to travel who's
on the go and loves movies this is the
Seagate wireless plus and it costs 199
it's a wireless one terabyte hard drive
and what it allows you to do is stream
movies music or photos directly to three
different devices at the same time and
it has a 10 hour battery life so for
someone like me that's also on the go
this is my BFF now the next product we
have here this is the belkin ultimate
keyboard case and what makes this one
unique is there's others out there but
it entirely protects the back side so it
has this kind of plastic / leather
surface on the back then when you flip
it open it connects and you can set it
at three different angles so that gives
you some versatility and then once you
set it at an angle it's automatically
connect to bluetooth you don't have to
flip on a switch and then you can type
away and really this is the closest
experience that you'll get to having a
laptop like feel with your iPad and
finally you see this guy this is an iPad
with the photo lens I know you've seen
that whole phenomenon where people are
holding up their iPads taking pictures
in public well you know what it's here
you might as well embrace it even though
I think it's dirty but check this out
this is a telephoto lens from photojojo
com it costs twenty-five dollars and
they make a set for the regular ipad or
the ipad mini and it includes a
telephoto 10x or 12 x lens this is
really a versatile package to get those
tight shots from something way far away
and you know if you're okay with being
that person this is the kit for you so
there you go three different type of
accessories for your ipad i'm brian Tong
