power here in all the years we've been
doing car tech here at scene that I
can't recall a car that's had more
advanced email from viewers than this
one it's the new Lexus GS the 2013 GS
350 let's take it for a ride
find out what all the anticipations
about and check the tech now this
believe it or not is perhaps the biggest
headline on the new GS its Lexus new
face the so called spindle grille it
kind of kind of gathers in the middle
like a waistline here the rest of the
car is not so remarkable ok here we are
inside the new GS and it tells you this
car is I think more luxurious than
sporting how do I know that because look
at the dash it's this big strong
horizontal pronouncement here this is
kind of more borrowed dare I say it from
the el Dorados Imperials and
Continentals of your nice clean gauges
Lexus ours is a great job of that great
typography very clear very crisp and
then you've got this guy that is a huge
screen BMW has some that are that wide
but I'm not sure they're that tall
that's a big boy
twelve point three inch diagonal the map
hasn't changed it's still 2d only flat
view they don't have a bird's eye view
or a 3d or a satellite rendered thing I
can live without that to the right
though you've now got a fixed second
part of the screen it's always there and
lets you get to your music menu put up a
climate screen or an efficiency screen
hit the radio button here and of course
that brings that up over the map and
you've got all your entertainment
sources there on the top my iPods
plugged in here my Bluetooth audio
streaming is available I can put an
optical disc in here you've got standard
aux and then that brings us to the apps
you've got Pandora and iHeartRadio here
as media apps Pandora of course is
Internet predictive music I Heart Radio
is Clear Channel's stations but if you
notice anything different while I'm
touring all this with you look how I'm
doing it this is a very different
interface from Lexus in the past and a
very different controller and it
a disaster all you do with this thing is
overshoot what you want now you can't
see this in a video but it's got haptics
that means as I move across each thing
on the screen it kind of goes cheap
chunk chunk and you feel that on the
little controller here but it's just so
badly calibrated I'm constantly missing
what I want and I'm not the only person
who found this the most glaring thing is
there's no back button so I found myself
going back to the home menu all the time
which looks like this which is over
stylized what does this one mean for
example go to my iPad can't do that
visit the Supreme Court I'm on the wrong
coast call a telemarketer to get a pitch
for land in Florida
those don't tell me anything now here
I've got satellite delivered stuff from
Lexus enform
sports scores fuel prices can be handy
as is weather then you dive in another
level and you get apps there's a weird
hodgepodge of distraction prevention
here for example I can go to Yelp which
is nice to have for some reason they
decided that you can look at two pages
while driving but you can't look at
three or more like there's a big
difference in distraction there it's
just frustrating also frustrating is the
fact that some of these apps have voice
command some of these don't I can't
operate Yelp with voice but I can't
operate Bing an open table with voice
and the voice command in this car
wallets pretty good is still nowhere
near as good as my $200 phone I mean not
even in the same universe this is your
drivetrain mode knob push it to go into
normal mode kick it counterclockwise
once for eco mode it'll dial back the
performance and push up the mpg now turn
it clockwise once for sport mode that's
going to aggressive eyes the throttle
mapping as well as the shift profiles
and then kick it one more time to Sport
Plus and that's going to get the active
suspension to be much more aggressive
and also going to dial in a more
aggressive profile on the electric power
steering
you'll only get Sport Plus if you have
an F sport car because that's where you
get the active suspension right above
that of course is our shifter one choice
only six-speed Automatic in all GS cars
that's getting a little bit of criticism
in the car world because it doesn't have
seven or eight or nine cogs we'll be on
the road in a minute and find out if
that's worthy criticism on top of the
steering wheel here check this out
two little eight there little red in
four red things behind this lens that's
part of the
fall asleep technology and it's
supposedly can tell if your eyelids are
down and you've fallen asleep I found no
reasonable life-preserving way to test
it so I'll take them at their work the
lka button here on the wheel enables the
lane keep assist which will gently tug
you back into your lane if you drift
with the signal off works most of the
time and be som over here that turns on
the blind spot monitor that's a passive
system gives you an indicator in the
mirror that someone's tucked away back
there by the way navigation on this car
is actually optional I doubt many of
them ship without it but it's
technically an option as part of a
package and they got a confusing array
of pricey packages for this car still a
three and a half later longitudinally
mounted v6 rear-wheel drive base
all-wheel drive optional compared to the
last GS 350 which was a model year 2011
the differences are slim 303 horsepower
has grown to 306 the torque has grown
from 274 foot-pounds to 277 and the mpg
has crept up slightly as well 1926 to
1928 comparing rear-wheel drive cars
pushing two tons or about four thousand
pounds or more a curb weight on this car
that's one of my first questions is
would you load up a two-ton four-door
sedan with an F Sport package
I don't know those things pull different
directions in my mind the ride quality
of course is Lexus like but without
being as floaty as Lexus has been in the
past thank the F Sport package for that
it's a v6 car without any kind of a
turbo or supercharger on it but what I
do like about this engine is it is so
happy to rev as a result this motor is
responsive more than its powerful that
said we have that 6-speed manual in here
that a lot of the the auto Rotty tend to
sneer at the mpg on this vehicle is not
great I'm not sure two more gears with
fix that
okay pricing this car makes me crazy
it's about $48,000 for a base gs350
rear-wheel drive bottom level then
there's that F Sport package which we
have here for about another six grand I
wouldn't do it it doesn't make sense to
put a bunch of go-fast stuff on a car
that's already a two ton four-door sedan
then there's Lexus many chunky packages
from eight to eleven thousand dollars
this is where you roll in the stuff you
want and the stuff you don't want like
that ghastly interface you're basically
stuck with it
this car is going to run your summer
between the high 50s to about 60 grand
done up seen that style</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
