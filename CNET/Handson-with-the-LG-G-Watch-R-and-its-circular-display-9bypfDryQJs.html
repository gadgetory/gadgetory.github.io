new as it once was but are they finally
starting to look good I'm the west road
for cnet here at E 4 2014 in Berlin with
the LG G watch our let's take a look so
this is an LG's first SmartWatch but
unlike its predecessor the G watch this
one as the are in the name suggests is
rounded it's got a stainless steel frame
and an interchangeable leather strap and
I have to say it's looking pretty good
and it feels quite classy as well it
still feels quite chunky considering
that it's a watch but this display is
actually pretty smallest a 1.3 inch
display has got a 320 x 320 pixel
resolution if I spin it round on the
back you can see there's a heart rate
monitor too I have to say the oled
screen here is the standout feature at
least for me when you see just a regular
clock face running on this device it
really looks like it might not be a
screen you have to sort of do a bit of a
double take and investigate to check
that it really is made up of pixels the
G watch art is running Android wear
which is Google's version of Android
tweet specifically for smartwatch
screens so what can you actually do with
it well it communicates with your phone
over Bluetooth you'll need an android
phone running android version 4.3 or
later and then on the watch will be L
see notifications it doesn't like track
your health your steps gives you updates
about the weather and how far it will
take to get to your next meeting for
example finally I want to end on
something that I think is a really cool
feature this thing is water-resistant LG
says you'll be able to hold it
underwater for a depth of up to one
meter for 30 minutes which means it
should be fine in the shower it's going
to be coming out towards the end of this
year let me know what you think of the
design and check out cnet com / Aoife
but much much more
