enough to live in a home with multiple
people using multiple Apple devices your
iPhones and iPads and Mac books and iPod
Touches Apple has made it really easy to
sync these all up to a common iTunes
account called family sharing I'm going
to show you how to set it up first for
this to work you have to make sure all
of your Apple devices that you want to
share with are running the latest
software that means iOS 8 for mobile and
OS 10 mountain lion for your Macs
next take the mobile device that's
associated with the Apple ID and credit
card that will serve as the master
account for the family then go to
settings iCloud and tap the button for
setup family sharing you're going to go
through a few screens here that explain
family sharing verify your credit card
information and make sure that you
understand that the family organizer all
purchases made on these other devices
are going to go through your account
that's an important detail so don't go
adding friends or deadbeat uncles to
your family sharing list eventually
you'll find yourself on this family page
where you can add up to five additional
family members to share with to invite
someone click add family member and then
type in their name or email address to
pull them up from your contacts once
they accept the invitation they'll gain
immediate access to any music movies TV
shows books or apps that you downloaded
and the same goes for you if you click
on the App Store or the iTunes Store and
you click on purchase you can see a new
list of all the things that they've
bought before that you can download onto
any of your devices
but what happens if a family member of
yours turns out to be a real jerk who's
running up your credit card with all
kinds of iTunes and app purchases that
you don't approve of well you can delete
them from your list by going into iCloud
tapping their name and removing them so
there you go that's how to set up
Apple's family sharing feature with your
family it's a great way to make the best
use of iTunes content you already have
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
