is a look at the super luxe HD 681
headphones the headphone market is
booming at the moment but if you want
good sound you have to look pretty hard
monitor headphones have been around as
long as there have been consumer models
while they don't usually look very
pretty they're often well built cheap
and sound great into that category we'd
put the Tonys super luxe HD six eight
ones you can find these online for only
thirty bucks and they certainly have the
butt-ugly thing going on for starters
it's covered in knobs that make it look
like a my first sewing machine and what
are these things
clocks what's the time it's headphones
time terrible looks aside these are
pretty well made for the money and fit
comfortably around the ear as they don't
fold it at all they do come with a cloth
carry bag so they look awful and are
cheap but do they sound good
well nowhere near as balanced as the $60
sony v6 headphone but they do have
plenty of travel detail dynamically
they're not very good and can compress
music Evon has not already compressed
this is particularly true with bright
sounding recordings but bass is quite
controlled and they can go pretty deep
without distortion if you want
headphones that will help you enjoy the
music this isn't them but if you want
headphones that will help you listen out
for flaws in recordings or to make TV
more intelligible these would work great
the fact that they're available for the
change from a cab fare is even better
this has been Ty Pendlebury for seniors</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
