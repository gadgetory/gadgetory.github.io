released without ice cream sandwich but
for 80 bucks you get tons of features in
a solid design I'm Lynn from cnet
bringing you guys the LG Lucid from
verizon the LG Lucid is an Android
Gingerbread phone that has a bright
4-inch gorilla glass touchscreen that's
responsive and smooth colors are vibrant
Lee displayed and graphics are crisp and
clean the phone runs on Verizon's 4G LTE
network and has a 1.2 gigahertz
dual-core processor inside it also has
one gigabyte of ram so browsing the web
multitasking through apps and taking
pictures feels pretty snappy the handset
is powered by 1700 milliamp per hour
battery with a reported talk time of
eight hours on the back of the phone you
can see there's this black and purple
stripe design that glitters in the
sunlight this may not be for everyone
but I personally don't mind it there's
also a 5 megapixel camera and an LED
flash the camera can record in full HD
1080p video there's also a front-facing
vga camera for vanity shots and video
chatting the device comes with a few
customizable features that i found mean
like some pre-loaded themes different
wallpapers for when your battery is
charging and a dialer widget a few
things i was a little disappointed with
was the output speaker audio quality
videos music and voices sound a little
tinny when you put it on speaker also
it's a little heavy in the hand it
weighs about 5 ounces and is point 45
inches thick but as previously mentioned
the phone is reasonably priced after you
sign a two-year contract and send in a
mail-in rebate the phone will cost you
eighty dollars again I'm Lynn from cnet
bringing you guys the LG Lucid
