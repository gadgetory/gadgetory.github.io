what was hot in a very cold Detroit's
and we'll take a look back at CES the
new Auto Show plus another reason to
feel smug in your SUV time to check the
temp you see cars differently under the
hood but also check the tech and are
known for telling it like it is ugly is
included at no extra cost
the good the bad the bottom line this is
CNN on cars welcome to see net on cars
the show all about high-tech cars and
modern drivers
I'm Brian Cooley coming to you this time
from the North American International
Auto Show in Detroit this is the big boy
the biggest most important Auto Show in
the US all year than one of the big two
or three globally all year so a lot
going on here people ask me what's the
most important car you saw that's an
extremely tough choice to make but if I
had to pick it on layers of innovative
technology I think I might give the nod
to the Audi q7 why these q7 sure has
changed so occupies the same basic slot
in the market but it prints differently
looking it now it doesn't really so much
say crossover or a large SUV as it does
say station wagon the change the
proportions around as they've stacked
the body modules the volumes now are
lower longer and more of that wagon look
now the technology underneath and inside
the cabin is also very different look at
the instrument panel you've now got a
12-inch irregularly shaped TFT LCD IP
that's not that rare anymore as of this
Detroit everyone's going LCD - you've
also got the large center console screen
and then look that they've done with
that handwriting or finger recognition
pad he used to be a small pad on top of
a knob now it's flowing a large area in
front of the nmi controller they really
interesting story here's they're doing
with the power train as well one of the
options will be a plug-in diesel hybrid
combine that efficiency with the fact
that they've shaved over 700 pounds on
this car through the use of more
advanced materials as well as sculpted
Aerodyne
and they're saying a 25% bump in mpeg-4
what is not a small car outer on the
back they've also used those Reaper
portion to body elements to bring it
down for a lower load floor they've got
a gesture controlled automatic tailgate
that's also a big trend in the world of
utility vehicles some interesting cabin
Tech works the option of some tablets in
the second row you might say okay
watching movies that's nothing new but
this one has entertainment and nav on
those tablets that can also tie into the
front so finally your backseat driver
can do something more than just drive
you nuts they can actually help
hopefully in a meaningful way and what's
app maybe showing up as part of the MMI
application stack for messaging that now
moves in carmakers beyond SMS and
calling people who buy SUVs have
typically always thought they were in
the safest seat on the road but that
wasn't always the case however now
things have changed see who has the last
laugh when seen that on cars continues
some years ago people were misguided in
believing their SUV was safer than a car
since a lot of them were not unstable by
comparison but now thanks to
improvements in and ubiquity of advanced
Stability control something interesting
has happened SUVs are now clearly among
the safest vehicles by several measures
the IIHS actually finds it from 2006 to
2009 there were only seven models of
vehicles that had zero driver fatalities
per million vehicles registered a year
four of those seven or SUV the most of
any vehicle class and generally across
all measures of driver deft IIHS finds
that SUVs are twice as safe for the
driver than being in the average car it
pays to double check the SUV your
driving has stability control of course
and know the new realities of the safest
kind
welcome back to see net on cars I'm
Brian Cooley still here at the North
American International Auto Show in
Detroit let me take you on a lightning
round a really fast loop around the hall
to show you about a handful of car
makers I think that are doing
interesting things let's go Mercedes
launched their g le coupe which for all
the world looks like a baby BMW x6
they'll go all the way up to a 577
horsepower twin turbo v8 AMG version but
for most people
maybe the 350 d diesel makes a little
more sense and around April or so we'll
get a more conventional non coupe
version of this same vehicle without the
rakish roofline but in either case gles
now replace the old ML and they'll be
hitting the streets summer of 2015
board was all about performance at
Detroit this year the shelby gt350r
elevates the new mustang to its most
track sharp level it's got a 5.2 liter
v8 but no turbos no superchargers still
gets around 500 horse and about 400
pound-feet of torque and uses something
called a flat plane crank shaft real
performance tech that along with very
exotic carbon fiber wheels and no air
conditioning or radio unless you insist
make this a very rarefied beast and the
new Ford GT stole the show in many ways
it's the latest version of Ford's
classic 1960s race car and it's really
got some serious power 600 horsepower
from just a 3.5 liter EcoBoost engine in
the middle is a carbon fiber tub with
aluminum sub frames around it an active
pushrod suspension it's basically a race
car you can register the new Chevy Volt
revises the look of that car for the
first time and it's substantially
cleaner and more subtle it's now up to
50 miles of range in pure evie mode and
volt buyers really pay attention to that
that's a gain of around a dozen miles
before it kicks into a hybrid mode and
it can seat five finally thanks to the
fact that the battery hump in the back
seat is now submerged and just to make
for some fanatic fun
Chevy also sholde a new concept called
the bolt it's their pure electric car
project with 200 miles of range and a
look and color than a rather reminiscent
of a BMW i3 they say you'll be able to
get one for about $30,000 after
government credits but the bigger cloud
over its horizon is the specter of
continued really cheap gas
this Buick Evanier concept was vying for
what may be the best-looking shape on
the floor this year now it's all styling
exercise but you can see they've really
pulled in a Buick Classic that line
across the top side of the body it's a
Buick spear if you will I don't know if
this is gonna come to market in any
shape remotely like this but I can hope
and Buick hasn't sold a convertible
since the Reata went away in 1991 but
that's about to change
here is a reworked version of a European
GM car that's gonna be called the
cascada here convertibles tend to do
well in rising economic times and this
one's tidy and trim so should be
relatively economical on both purchase
and operation but a quick look at the
rear seat and trunk space may make it a
bit of a tough sell or at least a second
car and the Acura NSX wasn't literally
new at Detroit but to see it in final
production trim was this is it still
mid-engine like the original but now
with three electric motors tossed in one
between the engine and the trans axle in
the back and another pair detailed to
run the front wheels for wickedly fast
and intuitive all-wheel drive
they say custom orders will start in the
summer around 150,000 dollars and you
may be lucky enough to see one pull up
to you next to a stoplight by fall of
2015 in a moment we leave Detroit for
much warmer climes and more car tech
went CNET on cars returned
we seen a lot of technology here at the
North American International Auto Show
but there's another Auto Show that kicks
off the year each January CES the
Consumer Electronics Show we had 10 of
these same car makers there and a
handful of them impressed me what they
were doing
VW's had some pretty ghastly cabin Tech
over the years but they're trying to fix
that now here's a giant mock-up of
what's in that the VW Golf R Touch
notice at the top is about a twelve
point eight inch master screen with most
of your information display below it
would be about an 8 inch touch panel
we're mostly virtual controls we'll go
this is not unlike what Honda and Acura
do with two screens one larger one
smaller but a very different flavor and
this lower panel by the way is
indicative of how VW is trying to move
to get rid of all switches and rotary
knobs in the car those physical tactile
controls from the old days if you will
it's debatable whether an all touch
interface is better worse just a lateral
perhaps from the traditional knobs and
switches also here and related to this
we're looking for who's going to install
carplay Android auto and mirror length
mirror links more of a dark horse but
Volkswagen here talking about moving
forward with mirror link which not a lot
of other car makers are doing then
addition to all those touchscreen
innovations that VW is showing is also a
new idea of controlling interface not by
touch but by gesture this has been tried
on the auto industry a couple times
we've seen it here at CES before it
keeps getting better and we're getting
to the point where it seems to be
nuanced enough look how this works
there's a sensor here right behind the
gearshift that will pick up my hand the
home position to go into gesture mode is
to hold your hand there open and it'll
recognize open fingers and then you've
just got five simple gestures not a lot
of complicated things you're not going
to do typing of text in the air or
anything you have a left a right you can
push down you can select with your
finger like you might imagine clicking
on a mouse now this is not replacing all
the gestures in a car it's primarily for
the more coarse ones and the ones that
are very commonly used volume change
climate change zoom in and out of a map
or go back and forth in a menu to select
something on his own now this is not set
for production any time soon but we're
starting to see how Volkswagen is
starting to really think differently
about how they do their interface
you may recall that when GM first
brought out built-in 4G through OnStar I
was kind of disappointed it was mostly a
hot spot in your car service but I don't
find that interesting now it's getting
more interesting unique custom built in
services in the car powered by 4G in
this case here's one called
OnStar at your service based on where
you are or where your programs should go
in the nav rig they're gonna come up
with offers that supposedly are gonna be
smart based on where you're going and
also based on your interests they're
playing my tune they're showing a demo
here of Dunkin Donuts coupons popping up
I'm in they would also work with
RetailMeNot the big online coupon
discount site to bring those offers in
based on where you are and where you're
going you could also book a hotel at the
last minute while you're driving along
through Priceline so in that case you do
get an operator involved now the Devils
in the details of course how well this
is elegantly executed how well it's
customized to what I'm really doing and
not just nagging me we'll see when this
hits the market how well they've worked
those nuances let me also show you how
they want to use 4G to make you a better
driver
this one's called smart driver
assessment what this does is utilize the
4G connection in the car to harvest all
kinds of data points about how you drive
and do so for a long time 90 days is the
snapshot they take that's not even a
snapshot that's a big look that is cloud
service processed by OnStar and after 90
full days of you allowing the service to
see how you drive then they send you a
report they email it to you as well as
giving you tips along the way through
the vehicles interface how you could
drive better it could be braking
steering accelerator behavior the way
you travel at a certain speed in certain
zone that's one part then if you agree
to and only your permission they can
upload that to at this point one
insurance company to qualify you for an
insurance discount now this is getting
into the area of pay as you drive or
usage based insurance you don't need a
4G connection for that a lot of the
insurance companies will give you a
little wireless dongle that goes into
your obd2 port but this is making it
more integrated into the vehicle and
using the 4G to a cloud service to
really crunch a lot of data about how
you drive not just some nuggets
consumers were weary of pay as you drive
a few years ago but the trends have been
getting pretty healthy a lot of folks
say you know what if I get a meaningful
discount I'm willing to let it happen
now let's talk about something
interesting on carplay and android auto
now here at Hyundai they're doing
something a little different as they
roll out toward getting it in showrooms
with most car makers you buy a car that
already has nabbed an elaborate media
and all of that and then you add car
player Android auto to it and you've got
some duplication you feel like maybe
you're paying for more than you need
Hyundai's got an interesting strategy
they've announced here starting in their
16 model year cars they're gonna have
this fairly basic display audio system
here they're trying to thin it down and
bring the cost down if you don't have a
phone plugged in it's pretty basic AM FM
bluetooth streaming and calling and
that's really the all the bells and
whistles but then when you plug in your
smartphone Android or iOS it pulls up
car player Android auto and brings in
all that incredible richness you didn't
buy it two or three times those
functions are only coming from your
phone so you're really leveraging the
services and connections of your phone
in a less duplicate of way and not
redundant with what the car maker has in
there as well it's not a very efficient
and elegance this allows them to move it
to a lower price point they think is
going to apply to 60 plus percent of
their sales volume in the 16 model year
we gotta wait a little while for this
one in the meantime by mid 2015 Hyundai
will roll out carplay and android auto
but stacked on top of head units that
already have their nav and apps
now here at CES Tim Stevens and I just
hosted a really good next big thing
panel on virtual and augmented reality
and one of the areas where I'm most
excited about AR augmented reality is
coming up in cars especially in these
head-up displays that are getting very
popular this one doesn't just show you
information statically on the windshield
or through the windshield it puts it in
context on the road let me tell you what
I'm seeing here there's a warning about
a car that just crossed my path and the
warning followed the car as I go along
now I'm getting indication about lane
drift and it's putting a colored line
right on the lane where I'm drifting
there's a traffic signal right in front
of me perhaps I didn't look up and see
the traffic signal it's put it right in
front of me so I don't miss the red
lights and here comes a car cutting me
off rat bastard and the vehicle showed
me the corner of the car to really
emphasize that's where the impact point
might be coming here is a navigation
prompt showing me one exit to take and
it's kind of like that fidelity
advertisement it's putting in this case
a blue line on the road none of this is
coming to production tomorrow this is
pretty elaborate stuff in terms of
projection technology and of course
making sure the data is right so it's
not giving you any false cues that
matters when you're on the road but I'm
glad to see a are coming to cars I can
barely think of a place where it matters
more BMW showed new ways to use laser
headlights
aside from reaching 1,800 feet they can
elaborately beam shape so you can stay
on high beam while making cutouts in the
projection to avoid oncoming drivers
these lights can work with the nav
system to spill light out where the car
is going next
even before the wheel turns they can
work with the driver assist cameras to
call out pedestrians and animals on the
side of the road by lighting them and
BMW show tail lights that use OLED
technology for extreme flexibility of
the light itself but also flexibility in
the pattern by which it illuminates even
if this tech were ready today though
u.s. regulations lagged far behind it in
terms of approval
hope you enjoy this special edition of
seen that on cars thanks for watching if
you know someone who would like this
show and maybe isn't watching why don't
you let them know send them over to seen
that on cars.com we'd appreciate it I'll
see you next time we check the tack
