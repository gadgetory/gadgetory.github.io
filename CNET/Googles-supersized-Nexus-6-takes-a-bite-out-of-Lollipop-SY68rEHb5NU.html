first smartphone to natively lunch with
Android 5.0 lollipop hello everybody I'm
Lynn la for Cena and today we're going
to check out google's highly anticipated
flagship of the year the nexus 6 try
saying that three times fast with this
new iteration google takes a huge leap
and equips its device with a five point
nine six inch display similar to the
samsung galaxy note 4 it has a 1440p
quad HD resolution but it has a lower
pixel density at 493 ppi even so the
AMOLED screen is bright immersive and
ultra sharp but given the displays
bigger size that means the rest of the
phone is big too powering the handset is
a top-of-the-line quad core 2.7
gigahertz Snapdragon 805 processor from
Qualcomm the processor includes the
Adreno 420 GPU and together they power
everything from daily productivity tasks
to graphics intensive games with ease
there's also a non-removable three point
22 ampere hour battery like its
predecessors the Nexus 6 has wireless
charging capabilities but it can also
now quick charge with a specialized
turbo charger from Qualcomm the battery
has an estimated seven hours of internet
usage time on LTE and you could talk
continuously for up to 24 hours for your
photography needs the handset sports a
13 megapixel camera and a 2-megapixel
front-facing shooter like past Nexus
phones Google keeps the camera interface
pretty simple you can shoot panoramas
and photo spheres as well as record
Ultra HD 4k video there's no native
gallery app anymore so images are all
saved automatically to Google's photo
app as with each new Nexus handset
google officially launches its updated
mobile OS dubbed Android 5.0 lollipop
the OS features a brand new interface
called material design animated colorful
and at times even playful material can
be seen in almost every aspect of the
phone gmail and the calendar app
underwent some of the more dramatic
changes with a ladder receiving a nice
parallax scrolling and whimsical images
the most obvious characteristic of
material
this motif of cards which we've seen
before in Google now overview which was
previously known as recent apps
integrates these cards giving users more
context to their open apps in addition
if you're doing more than one task in a
nap overview would designate individual
tabs for each task for example in Gmail
it'll show you your inbox as well as a
separate tab for a draft of an email you
may be writing other lollipop goodies
include notifications on the lockscreen
guest mode and screen pinning which both
give others limited access to your phone
and the ability to launch do not disturb
settings via the volume rocker there are
tons more features inside android 5.1
pop so be sure to check out other cnet
videos for the full breakdown in the US
the Nexus 6 is available on all four
major US carriers as well as US cellular
it's also sold through the Google Play
Store starting at six hundred and
forty-nine dollars for the 32 gig model
and six hundred and ninety-nine dollars
for the 64 gig keeping in mind that the
device does not have expandable memory
google has reported that the handset
will be available in 28 other countries
in the next following weeks with LTE
variants coming in countries both inside
and outside the Americas again I'm Lynn
and you've been taking a look at the
google nexus 6
