look at the new 2013 version of apple's
13-inch macbook pro the model with
Retina Display they actually still make
the 13-inch non retina MacBook Pro
that's the only laptop Apple still has
it has an optical drive in it but the
primary product is definitely this guy
and for the macbook air line the primary
product is the 13-inch macbook air so
you're really weighing those two very
carefully you know this is not quite as
thin and light as the macbook air you do
get four more powerful options did you
get that super high resolution better
than 1080p display and of course both
the air and the macbook pro all the
different sizes now have Intel's latest
fourth-generation core i series CPUs
otherwise known as has well and you do
get a little bit of a performance boost
their you get some better onboard
graphics these have Intel's pretty close
to the best built-in graphics angela has
the iris graphics but you also get the
most important thing which is a serious
battery life boosts we saw that in the
in the Haswell macbook air earlier in
2013 apple says that you should get
about nine hours of use out of this
versus eight hours and the 15th version
of the retina macbook pro and of course
you get a no 2 dot 11ac you get
Thunderbolt to get USB 3.0 pretty much
all the things that current macbooks
have or that current premium ultrabook
style laptops have I'd say this is a
little bit outside of the category of an
ultrabook but it's certainly small
enough to carry around every day if you
don't mind just a little bit of weight
if you're a super lightweight traveler
you probably want to go with that
macbook air instead but if you need a
high resolution a lot of people who want
that better than 1080p resolution these
days this is one of the smallest
lightest ways to get it especially with
of course Oh as 10 this comes with
Mavericks the latest version
pre-installed starting from its launch
so you get the new features in the new
operating system it's interesting to see
that sort of match up with Windows 8.1
launching it just about the same time so
anyone buying a new laptop this fall
whether it's a PC or Mac gets new
hardware and a new operating system i'm
dan ackerman and that is the 2013 13
inch apple macbook pro</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
