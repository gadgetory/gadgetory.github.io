I'm Brian Cooley from cnet always insert
to the next big thing we're on the cusp
of the payoff of years of VR hype thanks
to three head-mounted displays oculus
rift HTC vive and sony playstation vr
they've been coming forever it seems now
they're priced and locked for release
and on their shoulders we will get a
chance to end mass sample a completely
new medium oculus rift is going to be
about six hundred dollars not including
some motion controllers you're going to
want pricing on those is still TBD and
it has to hook up to a pretty powerful
Windows PC HTC vive also tethers to a
personal computer it might go beyond
windows to mac and linux as well price
is higher at 799 us but does include the
motion tracking that would be optional
with oculus and the inexpensive one if
you can call it that is the sony
playstation vr at just four hundred
dollars us plus a PlayStation camera you
probably have that goes with the
PlayStation game console that you also
need to power it all three of these as
you can tell are tethered by wires to
these powerful basis of computers or
game consoles now once you get any of
these rigs almost certainly the reason
you will do so and the first thing
you'll do with it will be gaming I don't
just mean gaming I mean immersing
yourself in gaming you're in the game
you're moving through the game you are
using your hands and arms to pick up
things and manipulate the environment of
the game like I said earlier this is not
just an increase in the quality of video
it's a break to a new medium now as
important market as gaming is there's
one that's even more delicious to
consider and that is VR for sports
that's the kind of content where the
immersive nature of this technology
makes total sense and that content
justifies long usage or where times but
that long usage could be anything from
fatiguing to nauseating we just don't
know yet and it depends on the yet
untested prospect of live streaming VR
the other major in-depth use case for VR
would likely be movies and television
shows again long-form content appeals to
a huge number of people but the problem
there is it's a completely new
storytelling an envisioning process when
you put someone into a VR environment it
has to be worth it it can't just be VR
of what is basically one place
to look the whole scene has to make
sense that you are going there and that
of course also means you're going to
have your viewers looking all different
places they will in a sense follow their
own storyline that's a very new world
for the writers producers and editors of
Hollywood and everywhere else that
creates long-form high budget content in
some we just don't know yet the highs or
the lows the top or the bottom of the
size of the VR market one Specter does
lurk over its shoulder no consumer
technology has ever gone to mass scale
that required you to wear something on
your face this will either be the latest
one not two or the first one to know
what's next at cnet com / next big thing
