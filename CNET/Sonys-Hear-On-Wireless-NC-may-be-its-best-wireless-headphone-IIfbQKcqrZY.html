cancelling headphone is the same price
as boses QuietComfort 35 it offers
similar features in a well-designed
headphone that comes in five different
color options some of which are very
eye-catching including this blue version
here which looks more like teal to me
I've been a little underwhelmed by
Sony's wireless headphone offerings in
the past but this headphone maybe it's
best Bluetooth headphone to date and
arguably the best headphone in the
company's current Iran lineup the
headphone is very comfortable but at
10.25 ounces or 290 grams it's a little
heavier than the Bose and isn't quite as
comfortable as that model but it's close
the headphone folds up into an included
carrying case but it doesn't fold flat
so the case ends up being a little bulky
and these aren't the most comfortable
headphones to walk around with wearing
around your neck volume and track
controls are on the right ear cup and
you can opt to turn the noise canceling
on or off or plug in a cord and use
these as a wired headphone sony says
it's automatic ai noise cancelling
function constantly analyzes
environmental ambient sound components
and automatically selects the most
effective noise canceling mode I thought
the noise cancelling was excellent
though a touch less effective than the
Bose is it also makes for a good headset
for making cell phone calls it has two
built-in microphones one outside and one
inside the housing battery life is rated
at 20 hours sound wise the sony arguably
sounds slightly better than the bose
qc25
it's well balanced with good clarity and
tight bass that isn't overpowering I
also thought it sounded pretty natural
for a bluetooth headphone it may not
quite match the sound of Sennheiser
momentum to wireless headphone but it is
one of the best sounding wireless
headphones with active noise canceling
is it better than the Bose well the bose
has a slight edge in comfort design the
noise cancelling but this sony arguably
has the edge in sound quality however
you look at it though it's an excellent
wireless headphone I'm David Carr for
