series has not been quite the ultimate
driving machine that we've come to
expect I felt that cars been a little
bit diluted and in fact the last time I
drove didn't feel much different than a
Camry fortunately somebody of dmw
realized this and came up with the all
new 4-series this new model is the
sports car this is the ultimate driving
machine this is the one that the series
drivers are going to want to have of
course that only comes in a coupe
version which lets you know it's for
serious drivers and being a BMW we know
what's under the hood this being the
435i of course we have a 3 litre
straight-six with twin turbochargers
that makes about 300 horsepower there's
also going to be a 428 and that'll have
the new four-cylinder with turbochargers
that'll do 240 horsepower the forest
series will also get BMWs latest series
of cabin electronics this is the newest
I drive system it's an evolution of the
current one the dial the center dial now
has a touchpad on top so you can enter
in letters just by scrolling tracing
them on the top of that dial that's a
new innovation from BMW and it sort of
copies without he's been doing with the
touchpad thing to a BMW fans of course
are going to be waiting for the m4
version of this car but that's not it
the NW has this 4 series with a lot of
the M Performance Package stuff on it
but this is not the actual m4 we'll have
to wait and see what that one looks like
when it comes out
