isn't sold in the US these days because
it doesn't meet us crash standards kind
of strange for a vehicle that's always
been so tough and rugged it's like a
little vault on wheels they're ready to
bring it back this is one of the DC 100
concepts the idea here is to bring this
forward in two different ways one's kind
of sporty Cabriolet like the other one
more traditional defender like this
among the high-tech features I'm looking
at one right here supposedly
self-cleaning paint I want to see that
work after you go through a big old
muddy gully full of rocks right now
technologies in the front of the car
that look forward are interesting they
have two things once called terrain I
get it terrain it's a scanning
technology that builds a 3d virtual map
of what the terrain is in front of you
and the car can say you know what you're
coming up on a lump or a gully that I
can't deal with why don't you go this
way or that way and there's one called
Wade a2 technology that will figure out
how deep the water is you think you're
about to forward without caulking the
car and tell you if you can actually do
that they say the car can get through
750 millimeters of depth that's what
that's about six and a half long
cigarettes whatever that comes out to
what is that about a yard here's one
right out of double-oh-seven there's
apparently a button inside the car they
envisioned as extending the spikes on
the tires I mean they're not spikes to
kill people but just to get some grip
inside all kinds of interesting
technology check out this pop-up display
we've seen this in cars even in
production right now but if this goes
into production this would actually snap
out it's like a tablet you carry with
you to do navigation on foot to continue
your journey after you run into
something you can't drive over anymore
8-speed automatic transmission right
here part of an efficiency message I
don't want to put any big old horsey v-8
3mv sixes in these cars anymore they're
talking about 2-liter hybrid motors or
even plug-in hybrids and the drive line
on this vehicle would physically
disconnect when you're not using
all-wheel drive to further cut losses no
place to put a key on this car that I
see and even when to production there
wouldn't be because they
an rfid adventure key which would
obviously be a lot better to have in
your pocket when you're out in the mud
and the wet then one of those actual
physical electronic keys now this is a
vision for maybe 2015 it's not gonna be
in your Land Rover showroom anytime soon
but it does bring back the defender
brand which they love to have on the
showroom floor in the US as well as
around the world</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
