welcome to the apple Viper all the good
and bad stuff inside the world of Apple
you know what this week's show is all
about Apple fanboys and tech enthusiasts
everywhere you can all agree it's the
end of an era after steve jobs announced
his resignation now in his letter to
apple's board of directors in community
Steve wrote I've always said if they're
ever came a day where I could no longer
meet my duties and expectations as Apple
CEO I would be the first to let you know
and unfortunately that day has come
Steve Jobs will remain active at Apple
as chairman of the board and interim CEO
Tim Cook will now succeed him as Apple's
new CEO now no one will be able to
replace apples visionary and number one
salesman but don't get too worried the
big as road map has probably already
been planned out for the next five years
and jobs plans on being involved in
developing major future products and
strategy but let's take a moment to
recognize the man who revolutionized the
pc industry the music industry with the
ipod and digital distribution with
itunes the smartphone industry with the
iphone and the post-pc era with the ipad
now he also won't let flash play on that
same iPad but come on I'm going to put
that aside and let's just remember some
of the moments out you shared
sometimes the honesty's too and I have
to close my eyes I i wanna hold you till
like I toy bald prick
wrong
hold you till the fear in me subsides
I told myself only the private okay well
I'm good okay now we should overlook his
impact on the movie industry with Pixar
stable of billion dollar hits and apples
impact on the retail industry with the
highest sales per square foot that's
better than Tiffany coach and everyone
else now the day after newly appointed
CEO Tim Cook sent a letter to Apple
employees obtained by ARS technica to
rally the troops saying I want you to be
confident that Apple is not going to
change Steve built a company culture
that is unlike any other in the world
and we are going to stay true to that
it's in our DNA so we'll see how much of
essays DNA will really be able to help
carry the company into the future now
Apple is all about his products and we
talked a whole lot about the iphone 5
last week according to The Wall Street
Journal Sprint will be offering the
iphone 5 when it launches later this
year in mid-october now the report says
it will debut at the same time as AT&amp;amp;T
and Verizon and Sprint will also be
picking up the iphone 4 as well in
addition that mattress is also reporting
that the next-gen iphone week coming to
t-mobile USA as well which would bring
the iphone to all four major carriers in
the US this year now at least one
developer has found evidence that
confirms Apple is testing apps with the
next iPhone operating two distinct
network codes from both verizon and AT&amp;amp;T
pointing to a single iPhone model that's
compatible with both gsm and cdma also
if you want to learn even more about the
man behind the apple logo which we've
talked a lot about Walter Isaacson's
authorized biography titled Steve Jobs
with a cover as minimalistic as can be
we'll be coming out on November 21st
bumping it up from its original march
2012 date and publisher Simon &amp;amp; Schuster
says the biography will also include the
resignation from Steve's point of view
Jobs has made no subject off-limits for
this book compiling hundreds of
interviews with SJ himself and the
people around them so you should get
some juicy tidbits in there now there's
been so many things said about Steve
Jobs in Apple but we wanted to leave you
with a clip from one of his recent
keynotes that really gives you a peek
into the heart and mind of one of our
generations greatest
mint and a person who at one time or
another has influenced everyone's
experience with technology simply put
it's the end of an era thanks for
watching and we'll see you guys next
week so I've said this before I thought
it was worth repeating it's in Apple's
DNA that technology alone is not enough
that its technology married with liberal
arts married with the humanities that
yields us the result that makes a heart
sink and nowhere is that more true than
in these post-pc devices and a lot of
folks in this tablet market are rushing
in and they're looking at this as the
next PC the hardware and the software
done by different companies and they're
talking about speeds and feeds just like
they did with PCs and our experience in
every bone in our body says that that is
not the right approach to this that
these are post-pc devices that need to
be even easier to use than a pc that
need to be even more intuitive than a PC
and where the software and the hardware
and the applications need to intertwine
in an even more seamless way than they
do on a PC and we think we're on the
right track with this we think we have
the right architecture not just in
silicon but in the organization to build
these kinds of products and so I think
we stand a pretty good chance of being
pretty competitive in this market and I
hope that what you've seen today gives
you a good feel for that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
