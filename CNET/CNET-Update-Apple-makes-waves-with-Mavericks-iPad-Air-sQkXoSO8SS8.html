making waves with Mavericks I'm Bridget
Carey and this is your cnet update the
new full-size iPad goes by a new name

more powerful this nearly 10 inch screen
has a Retina display with a more narrow
side bezel and it only weighs one pound
before it was nearly 2 pounds in sight
there's an a7 chip which is the same
that's in the iPhone 5s it's 64 bit and
it comes with the m7 motion coprocessor
in short it's got twice the processing
power as the previous model and graphics
are twice as fast apple also improve the
cameras on the front and back the ipad
air comes in silver and Space Gray and
it starts at five hundred dollars for a
16 gig model with Wi-Fi only but these
days 16 gigs really doesn't cut it if
you want to load videos on a tablet
you'll be adding a hundred dollars to
the price for every jump up and storage
and if you want to add the option for a
cellular connection tack on another
hundred and thirty dollars to the price
it'll go on sale november first along
with new covers and cases apple is still
keeping the old ipad 2 around for four
hundred dollars which happens to be the
same price for the brand new upgraded
ipad mini with retina display this new
iPad Mini is four times faster than last
year's model and eight times faster at
graphics processing also available in
silver or Space Gray it's coming out
later in November apple also made
several software announcements the iwork
and ilife suite of productivity apps are
now included for free when you buy a new
iOS device or a new mac laptop or
desktop Apple's also offering up a
document sharing feature for iwork it
lets multiple users edit and collaborate
on a document apple also revealed
details of its new high-end powerful mac
pro desktop machine this thing is a
powerhouse of a workstation primarily
for people who are serious about editing
videos or music and it starts at three
grand this new Mac Pro will be assembled
in the US and it'll be available before
the end of the year also getting up

improve battery life and with the
upgrades come a price drop the 13-inch
model starts at thirteen hundred dollars

sale but even if you're not in the
market for a new mac computer current
mac users can feel like they're getting
something new with a free upgrade to the
OS 10 mavericks operating system that
