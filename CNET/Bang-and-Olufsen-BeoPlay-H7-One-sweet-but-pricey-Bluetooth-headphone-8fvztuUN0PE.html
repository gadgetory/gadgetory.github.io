premium full-size wireless bluetooth
headphone this is bangin Olson's do play
eighty seven which carries a list price
of $450 but can be had online for 400
it's a swanky headphone there's no doubt
about that
it's headband is crafted out of anodized
aluminum and the plush memory foam ear
cups are covered with lambskin leather I
found it very comfortable but your ears
will get steamy wearing it on hot days
Beano makes it on your wireless model
the h8 which adds active
noise-cancelling
a feature this model leaves off however
it does have similar touch controls to
the h8 there on the ear cup and they
allow you to advance tracks forward and
back with a swipe as well as a just
volume and answer calls I like the sound
of the headphone its overall well
balanced with tight bass and good
clarity and is pretty open for a closed
back headphone the only issue I detected
was a little peak in the high end that
created some siblings at certain
frequencies there's just a little too
much sizzle from the hi-hat cymbals in
some tracks but apart from that it's an
excellent wireless headphone it's very
comfortable and offers good battery life
at around 20 hours it can also be used
as a wired headphone with the included
cord that's the Bo play h7 in a nutshell
it's definitely worth checking out if
you can afford it I'm David Carr noise
