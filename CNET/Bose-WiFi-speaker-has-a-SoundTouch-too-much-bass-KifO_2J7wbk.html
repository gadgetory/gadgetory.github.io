flagship tabletop Wi-Fi speaker and it's
the same prices so Knossos flagship to
play five they both cost five hundred
dollars so why would you choose the bose
over the market leader the answer is
that the bose has some features the
Sonos lacks given the bose makes the
most popular bluetooth speaker it's no
surprise to find bluetooth on the
santosh 30 the second convenience
feature is these shortcut buttons which
you can program to play a favorite radio
station playlist or whatever you want it
also has a handy display meanwhile the
Sonos just has a play button and volume
controls and thirdly the bose comes with
a remote which is handy if you don't
feel like digging around for your
telephone sound quality between the two
rivals is different as it expect the
Sonos has a smoother sound that sounds
better with more genres of music
meanwhile the bose has a presence heavy
sound that suits closed mic vocals and
jazz but can sound a little too bright
with punk or pop especially over
bluetooth but try to make a lot of bass
out of small cabinets more like both
sound exaggerated the Sonos is more
successful depending on the type of
track I found the bass in the Bose could
actually distort which didn't happen on
the Sonos so you may want to turn the
bass EQ down little if you listen to a
lot of Skrillex or similar dance music
the Bose offers a lot of convenience
features and is much easier to set up
than it used to be but with less
streaming services and a very specific
exciting sound it's very good but not
quite as recommendable as the Sonos play
