is the Frigidaire Professional six
sliced toaster oven as far as design
goes the Frigidaire looks professional
it has the stainless steel it has an LCD
display it's its overall really nice to
look at as far as its looks its kind of
comparable with the Breville Smart Oven
which is about two hundred and fifty
dollars and this guy is only about 180
so as far as style you're getting kind
of a bargain
also it's really easy to use it has a
lot of features that are just simple you
just turn the different dials to adjust
temperature and and you're good to go
the Frigidaire also has a lot of the
same features as the more expensive
Breville and Cuisinart toaster ovens and
the frigidaire even came with a pizza
pan that can cook pizzas up to 12 inches
so I had really high hopes for it very
unfortunately the Frigidaire
consistently underperformed on almost
every test we conducted for the toast
setting it worked really really well for
both light and medium but for the dark
toast setting it toasted for 12 or 13
minutes and after about the eighth
minute of toasting it actually started
smoking and filling up the whole room
with smoke so much so that we had to
open the doors and kind of get our fan
going so we didn't shut off the smoke
detectors and it produced this we also
tried toasting frozen waffles on the
dark toast setting and got this so not
even a frozen waffle or probably frozen
bread would need to bake for 13 minutes
in a toaster oven and most of the other
food we tested had kind of a similar
result the pizza was soggy the chicken
wasn't great it just kind of overall
underperformed on most of our tests so I
can't say that I would recommend the
frigidaire to anyone if you're shopping
in this price range I would really
suggest the Panasonic flash express
instead it's about a hundred and fifty
bucks and it performs way better or if
you want something with similar specs
that kind of
the same has the same classy look I
would suggest the Breville Smart Oven
it's gonna be a bit more pricey at
around 250 but definitely worth it I'm
