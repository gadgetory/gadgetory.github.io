it's almost a third of their sales add
it to the little brother RDX and you're
basically talking about the company
right there so when they did this
revision for 2014 they had to get it
right it's still highly recognizable but
there's been a lot of things change on
the tech and underneath let's drive this
2014 all-wheel drive with the advanced
and entertainment packages and check the
temp now you'll notice the MDX is still
very much the same kind of look a little
softer and thicker to my eyes a little
more how do you be honest it's two
inches longer but it didn't go to
legroom for the front row passengers
more to the rear cargo space now to my
mind it is like so many vehicles in its
class a two and a half row vehicle there
is a so-called third row of seating but
it's actually seating luckily if you do
need to use it for like groceries it's
easier to get to now they have an easier
sliding second row technology now if you
haven't been an acura lately this is
pretty cool stacked large LCDs and
they've revised the interface rather
substantially this down here on the
bottom is a really good-looking and
major improvement over what Honda Acura
used to do for presenting media and such
here your sources will take a look at
these AM and FM with HD radio satellite
radio optical disc that's CD and DVD on
this rig 15 gigabyte hard drive USB that
can also handle iPod bluetooth streaming
Pandora and aha support are built into
the car and of course aux Jack's front
and rear as you can see touchscreen here
not up here the one above is driven by
either menu buttons down here or this
kick turning click controller whatever
you're listening to to audio systems
base or Els audio which is a big deal
with Acura and of course you've got a
lot of settings for that including
different types of surround subwoofer
there are speakers in the ceiling for
the rear entertainment system they've
really jack this one up and you can't
see this but there's haptic feedback on
the screen puny little buzz or a bump
when you touch something but I haven't
found that it makes a big difference in
the vehicle
it can all get to be a bit complicated
though there are two or three ways to do
almost everything in this car here's the
one that infuriates me the most it's an
example of over interface this is where
you go to set the seat heater in some
cars you got a little plastic switch on
this one
you've got the most amazing multi-level
there's one ribbon for heat a ribbon
below that for cooling and then you've
got it off in an automatic mode that I
guess follows the cabin temp too much
now the navigation interface has not
been dramatically revised but I still
struggle with it for a couple of reasons
they've got this thing called Acura link
now under local search was a little
pokey but in this case I was trying to
get to the Fairmont Hotel in San
Francisco I know how to get there I
wanted the best route under traffic
conditions so I searched for Fairmont
first of all you can't do any of this
while you're moving so neither myself or
anyone else in the car can enter using
the keyboard so then I was stuck with
voice command after the be spell the
place for category name one letter at a
time
FAI r mo NT Belle the place for category
me one letter at a time H o te L press
the talk button to select the command
later seriously fa ir m ont pardon no
command was heard press the top button
and say a command
it didn't ask for a command it asked for
a place name and then when I gave it a
place name it wanted a command yeah this
was the most infuriating system ever for
entering a destination while driving
voice simply does not work and it's
fully locked out when you're rolling and
even when I pulled over used a knob
entered Fairmont and specified hotels it
didn't find the one in San Francisco it
found a bunch all over the country the
one in San Francisco is world-famous how
can it not find that especially when it
knows where I am big fail bottom line
it's gonna be a big draw so that we can
you drive this car are you gonna use
that map or this nap this works better
and that one is supposedly less
distracting I don't think so
cuz I was really infuriated while I was
driving
now back here is one of the new breed of
more innovative larger entertainment
system first of all look at the screen
this is optional on the full trim MDX
but look at that thing it's 16 inches
super wide you say well why how much can
you stretch a DVD you see doesn't fill
up both the screen however what I can do
I can turn this into a dual screen
watching to things on there at once so I
hit this dual guy right here that moves
my DVD to the right I now choose my left
source I'm gonna go HDMI which is also
very cool and what I've got hooked up
there is my Android phone which has an
HDMI output port so there it is I'm
using mirroring mode on my Android OS
and there's the desktop of my phone
that's kind of interesting so this can
become kind of the ultimate remote
desktop as you're working in the back or
just go to YouTube and your phone
becomes your all-in-one entertainment
system right here on a nice big screen
first of all Acura gets some kind of an
award for the lowest opening hood that
I've ever shot under so pardon me
three and a half liter v6 down to the
three point seven in the last mdx 290
horse out of this guy 267 foot-pounds of
torque pretty good numbers direct
injection technology of course zero to
sixty for this roughly forty three
hundred pound crossover SUV is six and a
half seconds or so in the all-wheel
drive trim a six-speed automatic is your
only choice that's a relatively small
number of gears by today's standards and
the top two are overdrive part of that
mpg thing but I'm gonna want to see if
it hunts out the top gears too much
because I always hate that it kills
responsiveness
okay so about that MTG 18 city 27
highway 21 combined quite a bit better
than the outgoing model look at the old
car 3.7 v6 had 300 horsepower it was 10
more 270 foot-pounds three more but much
worse mpg 1621
okay on the road the MDX has a nice
smooth power it doesn't come on with a
sporty urgency no matter what I do
unless I get on the gears drop it down a
couple get in the sport mode and really
get some revs work you got to really
push it to get this thing to have any
urgency now let's get on the freeway to
have a little bit of fun with our
self-driving MDX which it just about is
so I've hit the main button here I've
got adaptive cruise on lane keep assist
on you can see right there I've got my
lane keeping divider lines and I'm also
going to switch on my adaptive cruise
control here and see if I get into that
motor it's really nice but you gotta
really prompt it to wake up okay so now
I'm going to drive along here in these
lane lines and I'm gonna let the car
steer its way between the lanes okay now
let's see if it'll take over there we go
now my hands are right by the wheel for
safety in case this thing doesn't get it
right I'm drifting a little bit in the
lane here and if you look in that
overhead camera I think you're gonna see
it start to steer to that little nibble
right there it's not dramatic see that
right there now it just beats to me you
must get your hands on the wheel and it
seems to defeat the self steering when
it does that so it doesn't let you drive
along for more than about ten seconds
like this coming into a left turn there
there you go that's a pretty good turn
it's making by itself that's crazy now
combine this with the adaptive cruise
where the car is working the accelerator
working the brakes quite pronouncedly
and you get a real taste of what at
least semi autonomous cars are gonna be
like now the other thing I'm done in
this car it's hard to demonstrate but
take my word for it if you get too close
to a vehicle in front of you it's gonna
flash a big light on the dash that says
break and it blinks an orange light in
the windshield like a head-up display
but it's just an orange light it also
has collision mitigating braking so it's
also going to help you or bring the car
to largely tough stop when it sees you
closing on something too hard not gonna
demonstrate that I guess in sum I came
away from this car expecting it would
house
a little more driving spirit and also
all this self-driving tech and ends up
having more self-driving tech than Jawad
a V as a driver's car our MDX is loaded
as I mention all-wheel drive with
advanced and entertainment packages
that's top of the stack so 57 for with
destination about the only option I
would add to go seen that style would be
LED fog lamps for a five and a half here
in just a tick under fifty eight grand
now if you want a lot of tech in the
cabin as well as helping to keep you in
good shape on the road this is one of
the class leaders</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
