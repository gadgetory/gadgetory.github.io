tablet beautiful thin oh wait sorry this
is the ipad 2 here you go new ipad
apple's new ipad a cena editor's choice
looks really really similar to the ipad
2 also that's the same price that's
always has starting at four hundred
ninety nine dollars it comes in white or
black and all the buttons and ports are
just where you'd think and if you want a
version that works on 18 t or Verizon's
4G cellular network you're going to have
to pay an extra one hundred and thirty
dollars up front but why pay full price
for something that looks like last
year's ipad well here's what all the
fuss is about it's the screen Apple took
their 9.7 inch screen and they doubled
its resolution and it's something that
no one has done before on a screen like
this it's one of those changes that
won't knock you over at first but once
you get used to it you're not going to
want to go back now one of the first
benefits you'll see is that text looks
great whether it's ebooks email or just
browsing the web words are very crisp
another obvious benefit is video
assuming you can spare a few gigs of
space you can now download all the way
up to 1080p video from iTunes and play
them on the screen and the crazy thing
is Apple actually has to scale up 1080p
video for this screen but really you
know if the ipad is made for games games
look outstanding your old games are
going to look like a film of fuzz has
been wiped off the screen and games that
are optimized for the new screen and the
new quad-core graphic processor look
really great some of these look like
they could be streaming off of your xbox
another feature you should be excited
about is the improved camera on the back
the one on the front it's still pretty
crummy but this one on the back uses a 5
megapixel backside illuminated sensor
and more importantly uses the same
five-element lens system that the iphone
has you also get autofocus face
detection and 1080p video recording with
image stabilization here's what a photo
looked like on the iPad 2
and here's that same photo on the new
iPad here's a 720p video from the ipad 2
and here's the automatically stabilized
one from the new ipad now i still feel
like a toddler when i use this thing to
take pictures but the fun of showing off
photos on this screen makes up for it if
you really want to get fancy you can
spend another ninety nine dollars on an
apple TV box and wirelessly beam your
photos and home movies over to your home
TV for a less fancy solution a $39 AV
Adapter and hdmi cable will mirror the
entire ipad screen to your TV so for me
that's the core of what makes the new
ipad such a great tablet even if it does
look like last year's ipad for more
