car over here this is gonna be our donor
car you got to pull them close enough
within a few feet so the cables can
reach from one to the other now where
are they reaching used to be always had
a battery in the front like on this
Subaru there it is this BMW puts the
battery in the back for weight
distribution as a result they give you
remote terminals one for positive and
one for negative here the battery is not
here but these are representatives of
it's hot and cold terminals now let's
get going now you need some jumper
cables the crews laughing at me because
I use these little thin ones they work
all the time so don't buy the macho
thing where you got to have cables that
big around I jump big-block Ford's with
these all the time here's how you do it
to keep from inadvertently welding your
car to the other one this is very
important start with one end take the
red clip and that goes to the red
terminal on the donor battery take the
other red and that goes to the dead Cars
red terminal now go back to your donor
car hook up your black to the black stud
on its battery and then on the dead car
go find a body ground not the battery
ground this is for safety reasons
because there's a possibility on some
cars you're gonna cause some of the
hydrogen gas coming off the battery to
explode many cars like this to have a
remote battery you have this remote
terminal like I mentioned now our
circuits closed notice the ground is
what made the circuit energized not the
positives that's what we closed last now
you're gonna go start your donor car
then just start the dead car
there you go now if using one of these
battery jump boxes that are kind of
handy it's a very similar process you
start off with it turned off and you go
to the positive with its positive and
then you go negative to close the
circuit then you turn it on and then go
start this car
disconnecting off negative positive out
they get the former dead car running you
want to make sure it's running for a
while fifteen to thirty minutes of
driving would be good that gives the
alternator the ability to give that
battery a pretty good charge then you're
gonna turn off and see if it starts
again if it doesn't that means you've
got a bum battery a crapped out
alternator or possibly a bad voltage
regulator time to do some repairs odds
are you're gonna be fun by the way
before you're done make sure you put the
covers back on any of these positive
terminals or battery studs because you
don't want that stuff shorting out with
whatever may be in here now you may have
noticed that jumper box is pretty bulky
weighs about 18 pounds so check out our
recent roundup of compact jumper
batteries while they are all pretty tidy
I would recommend getting one that has a
higher number of ass to make sure it can
turn over any size engine hold the
button down and bam we got a flashlight
this new breed costs between 100 and 200
bucks they can recharge off your car's
12-volt outlet during normal time and
can also be used to charge your mobile
devices on the go during those vast
majority of days when you don't need a
jumpstart plus they fit in a glove box
or a console which my jumper box won't
do</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
