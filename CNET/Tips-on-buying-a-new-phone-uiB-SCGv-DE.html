they should buy but what really matters
is what you care about most is it going
to be the price the camera battery life
the size of the phone or maybe something
completely different usually it comes
down to price and features which
honestly go hand in hand so the most
expensive phone is going to have all of
the extras probably the best camera
fastest processor and when you go down a
level the mid-range devices you're not
gonna see everything on there but
they're gonna have pretty good cameras
and the most important part is that
you're gonna get good performance for a
lot less than you would spend when you
drop down to the budget range you are
not going to be paying a lot for them
but they're going to provide you with
all the basics and essentials that you
need if you're trying to decide which
size phone you want your choices are
pretty much large or extra-large there
are a few smaller size phones on the
market but you're really limited their
camera technology is so good that even
on a mid-range phone you're still going
to get really great usable shots if all
you're doing is taking it phone out of
your pocket and just shooting what is
going to differentiate the camera for
you is what kind of extra shots you
might want to take
do you like portrait shots with depth
effect if you could take a lot of
selfies then you might want to find a
camera that has an extra wide lens so
that you can get more of your background
into the shot
you take a lot of photos if you've got a
lot of video stored on your device then
you're going to want to have a phone
that's got more storage there are two
ways to do this you can either buy a
phone with larger capacity which will be
more expensive or you can look for a
phone with a micro SD card slot for
external storage battery life is
extremely important because the last
thing you want is to be out and have
your phones I then there are all the
little things that you might care about
day to day for example it doesn't have a
headphone jack
then there's waterproofing a lot of
phones have it even budget phones might
be splash resistant oh boy
Android versus iPhone fewer a person who
likes to tinker around a lot and
customize your phone Android is a
natural fit if you have a ton of iTunes
inventory already then you probably want
to stick with in that ecosystem you can
switch between the two there are a lot
of great guides on CNN that explain how
to do that and if you go into a carrier
store they will also help you meet that
transition the best time to buy a new
phone is during a promotion you'll see a
lot of promotions with carriers
competing with one another or even at
stores another thing you can do to save
a little bit of money is when this
year's phone comes out consider buying
last year's model it's gonna still have
most of the same specs my number one
piece of advice when you're gonna buy a
phone is to do your research but then
most importantly go hands-on with it go
into a store often time to pick up the
phone and you know immediately yes this
is a good fit for me or like know this
one thing is going to drive me insane</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
