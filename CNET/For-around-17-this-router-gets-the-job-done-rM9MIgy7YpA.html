and router from tp-link this one is very
simple router would very dated hard way
it is a single band router working only
on a 2.4 to go frequency band and has on
paper the Wi-Fi speed up just 300
megabits per second now on the back it
has all the usual port for LAN ports and
11 pulled or internet port but all of
these ports are slow 100 megabit per
second ethernet so this tie-up hardware
was first introduced more than 10 years
ago in fact the hardware is so dated
that I had to ask myself three times why
should I review it and every single time
the answer was because it's very cheap
it's quite popular too that's right you
can have this router here for just about
seventeen dollars so let's say if it
turned out to be a bad deal well just
quit coffee for three days and you're
fine financially but the thing is it's
not a bad deal at least not for everyone
of course it cannot compare with other
routers I've review the last few years
but in testing it has a Wi-Fi range long
enough for a small apartment and the
Wi-Fi speed fast in app to do the
sharing of a modest broadband connection
so here's the thing if you live in a
small hole have a connection to the
internet that about 30 megabit per
second for download or less want to
share that with a few devices wirelessly
and most importantly you want to spend
as little as possible on a rabbit this
one is for you or you can also use this
as a spare router in case your main one
breaks for more on this one check out my
full review etsy.com now just to be
clear this is not a router for me and
not because I have a big stack of router
but mostly because me risking not having
coffee for three days is a huge stick
for the world will you don't want to see
me without coffee and that's because I'm
Dublin this has been the first look at
the TL wr8 for one and
router from tp-link I have one right
here so</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
