tennis the company made big claims about
the phone's durability they're protected
from dust and liquids to an even higher
level now ip68 that means it's protected
to 2 meters for up to 30 minutes so if
you happen to be hanging by the pool
drop your phone in the water don't worry
die down grab it rinse it let it dry
you'll be fine
to test the claims we're throwing the
iphone tennis into the deep end
so this phone has been in a little less
than 2 meters of water for about 30
minutes so now I'm gonna do what Apple
recommends after it's been in chlorine
which is wipe it off in clean pure water
so this is actually drinking water and
then I'm gonna dry it off with this
towel and let it sit for about 15
minutes before I start testing
everything out but I can tell you now
the screen is still working ok so while
we let this one dry off we're gonna take
another iPhone 10s and do a few more
tests with it the team tested in many
different liquids in chlorinated water
salt water orange juice tea wine even
beer but this is some of the most fun
intense testing we get to do at Apple
and we had some fun of our own with
these next tests
ok so it's been about 20 hours since we
tested these phones this is the one that
we tested with the liquids this is the
one that was submerged under water for
30 minutes in the pool now we did what
Apple suggested which was to rinse them
off and let them sit for a while
I haven't charged them Apple recommends
not charging them for at least 5 hours
and to dry them off with a lint-free
cloth which I have done so now let's
take a look
this is the one that's been tested with
liquids
iOS stratify has a three testing one two
three
testing 1 2 3
this one is the one that has been
submerged into the pool
touchscreen works streaming service is
music to your ears did you see that
there's two water coming out of the
speakers 24 hours later testing one two
three testing the microphone so the one
that was splashed with the different
liquid seems to be doing okay it checked
off all the marks but the one that was
submerged in the pool seems to be
spitting out water from the top speaker
or the earpiece even 20 hours later
Apple doesn't cover liquid damages on
the warranty so they're gonna make sure
that the water indicator isn't red to
find the water indicator on the iPhone
10 s you'll need to open the SIM tray
and shine the light inside if it's red
you're out of luck both our phones
passed this test
in fact after another 24 hours of
letting the water clear out the speakers
on the iPhone 10s that went into the
pool we're back to sounding loud and
clear but your iPhone may not be so
lucky and Apple does not recommend
purposely taking your iPhone for a swim
needless to say do not try any of this
at home</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
