episode 191 of the 359 podcast my name
is Rockwell and I always feel like
somebody's watchin me and I'm here with
Alfred Inge and Roger Chang in the scene
at New York studios good morning guys
morning good morning how long were you
planning that for about 30 seconds okay
worth it oh yeah very very relevant
today I want to contribute something to
the show uh as I'm sure everyone's heard
WikiLeaks was out with the huge data
dump disclosing basically how the CIA is
hacked into our personal lives over the
last couple of years now we don't know
if the data is actually verified Cena
hasn't verified it we can't tell there's
been if it's true or altered although
experts from our sister sites CBS News
say that you know it looks it looks
pretty credible okay WikiLeaks has a
pretty good track record but we'll be
talking about that we'll be talking
about this brewing battle in DC over
what ISPs can do with our data and
lastly the sort of the the last bit of
drama between Amazon and federal
authorities over some data that was
sorry data that was stored in an echo
related to a murder trials so it's all
about privacy today if you have any
questions as usual leave them the
comment section Brian we'll take out the
best and we will get to them in about 3
minutes and 59 seconds all right hang on
everybody we'll be back shortly here we
go for the recording of the podcast in
three two
welcome to 359 we talk about the top
tech news of the day you know they have
the crap you want to throw it I'm Rutger
Chen I'm Alfred Inge it's all about
privacy today or the lack thereof first
off is the CIA spy on us according to a
WikiLeaks data dump the agency could be
listening in on us using our very own
phones the report which seen it hasn't
been able to verify so the CIA is able
to hack into iOS Windows Android Linux
to basically look at use our devices to
listen in on us Alfred how freaked out
are you um very I don't think I'm
personally being spied on but I think
there's a lot of privacy issues at hand
here especially considering that people
have been turning to alternatives like
whatsapp or signal to get encrypted
messages yeah so that you know they
can't be there's no level reassurance
when you were on whatsapp and online and
you could turn on the end-to-end
encryption yeah it turns out that's not
the case
yeah well in this case they're looking
at the messages before they're even
encrypted so it has nothing to do with
you know right corruption when you have
control the operating system you can
actually see what you see on the screen
you could record the typing the gestures
and basically get all that information a
little little freaky CIA obviously has
not commented on this but this is this
is a huge blow this is all true this is
a huge blow to the CIA and their
intelligence gathering there's no issue
right especially considering that this
is according to WikiLeaks at least this
is only one percent of what they have
discover ight there they're gradually
releasing more and more information
which is kind of their operating system
there where basically we're gonna slowly
leak this out because they've been
trying to build a discussion and debate
on this they did say that they also have
access to the actual exploits themselves
you know the programming yeah owning
behind that and you found out that some
of those exploits had some curious names
right yes
so if you look at the Android exploits
on their page about eight of the 23
exploits there are named after Pokemon
there's they're everywhere Starmie spero
lugia Totodile got a hack them all yeah
I mean they had other ones that were
named after a villain or a character and
Doctor Who weeping angel okay yes figure
that out yeah all right all right next
up our very own Maggie Reardon has a
breakdown of the battle in DC over your
online data there she sees hip
cause and some regulations that would
forced ISPs to disclose how they're
collecting data and what they're doing
with it whether they're sharing with
third parties opponents to this say the
the the rules are a little too they're a
little too strict and actually put them
at a disadvantage to say Google or
Netflix or Facebook which actually are
able to use the data in a to share with
advertisers so I don't know it seems
like the FCC is kind of rolling back a
lot of the things that they had been
putting in place over the last few years
right
well they hadn't put the rules in place
yet it was kind of a suggestion for from
the previous FCC chair yeah but now a
gpause basically saying we're not even
they were supposed to go in effect but
yes yes with a with a G PI the new
chairman he is definitely more of a
pro-business approach he sort of hit
pause on that alright lastly the fight
between Amazon the authorities over data
that might have been stored in an echo
related to a murder trial ended in an
anticlimactic fashion Amazon and in a
pen handing over that data since the
defendant consented to the disclosure it
would have set up a battle similar to
Apple versus FBI epic but again we're
get the way another another time another
case for a precedent I think it's
disappointing that the defendant decided
to do that only because I did want to
see what the legal ramifications were I
think everyone I think I'm don't want to
see it I mean we we talked about it's a
year after Apple versus FBI and we still
really don't have any kind of firm
ground on you know who has it right away
whether Wells Technology whether it's
our personal privacy versus the
government's right to look into our data
well yeah the case for the recordings
wasn't even on firm ground to begin with
they were just kind of hoping that you
know the echo was accidentally activated
because that's the only time it even
records anything no it's great point for
more on these stories check us out on
SEANET I'm Rob Chen I'm Alfred Aang
thanks for listening
and I love this first question I have in
the chat actually not a question it's a
comment from a CEO he says I guess it's
good that some of us have a Luddite
tendencies and don't use those
newfangled apps I only use text Google
Hangouts and sometimes Facebook well if
you're on a smartphone yeah yeah texts
are vulnerable - guys I got it let's all
get 33 tens that's what I'm saying I I
think this whole CIA leak was just a you
know big mark only problem is that 3310
won't work in the US so we'll have to
feel better I'll have to find another
burner phone well know it like literally
will not work in the US like it's just a
prop basically but we'll have to find
another burner phone you're crushing me
with this I thought I had it all figured
out what do you guys think is really
gonna be the outcome of this like how
are we actually going to see like a
rollback in smart technology absolutely
not no I don't think I think the
majority of people don't care about
their privacy that much to be honest
well I think a majority people say they
care like in surveys it's always high up
there privacy is a very big concern but
when it comes down to it when it's you
know the choice between privacy and
whether or not I can FaceTime or
snapchat with my friend yeah they're
gonna pick the snapchat I think I think
this is America it doesn't matter about
majority yeah I think I think the
conveniency of it all has has people
like like you said you know oh wait yeah
I can I want to be able to snapchat and
face on my friends at all time I
remember being concerned about privacy
myself and then I got an echo dot in my
apartment right out the window
yeah right now you really wish that yeah
pretty much I have an iPhone so you know
well and Apple is actually they made a
comment yesterday they basically said
that a lot of these vulnerabilities that
were disclosed in the state of dump were
patched up in the last version of iOS so
Apple is actually recommended that if
you haven't already upgrade to the
latest version of iOS you will
theoretically be protected although
WikiLeaks forgot something
well it's interesting I don't know who
they're talking to in this case but
there was a they replied to a BuzzFeed
tweet about Apple announcing yeah that
they had patched
most of the vulnerabilities and all they
wrote back was a no it doesn't and
though they very much like fake news I
don't know I don't know if they're
saying that about Apple or BuzzFeed I'm
gonna show my true colors here for a
second and agree with Ryan and the chat
who says I think it's funny that people
thought that they were not being watched
by the government yeah yeah that's a
really good point especially always
you're still surprised by this come on
all these movies were you know all the
high-tech spy gadgets that we see like I
feel like people are a little bit
conditioned to like to understand even
like on a subconscious level or I'm I
think that their phones are like can
theoretically be used to spy on us like
that this is not a this isn't a wildly
unlikely scenario but yes yeah he's
doing this right I think people are I
don't also the where it's also not
necessarily 100% criminal or Melissa
Melissa know in a sense you're just part
of the data part of the ether we're all
just increasing the amount of data and
this is getting just delving deep it is
it is just scary because it's you know
yeah you are being watched and it's a
sense but it's not like somebody's
sitting there waiting for you to you
know yeah your most intimate moments I
think it depends on who is using that
data like if it's the CIA it's fine
terrorism there's there's an argument to
be made you know about that but who else
has access to this and if I think it was
part of the point that WikiLeaks was
trying to make that you know the CIA had
knowledge of what ton of these exploits
these vulnerabilities and they didn't
tell anybody
yeah that's a problem because other
hackers can find the same
vulnerabilities it's not like this is
something that only the CIA can exploit
other people can exploit them to and now
wouldn't change too many people's
opinions if they had come right out in
front Street and been like hey we're
doing this right but it might have
helped a little bit it might have
actually made me naturally or
they're supposed to be I think under
Obama administration like there was
supposed to be some mandate damn for the
authorities to actually be a front and
center and like to say well some of us
they didn't but they did so some of that
is maybe it's not malicious in terms of
like actively trying or someone but it
is malicious in terms of the potential
consequences right the principal they're
still at fault here they're still wrong
in the way they executed this I'm sorry
I cut you off yeah I mean I was
to say I think people are aware that
they CIA spies I think it's more so it
just kind of hits home when something
like what do you mean my TV can be like
listened to or you know what do you mean
right like oh now it can affect me
personally so that I think that's like
the issue that that Smart TV apparently
there's so there was a camera on that TV
and there's a remote with a microphone
in it so yeah I mean like that's I mean
I'm personally really ashamed of some of
my Netflix habits but I don't anyway
Don's got a deep philosophical question
here says which is worse cable or phone
carrier and busybody employees spying or
government like black ops spying on you
well one of them is making a profit off
yeah I was City ISPs it's pretty for the
silver lining here I mean that I mean
that dovetails well that second topic
that we discussed which speaking of I
wanted to talk about this on the podcast
but we didn't have enough time I hate
the cable companies like argument about
oh but Google and Facebook does it I
don't think you know that should be
basically I think if anything they
should make it stricter for Google and
Facebook yes easy free Campea so the FTC
kind of governs Google and Facebook the
other Internet companies the FCC governs
the ISPs and so they they come in went
in with stricter laws which yeah you're
right like that's I see how their
companies have a point there the
counter-argument to the the whole like
Google and Facebook are an advantage of
weren't disadvantages for most people
like you only have one maybe two options
for your internet you know it's Verizon
or it's the Cable guy's a Comcast or
cable vision and with Internet services
you can choose to not use them there are
other services out that mean Crenna it's
hard to get away from Facebook but you
don't have you don't have to use them
whereas if you want broadband which most
people kind of define I was like it's an
absolute must you don't have a lot of
choices and therefore there should be
some some regulations sure but their
data there are certain people whose
perspective is you know I don't opt into
a lot of these programs systems
technologies and are they 100% protected
no is there an arguable defense that
maybe they have a little bit
or control sure right but at the end of
the day let's get real
it it politics government social norms
people are spying on people it's that's
the way it's been we've just made it
easier by volunteering to put some of
these things in our homes and pockets
yeah yeah yeah no but I mean look we
were the discussion was a little bit
about whether or not companies can make
money sure I think you brought in that
the point of opt-in that I think is one
of the big dissenting points is with the
FTC rules Google and Facebook
it's an opt-out model where's an opt
sorry it's an opt yeah opt-out model
where basically you're kind of enrolled
in and if you want to get out you
basically have to tell them you want to
get out well and here's where the small
print comes into play though how many
people have actually ever read the
disclosure agreement in iTunes yeah yeah
so that's one of our problems is like so
the thing of it is they what those
regulations that were put on pause with
the FCC they were gonna institute an
opt-in model where you actively had to
say yes I'm okay with sharing my data
which I think should be it should be
like that if we ask the board it
shouldn't be it shouldn't just be the
telcos or the cable companies should be
everyone the opt-in should be sort of
the default setting for everyone does
anybody in the chat agree with that we
want to hear your opinion it's agree or
disagree yeah absolutely or somewhere in
between
yeah Aaron really while we're at it
here's an interesting perspective from
Australian Tigers how could they spy on
us we around two point 1 billion using
the internet I mean are they actually
actively watching everyone in like a
statistical sense or are they just
trying to snoop out key words key moment
I guess yeah my guess is red flags like
you're on a terrorist watch list you
probably touch your phone to be it's
more fun it's more of a dragnet kind of
thing because it's not an act I love
that show I love that movie actually
it's and I'm a other show with Dan
Aykroyd and Tom Hanks
yeah it's great it's it's not an active
kind of thing though because with these
exploits it's more like targeted yeah
thanks yeah because it's not like yeah
they've hacked every single yeah there's
not like a massive database collecting
all of our tables or yeah whatsapp chat
message I think it is definitely more
targeted yeah in this case at least
have to hack into there's no like
automated system yeah everyone I love to
buy they just press the button and it is
maybe like the next day to dump that's
probably the CIA has one big red button
it just pushes I love Tobias's feedback
on this he says I think it sounds like a
pretty boring job yeah yeah for the
wires yeah yes I would agree I mean I
think it's like you'd have to be like
really into listening for juicy details
like a minute of juicy details out of
like 12 hours of boring discussions or
just wandering in in this case bring
back Jimmy Stewart from Hitchcock's rear
window and is binocular in this case so
it's not even listening because it's
also good text message emails yeah it's
probably even way down one could imagine
one of my favorite scenes in the
Simpsons movie is when the family's on
the run yeah and they like reveal where
they are on a phone call and then they
cut to a scene with somebody in the NSA
they're like I finally got somebody it's
like a whole bunch of you yeah big room
just listens always gets it first right
that's true
here's a question from Yahoo how can the
webcam turn on without that little
indicator light next to it so that's
that's been less up for a lot of
people's like that webcam is watch me
but it doesn't have the indicator light
on how does that we know how that works
no I mean I mean that's a lotta that's
that's a deep-diving conspiracy theory
we're not adding any validation right
but it's not without question I mean in
that case though that that's only for
your laptop there's no light that turns
on on the front-facing camera on your
phones right well for the end for the
computer I mean if you've taken over the
operating system the underlining
foundation of the device you can
probably tell it to keep the light as
far turning on the cameras ways to go
and like turn off the registry keys yeah
exactly if you have like the keys of the
whole operating system you can probably
find a way and get around them think
about what they did for the Samsung
Smart TVs where they had the fake off
mode right where it basically they left
the microphone on and it made it look
like your TV was off so there's ways to
hack into these things to make it look
like again once you have ashes that
underlying operating system you can do a
lot with that device yeah would use of a
VPN mitigate potential spying activity
no-no-no getting those back to the
operon systems on your device anything
you're doing on your advice they can spy
on yeah buddy's saying if you're if
you're trying to mask your literal
location through VPN yeah would that
actually deter I think they could still
probably yeah power through that I think
in that case yeah if we're talking about
a brand but like in this case because
that one of the exploits for Android
that they used was that they could send
your Geo tag and you know like where you
were is that one of the Pokemon one I
don't know but yeah that it could send
your geo tag to the the CIA so it knew
okay yeah
Timothy Shaw I know dude Timothy says
optin should be the default Hugh says
just cut the cord I kind of let Hughes
don't you just don't be so don't use the
internet let's just all go move back
into the forest moats and I like I get
for him I will be safe please read my
fave my cave carvings yeah if the CIA is
hacking into you I guess what carry your
pigeon yeah they could go pretty far
that I couldn't make an international
call
did I depends so I can we get Cena to
get behind like a new form of
communication technology where we
actually hear that a plated powered
carrier pigeon carrier bird breeding and
it works like a car lot like if you go
in short distances like the eco-friendly
one is the pigeon if you need to go long
distances you buy you opt up you pay the
premium for the hawk area pigeons are
probably like more insecure than your
phone though alright at this point I
think the pigeons are smarter than the
FBI sorry the federal bird investigation
uh yeah who asks again if they are
hacking is there way to know it like
does it affect your internet speed
they're streaming from the webcam like
an impact we don't yeah that's a good
question it's a great question I like
all of a sudden your speed throught owes
and you're like somebody's tapped right
right right or like every time your
phone has a go like a pause yeah it's
busy for a second you have to wonder but
I mean the idea though is like when you
are hacking
money is to leave leave it without a
trace oh right if they're smart about it
then they you wouldn't be able to tell
ya the scarier part is like a lot of
this stuff can work when you think your
phone is off or yeah great mode in your
pocket so you wouldn't even know if it
was under control really most of the
time it's probably being hacked while
yeah as per usual Danny and the chat is
my hero he says watch out for my stone
tablet sale next week by a bundle get a
free well there's like there's a guy who
sells those no phones it's just a black
3d printed a slab of plastic yeah I have
a whole bunch of them I'm mostly great
stop it slow play snake mostly hate it
cuz I didn't come up with it first but
it's a great idea
Stephen Stephens got a great idea it
says as for the camera the LED
manufacturers should design it into the
circuitry so that the electron must pass
the LED in order to reach the camera
sure I feel for that I wonder how much
done how would you feel like if you're
looking down your webcam right down the
right down the barrel and also nothing
just lights up you're like oh no I can't
like that just that may just be the
Zuckerberg man just tape the camera or
the Pope he does that too
really yeah the photos are like a pope
is smarter than me and I said that I did
not have my camera tape I should I mean
I want people to watch me let's see
alright alright I think we're just about
out of time that was the out of
discussion thanks everybody
yeah great questions guys thank you so
many questions this week so all right
that's a wrap
yeah we got a bit of an abrupt ending
but we gotta move on we're on our way
over to we're done alright if you liked
anything you saw or heard here check us
out on CNET our podcast is available on
iTunes tunas stitcher SoundCloud
Feedburner and google play music we'll
see y'all tomorrow
later I
