episode 191 of the 359 podcast my name
is Rockwell and I always feel like
somebody's watching me and i'm here with
Alfred Inge and Roger Cheng in the cnet
New York studios good morning guys
morning good morning how long were you
planning that for about 30 seconds ok
worth it oh yeah very very relevant
today I want to contribute something to
the show uh as I'm sure everyone's heard
WikiLeaks was out with the huge data
dump disclosing basically how the CIA is
hacked into our personal lives for the
last couple years now we don't know if
the data is actually verified Cena
hasn't verified it we can't tell there's
been if it's true or altered although
experts from our sister site CBS News
say that you know it looks looks pretty
credible okay I'm WikiLeaks has a pretty
good track record but we've been talking
about that we'll be talking about this
brewing battle in DC over what is peace
can do with our data and lastly the sort
of the last bit of drama between amazon
and federal authorities over some data
that was sorry data that was stored in
an echo related to a murder trials so
it's all about privacy today if you have
any questions as usual leave in the
comments section brian will take out the
best and we will get to them in about
three minutes and 59 seconds all right
hang on everybody will be back shortly
here we go for the recording of the
podcast in three two
welcome to 359 when we talk about the
top Texas of the day get the crap you
want to throw in I'm Roger Tsien I'm
Alfred hang it's all about privacy today
or the lack thereof first off is the CIA
spy on us according to a WikiLeaks data
dump the agency could be listening in on
us using our very own phones the report
which seen it hasn't been able to verify
so the CIA is able to hack into iOS
windows android linux to basically look
at use our devices to listen in on us
Alfred how freaked out are you about it
by this um very I don't think I'm
personally being spied on but I think
there's a lot of privacy issues at hand
here especially considering that people
have been turning to alternatives like
whatsapp or signal to get encrypted
messages yeah so that you know they
can't be there there's no central level
reassurance when you're on whatsapp
online and you could turn on the end end
encryption yeah it turns out that's not
the case yeah well in this case they're
looking at the messages before they're
even encrypted so has nothing to do with
you know right Krypton when you have
control the operating system you can
actually see what you see on this rain
you record the the typing the gestures
and basically get all that information a
little little freaky CIA obviously is
not commented on this but this is this
is a huge blow this is all true this is
a huge blow to the CIA and their
intelligence gathering this ability to
write especially considering that this
is according to wiki leaks at least this
is only 1% of what they have discover
aight they're they're gradually
releasing more and more information
which is kind of their operating system
there where jessica Lee we're gonna
slowly leak this out because they've
been trying to build a discussion and
debate on this they did say that they
also have access to the actual exploits
themselves you know the programming ya
hiding behind that and you found out
that some of those exploits had some
curious names right yes so if you look
at the Android exploits on their page
about eight of the 23 exploits there are
named after Pokemon there's a they're
everywhere Starmie spero lugia totodile
gotta hack them all yeah I mean they had
other ones that were named after a
villain or a character and Doctor Who
weeping angel okay that's what we can
jal's yes figure that out yeah all right
all right next up our very own Maggie
Riordan has a breakdown of the battle in
DC over your online data
the FCC's hit pause and some regulations
that would force ISPs to disclose how
they're collecting data and what they're
doing with it whether they're sharing
with their parties opponents to this say
the the rules were a little too they're
a little too strict and actually put
them at a disadvantage to say Google or
Netflix or Facebook which I should are
able to use the data in a to share with
advertisers so I don't know it's it's a
it seems like the FCC is kind of rolling
back a lot of things that they had been
putting in place over the last few years
right well they hadn't put the rules in
place yet it was kind of a suggestion
for uh from the previous FCC Chairman
now G pause basically saying we're not
even if they were supposed to affect but
yes yes with the with Ajapai the new
chairman he is definitely more of a
pro-business approach he sort of hit
pause on that all right lastly the fight
between amazon authorities over data
that might have been stored in an echo
related to murder trial ended in an
anti-climactic fashion amazon ended up
handing over that data since the
defendant consented to do the disclosure
it would have set up the battle similar
to Apple versus FBI epic but again we're
gonna wait another another time another
case for precedent I think it's
disappointing that the defendant decided
to do that only because I did want to
see what the legal ramifications were
for him something everyone I think
everyone wants to see it I mean we we
talked about it's a year after Apple
versus FBI and we still really don't
have any kind of firm ground on you know
who has it right away whether well
technology with it's our personal
privacy versus the government's right to
look into our data well yeah the case
for the recordings wasn't even on firm
ground to begin with they were just kind
of hoping that you know the echo was
accidentally activated because that's
the only time it even records anything
no it's a great point for more on these
stories check us out on cnet I'm Roger
Tsien I'm Alfred Aang thanks for
listening
and i love this first question i have in
the chat actually not a question it's a
comment from Matthew he says I guess
it's good that some of us have a Luddite
tendencies and don't use those
newfangled apps i only use text google
hangouts and sometimes facebook well if
what if you're on a smartphone yeah what
do you don't know what is yeah yeah
that's the texts are vulnerable to it
easy guys I got it let's all get 33 tens
that's what I'm saying I passable I
think this whole uh CIA leak was just a
you know big mark only problem is that
3310 won't work in the US so we'll have
to feel any better I have to find
another burner phone well know it like
literally will not work in the US like
it's just a prop basically uh but we'll
have to find another burner phone you're
crushing me with this haha I thought I
had it all figured out um what do you
guys think is really gonna be the
outcome of this like our are we actually
going to see like a rollback in smart
technology absolutely not no I don't
think I think the majority of people
don't care about their privacy that much
to be honest well I think I Majora's
majority of people say they care like in
surveys it's always high up their
privacy is a very big concern but when
it comes down to it when it's you know
the choice between privacy and whether
or not I can facetime or snapchat with
my friend yeah they're gonna pick the
snapchat I think I think this is America
it doesn't matter about majority yep I
think I think the convenience II of it
all has uh has people like like you said
you know oh wait yeah I can I want to be
able to snapchat and face on my friends
at all time I remember being concerned
about privacy myself and then I got an
echo dot in my apartment right that your
privacy is out the window yeah right now
you relinquish that yeah pretty much i
have an iphone so you know well and
Apple is actually they made a comment
yesterday they basically said that a lot
of the vulnerabilities that were
disclosed in this data dump were patched
up in the latest version of iOS so Apple
is actually recommended that if you
haven't already upgrade to the latest
version of iOS you will theoretically be
protected although WikiLeaks forgot
something well it's interesting I don't
know who they're talking to in this case
but there was a they replied to a
BuzzFeed tweet about apple announcement
yeah that they
patched up most of the vulnerabilities
and all they wrote back was a no it
doesn't and though they did hashtag fake
news i don't know they're saying i don't
know if they're saying that about apple
or BuzzFeed i'm gonna show my true
colors here for a second and agree with
ryan and the chat who says i think it's
funny that people thought that they were
not being watched by the government yeah
that's yeah that's a really good point
especially always you're still surprised
by this come on all these movies were
all the high-tech spy gadgets that we
see like I feel like people are a little
bit condition to like to kind understand
even like on a subconscious level or
that I think that their phones are like
can theoretically be used to spy on us
like that this is not a this isn't a
wildly unlikely scenario yeah she is
doing this right I think people are I
don't also where it's also not
necessarily 100 criminal or malice
malicious know in a sense you're just
part of the data part of the ether we're
all just increasing the amount of data
and this is getting just delving deep it
is it is just scary because it's you
know y CIA at the day you are being
watched in a sense but it's not like
somebody's sitting there waiting fuedeh
you know yeah your most intimate moments
I think later though it depends on who
is using that data like if it's the CIA
it's fine terrorism there's there's an
argument to be made you know about that
but who else has access to this and if I
think it was part of the point that
WikiLeaks was trying to make that you
know the CIA had knowledge of what ton
of these exploit these vulnerabilities
in us and didn't tell anybody yeah
that's a problem because hack other
hackers can find the same vulnerability
it's not like this is something that
only the CIA can exploit other people
can exploit them too and now wouldn't
change too many people's opinions if
they had come right out in front street
and been like hey we're doing this right
but it might have helped a little bit it
might have actually made money actually
are sionally they're supposed to be i
think under obama administration like
there was supposed to be some mandate
damn for the authorities to actually be
a front and center and like to say well
some of the stuff they didn't but they
didn't so some of that is maybe it's not
malicious in terms of like actively
trying or someone but it is malicious in
terms of the potential consequences
right the principal they're still at
fault here they're still wrong in the
way they executed this I'm sorry this is
all true I cut you off yeah I mean I
was gonna say I think people are aware
that the CIA spies I think it's more so
it just kind of hits home when something
like what do you mean my TV can be like
listen to or you know what do you mean
right like oh now it can affect me
personally so that I think that's like
the issue that we're discussing about
that smart TV apparently they're so
there's a camera on that TV and there's
a remote with a microphone in it so yeah
I mean like that's I mean I'm personally
really ashamed of some of my Netflix
habits but I don't anyway um Don's got a
deep philosophical question here says
which is worse cable or phone carrier
and busybody employees spying or
government like black ops spying on you
uh well one of them is making a profit
off yeah I was saying that the ISPs it's
pretty for the silver lining here I mean
that I mean that details well that
second topic that we discuss which i
speaking of I wanted to talk about this
on the podcast but we didn't have enough
time I hate the cable companies like
argument about oh but Google and
Facebook does I don't think you know
that should be basically I think if
anything they should make it stricter
for Google and Facebook yes which
fortunately big made it easy frequent
via so the FTC kind of governs google
and facebook the other Internet
companies the FCC governs the ISPs and
so they kind of went in with stricter
laws which yeah you're right like that's
I see how the companies have a point
there the counter-argument to the the
whole like Google and Facebook or an
advantage weren't disadvantages for most
people like you will have one maybe two
options for your internet you know it's
verizon or it's the Cable guy's a
comcast or cable vision and with
Internet services you can choose to not
use them there are other services out
that mean crying it's hard to get away
from facebook but you don't have to you
don't have to use them whereas if you
want broadband which most people kind of
define I was like it's an absolute must
you don't have a lot of choices and
therefore there should be some some
regulations sure but their data there
are certain people whose perspective is
you know I don't opt into a lot of these
programs systems technologies and are
they 100 protected no is there an
arguable defense that maybe they have a
little bit
or control sure right but at the end of
the day let's get real it it politics
government social norms people are
spying on people it's that's the way
it's been we've made it easier by
volunteering to put some of these things
in our homes and pockets yeah yeah yeah
no but I mean look we're the discussion
was a little bit about whether or not
companies can make money off your data
right sure opting you brought in that
the point of opt-in that I think is one
of the big dis any points is with the
FTC rule with Google and Facebook it's
it's an opt-out model or basic there's
an opt sorry it's an opt yeah up top
model where basically you're kind of
enrolled in and if you want to get out
you basically have to tell them you want
to get out well and here's where the
small print comes into play though how
many people have actually ever read the
disclosure agreement in itunes no not
really yeah yeah so that's one of our
problems is like the locally but the
thing of it is they what those
regulations that were put on pause with
the FCC they were gonna institute an
opt-in model where you at actively had
to say yes I'm okay with sharing my data
which i think I didn't you'd be it
should be like that we asked the board
it shouldn't be it shouldn't just be the
telcos or the cable companies should be
everyone the opt-in should be sort of
the default setting for everyone uh does
anybody in the chat agree with that we
want to hear your opinion it's agree or
disagree yeah absolutely or somewhere in
between yeah you're in really um while
we're at it uh here's an interesting
perspective from Australian Tigers how
could they spy on us we around 2.1
billion using the Internet I mean are
they actually actively watching everyone
in like a statistical sense or are they
just trying to snoop out keywords chemo
my my desk yeah my guess is red flags
like again you're on a terrorist watch
list you probably had such your phone to
be it's more it's more of a dragnet kind
of thing because it's not an act i love
that show I love that movie actually
it's in time another show with Dan
Aykroyd and tonics yeah it's great it's
it's not an active kind of thing though
because with these exploits it's more
like targeted yeah thanks for yeah
because it's not like they've hacked
every single yeah there's not like a
massive database clogging all of our
tables or yeah whatsapp chat messages
whatever I think it is definitely more
targeted yeah in this case that leaves
you do they have to hack into please
yeah there's no like autumn
yeah everyone I love to buy service
press the button it is maybe like the
next day don't as I probably a CI has
one big red button it just pushes I love
Tobias's feedback on this eases I think
it sounds like a pretty boring job uh
yeah yeah for the wiser yeah i guess i
would agree i mean i think it's like you
have to be like really into listening
for juicy date detailing a minute of
juicy details out of like 12 hours of
boring discussions or just hovering in
in this case bring back Jimmy Stewart
from hitchcock's rear window and is
binoculars attack in this case though
it's not even listening because it's
also got a text message that emails yeah
that's uh it's probably even wait our
mind numbing what I could imagine one of
my favorite scenes in the simpsons movie
is when the family is on the run yeah
they like reveal where they are on a
phone call and then they cut to a scene
with somebody in the NSA that's like we
finally got somebody it's like a whole
bunch of you that big room just
listening the person's always gets it
first and yes you're right that's true
uh here's a question from yahoo how can
the webcam turn on without that little
indicator light next to it so that's
that's been less time for a lot of
people's like right right that webcam is
watch me but it doesn't have the
indicator light on how does that we know
how that works no i mean i mean that's a
lotta that's that's a deep diving
conspiracy theory we're not adding any
validation brat but it's not without
question i mean in that case though that
that's only for your laptop there's no
light that turns on on the front facing
camera on your phone's right well for
the end for the computer i mean if
you've taken over the operating system
the underlying foundation of the device
you can probably tell it to keep the
lightest laura turning on the cameras
ways to go and like turn off the
registry keys yeah exactly if you have
like the keys of the whole operating
system you can probably find a way and
get around them think about what they
did for the samsung smart tvs where they
had the fake off mode right we're
basically they left the microphone on
and it made it look like your TV was off
so there there's ways to hack into these
links to make it look like again once
you have extras that underlying
operating system you can do a lot with
that device yeah would use of a VPN
mitigate potential spying activity no no
no again
those back to the operating systems on
your device anything you're doing on
your advice they can spy on yeah buddy
saying if you're if you're trying to
mask your literal location through VPN
yeah would that actually deter I think
they could still probably yeah power
through that I think in that case yeah
if we're talking about a judgmental
grand but like in this case because that
one of the exploits for Android that
they used was that they could send your
geotag uh and you know like where you
were is that one of the Pokemon one I
don't know um but yeah that it could
send your geotag to the the CIA so it
neways Julia okay yeah Timothy Shaw I
know dude Timothy says opt-in should be
the default Hugh says just cut the cord
I kind of let Hughes don't just don't be
on so don't use the internet let's just
all go move back into the forest is me
boats and I like this I get for him I
will be saying my apartment later I
could actually please read my game my
cave carving guys if the CIA is a
hacking into you I guess carrier patient
sent letters you can pen and paper
carrier pigeon Leonard's what carrier
pigeon yeah what's the distance for
kitchen they could go pretty far that I
couldn't make an international call kid
I depends so I can we get Cena to get
behind like a new form of communication
technology where we actually care that a
plated powered carrier pigeon carrier
bird breeding and it works like a car
lot like if you go and have short
distances like the eco-friendly one is
the pigeon if you need to go long
distances you buy you opt up you pay the
premium for the hawk Harry occasions are
probably like more insecure than your
phone though right like they can be
easily put inside your side yeah at this
point I think the pigeons are smarter
than the FBI sorry if it's a federal
bird investigation uh yeah who asks
again if they are hacking is their way
to know it like does it affect your
internet speed they're streaming from
the webcam like it like an impact we
don't yeah yeah I think that's so deep
down and that's a good question it's a
great question i like all of a sudden
your speed throttles and you're like
somebody's tapped right right right or
like every time your phone has a go like
a pause yeah it gets busy for a second
you have to wonder but i mean the idea
though is like when you are hacking
somebody is to leave
without a trace of right if they're
smart about it then you wouldn't be able
to tell yes carrier part is like a lot
of this stuff can work when you think
your phone is off or yeah wait mode in
your pocket so you wouldn't even know if
it was under control really most of the
time it's probably being hacked while
you're using the phone as per usual
Danny and the chat is my hero he says
watch out for my stone tablet sale next
week by a bundle get a freak well
there's like there's a guy who sells
those no phones it's just a black 3d
printed a slab of plastic yeah I have a
whole bunch of them I mostly great stock
slow play snake mostly hate it cuz I
didn't come up with it first but it's a
great idea and he sold a bunch of
Stephen Stevens got a great idea says as
for the camera the LED manufacturers
should design it into the circuitry so
the electron must pass the LED in order
to reach the camera Sherman ideal for
that I wonder how much don't how would
you feel like if you're looking down
your webcam right down the right down
the barrel and also nothing just lights
up you're like oh no I can't like that
just thought of that makes me just be
the Zuckerberg man just take the camera
or the Pope he does that too really yeah
a little fun of our like a hope is more
than me and I said that I did not have
my camera tape I should I mean I want
people to watch me let's see her ways
alright alright alright I think we're
just about out of time that was a
discussion thanks everybody yeah great
question guys thank you some questions
this week so alright I guess that's a
wrap yeah we got sorry a bit of an
abrupt ending but we gotta move on we're
on our way over toward we're done
alright if you liked anything you saw or
heard here check us out on cnet our
podcast is available on itunes tune is
stitcher SoundCloud feedburner and
google play music we'll see you all
tomorrow later I
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
