Mercedes the amazing crash test that
never happened and do we know
self-driving cars are really that safe
it's time to check the tap we see cars
differently we love them on the road
and under the hood but also check the
tech and are known for telling it like
it is ugly is included at no extra cost
the good the bad the bottom line this is
C net on cars
welcome to C net on cars to show all
about high-tech cars and modern driving
i'm brian cooling when i say Mercedes
you think something luxurious with a
little pomp with ostentation perhaps
after all it's a car that says you've
arrived but now there's a new Mercedes
out that says you've arrived and you did
so in a hurry
let's drive the all-new 2016 Mercedes
AMG GTS and check the tech
yep this is a Mercedes
one that could make you rethink what you
think of the free pointed star
well if you're going to have your new
car look like anything you can certainly
do worse than having it look like that
but in fact the Mercedes AMG GTS
goes head-to-head against a very
different car the 911 specifically the
911 turbo let's compare them the
Mercedes is 179 inches long a little
less than 2 inches more than a turbo 103
and a half inch wheelbase that's what
you're really seeing a 7 inch longer
spread between axles and a 911 turbo and
in weight there were then about a
hundred pounds of each other
the cabin of the GT is like a
tight-fitting Tom Ford store darkly
handsome purposeful and taut did I
mention it's tight in here this is what
a performance console should look like
upper-left is your mode button your own
independent set Comfort Sport Sport+
and barely restrained race start/stop
behind that stability control take it
off at your risk and independently
adjust suspension compliance separate
from the modes on the knob behind the
fan control you've got your manual
automatic gearbox toggle your blessed
auto start/stop defeat and a mode switch
for the exhaust in your face or really
in your face too bad it's set so far
back much of it falls under your elbow
instead of your hand the head unit is
Mercedes command TAC that we've seen
before no new ground being broken here
but I've really warmed up to the
configurable Mercedes favorites screen
that you access via either of two
buttons on the controller it lets me set
up what I think the home screen should
be and does so very nicely it's also
annoying that once you launch the
powerful Google online nav search app
which has Street View and some other
great tools the cars voice command tech
doesn't talk to it I've got to turn it
out with the knob or I got to use the
handwriting pad not bad but no cigar by
the way early 2016 Mercedes will also
start to add in apple carplay which
we've shown you before into some of
their models no word yet on when Android
auto will join
now up here in the very capacious engine
bay is a very small engine a four liter
twin-turbo v8 but I mean it's itty bitty
front of its about here back of it's
right about here it doesn't take up much
room at all but boy doesn't put out some
good output partly because it has twin
turbos and notice where they live on top
in the valley in the V between the heads
almost every other car with turbos puts
them down on the flanks alongside the
heads and on the side of the block by
doing so the turbos are closer to the
intake they're actually feeding you get
faster sharper response from them that
way this engine also has a dry sump that
means it does not have much of a pan
underneath it for oil allowing it to sit
down nice and low and give you this nice
arc of the hood 503 horsepower that's
only 17 less than a 911 turbo by the way
479 pound feet of torque goes out to a
7-speed dual-clutch transmission mounted
in the back it's a trans axle to be
correct and that's fed by a carbon fiber
driveshaft
super stiff no sloppy with that trans
axle in the rear and this engine sitting
right here about five inches behind the
front axle line you get something akin
to a mid-engine car and certainly a
lovely weight balance
the best compliment I can give the GT is
that it drives like it looks that
rounded muscular rear portrays the
direct lag less power and the only two
wheels that get it the long prow
suggests the way the front end hunts a
corner and those rear tips remind you
it's one of the best soundtracks in the
business
Jaguar does it louder but AMG doesn't
bet
the four driving modes are distinct and
satisfying altering power delivery shift
tightness suspension behavior and if you
option something called dynamic plus
even changing the firmness of the engine
and transmission mounts adaptively
on the downside are a few ergo issues
it's like driving a tank the pillars and
rear quarter really kill visibility and
the whole thing is just a bit too tight
inside I'd get stir-crazy about halfway
between San Francisco and LA that puts
me in Kettleman city
so it's an issue I'm Mercedes AMG GTS
starts at about one hundred and thirty
one with destination and I'm going to
load it up with a lane tracking package
for about nine hundred dynamic plus
gives me those adaptive engine and
transmission mounts I like that
panoramic roof I'm going there for under
thirteen I'm not crazy about $5,000
audio upgrades but if I'm going to get
the carbon ceramic brakes why not
in all in that about 150 grand done up
see next I'm far from affordable but in
certain avenues of auto dumb it's
considered attainable and that's key to
this car
it is almost supercar light but not at
supercar prices a hell of a lot of fun
on the road you'll be hard-pressed to
mistake it for anything else that you
see on the road it is about one shoe
size too small on the inside and it
fundamentally helps change what everyone
thinks Mercedes is if you want some more
on that AMG GTS check out Wayne
Cunningham's take on it over at Cars
cnet.com when we talk about self-driving
cars you naturally assume it means a
much safer car right I mean that is the
single big idea behind moving this way
with technology yet do we have proof or
is it mostly assumptions a decimal
latest thinking on this for the smarter
drive we've seen that on cars continue
Oh
33,000 people died in 2014 in us road
accidents another 26,000 in the EU vast
numbers unequaled in rate by any other
means of transportation so the main
selling point for self-driving cars
early on has been dramatic reduction in
accidents however in their first million
or so miles of real-world testing on
public roads they've yet to stake a
claim to that hope a new study by
Michael C vac and Brandon shuttling at
the University of Michigan
Transportation Research Institute look
at the data from the early self drivers
fielded by Google out and Delphi the
inconvenient truth these early self
drivers have a higher accident rate than
their human driven counterparts here are
three more nuanced takeaways however for
the smarter driver first of all the
accidents that self-driving cars are
involved in tend to be minor and let's
face it we've gotta get over this sci-fi
ideal that self-driving cars will never
crash and embrace the reality that they
will crash less often and with less
severity secondly the self-driving car
accidents so far have not been the
self-driving cars fault it's been the
other guy the human oh my god now that
will change of course that these cars
propagate into the real-world market and
the hands of non trained professionals
who aren't official company testers and
certainly the miles driven so far by
self-driving cars are under optimal
conditions the current state of cars
that rely on sensors around the vehicle
to see and read every situation really
can't hack it can heavy snow or hail or
even a wicked thunderstorm
see back and suddenly at University of
Michigan also point out there probably
some awkward teenage years ahead when
the earliest commercial self-driving
cars will be basically surrounded and
outnumbered by human driven cars they
with their hard logic we with our fuzzy
logic it's gonna make for some
unpredictable results bottom line as we
get these early indications of the
efficacy of self-driving cars toward
reducing accidents
it pays to double check the reality of
what the goal is complete accident
reduction or really a dramatic
improvement in fatalities at least in
some situations welcome back to see net
on cars coming to you from our home at
the mountain Motor Club just north of
the Golden Gate Bridge
well automotive crash tests to figure
out how safe vehicles are are a dramatic
tangible way to understand how when and
where a car will deform when it hits
something that ain't gonna move but it
does seem like a rather
twentieth-century process doesn't it
what if the whole thing could be turned
into basically a very high-resolution
video game it's happening
makes for a fascinating car Tech 101
it's part of the automotive landscape
new cars crashed intentionally with
great precision and measurement to
determine how they'll behave when you do
the same thing to them with far less
precision and intention but the setup is
exacting and tedious a given car can
when you crashed once and there isn't
time to crash every model of every year
of every make of car enter virtual crash
testing which stands to perhaps
revolutionize this spectacle of auto
crash worthiness cars and their parts
are all designed on computers these days
via CAD computer-aided design the design
is just a file of data that same data
which exists about every part every
panel every rivet screw and weld and
even the amount of gas in the tank along
with any crash you can imagine can be
fed into a computer a serious computer
running 10,000 cores across 200 or so
cpus and gpus turn off the lights come
back in 10 or 20 hours and see the crash
that never happened it's amazing to look
at the realism but more important are
these three games it's repeatable no
cars were harmed in this collision that
means you can run it over and over with
the cost and set-up time of real tests
remove its peelable
you can peel back or make invisible any
portion of the car to see how a given
sub assembly performs in real time can't
do that with a real crash test and it's
variable find a weakness redesign that
area via CAD upload the new design data
run the crash again see if it's now
fixed no need to retool and create a new
part for another crash test
so why are we still crashing cars for
real well virtual crash tests aren't
complete they're about 90 plus percent
accurate and data for a gap that should
be closable risk does move slowly car
makers insurers and regulators aren't
the type to jump overnight to a new
method where our lives are involved it
still takes too long that half a day to
a day of data processing per crash test
needs to come down and widespread
adoption is needed not every car maker
uses this technology nor are they using
a standardized version of it nonetheless
virtual crash testing looks like it may
do to the world of crash worthiness what
the computer did to photography in a
moment your email does working on your
car put you in hot water and who makes
the best quality cars when CNET on cars
continues
I had some doubts whether or not the XP
could handle what we were going to throw
at it but it did remarkably well it took
on every challenge we threw at it and
came out unscathed it's comforting to
know that during the inevitable zombie
apocalypse there are going to be
vehicles out there that are able to take
us to where we need without having to
rely on roads and I for one celebrate
that fact find more from the ex car team
of CNET UK at cnet.com slash welcome
back to CNET on cars i'm brian coulis
here's the part of the show that i
really like taking some of your emails
first one this time comes in from dr.
Ron and Reno who says some of us like to
add equipment to our cars that the
manufacturer only offered on a more
expensive model or not at all
case in point he says I put BMWs own
night-vision system into his 2016 328i
sports wagon that's a model that doesn't
offer BMW night vision pretty creative
he says he used an independent shop
after the dealer said they wouldn't do
it and told him it would void his
warranty
he says I did it for sacrifice my
cupholders to make room for the LCD
screen you can see some of those photos
there where he put the screen and where
he put the front sensor he says could
you explain to your audience of the 1975
Maus Magnussen warranty act affects
consumers who choose to add options or
obtain service not approved or provided
by the manufacturer interesting topic
Ron this is so big and weighty I'm
actually going to do a whole car tech
101 on it in our next episode episode 84
the meantime let me give you a couple of
quick pointers here on the three
entities that have something to say
about this first of all as you mention
the Magnussen Moss Warranty Act of 1975
this one's enforced by the FTC the
Federal Trade Commission here in the US
what Magnussen law says is you don't
have to use factory parts and you don't
have to go to the dealer to get your
work done to keep your car in warranty
the caveat to that is if you go use
aftermarket parts that are crap or go to
a lousy independent shop and either of
those cause damage to the car that is
not under warranty the next one I want
to tell you about is what's called CPE
Insurance this is customer provided
equipment it's an insurance industry
term you are insured in you're in
it's policy for the stuff that the
factory put on the car if you go and say
add a fancy tire and wheel package to
your car or put on a completely cool
stainless aftermarket exhaust and that
gets damaged in a collision it may not
be covered the insurance strictly covers
what was put there by the factory for
the most part anything substantial
beyond that may not be in your coverage
you got to look for the CPE language in
your policy and or see if your insurer
requires you to take out a separate CPE
writer to cover the specific things
you've added it's kind of like adding
jewelry to your home insurance policy
you know that works you got to sometimes
do declared a special coverage above and
beyond the basics and the third and
final one here is a more of an outlier
but becoming a big topic lately and that
is the dmca the Digital Millennium
Copyright Act which has lately been
interpreted to say if you go into a car
and change its firmware it's software
that lives on chips you are in theory
breaking the DMCA you're breaking a
copyright law that says you can't
reverse engineer or hack in to that kind
of technology that intellectual property
which the car maker has burned into the
chips in your car the most recent
interpretations though are saying you
have the right to at least go into the
firmware to diagnose a car and work in
the code of the vehicle you'll have to
stay out of there and leave it to the
dealer but a lot of the stuff is being
tested and figured out right now we'll
talk more about it in car tech 101-80
in our next episode next email comes in
from just indeed who writes in about car
quality he says when I was younger my
father used to talk about how Japanese
cars were so superior to American ones
according to him it had something to do
with the superior attitude of the
Japanese when it came to manufacturing
is that still the case now I know what
you're talking about there has long been
a halo around Japanese quality that
began back in the late 60s and early 70s
when this Toofer happened Japanese cars
came here with great fuel economy right
about the time we started getting hit
with these oil embargos and fuel crises
and secondly Japanese cars were built
extremely well to try and enter this
competitive market at a time when
American quality was indisputably
getting really sloppy move forward today
decades later you'll still find that the
Japanese makes get the best grades from
let's say consumer report
it's for long-term reliability I mean
look at the list and you'll find Toyota
Lexus Honda scion subaru overweight in
the top ratings that said I can tell you
from my experience that cars are
increasingly occupying a narrower and
narrower band of quality there isn't a
lot of junk out there anymore there have
been major gains by the American makes
there are three reasons why quality's
gotten so good in cars from what I see
from our technology point of view let me
run those down for you briefly first of
all is the era of digitization in design
and manufacturing of cars cars are
designed on computers and car components
are milled and shaped and often made by
computers you get extremely good
repeatability and the actual production
of those parts is highly precise with
very close tolerances because of the
digitization and computerization of
manufacturing and design the next big
factor are the Tier one suppliers your
car maker doesn't make a lot of the
parts that go into your car they use
what are called Tier one suppliers
enormous companies that are expert at
making axles cylinder heads speakers
seats whatever it may be and as a result
of that specialty and the fact that
they've got global audiences so they get
a lot of consistency in practice
excellent parts go into cars these days
and the third thing is electronics as
cars became more and more electronic
starting with electronic fuel injection
going back what thirty something years
to the fact that almost everything is
electronically run and monitored now in
a vehicle you've got an awful lot of
precision and a lot of intelligence in
the vehicle that can keep things running
right without you having to fuss with it
and constantly take the car in to get it
tuned by a human thanks for watching I
really appreciate you being here hope
you enjoyed this episode
