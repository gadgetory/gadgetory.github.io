things
I'm your host Aya's Akhtar the router is
the backbone of your home network it can
determine whether you have great Wi-Fi
or connections because you can't
connected any decent speeds today we're
counting down the top five routers
available spoiler you're going to see
one company on this list a lot at number
five is the Apple Airport extreme now it
doesn't provide a lot of customizations
but it's really easy to use it's got
that trademark style you've seen from
that Cupertino company and set up as a
breeze for people who live in the Apple
universe the airport extreme will fit in
well in our tests we found it to be
plenty speedy - at number four is the
assist our TAC 3200 tri-band Wireless
gigabit router when was the last time
you heard a web interface for a router
was fun to use probably when you read
scene at your review for the soos RT ac
3200 it's got enough power that it can
act as a small server and is one of the
most powerful routers you can get and it
had an effective range of around 200
feet and reach speeds of 513 megabits
per second wirelessly that's pretty dang
fast
oh and it can even connect to multiple
internet sources at one time so if you
want to use two connections at one time
you can do it at number three is the
Linksys wrt54g vac - the Linksys wrt54g
oh and it's one of the fastest Wi-Fi
routers in existence all right now the
wrt 1900 a C also has an excellent range
this router has four gigabit ports a USB
3.0 port and another port that can be
used for USB 2.0 or eSATA port and when
you attach a harddrive to it this rider
gets that share Drive on the network
like a boss sorry
I really shouldn't have said that what I
mean is performance is very good at
number two is the assuit RT AC 68 you
dual band wireless AC 1900 router yep a
soos is on this list again the rtac 68 u
is one of the fastest routers CNET's
tested clocking it at 520 megabits per
second this guy can act as an access
point as well another
you can use it to extend your wireless
network and conjunction with another
router like the other assumes we
mentioned on this list it can also
handle two internet connections at once
like DSL and cable it's parental control
feature is also very easy to set up
before we get to number one let's take a
moment to point out the elephant in the
room that's right the new Google router
the on hub it's new it's stylish and it
claims it makes your wireless world a
whole lot better now in our testing its
high asking price just doesn't match its
performance so for right now it's a pass
and the number one router right now is
via seuss AC 2400 RT AC 87 you now why
is this the best of the best it's really
easy to set up it's versatile and it's
crazy fast Wireless speeds we're over
one gigabit per second a gigabit that's
really really freaking fast it can
handle VPN and it's USB port can handle
hard drives printers and even cell
modems the firmware on this thing allows
you to easily prioritize traffic on a
network what's more important to you
voice gaming streaming video you can set
that up
it does have some odd design choices
like it's USB 3.0 port is on the front
and it's a pretty big device it could
probably have more than 4 Ethernet ports
considering its size but see nuts don't
know says all in all this newest seuss
has the most complete feature set I've
seen for a home router and there you
have it the top 5 routers available
today a soos is pretty much the king of
the mountain right now if this list make
you want to chuck out your current
router as much as it did for me let me
know on twitter i'm matt is thanks for
watching and we'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
