faces and keeping track of your tab I'm
Bridget Kira and this is your senior
update more details are being revealed
about BlackBerry's latest operating
system blackberry 10 when the next
blackberry phone comes out late this
year it will be entirely touchscreen the
home screen will have large tiles for
app shortcuts which will display real
time info much like Windows Phone tiles
or widgets on Android there's also a
multitasking feature called flow view
it's a way for you to quickly swipe
between apps flowing from task to task
and you'll never be caught with your
eyes closed with the new camera the
software it lets you wind back time on
selected portions of a photo by a few
frames click on someone's face and go
back a second before they blinked while
keeping everyone else the same it's like
bending the fabric of time and there's
that new virtual keyboard it will
predict your next word and places it
right above the letter you will hit next
just flick that word up word to toss it
in your typing field yesterday we asked
you to send us your thoughts about
blackberry and going all touchscreen in
its next phone and we got some great
replies here's a video Sam Anderson sent
to us on tout isn't the only reason why
people buy a blackberry is because of
the keyboard maybe that's why people
don't buy it though I mean they lost
exclusivity with bbm now there's I
message so I guess if you can't beat
them join them maybe a little better
success thank you Sam researcher motion
has said that the physical keyboard is
not dead they will eventually make
another phone with that tangible
keyboard fans love many of you told us

have thoughts on this or other stories
