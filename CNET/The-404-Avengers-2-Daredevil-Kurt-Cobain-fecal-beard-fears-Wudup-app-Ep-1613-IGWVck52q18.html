transform and then across the table from
me right now you may remember this guy
from shows known as the 404 show mr.
Justin you hey everybody we got an
impersonator ha what's up dude how are
the top Jeff what's up is how you doing
dude I wish you would have collected a
bunch of your old coffee cups from
starbucks because I bet you've gotten so
many wrong names written on there you
know I I didn't bother giving up my name
is because it became easy to the hassle
cuz it be like what's your name and I'm
like Alex yeah yes Alex yeah and it
still be spelled wrong but that doesn't
matter it's like well they're gonna
screw up somebody else right yeah from
you I totally give like Bob yeah my I'm
not doing is what peony does too because
so many people wrote pony and panini
alright that she just started saying
Jennifer's it went over PA yeah it was a
level to which I was like screw it I'm
gonna just use my name and then people
are like how do you spell that so I'm
like go actually writing it out in the
cup and they spell it right yeah then
the person the other other end is like
they hold up the cup in there like uh
I'm like that's me yeah that's just me
cuz if they don't want they don't even
call up the name is a butcher like I
don't care if her it's only looks I feel
like there's only three ways to
pronounce that I mean I'm not even
double macchiato for I yeah yes that did
yes Jesus Jesus is the worst one of her
yes he's as no less he's someone put the
Z in front of your name like Batman
villain this was this was at a high
school the guy that just like cuts
himself that's a superpower that he can
already know he can see really when he
kills people he makes hash marks right
how many superpowers no he's just crazy
talk about this calendar man have
powers no he's just like super obsessed
with the year whose calendar man oh yeah
give me clock King no no no Kara the
calendar man's a Batman villain I don't
know calendar man yeah did I just you
just one up on ya I believe he's a
friend of Jarvis tech right the Mad
Hatter and you owe the mad hatter ok I
didn't know his real name was joris
either you're full of right now I
gotta he's right I i I've seen talent
actually has one of those pull away
calendar numbers i think on a hoppity
survive like the multiple like reboots
to the universe's you said around
slicing up now my calendar man yeah just
one extra later it is like a easy you
look at me costo and I see dadjokes
usually names I calendar and high fives
all around you idiot speaking of the
superheroes actually that's a good
transition for what we wanted to talk
about our first run 10th pick of the day
it's not a good transition if you run
talk about the transition I can't
believe regardless i'm sorry i did want
to spend more time on calendar man but
go ahead well we're talking about
superheroes you could still do that but
i wanted to talk more about daredevil
and avengers because those are two
things that i've watched recently and
you have tues would you think about well
where do you want to start well i mean
it's our said before we start it's got
to be spoiler free ok he promised yeah
because to stone adventures like we're
devil maybe not oh yeah it was okay
Neville's been around for her in a month
that Netflix show right yeah and watched
it I probably will I got a lot of time
on my hands these days it's really good
and I didn't really care for daredevil
as a character before I never read the
comic book a second cuz that comic book
movie nearly destroyed the yeah
character itself yeah that was bad yeah
but jennifer connelly who I think did a
good job she wasn't in that one you
think it wasn't she was in Hulk know she
was in daredevil as electro right that
was uh Jennifer Garner yeah wait would
you know what alias was yeah that's
right was dared Affleck was due and
kevin smith had nothing to do with that
movie I don't think he did if he did it
wouldn't have sucked as bad I don't have
you seen jersey girl Kevin Smith's a
comic nerd he would do a better job
would I don't know why I associate him
with that film it's associate with Ben
Affleck you can't think of one without
the other does daredevil have any actual
superpowers aside from his height is
getting enhanced heightened
heightened senses that actually happen
when you lose your sight uh not to the
point of super heroic well we could try
that right now live he can ascend this I
don't think it happened to in either
they got my glasses guys I think you
developed the heightened senses of if
you watch the show they actually talk
about the training right and that thing
is it's based on it's a lot of it's
based on the man of Man Without Fear
mini series that ran so daredevil
essentially can see his eyes just don't
work uh well he uses echolocation the
way a whale does similar to well except
he's not constantly going wah yeah I'm
not like tapping monster by the way that
would be so much more believable if
they're devil just you always knew where
that guy was though that would be that
would be as giving any more like an owl
or yeah I should be more Matt who can do
the bloody of dolphin impression yeah
they do like that that's knocking that's
not echo look right but a whale is like
they do stuff like that your radio is
fine and we're getting back to daredevil
go huh if you were a fan of the comic
book there's a ton of really cool easter
eggs in it too so i don't want to give
too many away you can look up lists
online but there's other characters that
appear in the background within like
drawings and scuffs keep a lookout for
that okay and kingpin I think that guy
just does an amazing job being sort of
the pre pre kingpin in that show it's
d'onofrio as kingpin he's really good
kingpin had powers or is he just like a
walking talking block of stone i freak i
mean in the show he's basically just a
big deal e yeah she basically is that
but he's just kind of unbeatable in
general so like it seems like he's got
super powers but you could shoot him in
the head he died he's just super fat
yeah the reason i got into that show was
because my friend linked me to a clip of
it from the second episode where he's in
that hallway and they just film all that
one minute fight sequence that looks to
be uncut i don't know if there was damn
it well go watch the show it's awesome
yeah it reminded me a lot of old boy on
that movie from a couple years ago where
they film like a 10 minute just straight
through fight sequence they did a great
job with it so if you're into action I
mean superheroes aside he doesn't even
real
get into costume until much later in the
series okay I kind of liked that they
didn't yeah it's kind of see it's all
pretty like it's almost pretty daredevil
yeah and the weird thing was if you were
watching on Netflix as the days went on
that the art would change for the show
right so the first day it just matt
murdock and adjusting his tie and he's
got bruises on his face but like the
third day that it's on they show the
full day rubble costume and I'm like
damn it yeah I want to see it yet I
guess netflix it decided I have to see
it now what do you think about that
costume uh into it zoom read it is red
black I mean it's night what I don't
like is the I got the mouth an opening
part of it you don't talk my cuz it
shows a lot of his like his neck it's
true and that's that's what reads weird
to me when I see it cuz every other
action hero batman of super master
commands never was mask but even the
other daredevil they kind of cut it
around the chin see right they'll have
this little weird piece of skin I get
this extra bit right under his chin yeah
that's a little odd not for nothing but
what the hell does he care about what he
looks like that I mean that's a nice to
look presentable since 22 yes sorta yeah
why he's wearing this thing and what
he's trying to be it I mean it's a
spoiler to think that he wants to be a
symbol right like he's a symbol that's a
concept all right I'm gonna have to
watch this now so I think we have a
universal endorsement for daredevil I
would lower your expectations I think he
made it sounded way better really i
think it was good okay okay i think it
wasn't amazing i like and there's some
scenes that are really good but like
Karen page is really freaking annoying
Karen page who's that oh yes yes it's
like would you just shut up this is true
every time she's on screen I'm like the
first couple episodes all right she's
there and okay she's talking and she's a
moding a lot and I'm like okay bye
episode 10 I'm like whenever she comes
on I don't we can do anything right now
and start talking and because you say
one watching in peace and quiet I'll
start vacuuming right if she gets on
screen cuz she's always like you gotta
do something she's and she's the
anti-feminist I don't know she's just
always helpless even though the rest of
the characters around her are getting
work she's it in really bad situations a
lot she's almost like a look up what's
that thing like a hostage constantly
yeah spoiler that's weird um all right
good to know that I'll make sure I don't
like that character
check it out again I guess you didn't
know for yourself so who's boss who's
behind this and trying to figure out
who's behind this like if it's a good
show you gotta gotta tip your hat to the
people behind this the showrunner I
don't recognize any of these people no
I'm not didn't feel so strongly about
Avengers though yeah that's that and I
think that's because it's the exact same
movie as all the other Avengers movies
yeah it's basically get more of the same
if you like it's Avengers 2 we like
small ships coming out of bigger ships
in the sky then you'll love you is that
not what every Avengers movie in one
right I think slugs of small alien horde
ships coming out from a larger
mothership couple you brought this up
last week did you not where you said the
Avengers are the most powerful team of
superheroes ever what else can they
fight resides otherwise the universe's
most you know awful creations yeah i
mean like Thor could take out everybody
in any girl it wasn't why the hell the
rest do you hang on he's a living God
yeah the guy who can run real fast
thrown a shield so good I guess now uh
someone was telling me that there are
more members of the Avengers than the
films are displaying is that true is
there like a lower ranking of the
Avengers as if they need more disciples
there's a ton of Avengers really
yeah why are they all in this on this
team because this it's the idea when the
books it's the idea they've like as many
members as they have evil doesn't pop up
as much if you like look you're gonna
get hit by the Avengers and they have
like everybody everybody at some points
in Avenger okay even like Wolverines
been an Avenger spider-man's manually
and you're gettin laurels been Avenger
like everybody's been an Avenger I'm
surprised Wolverine did that yeah it was
like a fairly not recent thing yeah I'm
kind of 15 years so what happens do they
have like this indoctrination like
ceremony are you just like United they
kind of come together there's never like
oh we are the Avengers but it gets it's
basically already happened they have to
like show up to one location be like
okay are you here for the Avengers me
exactly they have a conference and
they're like you want to listen to the
shield guy yeah okay cool I'll listen to
red white and blue guy we're good and as
long as they
do that everything's fine but they're
gonna be like you know bastards and be
like am i listening to you yeah they're
off before the show we spoke briefly
about the trailers that preceded the
Avengers film I still have not seen
Avengers 2 how old is Ultron age of
Ultron dopeman snowmen I'll see that
when it comes out somewhere else because
I saw the first Avengers in the theater
and I was just like this was a waste of
ten bucks yeah yeah just like I don't
know I thought it wasn't bad what are
you expecting Justin that's why I wasn't
expecting a lot cuz I didn't really like
any of the other Avengers movies so if
all you're looking for is some violence
and explosions a decimation of engines
favorite city are DJs if that you'll get
that for sure this is our DJ making like
dumbass quips every 17 minutes right and
they do sort of a lewd at the end to a
larger villain that will appear in the
next movie that I'm pretty excited about
so I wonder what that one's gonna be
about there will be about little ships
coming out of ships I guarantee you
there will be a mothership and warship
that'll be the subtitle more ships
coming at Ashley this one was kind of
different because they came from the
ground like slightly opposite so you
always welcome to the water yes the next
one wins so the first Avengers correct
me if I'm wrong was low key yeah yeah
and Loki was lie working for somebody he
was working for like a gland in the
middle of space like just hep athanas
yeah sanaz so so Thanos just has like a
chair he sits on in the middle of space
well yes wouldn't you I mean how do they
get there it's all its paces big and
he's just like on one little box yeah
like oh sorry fan aside be here quicker
I know premium real estate in space man
you didn't see a lot of mostly rock
higher caliber like I don't care how big
you are I have no freaking idea where
you are you're smaller than a satellite
little easy really there's like apps for
this you know there's like an uber tooth
nanos the order it seems ridiculous to
me anyway so is that us in this one
Dennis isn't a little bit here's a
spoiler there's an extra after credits
scene oh my god movie do tell but it
actually happens before the long long
credits there's like yeah who else
jeje credits and then you have like so
you what sit there for five minutes and
there you go here's the scene yeah and
then it's 10 minutes of you know the
black screen with like Sheree but his
name's so a bunch of us still sit there
and wait they call that something
regular edits no I forget they call that
I don't I came in 30 years I can wax
poetic about when I was your age age to
wait to the integral yes for that pretty
quick wait so was there another second
see no I just want to make sure that
everyone who's listening to this now you
haven't seen it there's no unless you
really want to see that that no animals
were harmed yeah and that's actually a
trademark phrase that had no idea i'm
just sitting there staring it is what
couldn't you just put that in your own
words you can change it you just don't
use their Drake bar huh no animals were
harmed in the filming this movie yeah
wow I didn't know that that's amazing
that someone copyrights that I don't
know these are things that you look up
i'm so bored i'm looking at i'm like
okay i don't okay i don't know anybody
on this copyright reform was it trailer
it's a little different um alright yeah
trademark reform ok back to the trailers
what what were the trailers what did you
see yes see I'm reserving my hate for
Avengers because I'll need that overflow
for ant-man when that comes out and a
lot of people not happy about that movie
at all and it's still months away or
haven't seen a single trailer people are
watch the wait did we watch different
versions of that movie well so i came in
late to the movie um well hang on now
are you that guy yeah is it die max
first of all and i have reserved seats
just what is that what does imax event
i'm the same like there was a giant imax
like 10 minute trailer 20 tomorrowland
gotcha so i got there was this when i
walked in there's George Clooney
fighting off something I'm like what the
hell I don't remember him in this movies
on an Avengers is he yeah and I had no
idea what the trails were going to be so
I got in a little late and tomorrow line
was already gone so i'm assuming kind of
cool by the way that was was that lawman
effects it was that none everywhere else
I think that's every world oh yeah yeah
that's the george clooney movie and we
talked briefly about that last week
right Russ fresh dick believes that
there's no way he's making it out alive
of that film oh you think that George
Clooney will die I just got a funny
because it's just like me he's already
kind of old like yeah happy ending
exactly alright so what other trailers
did you guys see yes I saw Ant Man which
on
you know there's not much more to say
about that aside from ant-man it seems
like they didn't know how to make that
yeah does that make sense where they
where it seems like the direction the
the thematic elements of that because
I'd never heard of ant-man before yeah
the film and it seems like it was
supposed to be a comedy but it got
wrapped up in something else and now
it's just directionless right and it's
it sort of has a self humor about it
which i can understand movie called that
and in the trailer and it is not a
spoiler because i obviously haven't seen
it but uh Paul Rudd kind of talks about
how it wasn't his idea to call himself
at man oh boy and so it's a little self
reflective I don't know me I'll probably
watch it when it comes out on to rent
yeah to Brent to rent to rent old man
yeah did you see like the little uh
there's little viral marketing campaigns
are the little signs like tiny little
billboards at bus stops oh that's got a
viola I kicking level yeah yeah that's
kind of funny cheers for their marketing
to you that's not a bad idea doesn't say
much for the movie though what else are
you not excited for no I am excited for
Batman and Superman oh that makes one of
us why wait guys on my line or do you
yeah you all watch that no not yeah oh
no i'll watch it i'm not excited about
it yeah i patch it the way you know
Malcolm McDowell how to watch all that
stuff and clockwork are ya is hella
watch that yeah with a group of
scientists being monitored that's all i
watch that piece of garbage that's a
pre-emptive piece of garbage yeah come
on what I mean I look I I don't like
what you were saying earlier I as I
don't have a lot of hope for these
movies I'm definitely sort of you know
tempering my my expectations all right
that's so I don't know it might be
enjoyable that's what Avengers was too
it's a good way to waste two hot hours
in New York sure I don't know Avengers
had years to build up you got these
characters right being developed yeah
this Superman Batman movie you've got to
explain who the hell Batman is first of
all because it doesn't exist in this
world wait I thought he was supposed to
be older well he's still oh there's not
it's not attached to any of the other
Batman wait so this is a new Batman
we've never seen him in this world right
so this is not in any way shape or
warm related to Dark Knight Returns know
okay there's that part and then which
apparently there's going to be a sequel
of two would think the due to the dark
knight returns 0 NE right of what's his
face was writing another Nolan no not
know the dark knight returns when
Batman's old and so that's basically
what this movie is yeah that's right
milord yeah right so this is gonna be
like a Reagan a Reaganite sort of well
known fact that they have this giant
fight even the metal armored version of
Batman it's kind of from that book right
I returns I think I'm right logo the
benin logo looks very similar um but
what was the thing so it's a different
thing and then there's going to be a
wonder woman that's gonna be introduced
and Aquaman so like if you're gonna
introduce all of these people and two
hours versus Avengers would say set up
what how many years right five years to
go here's an Ironman and here's a
captain america and here's a god yeah
one movie we're gonna get three massive
characters and they're gonna be hanging
out with Superman yeah but they won't be
telling jokes like the Avengers are so
that'll leave a lot more time we keep
screaming great people I mean I know I
there is really no excitement no buzz
behind this it seems very forced um I
think a lot of it has to do with the
people behind it they're just not
directors that have been uber successful
with comic book stuff right it's Snyder
I just I don't think he enjoys the world
it's like it's so bleak I mean he's
doing Superman Superman is like the
brightest happiest freaking guy in there
all things like I'm really down that's
all the time I feel bad for anyone that
has to endeavor to make a superhero
movie now well so what happened with
Joss Whedon so Joss Whedon left Twitter
I think earlier this week a lot of
people are speculating that it was
because um it was over criticism over
the Black Widow character Scarlett
Johansson in the Avengers um the
controversy is that uh I think a lot of
people are upset that she fell in love
with the Hulk in this movie um boy
that's not a spoiler everybody knows
that it's in a newspaper oh is it I read
it in the Daily News I just heard that
for the first newspaper yeah I picked up
every right next to the red robin you
rent your moves actually I've never been
more not upset about here
yeah is but that what's about that when
you're watching because I thought it was
kind of uh it took the movie down in
tempo a lot which I was like said about
but I didn't you know I didn't take a
feminist perspective he's come out and
said he's called horse literally
keys that's his a quote from joss whedon
BuzzFeed reports that he'd left he says
it's horseshit that he left because of
feminist right yeah that was all
speculative so but as he said why ah
it's just sounds like when you become
mega famous specifically in a realm in a
medium that is filled with the majority
is geeky sort of pre-pubescent
hyper-growth overly critical like you
said maybe there comes a point where you
just can't take it anymore because you
can't do right unless you're Christopher
Nolan right or someone who just is
untouchable so maybe that's what it is
yeah and I up until he left Twitter I
thought Chuck Sweden was untouchable as
well yeah but I guess he's not he's not
doing the next Avengers movies right
he's just out yeah done with Marvel he's
done with this and hanging up unrelated
right okay yeah it's interesting I don't
know how it's all gonna shake out for
the guy but whatever right leave him
alone I didn't think that the the Black
Widow turn was like that bad I kind of
like the story getting smaller I don't
want it necessarily want to see giant
villains taking on the giant super team
it's like hey let's get some character
development here right and it's possible
maybe because if you work together close
enough with somebody may be like yeah
you know either build a relationship or
friendship or romance it seems normal a
little confused cuz I thought in the
first Avengers movie it was Black Widow
and Hawkeye that were sort of together
in retrospect i'm kind of realizing that
they never showed any kind of physical
intimacy with others oh yeah you know he
gets knocked out in the first movie and
she takes care of him I don't know maybe
I just assumed that he's like it wasn't
me just got to go out with him maybe hot
guys like me and falls in love with
every woman that takes care I don't know
that's probably accurate um all right
let's let's switch gears moving away
from sci-fi fantasy to documentary this
week saw the release of montage of heck
right which is the kurt cobain
documentary Kurt Cobain everyone knows
who that is he's on your classic rock
stations folks if you don't know that is
Kurt Cobain recently what it's baby can
you believe it's been 21 years the fact
that it's on classic rock stations yeah
makes me sad yeah it's strange you'll
hear like Boston more than a feeling and
then you'll hear you know breed right on
on 10 43 here in New York anyway the the
film is out it's in theaters and on HBO
you've made your way halfway through it
about halfway through what do you think
is this for me it's been touted as the
definitive whether it's official
unofficial the definitive Kurt Cobain
story yeah how do you feel about it so
far well they got their hands on a lot
of artifacts from his life that a lot of
the other documentaries don't have which
is cool and they find kind of unique
ways to tell that story so for example a
lot of the cartoons that he'd ruin those
spiral notebooks yeah they actually
animate some of that sky well into
moving pictures tell the story of his
life with voiceovers and stuff like that
so it's very unique in in terms of
features I'm not done yet so I'm going
to reserve judgment for it but I do like
all the multimedia in it and you learn a
lot of things about how Kurt Cobain was
kind of a humorous you know a lot of
people paint him as a real aduro's guy
but through some of this archival
footage you can see him crack jokes be
comfortable with Courtney it's it's
really cool and a lot of it you can sort
of tell is framed has a story to be told
to Frances Bean now about her father
yeah so it's it's more it seems close a
closer look at his autobiography I'd his
biography than some of the other ones
you know probably because she served as
executive producer I think i right it's
so interesting because you know she
doesn't really she probably doesn't
remember him no she was two when he
killed himself right uh and i read an
interview she gave
I think it was rolling stone yeah and
that take one of the takeaways is that
she's not a fan of Nirvana really right
which I thought was interesting yeah
which is a big Foo Fighters fan I'm just
kidding oh I'm gonna have no idea what I
we say seven the vacuum rolls over in
his grave there goes my hero Oh God
either way you slice it all it does seem
like she she doesn't necessarily it's
gonna sound crazy but she doesn't
necessarily have the undying respect and
admiration for her dad I'm not saying
she doesn't appreciate him and
understand but I think she's sort of you
know because he was not in her life
maybe she has that luxury of detaching
herself from the pop culture icon that
he evolved into posthumously hmm so I
don't know what do you think about that
it's kind of a weird thing do you think
that had to do with Nirvana's music
perhaps not holding up to a new
generation I I don't care who you are
never mind is a freakin masterpiece yeah
but I remember when I was a caterer and
I love the Beatles now but when I was
growing up I didn't really see the
appeal for it it kind of sounded like
simple childhood so like childish songs
to me but when I got older I realized
that a lot of my favorite bands were
influenced by the Beatles maybe that's
what a lot of kids see Nirvana as they
don't realize yeah maybe you're right
thats rips came from that's a fantastic
point I remember growing up I kind of
didn't respect the Beatles yeah until I
was like maybe 12 or 13 when I was like
oh wait a minute and I got my hands on
my guitar and I was like they did
everything what are drugs you know wait
what drugs were like you learn like six
chords and you're like they used all the
chords and they've done every
progression you could do ya know the
songs have room them so that to me was
kind of like the eye opening yeah thing
for the Beatles but it did wasn't
hervana though it was all like about
context because I think back then it was
all like really poppy glam kind of crap
oh yeah it totally smashed it smashed
through all that oh my god somebody's
got guitar again yeah and there's a good
actual
loud crunchy guitar not overly processed
and crazy was like oh good this is what
music to sound like kind of money the
Beatles is like it's clean music versus
overly echo didn't and layered and
layered and layered and layered to can't
have something that you recognize this I
music yeah I think it was the grittiness
like just how dirty that record felt
nevermind yeah uh you know it happens to
be like one of the best quality sounding
records you can find much of a ever
recorded right arm I think was like the
grunge eNOS not the genre the the just
the grime eNOS of that and then don't
forget couple that with that music video
which was so important in the 90 yeah
and I've been parodied of course but I
mean I remember watching that as a kid
and being like we're part of this club
that like we're all mad not sure why
we're all mad and we're all in this club
and this music speaks for us that's what
he talks about a lot to is his
resistance the idea that he's the voice
of writer and that and and he assumed
that without his he didn't want that no
he just had stomach aches he was just a
guy with an ulcer you know he just
wanted to get rid of that pain and we
meet labeled him a figurehead after that
but anyway go go and watch the
documentary it's definitely worth
checking out just for the eye candy
alone speaking of the Beatles not a
Nirvana fan oh yeah for sure I mean I
and I won't lie like I became more of a
Nirvana fan the older I got ya uh he
died when I was 12 right and III had a
copy of nevermind then but I don't I
wasn't as obsessed with that record as I
am now yeah like I listened to that
record now and men that that record is
not so I think I'll call it a record
dude you gotta come on out an album it's
a record later guys movie also may go
back and rediscover whole I'm guys
wherever into it I liked her have been
like terraria and is but all parts doll
parts I think I won't live through
through the both of those records are so
good good yeah I mean there's not
there's no live performances of hole in
the documentary there I'd be there are
plenty on YouTube I'm sure Courtney Love
man she what a weird bird huh
she is what not I'm attractive
especially in this movie too well have
you seen her lately dude and yeah
actually you should see her in this
movie they yeah that's good okay good I
don't know if that's the bill Mueller
that's another reason to one son do you
guys are thinking of her in the roast
where she's like falling off the chair
next to Pamela Anderson and like she
can't keep yourself in the simpsons
auntie or order character in The
Simpsons but what about the People vs
Larry Flynt II where she well my friend
she's she every now and then she like
pulls out these brilliant pieces of
artistry hmm right is a very strange
Courtney Love I've always had a crush or
any love yeah she's beautiful but now's
your chance she's 50 yeah go for it oh
wow she's tall until 5 10 Jesus that's
yeah good go go for it man I don't know
she's tied up right now yeah definitely
hit that space bar a few times story
okay so we we were talking then we
talked a little bit about the george
harrison yes because i was wondering how
long this document is this is
particularly long no it's not that why
is it called montage of heck is that
that mixtape he made that it's called
that question I remember reading I don't
I can't okay that's too George yeah
there was a there's a George Harrison
documentary that's on HBO now and
because I saw that the kurt cobain thing
was available there so it's gonna check
it out right but I've watched like the
first half of the George Harrison
documentaries like four hours long so
there's two parts two hours each adds to
its directed by Martin Scorsese so it's
completely authorized so you get like
everybody there you get McCartney you
get Olivia Harrison you get a son you
get George Harrison of videos you get
everything and it's freaking awesome if
you're a beetle spin or a George
Harrison fan I mean like it really is
it's killer to see like this guy who
just kind of like they're asking
question like so you made a comeback why
did you go back to music this like in
the 70's he's like well you got to do
something you know what are you gonna do
with your time that's basically his
weird attitude towards life is really
intriguing hmm the spacing somebody who
dropped out whenever you wanted to come
back in show up and do you like with the
one song you know from def oh um I'm not
my mindset I got I got mom onsen
yeah all the taxidermy animals singing
that one was a remake of like yeah it's
an old some these songs I thought he
could make it a hit I'll do that that's
we want to give these guys a hit he
remade it I think like what movie took
it was like a lethal weapon or sup I
don't know but that song was immensely
successful by a strange now he doesn't
get the reputation that some of the
other Beatles get right yeah was he a
nice guy because it seems like a lot of
the other Beatles just garda nice guys
cuz you brought up something that I had
never heard before you you brought up
ooh does that sound be their opinion no
i didn't i'm not saying that i subscribe
to this but a lot of people think john
lennon was John Layton's kind of a dick
which on some accounts i certainly agree
with one being an absentee father to
both of his kids and sean and who's the
others Julian Julian right to the point
where I think Paul mekia Julian when he
grew up he was quoted as saying that
Paul McCartney was actually more of a
father to him and his own dad ever was
and people don't like Paul McCartney
either well Paul McCartney's a nice guy
like Paul McCartney and generally known
as Gabby's a perfectionist that's where
the the attitude thing comes in because
he would talk down to George Harrison
Wright and George Harris you would say
something like this part is complicated
and this is like in 1968 right The
Beatles been playing for what 20 years
together yeah Harrison like it's not
complicated I'll do whatever you want
yeah Johnson okay guitars but I wouldn't
say that he's the greatest guitarists of
all time I don't think he's retarded I
don't think is regarded as that great
songwriter a great songwriter you wrote
a couple I think you look at like
Clapton and Hendrix for like amazing
guitarist Wow so I I didn't know that
that and then on top of physically
abusing a lot of his ex-wives yeah I had
no idea about that reversal apparently
there's a lot you're showing I think
it's kind of its vilified rightfully
yeah yeah appropriately not a cool guy
or he wasn't a cool guy i mean look say
let's may weather you know fight and
right he's apparently an awful human
being as well oh right yeah everyone
writes great songs don't ya all rights
great team his whole may wear this whole
thing is any time like Katie Couric asks
them about oh he's histories like were
the photos yeah how come there's no
photo I think your looks like i have a
photo of the police report yeah he sucks
why would you that be your notice let's
just go just go to just go to response
and the
as if we reveal because a las vegas
local toy department covers his ass
exactly they love I'm kidding the the
whole DP of Las Vegas is tethered to mr.
mayor may come this way look hundred
twenty million over that over that
anyone fine I read a hundred million
dollars and a journalist asked him to
produce the check and he did yeah
brought it out hundred million dollars
what a dick speak in a dicks I don't but
I don't want to go down that Jackie I
got on there like 80 to 100 also right
but he's getting sued anyway um because
he announced his injury too late and
that compromise a lot of stuff whoa
we're time traveling here ok back to the
Beatles real quick so then what was the
thing about so so John Lennon is a dick
apparently incident like if there's one
thing you take away from this episode if
that John Lennon was it didn't write
though the same way like Steve Jobs like
apparently posthumously became a dick
yeah not posh mr. he was it he was a
dick every day during it was covered
tyrant right yeah he'd fire people it
stories of him firing people in
elevators yeah like legendary is a
minute a through in the fact whole
hiring whole teams like it like a
conference is yeah he'd forget though
that's the thing though that's strange
um yeah I didn't know about the abuse
abuse is not I mean you could be a dick
but once you start hurting people and
women that's not cool that's the thing
is a lot of people hate on Yoko Ono they
blame her for breaking up the Beatles
but it was actually him who came we went
to the group you know it said that he
was done with it and yet he beat her
which is not cool you know I didn't even
I had never even heard that and I've
been around for 33 years I've never even
heard that life lessons so you can pass
it on Oh keep looking like keep looking
at your pinky ring yes can I do
something for me yeah I've got a pinky
ring it's on my ass on my pinky so isn't
it what's the origin behind that so if
you if you guys aren't aware and you
should be now I do have a pinky ring on
it's a little silver thing with the
flowers on it right are you the head of
like a crime family that I am that's
exactly but I get a macro look at that
thing macro yeah you want to see yeah i
think i've ever heard anybody say this
is cool well it's not a perfect circle
either it looks like you forged this
yourself it is a you in Mordor that's
true what I said I used to do back in
California to make sure
no no no what had me go I've got a good
poker face no you're that superhero
poker face absolutely not so that ring
uh is actually my girlfriend's ring it
was her thumb ring and one day she wears
lots of rings lotsa jewelry she's very
decorated so I I decided to take it from
her ok can I heard on you and I said I i
think i'm gonna wear this ring so i
tried to all my fingers and it only fit
on my pinky uh-huh and i was like i
think i can wear the she goes it's got
flowers on you're not gonna wear that
does i was out i was on the air like
every day back then you're not gonna
wear that on screen and i go yes and
watch me i can rock a pinky ring that's
got flowers on it let's see if I could
do it yeah but you can't see the flowers
well these aren't full hours these are
floors like a fluidity they're not like
you know okays a flat it's not like it's
their new did you know with bright
colors its silver and it's been in our
family for like a long time there was
another thing o.o that ring that's why
it's all beaten up like that so I
grabbed it kept it on my finger and I
just been wearing it since then I just
like to spin it and everything it's like
a promise ring I guess so I like a
reverse promise damn thing too noisy
lose ya so I was taking out the dogs
today want to go to the bathroom and
there was snow everywhere and so we left
with the dogs and then I came back and I
didn't have my ring on them oh my god I
lost the ring so tell my girlfriend this
she's like oh it's okay I hey wasn't 40
of them it wasn't really okay says she's
like like I'm gonna go back outside and
search so I had to search through like
snow banks uh-huh and it was just my son
was with he goes I maybe Audrey try to
eat something you try to stop her and
that's where it came off and I'm like
that's exactly what happened cuz I
grabbed my dog's mouth I opened it up in
a kind of shook her mouth oh my gosh and
slobber on my hand so it's kind of like
oh yeah totally totaled that ring went
flying off cuz I lost some weight which
was a problem so like now the thing came
flying off and there was sitting
perfectly on top of a snowbank and I was
like there it is Wow grab it you're
extremely lucky very lucky falling deep
into the Snowden or it could have been
eaten by something or whatever or a
vagrant could have taken off with it
yeah I thought that maybe it fell off
when you were scooping up the poop or
something no they never guess you know
that's what I thought too so actually
found the bag yeah man and I assumed it
I squeezed the back from the outside
I wasn't gonna go direct I'm like oh god
I can't believe I had to do this to get
this ring back and I didn't even find it
in the it was just it was just
having to be sitting cleanly on the
snowbank look at the home and it cleaned
it off a lot before yeah amazing and
that's my pinky ring there you go you're
gonna put it on wrapping film I all
right fantasy of putting her oh there it
is there we go you slid that on so
gingerly go and if mins anyone well any
rings in your future just stop it I got
so much changed propose to Courtney last
episode yeah I know he just confessed
your love the coordinated yeah if she's
listening she's a longtime friend all
right very good not only has the history
of the pink it is not a wedding ring no
all right fair enough fair enough um
what else we got here today I want to
tell you so yesterday I saw Justin
walking around with a with a speaker and
he's looking for like a cauldron filled
with water a cauldron cauldron basically
only a cold so tell me about this
speaker you had that was like supposed
to be waterproof but you broke it yeah
this is uh this is a chronicle from the
life of Justin you this is one paid out
of adapter but the last product that I
reviewed for Cena which went live on
Sina yesterday is the Philips shock box
mini this is a small micro bluetooth
speaker and they've kind of pin it as
something good for the shower Renee yeah
it kind of looks like grenade or you
know you could put it in the in the next
to you while you're washing the dishes
or at a picnic or something like that
and it's pretty nice it's like 60 bucks
sounds great but one of the marketing
pictures that i was looking at on their
website shows this girl lounging in a
floaty in a pool uh-huh with the
bluetooth speaker next to her in the
water in the water and the marketing
materials also said that it floats and
so they encourage you to use it in the
pool obviously so i thought to test this
myself until I realized that date
sticking I just realized the middle the
story that's not exciting snow it is
because you broke it yeah so this about
so the specs say that it's rated for IP
x6 what does
I mean yeah this what's IPA you you know
what a lot of these rugged gadgets say
that their quote waterproof or water
resistance it's so i PX it's a standard
that basically seeks to define the
differences between water resistant and
waterproof so that you know exactly what
it can what's there and so I p x 6 is
right at the cusp between being water
resistant and proof so you can spray it
with water you know can get some rain on
it or maybe some droplets but you
certainly can't submerge it it's only
until you hit ipx7 certification okay
that you can actually push it underneath
the water right all right so this deep
level stuff so that literally and then
you cover them to Justin I'm like
looking for a container and no one has a
big enough containers I can fill it with
water to see if this thing floats right
and so I finally empty a vase all right
I found like a flower vase that was
filled with candy all the candy I used
dumped out all of Kenny's candy right
and you filled it up with water color in
water until I see them like what happens
like I broke it yeah it sounds like in
the kitchen and I'm like playing music
like oh this is great and then the thing
accidentally tips underneath the surface
of the water and immediately bridge like
a me likely test over so the pool though
it's a great speaker but if you try to
put it in water not so good that's so
funny so I'm saying Phillips you need to
look at your marketing team and really
see if you guys are connected to have
some kind of communication you can't
freakin show of a photo of a speaker in
the water and have it not be completely
water break you know in the bin to be
fair here play devil's advocate actually
yeah play there's no no we're in the
marketing materials is it like show like
music coming out of it right and no
loading next do this show you're lonely
in the water you'd like it could be like
your Wilson it's a Phillips so it's cool
to the pain little face or like you're
the marketing materials could just be
like it won't sink right then ain't
gonna work but I'm gonna sing you'll
find it when you drop it in the pool
you'll just it'll come right up that
problem to its credit it did play music
very briefly pointed down underneath the
surface of the water and it didn't sound
good so even if it was waterproof
playing music underwater I don't know if
you ever tried talking to somebody else
water them sound doesn't sound good not
recommend it keep it in the shower
that's what I do all right do you guys
like to shower to a silent a shower Oh
to music yeah I I guess I used to do
that and then it was too much like set
up time so I was just like well I'm only
in the shower for seven minutes anyway
if that long that's it you don't need
one song oh you know while I'm in the
 my problems try to find a song i'm
like no i don't wanna sing along to this
no i don't think i have a Spotify
playlist but that says shower yeah and
then I'm like I've already sang all
these through this and they're like I
have to go why am I still messing with
modify I gotta go to work you've wasted
40 minutes that's crazy was just seeing
a three-minute song that's silly that's
assigned overnight how long do you
shower I understand I for a long time
what yeah well you listen to what's a
long time rock up what's a long time uh
maybe I don't know 20 minutes if that
blows my now very thorough I get all in
there even well as it's not hard to do
that quickly i mean when i get home even
if when i get home from a hockey game
and i'm at the dirtiest and smelliest i
could possibly be it's eight minutes 9
minutes the max and you and I have
different body types do it should take
me far less time to wash my body I don't
know about that you're talking about
like surface anything skinny people
don't take us long to should take less
time I should write because they have
less surface area no that's the thing i
should hear 4 inches on me equal out my
girth what are we talking about you're
taller oh right yeah yeah perfect what
yes your gigantic penis takes forever oh
yeah i would imagine all right okay so
the extra height all right for the
difference for ya for my gut i guess i
don't know i'm not a scientist you own
speaking of scientists apparently
there's a study that found out beards
contain fecal bacteria oh and then
someone even quoted was quoted as saying
there's dirtiest toilets I don't believe
that I as what's the deal fellow beard
friend yeah so I have a beard and I saw
this stupid story on facebook and oh my
god good god I got to see what's going
on here eat just for the record even if
this is is true I don't care and I have
a beer I don't care yea there is a
little poop in your beer there's always
 my beard come on oh poopy be
someone this idiot to actually click
something through on facebook yes once I
did that it actually gave me a bunch of
the story so the actual story is
somewhat some anchor in albuquerque new
mexico took a handful of people that she
found and swabs their beards okay and
then took kids this event is something
that she does royale de that's her name
a royal day okay okay isn't either after
she said it on the air its royal day
okay not royale it's got an either the
metric systems so royale with cheese she
goes out who am i to make fun of
somebody's name by the way uh she goes
ahead so i was people's faces for this
thing for beards and then she brings it
over to quest diagnostics yeah this
microbiologist John gall BIC he's like
these are the things you would find in
fecal matter huh so uh the the anchored
starts saying well that's the stuff if
you found it in water they might have to
like shut down a disinfect that area
right so the anchors that are talking
around if this little package piece like
oh it's just dirty as a toilet so
everywhere all these headlines are your
beers full of effectively and I'm
like god damn it I have a beard I don't
god damn it i have a shoot you I'm not
just trace amounts of fecal matter like
you know a doorknob or something would
have this is enough to where you said if
it was in water then it would become it
would shut down an entire yeah but that
was it this is a huge jump and it
actually got debunked crazily right
after that because when the fun things
after I clipped that stupid story
facebook all the other like once the
debunked it showed up underneath nothing
oh cool or as I read these I mean you
look at how many people get pinkeye
right and we all know where pink eye
comes from there's def I'm a link to
 there a lot of people don't get
pink eye I've seen a lot of people think
in this office you know of course but
the babies can get it really is babies
all the kids always get it but since I
see where that could come from where
maybe if yeah you're changing a baby's
diaper then you go to like you know do a
little dance the thinker you know and
you're like rubbing your beard it could
get in there like that I mean the second
I'm done you know hanging around his
bottle I go right to the sink and wash
my hands what Oh Dylan yeah
first thing I forgot that you have a kid
that just added that's not in the front
of my mind what the mud went there it's
a club oh boy the model is downtown oh
man yeah but but the thing is the
guardian immediately published something
said this is a lot of garbage because
first this is going to be a study it's
not a study because there's a handful of
people it's not a very good that's right
ample sized in the first place and what
the microbiologist actually said the
bacteria that was present something
called an terex which is actually the
bacteria in your stomach your intestines
that is and that's gonna be on fecal
matter anyway so people use it
diagnostically to check water supplies
if there's fecal matter haha it's an
indicator of right not necessarily
saying it is the same as right it
just hangs out with wait because
it's gonna because they're being tested
right right even if there isn't actual
 particles in your beard I'm sure
that there's a ton of germs just living
around there like you haven't any part
of you says the guy who never has one
yeah you guys are gross well they found
guardian actually looked up a couple of
studies actual studies that like we're
published in journals yeah and bearded
people did not have any more bacterial
issues than people without beards or
that would exist in your fingernails and
and the things we're always covered in
bacteria anyways if I'm saying showgirls
you're covering bet yours like yeah
everything is all the time yeah and
don't look up yogurt then you're gonna
really freak out yeah oh my god and
don't use your phone in the bathroom or
just don't look at your phone don't look
at it don't even touch her don't lick
your phone is really I cannot stand that
right column in facebook of all the
trending stuff I don't watch arrives me
crazy because it's you know I guess like
the worst trending thing ever is is
Twitter because it's always like what
all the 12 year olds are going to do on
a day with one direction or something or
or something completely asinine it's 5
seconds of summer right right it's five
seconds time right and and the facebook
one isn't really any better this one's
fun Kevin Bacon actor post selfie
appearing to show weight gain yeah like
it's never real news always pop
culture's up and yesterday i think i
read the dumbest one yet what's that
like tell me if you've ever heard
anything less important
okay tell me if you've ever heard a less
important sentence in your entire life
okay so you know it's like a little bold
and then the text yeah so the bold part
was the game okay and then the regular
text was rapper threatens to beat up
young thug / ongoing dispute with little
Wayne yeah wait young thug the rapper I
guess the game is a rapper right right
so the so the got like a young thug like
valium I don't know almost capitalised
yet that's really that that would to
note it's a proper name right oh no but
it's the whole it's capitalized like a
headline yeah I'm noticing that now to
you right it's pretty strange yeah and
that's what trends on facebook that's I
mean that's not uninteresting you just
don't happen to care cuz you don't like
hip-hop know or like if you don't keep
up with modern hiphop gym not well not
modern hip hop i guess if it was a bell
I see now to click through to that you
would actually know what the hell's
going on I did so maybe I didn't
understand it led to scary lyrics I was
just a bunch of symbols that made no
sense to me I don't know I feel like
that right column on Facebook is really
starting now hmm starting to be the
body's not see it I don't mentally I
think I block it out yeah it's there I
just don't your brains just processes as
the right whales right rail i don't i'm
not looking at that oh I'm always
looking at it there's nothing I can do
what about you you look at a lot of what
oh I really go on facebook too much yeah
yeah I'm back on Twitter though you what
does that mean well i'm just posting
some stuff on Twitter yeah why what why
the Russian quick first was it because
of the bad writing of Black Widow yes
that's right that's why you left too
much criticism over the Black Widow no I
don't know I just want to take a break
now I'm back all right before we that's
good to know malice Brutus go follow
justin before we say goodbye i wanted to
talk about one quick new app that i
heard of that's interesting it's called
wud up wud u P and it's calling itself
tinder meets facetime who think about
that they match you up with someone
random and you have like an auto auto
video conference I don't know welcome
megalyn huh it's not like the old thing
we just have the video matchup yeah yeah
yeah yeah that too yeah omegle is the
video ver SI so there's some see i can't
figure this out because it's only
available
on Apple iOS devices I don't know what
the hell it is but apparently you it
doesn't use profiles the way a normal
tinder connection gets made I have like
I have like screenshots of what it looks
like but it's not really telling me a
lot and you don't just get instantly put
into a FaceTime with people you have to
like both agree on the picture and then
you say oh it's found a match and then
chat and then all of a sudden you're
looking at each other and you're ready
to you know faced how they just added a
video chat to tinder effectively I guess
that's like obviously what we're looking
at I mean I you're not a single man but
no you're not in a very are you in a
serious relationship I'd say ask you a
personal question like that we're at I
mean you gave each other ring I mean you
are wearing her thumb ring on your
panties really yeah what what what ring
are yours it's what's the ring it's a
was like a gold ring with the like a
star pattern diamond thing what a hang
what that's like that's what that's a
promise all right that's initially that
means not doesn't mean like it's not an
engagement ring it's a regular ring okay
it was like we were in line for a beer
hill and so we just went up to the store
and waited no go got it in a ring it's
like what L not usually diamond ring
afternoon now's you gives your SOA ring
you give your soo ring that's been two
years and I'm like I'm stalling it was a
two years of one year I don't know it's

relationships have lasted for a long
time I think the majority of people that
I hear about online dating or on tinder
down yeah so if you say that you met on
okcupid that you're like a grandfather
right you might as well met on myspace
right somo it's always think it
how do I think I do I think I just yeah
you know cuz we had to put in so much
more work back in the day for okcupid is
a lot of long-form message- I like that
again my time is before okay Hugh bright
who that time was my time was a 0 l
profiles that's how you guys met no but
remaining well we're from the same
hometown with the same college you men
basically are really it was what was the
most convenient for everybody is what I
did right now kid how do you think you

like nobody can actually hook up on this
F way they just want to see if it would
have happened yeah yeah what do you call

I think I do very well for myself I
think you would isn't it it's it's like
this amazing thing I need I need to know
yeah how's fatherhood working free by
the way huh what we're not talking about
that right now we're talking with
something else just to get a curiosity
come on my poor child's virgin ears
switch gears for a little bit it's
working out great you believe he's gonna
be a month old on Monday you talk about
that does he talk about that enough on
this show I mean only been one time he's
been gone for like forever yeah okay
something I bet people have been waiting
for me to ask you well know we answered
a lot last week yeah how's it going it's
it's going you know he doesn't sleep a
lot but wait that change because yeah I
don't even sleep in he was good he was
sleeping more than I thought he would
and now he's sleeping yeah about the
amount i thought he would or it's like
three hours per second thought that I'm
holy crap thank you don't see that yes
absolutely yeah means the states for me
yeah very limited English mr. engine is
that why not ah it's you know it's it's
weird and I'll be as honest as I can be
yeah I'm not at a point right now where
I'm committed stable with the whole
thing we're to the baby no no I'm not at
a point right now where I'm like in a
groove it's still very fresh and new to
me
and every day is a learning experience
and you know every father mother I've
talked every parent I've talked to says
you know it just takes time to like find
yourself with it I don't and I'll be
honest and this might sound you know a
little harsh or you know not crass but
definitely a different than what you
might think if you're not a parent I
don't end this and I hear it's very
common from parents like I as has told
me this I don't feel like a dad really
just yet because it's just not I know
I'm not having that like father-son
relationship yet I'm having adult and
infant and helpless baby relationship I
think that I was thinking missed this
gelatinous stage that's what I think I'm
the person is like you got the soft head
and you looked right how do you pick it
up how do you put it down is it gonna
roll over what's gonna do now like let
alone not able to make eye contact I
can't even like tickle him I can't
really tickle him and get a laughing
where's gonna scare you just get why are
you doing it yeah I'll tickle him
thinking like he's gonna be like stop
that Daddy no I tickle him and he's just
like me yeah just like wow actually
that's what they sound like his response
I'm like you he's essentially like Krang
from Ninja Turtle I just this blob and
very accurate you know like completely
help yeah yeah yeah so you need to build
up a metal suit no idea no you're his me
now today yeah we do like there's
nothing I can do with him at all right I
can work that into Cho's with my son
like actually knows characters as punch
a difference and they'll be like dad
what's shredders origin so how long is
it gonna take for young die lon to get
there I love I'd say one and a half
years it's real it's really easy to it's
like yeah okay this thing is like this
thing is really really alive yeah yeah
yeah and you can actually talk to it you
know about like interaction though like
reinforcement like stuck where I can be
like hey buddy and indie like huh
like 3x three months oh so right here
yes gelatinous for too long he's gonna
actually like laughs and like actually
look at you yeah I understand that you
exist but takes it i'm a long time to
realize a lot of weird stuff that you
don't think about he's definitely aware
of my voice already I can and stacey's
for us we can kind of we can kind of
sense that and um but you know I just I
just want to sleep for more than four
hours at a time right now wow it's
really like that hun you guys have
shifts or how do you work that you know
she's not working yet so she's been very
generous with her time yeah yeah um and
the days that I come into work I I kind
of get a free pass it doesn't keep me
from you know I still get up because
it's a crying baby crying because he
needs a new diaper or no freakin oh he's
just a baby and they cry for no reason
what so that's all they know it's it and
I get it I'm sympathetic I understand
like that's I love sent me go I'm
sympathetic yeah I understand yeah hard
like I get it like living sucks yeah
especially when you've been spent it
when you spent nine months doing it in a
really small quiet and dark amusement
yeah and you're like super psyched there
and you know you never hear a baby's
crying in the womb do ya know cuz it
doesn't happen because the second they
leave they're like oh wait Obama you
know I just hate ever hear ya and I
don't blame them life sucks Avengers is
terrible but he's got to deal with that
on his plate the poor thing oh no
actually the first couple of years and
they actually pay attention to movies
like this happened with my son we were
watching a trailer for paul Blart 2
right exactly right purchase date that's
actually child abuse in solana like oh
is this stupid this is stupid stupid
this is stupid but then paul Blart like
runs head-on into like a clear plate
glass window to which my son laughs you
love it and I'm like you know what this
is actually really funny if you've never
ever seen it before yeah that's not a
trope yet and never seen a boot like
people do that and like Mike oh my god I
guess that's kind of a nice thing to see
but like I'm like is it can be why i
said i'm like no yeah no we won't like
that i will show you stuff that is
funnier than that but we're not watching
that
I don't ever like if an eight-year-old
asks you if you want to hear a joke say
no say no because your fist will almost
instantly punch them right in the face
and ear the 19th not not so uh but yeah
it's I'm having fun with it you know
there's I I think everyone just needs to
know that it's not i don't know i don't
want to say it's not as bad as I thought
it would be it's exactly what there's no
that is way worse than raising a child
there's no way for you to know but I do
think there is a way for you to have an
idea and I'd like to think even from the
point where her water broke till now I
kind of had a very specific expectation
of just place shifting my mind into what
it must really be like and have to say
if I am going to be at all
self-congratulatory I'll be I'll
recognize the fact that yeah I kind of
like knew what I was getting into and
that's nothing has shocked me and say
that the only like shocked me was they
are way more durable than you think yeah
that's that's I want you to talk about
that cuz I'm very awkward around baby oh
yeah I mean everyone's like to protect
the head yes you protect the head but
like there's ways to pick them up where
the head won't even fall back and it's
easy by the arm yeah you just lift him
up by his legs you know like I wanna
like and I'm also surprised at how
strong he is very strong surprisingly
strong is there picking up his head yes
you know when he's on his back and you
put a cinder block on making hold them
up haben a second one odd yeah and you
break your head what you do and it's
pretty good in a couple months this is
the way good relationship you guys have
but no it's it's fun you know uh I
didn't of someone asked in the subreddit
if you guys got to hold him yet yeah no
no no I haven't but I'm looking for
damping a lot of people have come
already visit him right it's still
pretty early it's early we've had we've
had about 20 people oh well thanks man I
mean you want to come by you're more
than welcome to come by how do you be
here by now he'll be here over the
drawer he'll be here he'll be here if
not in June's a busy month he'll be here
in July yeah for sure a busy month I
familiy for me
not for him you'll be here in jitsu he's
got the e3 next yeah he's got a schedule
gonna check out the new terminal at
grand central path or maybe it may be
the end of this month or maybe beginning
a June we'll see how it works arm
shifting over to the subreddit real
quick jdl are 28 wants to know if Justin
you've had any more near-death
experiences like something like a hiking
thing like harriman state park yeah we
have not yet been back to harriman but
we almost did last weekend because I
think last weekend was the first one
where is mid 70s nice enough to actually
do a hike without bringing it Jen you
wouldn't go back to the scene of the
crowd would he go back to harriman want
crazy I don't trust myself but we ended
up going to Staten Island after
researching a lot of the parks and I do
not recommend going to Staten Island I
don't know why I thought that the middle
of Staten Island would have this
beautiful park yeah and there is a
nature preserves where we throw our
garbage but it's really bad yeah and I
know that now after hiking this yeah you
know what you're hiking you're hiking
landfills yeah basically you're hiking
behind a freeway which I didn't realize
and you can see cars on overpasses
throughout the entire night in nature
which takes it away from the experience
again the wilderness d saturates a
little bit well you know in doing
research for that hike last weekend we
realize that we've done everything
besides go back to harriman off the
metro northern go back we don't have a
car yeah don't go of it I think we might
go back sometime I mean there's a lot of
new things there's a lot of changes we'd
make I feel like maybe you should start
at six a.m. and i want you right i do
want you to go back so you can have
closure yeah I call chairman you have to
complete that trail closing the circle
of regret and kill that bear that
threatened me right right don't you
think you should go back to the scene of
the pink you definitely in revenge the
revenge on that trail let's go hiking oh
no none of my friends care to go hiking
no it's just not something I want to do
okay you know it's just I'm okay one of
my buddies is a big climber now loves
climbing wants to climb up rocks and I'm
about rock walls ya ever he can that
seems like fun there's an indoor rock
climbing place by my house yeah but I
haven't tried yet

bag yeah my cool man is you know fall
off you don't like climbing then I've
died before it's not you know something

choice to play hockey er climb a rock

sport is what do you do for I used to do

alone yeah these days I don't really
just sports I just dude crazy cardio
workouts yeah like you have insanity
know what that's one of those DVD ones
like the beach body doesn't have
insanity max which is like 30 minutes
and it's super intense and crazier than
insanity it's there's no there's no
brakes wow there's no break so you're
sweating and dying and it works really
well cardio was in st. Michael when I
was doing that regularly and I would
ditch things like office parties just to
do it my cardio was like through the
roof ridiculous so now I'm lazy and
we're done a week or something that's
not bad if you do as long as you get
something really intense once or twice
