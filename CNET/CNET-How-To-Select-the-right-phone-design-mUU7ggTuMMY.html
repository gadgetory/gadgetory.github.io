phone now regardless of which carrier
you've chosen or what type of pan you're
gonna have they're really only a few
types of phones to choose from the first
thing they think about is design which
breaks down into three general types you
have your basic phones phones with
keyboards and touchscreen phones basic
phones are a dying breed but they're
still a good choice for someone who
wants an uncomplicated phone typically
these are flip phones with a screen and
a physical numeric keyboard they're
usually pretty cheap and some people
still like this classic design but
they're short on features so if you want
a phone that you can use to send email
or browse the web or comfortably send
text messages that's what these phones
come into play phones with a physical
keyboard are great for people who are
just getting used to the idea typing on
their phone but they're also great for
people who type all the time the
trade-off is that these slide out style
phones are usually thicker and heavier
than touchscreen phones I'm a
touchscreen phone all of the controls
and the keyboard are right there on the
screen this is the dominant format right
now
the trade-off here is that any damage to
the screen is going to affect everything
you do on the phone I see people walking
around all the time with a cracked
smartphone caused by a drop on the
sidewalk so if you go this route a case
is a good idea now another term you're
gonna hear a lot of when describing
phones is feature phones versus smart
phones a smart phone is any kind of
phone that runs a main brand os this is
where you'll find the iPhone Blackberry
Android and Windows user essentially
computers that fit in your pocket and
can also make calls feature phones give
you the messaging email and web browsing
capability of a smart phone but they run
customized software typically they're
less expensive and geared towards
teenagers but they don't have the
extensive capabilities and app selection
of smart phones so there you go that's
an overview of the types of designs
you're gonna find when you're out there
