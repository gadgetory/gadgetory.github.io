un60f8000 it's a 65 inch size in the
least expensive line of the company's
high-end s UHD TVs putting it in sort of
a sweet spot on paper in person one of
its strong suits is design from the
sleek extra thin chrome frame to the
simple easy to hold remote Samsung
thought this TV out very well one thing
I love is that you can choose two
different positions for the legs toward
the center for narrower furniture or
splayed wide for added stability another
thing I love is that it's flat not
curved like many Samsung TVs as you'd
expect from Samsung this set is packed
with features and one is really cool the
ability to control connected devices
automatically just plug in your cable
box game console Roku or other device
and the TV recognizes it names the input
and even program into that simple remote
to control it it worked well for many
devices but certainly not all the ones I
tried the smart TV system is great with
a solid selection of apps the ability to
surface individual shows on the home
page and even the ability control
Samsung smartthings smart home devices
like lights and thermostats right from
the screen that function is coming later
the summer with a free USB dongle fancy
features are all well and good but image
quality is the most important thing in a
TV the KS 8000 demonstrated gray color
video processing and screen brightness
but its overall picture quality fell
short of the competition it can't
produce a really deep shade of black and
the edge of the screen are brighter than
the rest so it lacks the contrast and
punch of recent 2016 sets I've tested
from Vizio and Sony its image is still
very good however and with its unique
features in style the Samsung KS 8000
should appeal to plenty of mid to
high-end TV shoppers this year I'm David
Katz my resina
