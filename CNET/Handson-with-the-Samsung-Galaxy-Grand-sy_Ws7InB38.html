of a samsung stand in Mobile World
Congress taking a look at the samsung
galaxy grand the galaxy grand is
basically a slightly bigger galaxy s3 it
has a 5-inch screen as opposed to 4.8
screen and in looks-wise it it looks
basically like the same phone we've got
the same white plastic design at the
chrome speaker and the home button and
around the back with again got this
large expanse of white plastic and you
will see an eight megapixel camera with
a flash which is probably safe to say
that we expect similar results from that
as you've got on the s3 already it
strips that your galaxy s3 specs down to
so we've got a 1.2 gigahertz protest it
inside with one gig of ram so when it
seems fine for swiping around but don't
expect it to give the same performance
for games and photo editing but you'll
get on the s3 or orphans like the note 2
running Android 4.1 point2 jelly bean
and Samsung has given it the dewlap
feature but your seat on the Galaxy Note
now this lets you put two apps
side-by-side on screen and once which is
particularly handy say if you want to
Google something whilst you're writing
an email an interesting feature as well
is that it has a dual sim so it's
particularly handy if you were if you do
a lot of traveling I want to keep a
European or us or UK sim alongside your
normal one samsung hasn't said anything
about pricing as yet but as it's a
stripped-back s3 we are hoping that it
will be a little bit cheaper it's
currently on sale in asia but something
hasn't yet given any word if it's going
to be turning up in europe of us so
we'll have to wait and see if it will
ever hit our shelves I'm under oil for
cnet and this is the samsung galaxy
grand</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
