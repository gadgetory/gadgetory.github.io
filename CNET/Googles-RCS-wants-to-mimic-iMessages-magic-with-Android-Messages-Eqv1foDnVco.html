text message it can drive you crazy I
have my friends with iPhones getting fun
animations with iMessage but my Android
friends can't see it I have family on
whatsapp my mom is using face and my
mother-in-law is using Skype my
colleagues are on flak and people are
still messaging me with facebook
Messenger things can get even more hairy
with Google and Android aside from the
default texting app there's also Google
Hangouts and Google allo and then
sometimes a carrier or phone maker will
throw in their own texting app to join
in on the fun the universe of texting
has become fractured with all these
competing services trying to have the
cooler experience with their own
stickers and animations Google's on a
mission to make the experience a little
more uniformed at least on Android
devices but created something similar to
how my message works on Apple devices
the default Android texting app has been
renamed to Android messages it's using a
standard platform called rich
communication services or RCS for short
but all you need to know is that it's
going to support interactive media so
you won't just get a photo of a boarding
pass you're going to see an interactive
boarding pass with current departure
times in a station map or you could text
a store like Walgreens to get a map of
the nearest location and find out if a
product is in stock Google made deals
with a number of carriers and device
makers all around the world to make sure
this is going to be the default texting
app on all future Android phones but not
everyone is on board Samsung is not
agreeing to use the Android messages as
the default and neither are US carriers
Verizon AT&amp;amp;T Mobile Android users can
get around all this by just downloading
the app on their own from Google's app
store and keep it updated at the end of
the day maybe Google is too late in
trying to get all Android users to use
one app we'll already invested in
multiple platforms and you know what all
anyone really cares about is if they can
send emoji
