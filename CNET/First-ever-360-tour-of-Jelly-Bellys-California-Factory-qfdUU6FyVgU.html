and we're going to see how a jelly bean
is made from start to finish
right here they produce over 15 million
beans every single day handed on
mad-scientist jacket on come with me so
around and 360 degrees and see how
they're made
we start in the kitchen with a liquid
slurry sounds disgusting but it's
actually just sugar water corn starch
and corn syrup it's pretty warm in this
room as machines have to make sure the
ingredients are nice and high
confectioner's then mixing condensed
flavors to the slurry mix it runs
through pipes into a machine called the
mobile that makes mold
each trade can make 1260 feet
once the liquid is already to Trey's
risk through a high-speed machine that
fills each of those trays with beautiful
five pounds of candy after a quick
shower under a steam spray and then a
sugar spray the centers rest overnight
and head to the planning process to make
the jellybeans shell
Dane's up almost ready what's happening
to get quite that so here is our panning
department and what we're doing is
retaining the Centers of the jelly beans
we're alternating layers of sugar syrup
several weddings we call that enough
holding Grossinger's gel onto the center
of the jelly beans how long does this
crisis place so this will take about two
hours from our candy makers to complete
this run now the jelly bellies are
almost done and get a final dusting of
sugar sugar syrup and confectioner's wax
to make them shiny shiny
a special printing machine adds the
Jelly Belly logo onto each bean at a
rate of twenty thousand seven hundred
CPM I've seen per minute the beams
travelogue conveyor belt where they're
packed up ready for shipping and we exit
through the gift shop of course where
you can even buy belly flops there those
irregular shaped beans that get kicked
out during production</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
