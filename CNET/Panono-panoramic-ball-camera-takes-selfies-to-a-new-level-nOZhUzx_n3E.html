2014 taking a first look at the panono
panoramic ball camera taking selfies to
a whole new level so what you do is you
throw this camera up into the air with
two hands
it takes the photo as it reaches the
highest point in 360 degree interactive
panorama that's all comes down to those
36 cameras that are dotted all around
this false surface all together you're
getting a photo with a hundred and eight
megapixels of resolution making it the
highest resolution consumer-based camera
on the market now as you can see I have
two models in front of me this is the
final retail version that you can pick
up if you pre-order from IndieGoGo as
you can see it's a much smaller model
than the prototype which is right here
is made of tough and plastic surgery
whatever clucks like me you can drop it
and it doesn't matter all too much so
this is the prototype obviously a lot
bigger and when you throw this one up
into the year it captures the panoramic
image once you have this image what you
can do is you see the unstitched version
as you can see on the screen here this
is the unstitch version before it goes
to the servers and it presents you with
a stitched version also what you can do
with your 360 degree panorama is view it
on a smartphone or tablet and interact
with the image by pointing the tablet in
a certain direction and you can see that
particular portion of the image sorry
the panono panoramic ball camera will be
available for $4.99 on IndieGoGo coming
very soon I'd like to see baby Cecina
and Spain a first look of the panono
panoramic ball camera</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
