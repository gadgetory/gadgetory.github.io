proprietary pls technology was used just
once before on the Samsung sync master s
27 a 850 D however that monitor was
geared towards professionals but now
Samsung has finally given us consumers a
monitor that uses a panel tech as well
hi I'm Eric Franklin and today I'll be
taking a first look at the Samsung sync
master s 27b 970 the 970 takes a few
design cues from the Apple Thunderbolt
display with a minimalist design a
fairly thin panel screen tilt and
actually goes a bit further with screen
height adjustment something the Apple
monitor doesn't have it's quite pretty
looking with this nice striking chrome
neck and this kind of Flying Saucer
looking foot stand that gives it kind of
a retro sci-fi vibe unfortunately there
are a few design issues that really
really annoy me first off there's no
swivel feature now the thunderbolt
monitor didn't have swivel either but at
least you could easily slide it around
but with a rubber on the bottom here
it's really hard to slide it second the
DisplayPort input is embedded too far
into the foot stand this is fine when
plugging it in but DisplayPort requires
you to depress a button when I'm
plugging it and as you can see it's not
the easiest thing to do here actually
it's almost impossible unless you have
razor thin fingers or a CD you're
willing to sacrifice the monitor just
kind of gets in a way of itself
finally the cover of the foot stand can
easily be pulled off from the front like
this it's just not what I expect from a
monitor that cost $1200 now this is a
pre-production model so there's still a
chance that some of this will change
before release so I'm still holding out
hope that I'll see some improvements by
the time the actual release version
comes in other than those annoyances I
really don't have any complaints so far
in addition to the display port it has
HDMI DVI a USB upstream port and on the
side here to USB downstream ports the
OSC is here on the bottom of the neck
and glows all blue LED they all sea
itself has most of the options I expect
from a Samsung OSD like five different
presets brightness contrast sharpness
and red green and blue adjustment
options there's also some really cool
eco saving options performance on the
pre-production unit was impressive
viewing angles are why colors are
accurate and pop from the screen movies
look good with no sense of any color
tint problems and games especially look
amazing running at that crazy X HD
resolution the $1,200 price will
definitely give some people pause last
year Samsung released the T twenty seven
eight nine fifty and while that monitors
performance wasn't as impressive
it included Samsung Smart Hub which
provides streaming video games and apps
including Netflix Hulu Facebook and
Twitter as the first consumer pls
display the 970 should have had those
options well that's my first take look
for a full written review with a final
verdict in the weeks to come once again
America Franklin and this has been a
first look at the Samsung sync master s
