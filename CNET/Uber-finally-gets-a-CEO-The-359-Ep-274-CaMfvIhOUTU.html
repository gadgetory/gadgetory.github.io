they almost said Wednesday I have gotten
way ahead of myself here it's time for
the 359 podcast and it's episode 273 and
we've got Alfred Aang Roger Chang and
Derek ER in the studio today and we are
talking about uber go figure
yeah super finally get this new CEO I
still need a practices name but look at
well we'll get it right well we're also
gonna be talking about Alfred story on
hackers preying on new students back to
school baby
yep and then lastly we'll be talking
about our latest roadtrip feature which
Dara and rich Nieva
or other intrepid reporter from SF went
out to angola to go hunting for land
mines essentially yeah very cool story
we'll talk a little more about that as
always if you have any questions leave
them in the comment section Brian we'll
get to the best 59 seconds and here we
go in three two
welcome to the 359 I'm ready Chang I'm
Alfred Inge go ahead I'm Derek err uber
finally has a new CEO
say hello to Derek Asahi formerly the
CEO of Expedia he's a business of prize
pick since a lot of the rumors is
centered around Jeff Immelt the former
GE CEO and make Whitman the HP CEO both
of which who basically said no we're
interested this job
Dara who you sort of share the same name
kind of but well one of you know let you
figure out who's who who is this guy
well I'm myself I'm just learning a
little bit about him he was kind of a
dark horse in the running not a name
that was flown around at all and but
he's originally from Iran
he came here went to brown and then
worked on Wall Street during the 90s and
he kind of got this reputation as this
tough you know hard-ass all right yeah
and abrooke I use a hard-edge yeah they
need somewhere
I need a disciplinarian crack the whip
yeah and then in 2005 he became CEO of
Expedia and he really helped grow the
company number of acquisitions so seems
like he's been a pretty good businessman
on that front what's he gonna be able to
help her out on though uh well he has
his work cut out for him I yeah uber is
facing several lawsuits allegations of
everything from you know chaotic parties
to sexual I mean things like there's a
whole cultural sort of institutional
problem that uber has to deal with right
it's basically that most of the folks
that don't think that should have been
right yeah he had quite a following and
people there I mean I've heard from
people who've worked there that a lot of
employees try to emulate Travis kalanick
he had this thing where he would pace a
lot and then everyone started pacing
during meeting so it's gonna be really
interesting to see how a new leader will
affect the company and its employees all
right well next up we're talking about
back-to-school season
Alfred you wrote a piece about how
hackers love to take advantage of
students new students going into
university yeah so a lot of universities
their IT department have a lot of work
cut out for them especially around the
back-to-school season because you know
about 1,500 to 2,000 students come on
campus every year like mostly freshmen
and they all bring their laptops with
them and then the IT department has to
basically manage and make sure that you
know there's no malware on those
infecting their system so there's a lot
of work cut out into it a lot of them
they use like DNS management on their
systems which basically it manages the
network because they can't go to every
student's new laptop and like you need
to get rid of those you need to get rid
right they can't touch your laptops but
they can manage the network so if you're
a student and you have malware on your
advice and you try to log on the network
it's basically you're not gonna be able
to get on or Wi-Fi with your disgusting
like virus field computer ok a lot of
things like that they also do think some
universities like Carnegie Mellon have
like specific courses targeted towards
cyber security so you actually have to
go to these classes and learn about how
to avoid phishing attacks why you need
to factor auth and
occasion and things like that right stay
alright lastly Dara and rich neova went
to Angola for our latest road trip
feature this is a fascinating piece on
the demining efforts talk a bit about
the tech that you know some of the tech
and how that kind of got incorporated
story yeah so we were basically embedded
with this organization called the halo
trust and they are using we heard about
them through Google Earth Google Earth
is helping them map our land mines and
it's it's really before that they were
using old Portuguese colonial maps and
so it's it's a big help because they can
take the GPS coordinates of what they
think are land mines and then put them
onto Google Earth and then lay that over
and see what they need to clear and what
was that like walking through a
minefield that had I mean I'd be
freaking I don't think my wife would
even let me do this yeah I'm surprised
we were with the photographer James who
has two kids and a wife and she was not
very happy oh it was it was really scary
yeah I mean there's it's there's no way
around it you would be walking and
there'd be a landmine literally you know
1 foot away Wow and if you stepped on it
you would theoretically die or lose
somebody I was thinking as I was reading
this tournament well I just went to a
lunch so those are really stressful but
no look for more of these stories
chickens on CNET I brought your Chang
I'm Alfred Inge I'm Derek Kerr thanks
for saying my microphone is utterly
terrifying
I'm delayed here and I'm like it's
fumbling over my buttons just thinking
about what you went through in a
minefield a little minefield well what's
really crazy is the people who work
taking out these landmines and they're
there every day digging up these
explosives it's really crazy it's very
admirable work and we'll set things this
was like the last yeah so we were there
on the very last day and this area's
that most
we mined land minefield in all of Africa
and one of the most on earth and they
you know land mines of I think in that
NGO world have kind of gone out of vogue
as Mars funding right right so kind of
celebrities because right so you know
back in one of the reasons we went there
is cuz Princess Diana had walked in
these same minefields and so but you
know where there's no Princess Diana now
doing that kind of work the insane thing
to me was how relatively like up until
recently how relatively like low-tech
this like yeah readily dangerous effort
was and you know to going into something
like that using like pen and paper you
know I don't leave my house like to
navigate somewhere with pen and paper I
like to do something like that you know
using such low-tech is insane to me yeah
and they're still it's still pretty
low-tech I mean they're using Google
Maps there some groups are trying
different types of mechanisms to find
the landmines but really everyone says
it's just boots on the ground there's no
silver bullet yet okay this is their
last day didn't mean that the mines are
all cleared like they're still yeah
there's there's so so many left and
there's there it's unclear how many's
left but they're thinking at least that
they know of 35,000 Wow and that
includes one minefield that's 30
kilometers long I mean it's it's insane
it's hard to even fathom
Brian do we have any questions thank you
for the cue I was waiting for so yeah
let's go ahead and jump into the chat
first up shout out to our Cass who is a
longtime listener first-time contributor
from okay
welcome enjoying your evening we hope we
have a question from Satyam Das who says
asking how come ooh BRR can work without
a CEO until this point so just oh you
understand how business works
I don't know how business works how
could a company like that stay afloat
when the head honcho is gone that's a
great question
yeah I mean Roger you might be better to
answer this then they mean they had they
started their board of yeah it was all
there was no interim CEO this no which
is kind of interesting cuz usually
there's there is an interim that's
usually how
this is run without CEO there's yeah
there's a temporary head honcho and this
is a little bit more than usual because
they were was run via the board almost
yeah which isn't normal yeah but also
for like the last you know few weeks
what wasn't over just not making any
like major decisions that would require
a CEO to begin with in the first place
yeah
that's true I mean the only thing the
only decision was choosing the CEO
really was there also when the former
CEO was asked to step down they were in
major searches for all sorts of heads of
CTO yeah just all the top well the kind
of goes to show you at least a company
like uber it can kind of run itself for
a while I mean it's because it's
ultimately it's based off of local
drivers in the road I mean as long as
you're not doing a huge strategic shifts
or nothing really breaks down like a
cupcake basically keep yeah yeah maybe
their new CEO that could be the new
model just a seamless company driverless
cars and a trial yes a driverless
company that would be cool no keep
pointing that wrong all our decisions
are made by AI or you love us
it'll created the AIC all companies that
are out there no way he's an ta yeah
he's gonna save the world from from
itself you see like a announcing though
of like Callen ik loyalists I don't know
okay good question I mean they may
depending on how things go they may quit
on their own rather than an Austin yes
especially if what you're saying is true
like if he's like a more sort of
hard-ass
you know new CEO comes in like that's
usually when there's a big wave of
turnover my real CEO would let me stay
up past 11 yeah there it's a notorious
for a hard-working workplace under the
last CEO under manic right long hours so
but yeah who knows it I mean there's
definitely people in the company who one
who wanted change but there are there is
a huge cohort of loyalists yep so before
we move on you want to Cheers
to our loyalists Michael Brown imagine
soccer a green guy guys Michael Browns
asking what are your thoughts on this
new CEO you kind of brushed on this
earlier you said he's kind of a hard-ass
right
the did you did you meet him yeah
actually and I personally I don't know
that much about him I know yeah he's a
complete surprise pic yeah um you know
and I haven't written much about Expedia
and so I will know more at the end of
the day I know Expedia is one of those
companies that it's a tech company but
it's not one of those tech companies we
write about a lot I think I use it I'm
fairly common fairly frequently actually
what does Expedia is it like a Wikipedia
thing it's like wait a minute wait a
minute wait a minute outdated at all
it's still quite oh yeah I've never used
Xperia Lee no I don't travel that much
either yeah I bounce back and forth
between it and kayak for a lot of the
same reasons yeah
so what is it like compare like flight
rate something yeah you actually I I
know it's a travel website yes so it's
Weiss hotels rental cars basically any
kind of travel site that does comparison
what did you just go and like Google
like your flight prices and you probably
land on an expiry date to the airline
that's where I go to like well that's a
thing if you want to compare JetBlue
with Delta this shows how much I travel
airplane tickets no wait you're saying
you don't still go to a travel agent on
the corner apologies to people who
actually are employed as travel agents
you do good jobs but it's hard to not
make sense just seventeen we have a
question from Jacob Kraft in the chat it
says do you guys think it's too late for
uber to give in to all the controversy
didn't Eve I give in yeah I'm not really
sure Jake clarify
yeah Jacob could you clarify for us he's
saying given all the controversy Oh
do you think it's too late for uber
given all of that controversy I see I'm
an idiot I can't read today apparently
that's a really good question because
there is so much controversy I mean
there's a lot of backpedaling and a lot
of smoothing over things that the CEO is
gonna have to do but I mean if they
could exist without the CEO for so long
does that really kind of leave them as
self-sustaining yeah I don't think
people care about yeah yeah chick-fil-a
despite their controversies and like
Under Armour back when they were still
most people I talked to either the
drivers or just customers like they just
want things that work so like I had this
issue I was getting picked up from JFK
this past weekend I use lyft initially
driver like couldn't find me or whatever
and I just ended up switching back
because it worked and ultimately like I
don't necessarily feel great about using
it but like if it's if my alternative
service isn't gonna work as well I'm
gonna just use the one that works yeah
garlis of the controversy right and
that's when it kind of comes down to
like as a company it's not represented
just by Colin it's a number of people
who work hard and have done a good job
right yeah I feel like they're just some
things that you can't boycott and I'm
like I haven't used ubirr since their
controversies in news live but I know
there's a lot of people that like uber
is kind of like their only option or
something yeah driver
they were both they were from both but
they're like uber all the way they well
I haven't talked to any drivers in New
York but everywhere else every drivers
likes left Waymarsh they they're treated
better by the company well know that I
get better I hear that but I also hear
that yeah I think that kind of reflects
as part of the location as well like
coming down to New York is a fairly easy
city to navigate an app itself really
functions better and I think arguably on
a more objective level the uber app
functions better than the lyft app not
saying one versus the other as a service
functioning just simply as an
application maybe that's why they make
more money off overs because they yield
back
you just do the algorithm it's been
around longer it's more established
there more people using it I think in
general that ball kind of thing right
there to get right from left
well they yeah they've been hyper
competitive too and trying to squash
their competitors but yeah it's - you
know my grandparents would have heard of
uber and not lift probably so it's
become kind of a household yeah do you
think your grandma know about the
controversies with it also like the
lobbying that they did and the way that
they treat the average person like
doesn't know all the shady yeah just
know that it's really cheap they don't
know that like people through use that
to get there you brought up a good point
about chick-fil-a right like people I
mean it's a hugely successful in New
York and you know regardless of their
stance on yeah yeah
speaking of stances chick-fil-a is
extraordinarily overrated you know it's
just as fine as any other fast-food
fried chicken I don't know if it
succeeds I won't say this I've had I've
only had twice it's not here in New York
like what's an airport and I had a sale
I ate the sandwich I was like all right
whatever I walked away from a chicken
it's always a good five minutes later is
like kinda worn otherwise it's okay
later all right we should probably knock
out another question or two before we
call it a day Mike Brown asks do you
think driverless cars slash service is
the only end game for uber what else can
they do
I think if I think it should be because
you know if they don't end up at it lift
will or in any all these other companies
well they're going to get shut out yeah
it's - oh no I think the actual true end
game is the yeah I mean the uber is
working on that - hey I remember the pad
for that like lifts off from with it it
was it was it in Dubai right like where
they said yeah no it's a tanning palace
and was it travel ready that made the
great statement about it you know it's
better because it's essentially like a
dictatorship there and you can make
changes faster I'm paraphrasing you but
it was about that
like you know we don't have to deal with
this government red tape yeah they
launched in there and Dallas at the same
time but Dallas is no but they're
they're very friendly to tech and yes
yeah and there's a big airline it's an
airline hub because they usually yeah
yeah they had a big conference I mean
who knows it's a lot of smoke and
mirrors in my opinion but and that
basically they just look like little
helicopters yeah laughs and I appreciate
it yeah durable weather that Kitty Hawk
thing from like Larry Page it funded
mm-hmm oh the durable yeah it's like a
her roan that you could ride except
like I'm like no state would ever
approve that like no a huge manatee
self-driving cars that's gonna be a hard
Pitt because uber is its business is
built on drivers yeah and so I mean
drivers are also what is making it not
profitable because if it doesn't have
drivers and it could keep all of that
money but um yeah that's I think it's
gonna be a rough road and I actually you
know all these companies keep saying
2020 they're you know they're gonna be
out and about I don't I'm not as yeah I
mean they'll probably like three or four
of them out and about yeah I don't think
you'll be seeing I was like traffic let
me I think I never start seeing them in
like like there's like grades like level
one yeah yeah yeah so like they'll be
kind of like half-measures but you can
see a completely driverless car from I
mean that rollout in San Francisco it
was a fiasco yeah yeah because they were
jerks about it forget the city we're
just gonna do it anyway so many
incidents just in the first couple of
hours and the part that they didn't get
permission we gotta wrap it up soon but
I just want to point out a comment from
the chill one who backs up the
validation of how uber is a little more
widespread says that uber is in an ghana
lift isn't for example uber is just
going harder i think that's a good point
and then as a sidebar i like Josh's
comment uber and lyft is like Google and
Bing
yeah things really irrelevant also Ben
came like way later than Google dad
whoever and left kind of start around
the same time was it I thought was a
little later later
a teeny bit later but lift started the
whole the idea of carpool yeah being it
was like big was years way yeah like
relatively lift was closer to alright we
good yeah we do have to wrap things up
we do sorry alright sorry guys
you and your stupid meetings trying to
keep the company going I know the radio
hit like in 10 seconds so anyways the
only thing that you saw her here checks
out CNN our podcast is also available on
iTunes stitcher SoundCloud P burner and
sound and Google Play Music sorry I'm in
a rush
