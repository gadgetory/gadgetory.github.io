cases to extend the battery life of
their phones but going forward you can
add a new feature to the Mophie list
wireless charging that's right along
with the previously released wireless
juice packs for Samsung Galaxy s7 and s7
edge the company has now released the
Juice Pack Wireless for iPhone 6s 6 and
iPhone 6s plus 6 plus and all of no fees
cases going forward will offer wireless
charging as for price both new iPhone
juice packs cost $100 and provide more
than 50% additional battery life the
cases come bundled with a wireless
charging base that's compatible with
virtually all Wireless phones
accessories and charging standards
including Qi so the value proposition
here is that you're getting a Mophie
battery case plus wireless charging for
the same prices Apple smart battery case
which provides a similar boost to
battery life as for how it all works the
battery cases adhere magnetically to the
charging base as well as Muffy's new
charge force desk mount and charge force
car vent mount right now those mounts
which cost around 40 dollars are the
only additional charge for successor
ease announced but Mophie sees this as a
budding wireless charging ecosystem that
may someday include other accessories
that magnetically attached to the case
those who own any of Samsung's more
recent Galaxy smartphones know that
wireless charging circuitry is built
into the phone so you do need to buy a
charging base to make it work and while
wireless charging may not be an
essential feature it makes charging a
little easier and more businesses such
as Starbucks are offering wireless
charging stations in their stores so
there you have it wireless charging is
the future and so our magnets are so
