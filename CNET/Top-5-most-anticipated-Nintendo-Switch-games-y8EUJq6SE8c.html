Nintendo switch games people are excited
for Nintendo's latest console but what
good is a console without games so I
asked scene that resident video game
expert Jeff Bakalar for his help and
guess what he said yes
and number five arms every game console
needs a good fighting game arms looks
like it should be a lot of fun and ripe
for smack-talk in arms you throw punches
at each other using spring-loaded boxing
gloves the motion controls make it look
like an easy game to pick up since
you'll essentially be shadowboxing to
play it at number four Mario Kart 8
deluxe April 28 is when this game
arrives Mario Kart 8 bring some new
playable characters like dry bones along
with new battle mode horses plus it
comes with all of the DLC available for
the Wii U version the big downside of
this game it's not a true sequel so if
you play mario kart 8 deluxe might not
be much of an upgrade at number 3 is
spittoon 2
now here's a real sequel but tune to
will let you aim your ink using the joy
Kahn's motion control function if you've
never heard of splatoon think of it as a
war game but way more kid-friendly but
tuned to won't be out of this which is
launched but there will be a playable
demo available in late March and number
2 super mario odyssey every Nintendo
system leaves a new Mario adventure this
one takes Mario outside of the Mushroom
Kingdom to places like new dog city
where Mario can trespass to anywhere
he'd like Super Mario Odyssey won't be
out until the fourth quarter of 2017 and
the number one most anticipated game for
the switch is the Legend of Zelda breath
of the wild this game was supposed to be
a Wii U exclusive in the Year 2015 the
first murmurs of this game go back to
2013
so people have been waiting for this
game for years
well it's here along with the Nintendo
switch on March 3rd thanks to Jeff don't
call me jazzy Bakalar for his help more
