to the biggest phone on the market
carriers that need to learn a lesson
from cupid and a keyboard that makes
Brian's heart sing I'm Jessica doll
courts you are joining the Valentine's
Day episode of dialed in i'm joined in
san francisco by lynn LA oh and in New
York by Brian Bennett what's up and
Steven Beecham is our technical producer
hello today's podcast is sponsored by
the letter via and by this huge phone
that is giant net thr way I drew it I
drew it on the samsung galaxy note for
those of you who are not watching the
video and then I drew a little
Valentine's note to everyone so a note
on the note and that brings us to the
samsung galaxy note so Brian and I
managed to get our hands on a review
unit that this phone comes out for AT&amp;amp;T
officially on Sunday for three hundred
dollars and we are going to be just
looking at every aspect of this I mean
it's got a 5.3 inch screen it is it is
big it is big I'm holding in my hand it
takes up the whole of my hand it's
really it's a little awkward I found my
self adjusting so it's a little more
comfortable if I hold it here at the
bottom but it's one of those things
where I think you can get used to it but
a lot of people a lot of other like
reviewers and people who've seen the
phone and held it or just like that
phone is stupid big it's dumb it's
stupid big stupid big um Brian and I
both have overlapping and yet different
opinions about this but Brian let's
start with you what do you think about
it well I mean it's funny because i was
actually i wrote a post a little while
ago just saying ok here it is this note
is coming out you know what do you what
do you think i don't know if i can deal
with this can I you know you know can I
is going to replace my tablet or is
going to replace my phone or I'm just
going to like use one device for it both
well she's gonna replace your phone cuz
it is yes right well that's the thing
you know it is a phone but it's a tablet
is it really a tablet is a small so I
mean people say it's a big phone
own a small it's a small tablet there's
so many heating can you get it in your
pocket back well maybe you know what you
know what listen wewe yesterday I went
out on the street in New York and just
started showing this phone to people and
and got the reactions and one of them
was basically said you know you cannot
put this in your pocket because it is
the wrong type of bulge in your pocket
so you know I know that was pretty
pretty impressive you know I don't think
we really need to see anything else
about it right right because that is the
one line that you really mean I mean for
me I can fit it into a back pocket but
I'm not really gonna walk around with it
in my back pocket but it does fit in my
purse pocket which as a lady who carries
a purse is the way that I carry all 17
of my phones yes and that's true well
you know that's the thing it depends on
how you use it you know if you're using
a tablet primarily at home like maybe by
the bedside or on the couch or something
like that this this is going to look
really you know you know it's going to
be smaller a lot smaller and you know if
you're going to take if you take your
tablet a big tablet on the train or on
the plane or something like that then
this this thing would actually probably
be a lot more convenient just because
you're not going to bump elbows with
people and get in you know start a riot
we're okay now one of the
characteristics of the galaxy note is
that it's got this throwback stylist
here it's it's pretty small there's also
an accessory that Brian and I both got
it's called the s pen holder kit you
basically just slip a stylist in here
that's an extra of 50 bucks and it comes
with the stylus and I think this one's
much more comfortable but realistically
most people who get this phone aren't
they gonna shelled another fifty dollars
unless they're really dedicated to it
what did you think of the stylus and
what did you think about using the
stylus on this phone well so far I
haven't really had much use for it I
have to say because I'm not really sure
if I really want to be taking notes I
mean I do want to take notes in meetings
or you know just just to remember things
but you know my handwriting is pretty
bad so oh sorry I remember on your man
in the street video um when you showed
that the guy that you had a stylus he
was totally turned off by it
like oh god there's a stylist and you're
like oh what do you think about that and
then he's just seemed I think a lot of
people thinking I think look
old-fashioned yeah yeah especially
because the last time we really saw
styluses well okay there was the HTC fly
excuse me that's uh that's tile I
island-style I there was the HTC Flyer
tablet and that had one and and you know
but really before that the last time we
saw them was mostly unlike palm phones
yeah with ya with a resistive
touchscreens and you couldn't really use
your fingers or anything else I think on
this phone it's it's okay because um you
know it's got it's basically another
input method so you can use your voice
you can still type and the keyboard is
quite large on this phone as you can
imagine especially when you're holding
it in landscape view I actually have
been taking notes on it I when I picked
up the phone from samsung I took notes
on the tab um I in scratch Jessica yeah
it got a lot better when I actually
switched from the paintbrush to the
ballpoint pen and picked a fine tip but
there is a little bit of a delay when
I'm using it i notice i tried to draw
some pictures and i'm not so much the
artist but there's still an issue
sometimes with the sensitivity and the
responsiveness but I'm not an artist so
I really wouldn't use it for a lot of
doodles unless it was to do something
fun or entertain some kids or something
like that and to be honest I personally
think that if you never use the stylus
it's okay because what you're left with
is a samsung galaxy s2 phone that
somebody spilled miracle grow on for
overfed or subject I'm asteroid's
injected with steroids exactly i mean it
it basically looks just like a a larger
version of the sky rocket which was a
larger version of the samsung galaxy s2
it's a android 2.3 gingerbread it's got
TouchWiz it's got some motion controls
so i think that the stylus and the apps
for that like there are some memo apps
and they're going to be some games and
things like that and also in addition
you can use the stylus pretty much
anywhere there's a text field so if you
decide you want
right in with your hand instead of
typing in like cnet com for example on
the browser then you can do that but i
think if you never use the stylus you're
still going to find just a perfectly
good phone it's got the 8 megapixel
camera that's really good on the other
galaxy s2 phones it's got a 2-megapixel
front-facing camera 1.5 gigahertz
dual-core processor in here what else am
i missing screen HD super amoled which
is not a sharp you may not be surprised
as it is on the Samsung Galaxy Nexus
which has a smaller screens at the pixel
density is a sharper but it's still nice
it's very nice actually it's just when
you hold them side-by-side and compare
them so I think to me it comes down to
size and how you use it I personally
think that you know if you've already
got a 10 inch tablet you might take this
phone more often but it's not going to
have a similar you know video playback
viewing experience you're going to have
to turn more pages when you're reading
an e-book but if you've never had a
tablet and you like a phone this large
and you think it will feel comfortable
in your hand and then I think that
you're going to get a good phone but I
think that most people if they're smart
should consider the size before they
consider the stylus when they're
thinking about it yeah I mean in a way
it's like a step up to folks you know
for folks who are considering a tablet
you know going from a from a more
traditional smartphone you know you're
gonna you're getting a you're getting a
lot of tablet like features and a pretty
you know powerful phone itself but the
whole pen thing I don't know I don't
know I mean I well you know what I'd
like and then just I'll be real fast by
this basically if this is fantasy land
here but if the screen had a almost like
paper like feel to it um that provided I
kind of friction uh it's glossy you want
the resistive screen no no no I mean now
I don't want it unresponsive I wanted to
you know have that kind of feeling of
writing on paper you know for you know
for me to use as a pen with a pen
I mean and then of course it'd be great
if the paper actually I mean that the
fake paper would emit light like a
screen but that's you know science
fiction so wow so you we saw a couple
respondents but surely you ask more
people what they thought what was the
general consensus or was there one for
the people you were asking in New York
at the park well I mean I I was uh you
know we talked to four different people
we just basically just ran over to the
park and I went you know coincidentally
there's a shake shack right there so I
didn't have any vested interest there
but um but yeah so we went there and
obviously it was a cold day and a lot of
people out there still even so so we we
talked to some folks and we do not yep
and believe it or not you know we talked
for different people I would say for the
three of the three out of the four were
definite iphone users invested in iPads
and iPhones so they they were not sold
on this though uh there was um well one
person seemed to sort of two women one
woman seemed sort of on the fence but
she did like the side she thought the
size wasn't soaps so large and it would
fit in her life whereas this other woman
who actually was a fan of Android and
had a original Galaxy S device she
actually liked it a lot and thought she
would buy it immediately so so it's
actually pretty mixed even though even
though I mean if you look at the post
though that I wrote talking about the
video there people on there who are just
flaming me and just saying you know what
are you talking about you know why why
are you phrase the question like this
but habla you won't you have it out for
Android and all that stuff that's not
true because I use Android I've actually
don't even use an iphone so you know
basically it depends on where you stand
this is like at the center of a huge
controversy whether or not your iPhone
or iOS or whether your Android whether
you're a tablet user or an iPad user
pretty much or a smartphone user
and an Android user I mean it seems like
you're to Center this issue what is this
device how would you use it it's it's
all it's like the center of a maelstrom
so so send us your thoughts on that
Brian and I have a lot more great
stories on the galaxy note to come
including how well it does with art if
you can indeed use it in workplace
environment to take notes and also what
it's like to live with it for a week so
more stories to come and also it comes
in carbon blue which almost looks black
to me ceramic white or at least it will
on Sunday and the pink color is a coming
along as well so basically sorry as I
pause there so so basically that's AT&amp;amp;T
and we kind of like at least we like the
Samsung Galaxy Note even though there's
some question marks surrounding it but
what we don't like is the carrier's
being bits of Scrooge's unseat assembly
with upgrade fees so did you guys see
the stories Kent wrote one basically a
nice little tidy rants about AT&amp;amp;T
basically charging customers to be loyal
they have confirmed that they were
doubling the upgrade fee from eighteen
dollars to thirty-six dollars and that's
on the heels of sprint also offering
it's sort of an offer they're offering
an upgrade now for people who are not
within their to your service agreement
or if they're still in the middle of it
and then there's a rate during this
promotional program of like thirty-six
dollars to 165 dollars to upgrade so
what do you think about this so I mean
what is the fee for that's what I don't
understand exactly like are they paying
you to stay with them or pain so you're
bringing them yeah I mean would that's
so crazy I don't understand a better
phone or if you want to keep your
contract and then have a better phone
that's um more high-tech than the one
you have now they will charge you
thirty-six dollars that doesn't make any
sense to me in addition to the price of
the phone yeah but I mean I thought the
whole point of pain
for the phone was because they already
paid for most of the phone right
subsidies yeah so why are were you
paying them again I I don't understand
this I think it has to do with patent
wars they have to pay fifteen dollars
per device or something for the all the
patent litigation they're going through
I think they're trying to like get it
out of the customer somehow that's
that's my could be true an ATT told
phonescoop that since today's cell
phones are more sophisticated than ever
before then the costs associated with
upgrading to a new device have increased
and that's part of the upgrade fee so I
think that it definitely sounds like a
litigation issue as well however how
much does it cost I mean you go and you
look online like Verizon for example the
HTC Rhyme costs zero dollars it is free
with the new to your service agreement
so aren't they just encouraging turn
which is that the last thing they want I
don't know it did it I really have I
have very I'm very skeptical let's just
say that it seems really backwards to me
yeah but the sprint thing is actually a
deal only offered at corporate locations
and will run just a month from februari
12th through March 14th and Scott
Webster who wrote this piece said well
think about it you know from the other
point of view you could be paying five
hundred dollars if you bought it without
a contract so the fact that you're
getting it for two hundred dollars even
with an upgrade rate even if you pick
the highest upgrade rate you're still
gonna save 100 bucks or 130 bucks and I
think that's a good point I just don't
think that's how people in this country
think if they've been with a carrier
before who is like post paid so if you
sign up for it to your contract you're
definitely I think expecting a certain
kind of payment roster and upgrade
schedule and prices associated with that
yeah i mean i just--that's AI think
they're done that's that's totally
ridiculous so I mean charge more for
phones i guess but i'd rather be charged
more upfront and then rude to stay with
the carrier then have to keep paying
hidden costs and nickeled and dimed
exactly i mean night
people should be able to vote with their
feet and not be tied into contracts and
if worse comes to worse if the phone is
more expensive up front than fine just
as long as you can leave whenever you
want and you know and also swap out your
device for a much better device you know
for most of our device if you can find
one you know I mean that's Bette's much
better so we're going to give you that
food for thought and we're going to take
a quick break and we'll be back with
quick hits and reviews
and we are back it is styled in its
valentines day and we've got some news
that's sparked our interest this week
first of all will the PlayStation Vita
OS land on smartphones and tablets this
is Sony's new OS coming to a handheld
gaming device and I don't know since
they bought ericsson we are their stake
in sony ericsson we could possibly be
seeing this in the future on smartphones
Ryan you want to take us along to the
next sure yeah well we have learned that
it's possible that HTC will further
bring out some more details of ice cream
sandwich landing on a few devices so you
know that would be awesome we want more
ice cream sandwich wherever we can get
it and definitely check out the article
if you want to learn more and another
apple ipad or iphone rumor this one
dealing with the ipad 3 apple will
reportedly unveil ipad 3 in early march
i think it's probably yes we're
definitely going to prepare for that the
Justice Department says that it is not
going to stand in the way of the Google
and Motorola of marriage at least
according to The Wall Street Journal so
Google should jump over the last couple
hurdles to buy motorola outright
excellent well actually now this is the
thing here we've got we've got sprint
here with the next hill situation and
i'm not even sure you know they've
gotten rid of their that service right
so i thought it was dead already but you
know is officially is dead now so let's
you know let's hope that they'll be able
to buy some more spectrum and modernize
their service yeah 2013 was the year and
if you couldn't get enough already about
the huge galaxy note there's remember
that LG will go big with a 5-inch
Optimus Vu which has fewer view view I'm
going to vote for view okay I like that
name better Optimus view and it's going
to be a good Scott I have a 5-inch
display and an eight is it what cam
and the camera megan is an 8 megapixel
camera yep NFC support 1.5 gigahertz
processor so we could be hearing about
that at Mobile World Congress perhaps I
don't know just a note we are going to
be doing our mobile world congress
preview next week with Mobile World
Congress coming after that and since
monday is a holiday for us we'll be back
here tuesday at one o'clock again same
time next week but we have a little bit
more of the love letter variety for this
next phone Brian took a look last week
at the motorola droid 4 and he's going
to tell us all about that all right yeah
so I mean you know we just took a look
at the motorola droid razr maxx which
was pretty awesome but now you know just
a week later motorola came out with the
droid 4 which basically is an upgrade to
the droid 3 and essentially ads you know
LTE 4G data connection on verizon's
network costs 199 99 basically two
hundred dollars and it's a it's a great
phone it problem is it doesn't run a ice
cream sandwich comes with Gingerbread
they will have support for ice cream
sandwich down the road and I mean that's
a drawback but otherwise it's a great
device just you know if you want a
keyboard that has full five rows offers
great tactile feedback and a pretty nice
decent you know eight megapixel camera
on there this is this phone is worth
checking out but it does feel a little
bit dated because not many devices have
keyboards these days it's kind of thick
it's kind of heavy you know it depends
on what you want if you really are
married to a keyboard and you want an
android phone with 4g on verizon this is
very compelling otherwise you might be
better off just going with the galaxy
nexus for cutting edge ice cream
sandwich or going over to the droid razr
maxx for
incredible battery life and a very thin
design I'm surprised because when you
first saw this you were all over this
phone you I know loves it it's yes
you're like I got it I got it at the
stage we're gonna see it so I mean did
you fall a little bit out of love with
it after seeing that surprises yes you
know it's I guess kind of fitting on
valentine's day for me to uh you know
changer to break up with this phone you
know well I mean I guess what it was was
uh you know this has been a device that
people been looking at looking for for
such a long time I I know people that
you know are addicted to keyboards they
loved the original droid the first droid
that came out a few years ago when was
at two thousand seven or whatever it was
no no no 2008 right I'm just gonna let
you say it's it's so long ago I can't
remember but anyway the original droid
that broke the Android barrier everybody
you know heard about Android through
that device they loved the keyboard they
loved the power that it had they even
could deal with the motoblur interface
that Motorola put on Android and it was
it was a device that everyone just you
know kind of near and dear to many
people and the subsequent revamp so that
that product line have been steadily
kind of blah you know so when a new
device like this came out and it in it
by the way it did come out originally
October 17 2009 2009 there you go
thousand oh nine Wow okay yeah you know
that's you know feels like 10 years ago
but uh you know I'm sure there are
people out there who still have their
original droid and still can't give it
up so if you really need that keyboard
this muy bien as long as you don't mind
turning it on its side and sliding out
the keyboard I want to see more portrait
queries oh god no i don't know like the
tortoise motorola droid pro for example
that's an Android device right it's true
not like a super premium Android device
but definitely gunning after a
blackberry there anyway we also have a
review Lynn took a look at the LG
marquee for boostmobile which is would
you say it's very similar to the
original sprint version yeah I mean
they're pretty much the same except that
it runs on boost mobile's a carrier so
it's kind of pre it's prepaid no
contract and a lot of people that that's
their style they might really like it
goes for 279 99 so it's the most
expensive phone on boost mobile's
website and it has a 5 megapixel camera
on the back two megapixel front facing
camera and I kind of liked it out like
the designed it was it was slim and it's
very light so it could easily kind of
travel with you my only thing with it is
that it's a little sluggish the internal
processor was a little slow so when you
browse the web or you translate the
processor alma I I think those it one
gigahertz yeah and it's a Singapore yeah
it was a it was pretty noticeable and
but the display is really nice i has
seven seven hundred nits of brightness
just like the LG connect 4g so it's
really really bright but it also drains
the battery quite quickly if you use it
like that i remember i'm taking a look
at this phone before for sprint and
comparing it with some of the other
bright funds of the day and it's
interesting what people mean with with
brightness and color because it is
really really bright but the colors
aren't always true it's interesting
there's definitely a trade-off sometimes
you get like over saturated color but
it's not quite as great but definitely
like when you hold the phones up like
they look good yes one looks really good
is it almost like too bright that it's
like Sir never be too bright bride no no
really it also like 700 minutes at max
yeah and it's so if you drop it down and
then in just it i mean if it if it's too
bright you could always lower the
display but you're right about the kind
of the picture quality is some some of
the stuff is pixelated and a lot of the
graphics weren't as smooth as I wanted
it even though it's such a really bright
screen yeah so but definitely good for
boostmobile you would recommend it for
anyone who's interested in that Network
I would say go for a kind of a cheaper
phone that boost mobile can offer only
because it makes really great calls so
there's that but if you really just
wanted a phone that had made really
great calls on a note
uncheck kind of basis then but if you
wanted a smartphone like a more advanced
smartphone for boosts then would you
recommend this one sure I guess sure
well there you go so we also took a look
at the blackberry curve 9370 for verizon
that's the sort of entry-level 3g phone
with some world capabilities so it's got
a sim card GSM SIM card also i looked at
the samsung SPH m3 71st print that's a
basic flip phone I mean that's real
basic it did make very good calls its
twenty bucks so I would recommend that
and then Brian checked out the Jabra
supreme bluetooth headset you can find
all of those full reviews on cnet com
and did you guys get any email this week
I didn't either no I got a little tiny
bit of personal email I got an email
from a co-worker here it was really cute
he's like hi I don't mean to annoy you
you probably get these questions all the
time but you know my wife's looking for
a new phone on Verizon you know she's
willing to spend this range what can you
recommend I'm sure it's on the site but
I really hope I'm not annoying you and
I'm like this is what we're here for of
course you're not annoying me so if
you're curious I recommended oh and she
will use it primarily since she's a
commuter and she drives to work him back
she would use it primarily for
navigation so the voice readout is
really important and that's sort of like
the deciding feature for her between
like iphone and android essentially
although i did mention that Windows
Phone has that as well it does have a
voice freed by read out with being maps
but for Android I recommended the
Samsung Galaxy Nexus I'm just because of
the Ice Cream Sandwich experience and
they don't flip their phones a lot
they're going to keep it for two years
so it seems like a good phone that will
last the hold years it also probably get
all the updates to like yeah exactly no
delays and stuff and I actually also
recommended HTC Rhyme because it is free
right now and her needs are actually
very
whew you know she just she wants you
know a phone that she likes the look of
that will do the voice by you know the
voice readouts for directions
turn-by-turn nav and that's every
android phone and so it's a nice device
and I don't really think she's that much
into charms but if she doesn't mind a
smaller screen then you know it's fun to
get a phone for free rather than paying
three hundred dollars for one right go
figure everybody likes anything I had a
great set of headphones too in there so
we'll see we'll see what uh what she
winds up with um but if you have other
questions or anything or want to keep us
company more like to hear your name on
the air then send us an email dialed in
at cnet com leave us a voicemail we will
probably play it at 1 866 4022 638 you

and insightful blog posts at dialed-in

interested in the samsung galaxy note
