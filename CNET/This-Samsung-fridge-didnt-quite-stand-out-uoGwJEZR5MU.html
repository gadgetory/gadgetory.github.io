standing next to the e here we go
Samsung RF and this is a mid-range
French door fridge so it's in that kind
of first class of French four models
with an ice maker in the door and a
digital display open the fridge up and
you'll find sixteen point six cubic feet
of fresh food storage space not a bad
number but not a great one either it
gets beat out by a couple that the close
competitors you'll also find a number of
features that help set this fridge apart
from lower tier French door models every
one of these four shelves moves in some
way this one on the bottom slides in
these two slide out and this one appear
folds up to make room for taller items
those are all nice for flexibility but I
wish they were more flexible they don't
really move that well they're kind of
stiff and sticky and when you try and
slide them out or push them out of the
way you have to use a little extra force
I don't like that I have similar
problems with the build of the drawers
down below you've got two crisper
drawers both of them rattle as you pull
them out and kind of shake the cool
select pantry down here though is the
worst you pull it out and really have to
work to get it back in I didn't like
that at all it's a nice feature with its
own thermostats you can adjust from
temperature presets but I still think I
would never use it just cuz I hate
opening and closing it
this fridge earns a little bit of
redemption though when you look at the
performance scores take a look at our
heat map here it's got the usual blue
and orange sections but you look in the
middle of the fridge the body of the
fridge there those are all very accurate
nice cold numbers we see other French
door models that store up above the 39
40 degree mark you don't want to see
that this fridge didn't have any
problems like that in the body of the
fridge all-in-all this fridge gets
enough right to merit consideration but
it is a bit pricey and I don't think
it's quite the standout that it needs to
be for more check out my full review at
cnet.com see that appliances I'm right
