our ultra pixel technology and camera
experience to the next level and let me
tell you the results are fantastic you
get better quality photos under all
lighting conditions and a focus time of
less than 300 milliseconds up to 50%
faster than before a new camera switcher
lets you easily change between modes and
it includes all new ones things like
dual capture selfies and a fully
customizable manual mode you can
manually configure your camera settings
with sliders for ISO white balance and
more you can then save those settings as
a custom camera mode that will always be
available in the switcher for those
times that you want it what about video
when you're shooting video you can
actually now pause reframe your shot and
then continue shooting so that you get
multiple cuts within one video and our
slow-motion mode not only lets you
capture HD slo-mo video but you can
later choose which part of the video to
slow down so that you can add a stronger
sense of drama to the action that you
just captured and then you've captured
all these photos how do you find them
the redesign gallery lets you search for
images with a timeline search you can
just pinch to dynamically adjust between
day month and year views and we've also
introduced a new image mash that gives
you a whole new way to find photos of a
specific person for example let's say
you just took a photo of your friend
Jesse you can tell image match to find
all other photos on your phone that
include Jesse and not only that it will
immediately create a custom album with
all photos including her now 2013 was
the year of the selfie and HTC is known
for giving you the best front camera
and it's not just for photos anymore
mobile video chat is exploding and is
expected to triple over the next three
years so people want a phone with a
better front camera so that they can
make sure they look great in all of
these photos and videos the HTC One m8
delivers with a 5 megapixel wide-angle
front camera you can just swipe on the
screen to instantly turn the camera on
so you can capture great photos and
videos of you and your friends and one
other key feature that you heard Peter
mention earlier is that the HTC One m8
has not one but two cameras on the back
we've actually added a second camera
that captures detailed depth information
about a scene so it understands what
it's looking at by using hardware to
automatically capture depth information
it opens up creative options that just
haven't been possible before on a smart
phone it means your phone knows which
objects are closer in the foreground and
which are farther away in the background
so the question is what can you do with
this sort of information in a lot of
professional photographs you see this
effect where the subject is crisply in
focus but the background is softly
blurred out this is called the bokeh
effect and traditionally it's only been
possible with high-end cameras because
the HTC One m8 Hardware depth sensor can
tell which people are closer or farther
it can instantly create this effect
right on your phone you can refocus the
shot on anyone in the frame with just a
tap instantly applying this artistic
blurring effect you don't have to mess
with a separate app or a special mode
and because detailed depth information
is captured at the hardware level your
phone doesn't have to guess about how to
apply the effect you just tap and it
turns a good photo into a great photo
for the first time your phone can
understand objects and physical space
this opens up new possibilities for your
creativity for instance you can
completely and instantly separate the
foreground and background of a photo to
create awesome effects with the
foreground ER tool the phone can use the
depth information to instantly apply
cool effects to everything around the
subject of your photo you can choose
from effects like pencil sketch motion
blur or cell shading and these are just
a few examples of how depth information
can have an enable you to be more
creative and expressive in fact we
believe that there's so much potential
that we're opening up our camera API to
outside developers we can't wait to see
how developers will put this innovative
hardware and depth information to use
this is yet another breakthrough in
mobile photography professional looking
photos and cool new effects all applied
effortlessly and there's another great
benefit that all these creative
possibilities mean which is that your
highlight videos will look better than
ever one of the most exciting things
we've done on the HTC One m8 is to
radically expand the highlight video
experience earlier you saw the camera
switcher with all of the different
camera modes one of these modes is a
simplified Zowie camera that makes it
easier for you to shoot lots of great
footage in Zowie mode one camera button
does it all you just tap to shoot a
photo you hold the button down and it
starts recording video and captures up
to 20 burst photos within the first
three seconds and like before your HTC
One m8 automatically edits your photos
and videos into professional-looking Zoe
highlight reels you can choose from
preset themes and soundtracks but now
you can personalize your vote Zoe videos
even further by adding your very own
music we've developed dynamic beat map
so the phone can instantly apply cuts
fades and effects in synch with your
music making your videos look better
than ever it gives you more creative
input but and still is so easy to do and
there's one more bit about Zoe today
we're pleased to announce that we will
be extending Zoe to the cloud creating
an innovative online service free or
highlight videos you'll be able to
upload your Zoe videos for everyone to
see and then invite friends to add their
photos videos and music it will let you
share remix and relive your most
important moments like never before
this new Zoe experience will be coming
to sense six this summer and we look
forward to sharing details with you
later and speaking of updates we've
actually re-architected sense so that we
can update blinkfeed
sense TV our gallery and more right
through Google Play we'll also be adding
new creative experiences to our duo
camera things like copy and paste
bringing innovations and improvements to
our customers throughout the year what
this means is that you'll be able to
enjoy the latest innovations from HTC
immediately in the same way you do with
other apps downloaded from the Play
Store</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
