lab CEO Farhad firebox chillin I get it
right every time and we're here to talk
about this product here it's it's like a
smart mirror what is this exactly what
do you guys call it we call it naked 3
fitness tracker what we have here are
three sets of depth sensor powered by
intel realsense that when you stand on
the turntable start scanning your body
taking 30 frames per second of depth
snapshots then we stitch them all
together to create your 3d body model
what's also inside this mirror is a
quad-core Intel Atom processor and what
that does actually it does all the body
transformations
it creates the body model and runs all
the analytics and dimension measurements
so the minute you step on the base what
happens is the mirror detects that then
it actually there's a very quick scan
your body determine who you are and then
it starts how does this system actually
really detect how much you know body fat
percentage you have we instantiated a
system that is very similar to a
hydrostatic dunk tank we calculated by
integrating the area within your 3d body
model is it better to do it with clothes
or you know really you know compression
make it like what's what's prefer so
that the best scenario of course is your
skin type clothing or just underwear
because whatever is exposed gets
measured and what gives us the most
accurate volumetric body fat percentage
as if your bodies actually
okay so I have this scan in my hand and
I've got to give you guys props you you
made the hair the Quaffle looks good
