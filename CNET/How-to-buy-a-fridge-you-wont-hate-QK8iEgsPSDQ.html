you're just sick of the one you already
have
either way shopping for a new
refrigerator can be a daunting task but
don't worry we're here to help now
before you start shopping you're gonna
want to get up a tape measure and check
how much space you actually have in your
kitchen
those width and depth and height
measurements will go a long way to help
narrow down your options you'll also
want to get familiar with the four main
refrigerator styles top freezers bottom
freezers side-by-sides and French door
fridges if you just want a simple value
then a top or bottom freezer might be
your best bet you can get a really good
one for roughly the same price as an
entry-level side-by-side or French door
model those side by sides and French
doors are the more popular fashionable
choices though and they also boast more
features than top or bottom freezers
plus as popular as they are you'll find
plenty of options to choose from to pick
one out you'll want to look for a fridge
that matches the kitchen aesthetic
you're going for and you'll want to be
sure that it's big enough for your needs
too
a good rule of thumb is to pick out a
fridge that has at least 4 to 6 cubic
feet of storage space for each member of
your household plus a few extra cubic
feet of wiggle room once you've got a
good general sense of what kind of
fridge you want and how much fridge you
actually need you'll want to start
thinking about features many of the
newest models try to stick some extra
utility into the old icebox
everything from built-in coffee makers
to built-in cameras and no it isn't
always easy to separate the gimmicks
from the good stuff for my money I'm a
fan of features that make it easier to
you know actually store things in the
fridge and shelves like this one that
slide back or fold up out of the way can
be a nice help in that regard I also
think that temperature adjustable
drawers like this one with their own
presets can be a nice luxury to look for
if you want something feature-rich just
make sure that you aren't buying
features just for the sake of having
features at the end of the day nobody
cares about the bells and whistles in
your refrigerator all that matters is
that those bells and whistles make sense
to you as for smart fridges expect to
see more and more of them in the coming
years
some have big flashy touch screens like
this one here loaded with fridge apps
for things like recipe support or
cooking timers other smart fridges are a
lot more subtle they'll have things like
built-in smart grid support or Bluetooth
speakers those kinds of connected
features probably don't justify the
extra expense on their own just yet but
if your dream kitchen includes a
flagship smartphones like the Samsung
family hub or the LG smart instant view
refrigerator don't let me stop you from
splurging it definitely do not come
cheap but these are also top-of-the-line
fridges that were talking about one last
tip don't forget about performance it's
not the kind of thing you can just look
for as you're out in the show floor so
you'll need to check out in-depth
reviews like the ones we post here on
CNET those will help you make a more
informed decision and if you do your
homework you'll be able to pick out a
fridge that you love for years to come</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
