smartphone is apparently in the hands of
a tween I'm Bridget Carey and this is
your cnet update samsung will be
revealing the highly anticipated galaxy
s4 next week on Thursday but there's
speculation swirling about the
smartphones features rumors say it could
have an eight-core processor a 5-inch
screen two weeks of ram and a 13
megapixel camera on the back we'll have
to see what exactly is true though on
March 14th and to get people buzzing
about the phone samsung released a
teaser video about the event but to be
blunt it's a pretty bad video it's about
how Samsung is trusting the secrets of
the s4 to this really annoying kid and
instead of getting you excited about the
s4 and leave you questioning what was
Samsung thinking usually their ads are
pretty clever it ends on a to be
continued message so i guess samsung
will push out a few more of these
embarrassing videos before it launches

making its premiere exclusively on xbox
live it's a british comedy called pulp
and this is the first time any movie has
been only available on xbox live and
