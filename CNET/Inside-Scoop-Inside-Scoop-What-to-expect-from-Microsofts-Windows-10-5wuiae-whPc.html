I'm cnet's Cara tsuboi joined by staff
writer Nick statt on Wednesday January
21st Nick myself and a few others from
the cnet team are traveling to redmond
washington to microsoft's campus to
cover the big launch of windows 10 Nick
what do we know about this event so far
so it's going to be called Windows 10
the next chapter Microsoft named the
operating system or revealed the name
back in September and there's a big
surprise because they jumped over nine
that went right from eight to ten okay
now it's the first opportunity to show
why that's such a big change and why it
deserved that that name jump so they're
going to be showing some more sharing
some more details about what it's going
to look like I'm phones on tablets and
how it's going to all work together and
this is a big press event I mean it's
expected to be a few hours long a big
deal for Microsoft yes it's a big deal
this is gonna be the really long one
where they really dive deep it's gonna
expect it to be maybe over two hours
long sajid Mandela will will be in
attendance were unclear it's unclear if
he's going to be on stage speaking will
definitely be there okay and what do we
know about the product itself you
mentioned that it's for for mobile for
tablets and phones what else right the
big change with Windows 10 is that it's
going to be the only operating system
for Windows it's going to be universal
so it's going to work on your desktop
it's an work on your laptop on your
phone on your tablet there's going to be
no windows phone anymore as we know it
it's going to be all Windows 10 it's
supposed to work using what windows are
Microsoft calls continuum across all
devices just depending on what topic the
screen is weather is a master there's a
keyboard it's supposed to automatically
move just seamless seamless yeah
Microsoft hopes at least ok any other
features that we know of thus far too
early to tell it's kind of early to tell
too early to tell but we do know besides
continuum that Microsoft is kind of
bringing it back to basics they're going
away from the heavy touch dependency
they had in Windows 8 that turned off a
lot of users they're trying to make it a
look a little bit more like Windows 7
but still pushing it forward I'm still
trying to incorporate touch because they
can't ignore it and it's now on their
surface tablets and obviously on phones
so they're going to work really hard on
trying to make sure this is a this makes
sense to people whether they're using
their fingers or whether using a mouse
and keyboard and what do we know about
the release day
it in the price point it's expected to
release later this year we don't know
when but developers have been using it
since late last year okay in terms of
pricing they are going to charge for it
we think we don't expect Microsoft to
switch to a free model like Apple has on
last few years though after this release
after Windows 10 we're unsure if
Microsoft might go free they could go
free and that would be a big change for
them what is microsoft need to do to
ensure that this release is a success
and can actually you know get the
attention of the broad public
Microsoft's big job is to just not turn
people off and to assure them that they
can be trusted to create something good
they are going to do a lot of work
trying to simplify things they're going
from a number of different operating
systems very confusing product specs all
into one universal thing if they can
pull that off I think they'll really
turn it around for windows all right
thank you Nick you can tune in to cnet's

is new with Windows 10 Nick statt Kara
