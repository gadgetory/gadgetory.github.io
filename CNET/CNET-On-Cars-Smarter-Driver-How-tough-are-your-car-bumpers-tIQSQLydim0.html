1973 was not a good year
the OPEC oil embargo had us waiting in
long lines just to buy gas on either odd
or even numbered days but even worse is
what happened to bumpers
starting in fall of 72 the 1973 cars
were the first to accommodate new
federal standards that said a cars
bumper had to withstand a 5 mile an hour
front impact or two and a half mile on
our back impact without major damage
so bumpers got big jutting and ugly
overnight to this day many vintage car
collectors draw the line at 72
now 40 years later and everything's
different the old chrome bumpers like on
this Lotus they're gone
this is basically strong trimmed today
the bumpers a tougher piece but
invisible hidden underneath the cover
that's integrated into the shape of the
body but also the standards were cut way
back in 1982
cars now only have to survive a two and
a half mile an hour front impact or just
a one and a half mile an hour bumper
corner impact all this low-speed testing
is important not because it saves lives
but because it saves you money how well
a bumper performs in slowed impacts will
give you an idea how much you'll pay to
repair the damage after and it varies a
lot
the IIHS test bumpers with a six mile an
hour full impact and a three mile an
hour corner impact those full impacts by
the way are the lion's share in the real
world the cost to repair that impact
damage on similar cars can vary wildly
according to IIHS a full-frontal on a
2011 Ford Focus bumper results in just
five hundred eighty eight dollars damage
same impact on a 2011 Hyundai Elantra
almost five grand and a similar pattern
continues across other test modes
average all tests damage together and
it's almost 4x more expensive from one
car to the other so clearly when you're
buying a new or used car it pays to
double check these bumper impact ratings
and what it costs afterwards but know
you're fighting a bit of an uphill
battle for three reasons
most bumpers suck the IIHS finds most
bumper designs simply don't go far
enough past the very slim minimum
standards to be tough enough high enough
or tall enough lane cost control but
also the fact that the best bumper would
probably not be the best-looking bumper
bumper toughness regulations were
largely gutted in the early 80s and so
far have not bounced back and finally
pickups SUV's and minivans they get a
pass on the federal height standard
unlike your passenger car which as you
can see quickly moves the discussion
from and how well your bumper performs
to how way your headlights and hood are
gonna perform that gets expensive in a
hurry
I never parallel parked next to one of
these
your bumper is your first line of
defense between you and the most common
thing you'll pay for in a body shop this
kind of impact you can see this one gave
its life for the cause measure the
effectiveness of these in dollars avoid
common bumper related damage by parking
carefully around non height compliant
vehicles trucks and SUVs and consider
low-speed forward collision avoidance
tech in your next car depending on the
car that technology could pay for itself
if it saves you just one low-speed
bumper impact</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
