representing you in the game there are
real human actors on stage and in the
crowd with a first-person perspective
you can see the audience and your band
members react to your performance the
guitar itself is different with six
buttons and two rows at the top of the
neck the game is also keeping things
fresh by mixing in music videos and the
ability to have others watch you live
and compete with players worldwide it's
coming out this fall for $100 and

begin trading used games from old school
systems including the NES Super NES and
Sega Genesis starting April 25th about
250 stores in test markets around New
York City and Birmingham Alabama will

PlayStation Nintendo 64 and Sega
Dreamcast All Eyez this week are on HBO

have passed its first major test on
Sunday during the game of Thrones season
premiere as there weren't any major
outages or streaming hiccups reported
but dishes sling TV streaming service
has not been as fortunate some customers
who tried to watch HBO from slings Roku
app complained of issues which Dish
