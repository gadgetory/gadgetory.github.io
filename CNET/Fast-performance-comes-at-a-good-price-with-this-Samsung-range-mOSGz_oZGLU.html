appliances
and today I'm going to tell you about
the Samsung in e59 j76 3os B there are
forest burners on the stove top and one
warming zone two of the burners have
really interesting features they have a
power boil mode which essentially allows
the power of a double burner or a triple
burner depending on which of these large
burners you use the only drawback with
this feature is that with the oven knobs
you can control how many of those
burners you want active but it makes the
knobs a little hard to decipher when
it's time to turn the burner on I'd
rather be able to just use all of the
power of the double or triple ring
burner and have a simpler knob control
rather than trying to figure out how
many burners I'm using now this stovetop
produced some amazing boiling results
using the rapid boil feature I was able
to boil 112 ounces of water in just nine
point three three minutes that puts this
oven at the top of the electric oven
boiled tom tests range I was pretty
happy with the convection baking mode on
this oven I've baked two racks of
biscuits at 450 degrees and one thing I
did notice is that even though the
biscuits were pretty even across both
racks the racks were a little bit
different in color from one another the
bottom rack specifically was always a
lot lighter than the top rack of
biscuits not necessarily a huge knock
against this oven but something to keep
in mind if you are baking multiple
sheets of biscuits or cookies at once
now if you're really interested in using
this oven for lots of different tasks
this Samsung has a lot of different
features packed in you can dehydrate
food in the oven you can also slow cook
or you can proof bread which makes this
a pretty versatile tool for the home
cook this Samsung model is nine hundred
and forty-nine dollars when you take
into account all the features that are
packed into this oven such as convection
baking and roasting bread proofing slow
cooking this is a pretty good value for
your dollar for more about the Samsung
model
