see at Google i/o over the years Google
has introduced lots of new things at its
annual IO event there's been Google home
new versions of Android and the
unforgettable project brillo this year
is the tenth Google i/o so here's our
wish list for what we want to see and
number five is a music strategy google
has Google Play music along with YouTube
music now there's a rumor that a new
YouTube service called remix is coming
and it will swallow up Google Play Music
I'll use Google Play Music and I'm all
for this idea whatever you do Google do
not have two separate services that are
essentially the same coming in at number
four are some new Google home features
Google did add a ton more control to
Google home recently it now controls
more than 5,000 smart devices but home
is still trailing Amazon's insane amount
of skills maybe Google can come up with
better chromecast integration for
example you can ask home to show you
something from Netflix but you can't
tell it to play a particular season or
episode with your voice also Amazon has
a pretty simple online tool that lets
anyone create a custom Alexis skill
easily maybe Google can copy that
strategy at i/o at number three is
figuring out TV google has been trying
to figure out a television plan for
years remember Google TV it was
discontinued within four years of its
introduction then there was that oddball
Nexus Q then we got Android TV which was
on the Nexus player the player was
introduced and discontinued within two
years in parallel is the chromecast
which is pretty decent as long as you
have a phone to send it content maybe
this is the year Google puts Android
into the chromecast number two goggle
fuschia the mysterious operating system
could be the future of both Chrome OS
and Android now Android apps can run on
Chrome OS but that's still kind of messy
Android can sort of be a desktop
interface take a look at a Samsung
device with a deck stock reports say
fuchsia can run on phones and
Chromebooks so maybe it is the future of
Google devices whether it merges chrome
and Android or just something else
entirely it would be great to find out
what the plan is
for fusion hey Google can you clear this
up
and the number one thing on our wish
list for Google i/o 2018 is a lot more
messaging apps we've only got duo and
Hangouts and Google Voice and messenger
with a low on life support Google this
cannot stand
ABB's kidding here's what we really love
to see some amazing Android news if
you've been following the news on
Android pee you may be underwhelmed
Android Oreo brought us
picture-in-picture video smarter text
selection notification dots on app icons
and the ability to snooze notifications
Android pee has not supports rounded
corners for notifications it may be
named popsicle yay here's hoping Google
is sitting on some awesome features for
the next version of Android and we'll
see them at i/o big thanks to Paul Greg
Michael Jessi Steven Risto and everyone
else who chipped in with their ideas on
Twitter we'll have all kinds of coverage
on Google i/o at CNET so make sure you
check that out
