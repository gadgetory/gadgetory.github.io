challenging to keep all of your tech
accessories organized and all together
one solution is to use a product like
gritted which uses elastic bands to keep
everything in place or you can do it
yourself
it's easy and affordable you'll need
some kind of hard flat material like
foam board this will be the base of your
organizer so it should be really sturdy
a ruler scissors a stapler elastic
banding you can find this at craft
stores or order it online you'll need a
few yards of that and finally for a
cleaner look you'll see why a hot glue
gun so the first thing you want to do is
cut the foam board down to the size you
want your organizer to be it can be
pocket-sized or it can be larger if you
have a lot of accessories so I'll just
cut mine to seven inches by ten inches
which is about the size of a large
tablet now grab your elastic band and
staple it to one side along the edge of
your foam board then turn it around and
stretch it across the board you want to
be free pot because remember this is
what's going to hold all of your
accessories in place then just trim it
and repeat the same process all the way
across
halfway there
so we have one side done now we're going
to go this way perpendicular but this
time we're going to thread the elastic
band through these existing bands to
create a sort of net that'll hold
everything together
and we are all done see how easy that
was now at this point your organizer can
be complete but if you want a cleaner
look there's just one final step so I've
got a piece of foamboard the exact same
size and I'm equipped with a hot glue
gun all I need to do now is apply glue
to each corner of my first phone board
just like that and now it looks much
more polished and clean we'll just give
it about 30 seconds to a minute to
settle the glue is dry and the organizer
is complete now let me show you how you
use it
I've got a little Ethernet to USB cable
headphones second pair of headphones
I've got my charging device and a
wireless mouse I see
everything is tidy organized and the
next time you travel you'll know exactly
where everything is and as a last touch
I picked up this pouch for about 2 bucks
usually it's meant for a tablet but it's
also the perfect size for this organizer
and you're good to go if you have any
questions or tips of your own and hit me
