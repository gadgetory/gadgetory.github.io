2015 with the one-wheel is this
interesting futuristic skateboard
looking thing now if there's a motor in
here so it accelerates automatically and
speeds up and stuff as you tilt and lean
so this thing has been a crowdfunding
success over the last year and this is
the final retail model but if you order
one the big question is how easy is it
to right now I haven't been on a
skateboard in about 12 years and I
wasn't very good at it then so I'm about
as much of a newbie as you can get I'm
gonna give it a go and we'll see how I
fare so when I first got on this thing
my instinct was to bend my legs but
apparently that's not the thing to do
you need to be stood up as straight as
possible and actually that does feel a
little easier the other observation I'd
make is that we're not exactly on the
smoothest terrain here but this big
bouncy tire does make the ride feel
quite smooth and it's very very quiet so
even though all I'm basically doing is
standing still and leaning I do feel
like I'm getting a workout I can feel
this in my feet I can feel it in my
curves so I mean that might say more
about my general fitness level than
anything else but speaking to the guys
who make this you know they describe it
as a kind of fitness device it doesn't
feel as lazy as it looks now something
that's brand new is this app it lets you
do things like see how much battery
you've got left on the one wheel and you
can also change out rides I've been
using it on classic mode but if you're
ready funding a little faster and a
little more tricky there's extreme mode
as well so I wouldn't describe this
thing as easy to ride but I've been
practicing with it for about 10 minutes
and I have to say I'm starting to feel
pretty comfortable in terms of just
hopping on and going I was impressed it
felt kind of easy and actually rather
intuitive it's really cool and to be
honest I kind of want one alright that's
all for now I'm Luke Westray 15 it's
