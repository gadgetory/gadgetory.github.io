here at CES 2016 at Tech West but this
one buys Emoto it's called the Z moto
pivot is a little bit unique it's gonna
hit Amazon later this month for 199 50
and it has some really interesting
features
aside from 1080p live-streaming motion
alerts and other features this actually
has a 360 degree motion sensor so if
activities happening outside of the
traditional field of view it actually
knows what's happening and will take
snapshots of that other activity so
basically you're getting a view of all
of the things happening in the room
instead of just one part of what's
happening in the room so you probably
don't need with multiple security
cameras to watch the same space so
you're actually getting a pretty good
deal for this considering that a lot of
security cameras are available for the
same price around 200 bucks the new nest
cam a lot of Samsung's cameras a bunch
of those and another really cool thing
is that it has optional cloud storage
for a monthly fee that's to be
determined still and also a built-in 16
gigabyte internal storage so you have a
lot of options if you aren't interested
in that whole remote server thing you
have all of it recorded and saved right
here it also has a related app obviously
for Android and iOS so you can interact
with everything remotely see what's
happening when you're away
home and check in on your kids or your
dog or whatever you want thanks for
