photos is by simply cleaning your lens
even a small speck of dust on the glass
can blemish your photos and you might
not know until it's too late
start by using a blower and not
compressed air to blow off any dust
particles on the glass the less you have
to actually touch your lens the better
but if that doesn't totally help grab a
microfiber cloth and just gently wipe
off the lens at this point if you still
have anything stubborn stuck on the lens
your next step is to grab some lens
cleaning solution put a couple drops
onto the microfiber cloth never onto the
lens and do the same thing or keep one
of these lens pens handy which really
let you go at it without damaging the
lens don't forget the other side of your
lens where dust can also collect and
equally ruin your photos follow the same
methods first using a blower and then
resorting to the microfiber cloth or
lens pen for any stubborn dust if that
doesn't help the problem might be on
your sensor in some cases you might need
a professional to help you out but there
is one thing you can try first put your
camera in cleaning mode you can usually
find that in the settings under
something like sensor cleaning or mirror
lock in this case I want to clean it
manually and once I hit OK the mirror
will flip and the sensor will be exposed
now use the blower to blow away any
particles that might be lodged inside
that's really your only option when it
comes to cleaning the sensor you don't
want to use a lens pen and you also
don't want to use something like a brush
which can easily damage those parts
inside if you still have a problem take
your camera to a professional when
you're done replace the lens turn off
your camera and enjoy clearer
