there may not be anyone driving it I'm
Bridget Carey this is your scene that
update soon we may live in a world where
you hail a taxi and no one is driving
General Motors and lifts are on a
mission to test self driving taxis on
public roads within the year GM recently
invested five hundred million dollars in
lift the ride-hailing service that
competes with uber GM also is putting
down 1 billion dollars to buy a company
that develops self-driving car
technology reports indicate that if you
live in a city that will have this self
driving test you would be able to choose
in the app if you want a human to drive
you or just the car which would be an
electric Chevy Volt but it's not just GM
that is revving up self-driving car
plans this week Chrysler and google
announced plans for developing
autonomous minivans that will be tested
this year and the Wall Street Journal
reports the Google and Apple are
shopping for land to test self-driving
cars you are already familiar with
Google self-driving cars but Apple has
no facility yet and it also isn't saying
a peep about it officially but in the
meantime Apple is said to be making
another update this time to its music
streaming service Apple will be offering
its monthly on-demand music service at
half the price for students the discount
first reported by TechCrunch comes out
to about five dollars a month Spotify
also offers a five dollar monthly
subscription for students so this would
be a move by Apple to stay competitive
there's been buzz that Apple is going to
show off changes to Apple music next
month at its developers conference and
the latest report from nine to five Mac
says the new interface is going to have
text and backgrounds in basic black and
white with larger album art and the
mission is to make the app look and feel
simpler to use Apple music has been
around for a year and the company said
right now about 11 million people
subscribe to the paid service that's all
