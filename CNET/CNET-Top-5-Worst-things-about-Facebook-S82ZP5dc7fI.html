complicated I check it compulsively but
I always seem to put it down and
discussed the sound familiar Donal Bell
and today's top five is going to be like
a little public therapy session for my
facebook addiction I'm counting down the
worst things about Facebook not the ads
not your annoying friends not the game
invites that small potatoes I'm talking
about the real core issues that make
Facebook and existential tar pit
starting off at number five creepos if
use Facebook as prescribed it acts as a
daily diary of everything about you it
only takes one weirdo to make you
realize that that's a really bad idea
and I'm saying this with a guy women
have it a million times worse so you
lock up your profile like Fort Knox only
to realize that Facebook can sell all
your stuff to advertisers which is just
a different kind of creepy you want to
be part of the party but you don't want
to be exploited or stalked so how do you
open up and still keep out the creeps
it's a big question that pervades the
entire world of social media not to
mention your entire real life at number
four it's mostly lies if you were to
believe your newsfeed every one of your
friends even that dirt from high school
are all currently having a blast their
kids are being adorable they're on
vacation in Hawaii they're engaged they
got a new job and it might all be true
but it's only half the story you're not
seeing the food poisoning they got on
vacation or the credit card debt they
incurred no one shows their kid acting
like a monster and you know that kids a
total jerk it's all a selectively
crafted facade and we're all guilty of
it and if that isn't really you then who
is it and why are we doing this coming
in at number three too much information
I met you at a party I accepted your
friend request and now I'm learning
about the unfortunate side effects of
your master cleanse good God everyone's
got a different idea of what kind of
information is appropriate to share on
facebook relationship drama family drama
does this look like something I should
see a doctor about drama some people
can't help it some people get their
kicks from pushing too far I prefer the
good old days when you can pass a kidney
stone without having to take a selfie at
number two
envy Facebook is exceedingly good at
making you feel inadequate it is after
all designed to sell advertising whether
it's by design or just human nature most
of the time I press the like button what
I'm really saying is I wish I had that
your lunch looks great I wish I were
eating it that concert looks great I
wish I were there it makes you wonder
how much happier you might be if you
weren't constantly being reminded of all
the things and parties and amazing food
everyone else seems to be enjoying
aren't there any boring people left in
the world to make me feel better about
staying home and watching Netflix in my
underwear all right finally my vote for
the number one worst thing about
Facebook the small daily reminders of
your inescapable death after 30 Facebook
is where you go to watch your friends
get fat and wrinkled I mean throwback
Thursday should really be called holy Sh
we're getting old remember your crush
from high school they have five kids now
in college probably posting
inappropriate pictures on facebook of
how awesome their spring break is which
you shouldn't look at because that would
be creepy so there you go five reasons
why joining Facebook was the worst thing
you've ever done not that thought will
stop me from checking it compulsively or
posting this video on Facebook I'm
