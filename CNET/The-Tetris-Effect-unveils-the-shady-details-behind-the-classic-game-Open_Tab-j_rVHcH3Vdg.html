very special project you recently
published a book hey yourself you know I
have a letterpress at my house I just
stamp them out he's been out for six
months doing why it took so long here's
the book can we a shot of this it is
called the tetris effect the game that
hypnotized the world I'll
congratulations thank you sir thank you
very exciting is a very big deal all you
can get this wherever wherever you buy
bar every Bibles so I want to talk to
you about one just a little side note
this is the UK version and now the UK
and the US version are like fighting
each other it's right by boat I'm sure
both right cuz like we said before the
show all the all the use and all the
weird grammar is in this pound symbol as
they want with the Cold War angle they
did yes you did well there's a lot of
that there in your street yeah you know
they're still paranoid about that so I
want to talk to you about the the book
what is it about Tetris because I would
have met like Tara's interesting but
it's not that interesting by itself okay
and I looked at her I said okay there's
an interesting history there if you know
anything about the history of video
games or technology you may know that
Tetris came from the Soviet Union during
the Cold War and there are a lot of
fights over who owned it and let you
know legal battles and things like that
that's fine the more I looked into it
though I realized this isn't a game
story it's actually a start-up story
very similar to the startup stories that
we have set about over at Silicon Valley
and elsewhere sure but the startup story
from the Soviet Union in the middle of
the Cold War in Moscow and that's what
made it super interesting to me that we
were taking this modern you know
startups or that we talked about but
finding the most unlikely version of it
possible that said a huge global impact
over 30 years so I mean the way you
described like that almost makes it
sound like it was this sort of accident
or at least its popularity of course it
is how is a little software program some
guy makes in a Russian you know science
academy all of a sudden become a billion
dollar global business it's the most
lightly of success stories so like how
and I don't want you to give away too
much about what's what's in the book but
like how does ownership work they're
like hey and I'm sure obviously that you
get into that but like how did that play
out that's a huge part of it it's almost
like like a cold war you know business
spy thriller with all these big
companies backstabbing each other and
trying to make deals with the secret
Russian groups alexey pajitnov the guy
who created tetris he was a he was a
computer scientist at the Russian
Academy of scientists he was actually
working on some very advanced stuff
things like artificial intelligence
voice recognition for the Soviet Union
the 80s that's like super cutting-edge
in his spare time he used his ancient
computer ancient even for them at the
time to make this a game that mimic this
puzzle game used to play as a kid uh
many friends liked it he passed it
around and to go viral back in the
Soviet Union in the eighties that means
making a big 5 inch floppy disk and
walking it over to the other people in
Moscow who have a computer at the time
ago hey check this out yeah it'sit's
sneakernet it's we still call that
sneakernet but that's all they had and
somehow improbably it just spreads and
spreads because what else you can do for
fun in Moscow in 1984 think a lot going
on you're not unless you just want to
like stand red line or everyone yeah
exactly that's all right and then it
makes its way too hungry which is an
eastern bloc country but a little more
open to to commercialism and the West
that's where Rubik's Cube comes from
that was also Eastern Bloc invention
that made it out into the West they
really love their squares and a business
guy from the UK saw it and said hi
wonder if I can sell this somehow maybe
I'll try to talk to I'll find out it's
from rush i'll try to talk to the
Russians they don't understand
intellectual property rights or
licensing their communist ok so just
good all right below that all we're
going to deal with these guys but in the
meantime I'm just gonna start selling
this out of the back of a car okay and
that led to you know many many
intersecting lawsuits and this huge
tangle that takes us through this whole
you know legal and business thriller
cool alright sounds like you're already
working on like the movie adaptation I
feel we're gonna act it out right I feel
like I feel like there's their substance
there to the stage as a stage show a 23
now now I've read half of the book don't
spoil the ending for me hahaha the ship
sinks in the end here's the spoiler it's
let zigzag piece is the murderer well I
there's no point of me reading the rest
of it anymore but I think one of the
interesting things though you put a lot
of detail into the losers in the tetris
race and you know most books it's
essentially just alright here's this guy
did a really cool thing that's their
story but how did you get in contact and
you know why did you decide to put so
much like focus on you know people that
didn't like when the rights to tetris
when you're telling a history story or
good non fiction story I think it's
really all about it's not just about
what happened it's about the character
do you really need characters that that
make the history come alive when I found
was this story had so many fantastic
characters in it alexey pajitnov and
Hank Rogers on one side but also the
guys you talked about who lost out in
the end guys like robert maxwell and and
robert stein and a lot of the other
russians and the guys that like king in
an Atari and spectrum holla by and they
were also interesting i thought it was a
great sort of you know large cast of
characters that I could walk through and
a lot of them were very you know happy
to talk to me and tell me you know their
stories and a lot of like interesting
anecdotes that hasn't been you know
published anywhere else before so I
found it was a great it was a great
human story behind it and that's what
really helped me to kind of put it
together in that way and make it make it
a character piece what was the most
surprising sort of maybe even shady
thing I mean a lot of shade is a lot of
shady my favorite surprising thing was a
little bit later when Nintendo is
finally negotiating with the Russians
for various Tetris rights for the
famicom and nes a lot of boy tetris just
within Tendo true and nintendo was at
was kind of a johnny-come-lately to that
but they're the guys who really
mainstreamed it after it was a kind of a
cult hit on PCs and of course we go to
CES every year there's a big scene set
at CES in like nineteen eighty-seven uh
where the game is just on PCs uh but
when Nintendo Howard Lincoln who's a
famous you know figure he later went on
to become the president of the Seattle
Mariners I think he just retired a few
months ago M&amp;amp;R Arakawa who was the
founding
nintendo of america they're in Russia
trying to do some of these negotiations
and the rand they're sitting in the room
and the Russians come in with a
cosmonaut I they go uh comrades this is
comedy so in total Kozma he wants to
talk to you about Nintendo sponsoring
the Russian space program maybe we could
send the Soyuz capsule up it'll have
been Nintendo logo on the side these are
very forward thinking right yeah right
uh and then later they take our lives
yeah right and then later they take
Howard Lincoln and his son to the secret
top secret Soviet the space training
town hall town they have set up to Train
astronauts and they show mall like the
training uh you know modules and
everything so so the fact that they
tried to do that I think that was the
the coolest surprise thing huh yeah cuz
I you know most people I feel like a lot
of people don't even realize it is a
Russian sort of institution were like
this came out of oh yeah uh yeah go
ahead but you think about the game that
you remember with that the Russian
plinky music and the backwards are in
the title and the and the cathedral on
the Fox that's all the invention of
Western publishers mirror soft in the UK
and spectrum holla bite in the US the
whose sister companies owned by the
maxwell's uh they said you know what we
have this kind of plain looking game
let's do it but it's from Russia let's
play that up let's make it the first big
import from the Soviet Union make it
kind of scary sort of forbidden and
that's really what what causes huge
mainstream breakthrough how is it that
such a simple game like this has a back
story that's more complicated and like
the Jason Bourne movies because we were
dealing with at the time this tie in
credible tension between Russia and the
West and we were dealing with the very
beginning of the computer era and and
the beginning of people starting to this
is just before Gorbachev came in and we
moved from this very strict communist
system to collapse mist and perestroika
and this opening up so it was really the
exact right time for people to start
testing the waters mixing these two
cultures finding things that's what Hank
Rogers did he was kind of a software
anthropologist he would go around to
different countries he was a naturalized
American from the Netherlands living in
Japan at the time and he would go around
and find software from other countries
that he thought would sell well in Japan
you know without a lot of localization
so he said Tetris this is going to be
this will work
any country you don't have to read the
instructions you don't have to
understand any story you could just
watch it for 30 seconds and you know how
to play it so that and the Russian stuff
and that just the arrow computer stuff
rat and the birth of the NES and the
Game Boy yeah this perfect storm came
together and that's why you know instead
of just being an 80s you know curiosity
EA just sold 500 million Tetris
downloads on smartphones and that's
blows my mind 30 years later yeah like
Tetris really ended the Cold War it was
that this was right this was like the
silent assassin it was the first Russian
thing that a lot of people were exposed
to that actually was from Russia right
it kind of gave us the it's like the old
sting song we're like oh the Russians
are just like us they like video games
too right no yeah it's an amazing story
you can get the book wherever books are
sold I think we might be giving one away
I'm hat we're happy to give one away I
don't know if it's designed it for you
to the excellent know if it's this one
in my hand it could bake but we'll
figure it all out so we're going to pass
this along to someone in it was watching
live but you'll lot of rules on how to
do that I think they're going to be up
on screen or something like that awesome
i'll try to one of the thing very quick
that was super happy to do which was
finally be able to get some cool blurbs
from people i really admire you and i
think the most fun thing was to get i
got steve wozniak word a little blurb on
the back and ernest cline ready player
one into the fantastic book Doug
rushkoff is a great tech author he
actually can't coined the term viral
media back in the 90s there i was able
to send all those guys early copies and
i'm super excited that a that they were
what's that like when like you're you're
looking for a quote like was I'd like we
literally cold email was yeah like
because he was a big Tetris fan zactly
eight is he would send his high scores
into gay magazines oh no they would stop
and they stopped running them at some
point because he was in there every
month you're always the one who always
in here when I so he started sending his
scores in under an anagram of his name
and they started running it again and I
knew that beforehand so i just said
after the fact that you know what I bet
he'd like to resell them is a great send
it to me and we got a nice we had a nice
floor problem how does Nathan verify
those scores now that I'm thinking about
it can I just you just have to take a
photo of your TV screen get it to Villa
when you're dealing with a camera how
you gonna do that on an old
35-millimeter camera travel back in time
and do it oh that was so we are looking
for our a hundred Twitter follower for
the handle of the show that's per that's
a big accomplishment that's seen it open
tab if you are our lucky winner you will
get a signed copy of the tetris effect
by mr. dan ackerman thank you so much
for being here really appreciate it I
pledge and good luck to everyone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
