very special project you recently
published a book yourself I have a
letterpress at my house and I just stamp
them out he's been out for six months
doing why it took so long here is the
book a shot of this it is called the
tetris effect the game that hypnotized
the world congratulation thank you thank
you very exciting it's a very big deal
oh you can get this wherever wherever
you buy Barberie Bibles so I want to
talk to you a battle and just a little
side note this is the UK version and now
the UK and the US version are like
fighting each other it's right by both
I'm sure both right cuz like we said
before the show all the all the use and
all the weird grammar is in this pound
symbol I wasn't a one with the Cold War
angle they did well there's a lot of
that there they're still paranoid about
that so I want to talk to you about the
the book what is it about Tetris because
I would have liked interesting but it's
not that interesting by itself okay and
I looked and I said okay there's an
interesting history there if you know
anything about the history of video
games or technology you may know that
Tetris came from the Soviet Union right
there in the Cold War and there are a
lot of fights over who owned it and let
you know legal battles and things like
that that's fine the more I looked into
it though I realized this isn't a game
story it's actually a startup story very
similar to the startup stories that we
have set about over at Silicon Valley
and elsewhere sure but it's a startup
story from the Soviet Union in the
middle of the Cold War in Moscow and
that's what made it super interesting to
me that we were taking this modern you
know startup story that we talked about
but finding the most unlikely version of
it possible that's had a huge global
impact over 30 years so I mean the way
you describe it like that almost makes
it sound like it was this sort of
accident or at least its popularity oh
of course it is how is a little software
program some guy makes in a Russian you
know Science Academy all of a sudden
become a billion-dollar global business
it's the most
lightly of success stories so like how
and I don't want you to give away too
much about what's what's in the book but
like how does ownership work they're
like huh and I'm sure obviously that you
get into that but like how did that play
out that's a huge part of it it's almost
like like a Cold War you know business
spy thriller with all these big
companies backstabbing each other and
trying to make deals with these secret
Russian groups Alexey Pajitnov the guy
who created Tetris he was a he was a
computer scientist at the Russian
Academy of scientists he was actually
working on some very advanced stuff
things like artificial intelligence
voice recognition for the Soviet Union
the 80 if that's like super cutting-edge
yeah
in his spare time he used his ancient
computer ancient even for them at the
time to make this a game that mimicked
this puzzle game we used to play as a
kid any friends liked it he passed it
around and to go viral back in the
Soviet Union in the eighties that means
making a big five inch floppy disk and
walking it over to the other people in
Moscow who have a computer at the time
ago and hey check this out yeah it's
it's sneakernet it's we still call that
sneaker net but that's all they had and
somehow him probably it just spreads and
spreads because what else you gonna do
for fun and in Moscow in 1984 they got a
lot going on you're not unless you just
want to like stand on a red line or yeah
and then it makes its way to hungry
which is an Eastern Bloc country but a
little more open to to commercialism and
the West ok that's what comes from that
was also a Eastern Bloc invention that
made it out into the West they love
their square and a business guy from the
UK saw it and said hi wonder if I can
sell this somehow maybe I'll try to talk
to I'll find out it's from Rush I'll try
to talk to the Russians but they don't
understand intellectual property rights
or licensing their communist right yeah
sorry it's good all right blows well
we're gonna deal with these guys but in
the meantime I'm just gonna start
selling this out of the back of a car ok
and that led to you know many many
intersecting lawsuits and this huge
tangle that takes us through this whole
you know legal and business thriller
cool all right
sounds like you're ready working on like
the movie adaptation I feel we're just
gonna act it out right I feel like I
feel like there's their substance their
stage a stage show
now now I've read half of the book don't
spoil the ending for me the ship sinks
in the end here's the spoiler its lens
exact pieces the murderer
well I there's no point of me reading
the rest of it anymore but I think one
of the interesting things though you put
a lot of detail into the losers in the
Tetris race and you know most books it's
essentially just alright here's this guy
who did a really cool thing that's their
story but you know how did you get into
contact and you know why did you decide
to put so much to like focus on you know
people that didn't like when the rights
to Tetris when you were telling a
history story or good non-fiction story
I think it's really all about it's not
just about what happened it's about the
character do you really need characters
that that make the history come alive
what I found was this story had so many
fantastic characters in it Alexey
Pajitnov and Hank Rogers on one side but
also the guys you talked about who lost
out in the end guys like Robert Maxwell
and and Robert Stein and a lot of the
other Russians and the guys that like
Kangin and Atari and spectrum holobyte
and they were all so interesting I
thought it was a great sort of you know
large cast of characters that I could
walk through and a lot of them were very
you know happy to talk to me and tell me
you know their stories and a lot of like
interesting anecdotes that hasn't been
you know published anywhere else before
so I found it was a great it was a great
human story behind it and that's what
really helped me to kind of put it
together in that way and make it make it
a character piece what was the most
surprising sort of maybe even shady
thing I mean a lot of shoes there's a
lot of shady my favorite surprising
thing was a little bit later when
Nintendo was finally negotiating with
the Russians for various Tetris rights
for the Famicom and NES a lot of Tetris
just with Nintendo true and Nintendo was
a was kind of a johnny-come-lately to
that but they're the guys who really
mainstreamed it after it was a kind of a
cult hit on PCs and of course we go to
CES every year there's a big scene set
at CES in like 1987 where the game is
just on PCs but when Nintendo Howard
Lincoln who's a famous you know figure
he later went on to become the president
of the Seattle Mariners I think he just
retired a few months ago
Minoru Arakawa who was the founding
Nintendo of America they're in Russia
trying to do some of these negotiations
and then they're sitting in the room and
the Russians come in with a cosmonaut
they go oh comrades this is comedy
so-and-so Kozma he wants to talk to you
about Nintendo sponsoring the Russian
space program maybe we could send the
Soyuz capsule up it'll have a big
Nintendo logo on the side these were
very forward-thinking right yeah right
uh and then later they take everything
right then later they take Howard
Lincoln and his son took the secret top
secret Soviet space training town the
whole town they have set up to train
astronauts and they show them all like
the training you know modules and
everything so so the fact that they
tried to do that I think that was the
the coolest surprise thing huh yeah
because I you know most people I feel
like a lot of people don't even realize
it is a Russian sort of institution
where like this came out of oh yeah oh
yeah go ahead but you think about the
game that you remember with that the
Russian plinky music when the back words
are in the title and the and the
Cathedral on the Fox that's all the
invention of Western publishers
mirrorsoft in the UK and spectrum
holobyte in the US the sister companies
owned by the Maxwells they said you know
what we have this kind of plain-looking
game let's do it but it's from Russia
let's play that up let's make it the
first big import from the Soviet Union
make it kind of scary sort of forbidden
and that's really what what causes huge
mainstream breakthrough how is it that
such a simple game like this has a
backstory that's more complicated and
like the Jason Bourne movies because we
were dealing with at the time this time
incredible tension between Russia and
the West and we were dealing with the
very beginning of the computer era and
and the beginning of people starting to
this is just before Gorbachev came in
and we moved from this very strict
communist system to collapse missed and
perestroika and this opening up so it
was really the exact right time for
people to start testing the waters
mixing these two cultures finding things
that's what Hank Rogers did he was kind
of a software anthropologist he would go
around to different countries he was a
naturalized American from the
Netherlands living in Japan at the time
and he would go around and find software
from other countries that he thought
would sell well in Japan you know
without a lot of localization so he said
Tetris this is going to be this will
work
any country you don't have to read the
instructions you don't have to
understand any story you could just
watch it for 30 seconds and you know how
to play it so that and the Russian stuff
and that just the arrow computer stuff
we're at and the birth of the NES and
the Gameboy yeah this perfect storm came
together and that's why you know instead
of just being an 80s you know curiosity
ei just sold 500 million Tetris
downloads on smartphones and that's
blows my mind thirty years later yeah
like Tetris really ended the Cold War oh
boy yeah this was right this was like
the Silent Assassin
it was the first Russian thing that a
lot of people were exposed to that
actually was from Russia right it kind
of gave us the it's like the old sting
song we're like oh the Russians are just
like us they like video games too right
no yeah it's it's an amazing story you
can get the book wherever books are sold
I think we might be giving one away I'm
happy we're happy to give one away I
don't know if it's designed it for you
to do the excellent know if it's this
one in my hand it could be but we'll
figure it all out so we're gonna pass
this along to someone in who was
watching live but you'll have rules on
how to do that I think they're gonna be
up on screen or something like that
awesome one of the things very quickly I
was super happy to do which was finally
be able to get some cool blurbs from
other people I really admire I think the
most fun thing was to get I got Steve
Wozniak word a little blurb on the back
and Ernest Cline who wrote ready player
one into the fantastic book duck
rushkoff is a great tech author he
actually can't coin the term viral media
back in the 90s so I was able to send
all those guys early copies and I'm
super excited today that they were
what's that like when like you're you're
looking for a quote like literally cold
email woz yeah I was like because he was
a big Tetris fan back in the eighties he
would send his high scores into game
magazines
oh no they would stop and they stopped
running them at some point because he
was in there every month you're always
the one we're always in here we started
sending his scores in under an anagram
of his name and they started running it
again and I knew that beforehand so I
just said after the fact that that you
know what I bet he'd like to realize
that great sent it to me and we got a
nice we had a nice blur problem doesn't
even verify those scores now that I'm
thinking about can I just you just have
to take a photo of your TV screen get
into Villa
when you're dealing with a camera how
you gonna do that on an old dirty five
millimeter camera travel back and do it
that was so we are looking for our 100th
win follower for the handle of the show
that's her that's a big accomplishment
that's seen it open tab if you are our
lucky winner you will get a signed copy
of the Tetris effect by mr. Dan Ackerman
thank you so much for being here really
appreciate it my pleasure and good luck
