a look at the microsoft surface pro 2
that is the latest version of
Microsoft's flagship PC product here
just in time for Windows 8.1 so you have
an updated operating system you have
updated components inside the surface
pro most notably an Intel Haswell
generation ship that's the fourth
generation of Intel's Core i5 CPUs that
are supposed to give you somewhat better
performance but also much better battery
life the catch is that the surface pro 2
from the outside looks pretty much
exactly the same as the surface pro 1 in
fact I've got a surface pro original
version right here and as you can see
these are pretty much the same same
weight same thickness
the big difference physically is that
the original surface pro is a kickstand
that comes out like this the surface pro
2 has the same kickstand but it has a
second angle as well which is actually
important works a lot better in your lap
when you can tilt the screen back or if
you're tall and kind of looking down on
it like I am right here like the
original surface pro 2 surface pro 2 has
some optional keyboard covers as a touch
cover with flat keys and a type cover
which has actual physical keys it
remains the best thing about these
surface pro experience this new version
which is about 119 for the touch cover
129 for the type cover is actually
backlit now which is really cool
especially if you're sitting on your
couch in the living room and typing on
it you can actually see the keys I think
people love back the keyboards once you
get used to one you never want to go
back it cost about $8.99 if you start
with a 64 gig version you really want
128 gig that's $9.99 you had another 130
bucks for the touch cover which really
should be packed in by default so you
end up with a fairly expensive kind of
premium
ultrabook price for the same price you
could also try out sony's version of the
same thing which is the tap 11 and I
have that right here the tap 11 has an
11 inch screen so it's a little bit
bigger it also has a keyboard cover in
this case that attaches it's got a
little skinny kickstand back here so
that's kind of different that they cost
about the same but
this is thinner and lighter so you're
really a much nicer overall physical
design however I like them both about
equally because I like the typing
experience on the surface better because
of the attached keyboard and the fact
that the kickstand is wide and can go
across your lap but I like the actual
you know very laptop style keys on this
and the fact that the whole product is
thinner and lighter so for about 1100
bucks if you work in what the keyboards
cost you can get the same experience
from both the real selling point for the
surface pro 2 is that with these Haswell
chips and some internal improvements
that Microsoft has made you get better
battery life and our very tough battery
test the original surface pro gran for
about four and a half hours this new
version ran for more than six hours
that's a pretty significant improvement
and if you're just doing casual surfing
on it it should last even longer I'm Dan
Akron and that's the Microsoft Surface
pro 2</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
