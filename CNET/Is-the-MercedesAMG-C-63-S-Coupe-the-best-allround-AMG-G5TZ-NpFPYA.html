its mercs turbocharged answer to the
lights of the BMW m4 lexus RCF and Aldi
rs5 and I think it's a bit of a looker
the only thing it shares in common with
its more pedestrian body styles cousins
is the roof the boot lid and the pinless
doors the rest is all bespoke for the
complainant absolutely stunning power
comes from a 4-litre twin turbocharged
engine but if s trim kicks out 503 brake
horsepower and 516 pound-feet of torque
nor 262 is in 3.9 seconds in its top
speed is 155 miles an hour unless you
spec the drivers package and that gets
you some driving lessons so you can
handle the thing and a limited top speed
of 180 miles an hour largely useless
unless you have a test track or an also
garnet your disposal but still pretty
damn cool now AMG's are all pretty
special here's why so there's a new c63
and this time it's a coupe a so what's
the deal with all the AMG love then and
why will the two-door c-class be the one
to watch those are two very easy
questions to answer AMG s are hard to
dislike they come with a mental turn of
pace and make absolutely incredible
noises and the engine in the c63 is not
too far removed from the one in this AMG
GTS sports car and this thing sounds
amazing have a listen to this
the AMG philosophy has never been to
create a hard-edged racecar for the road
well apart from the Black Series cars
but those are a special case instead
they're about going very quickly in
comfort and having some silly fun along
the way which is why the c63 kupe may
end up being the perfect AMG allow me to
explain the c-class is a sensible car is
the one you buy if you want a swish mode
of transport to take family friends that
stuff around you can have a sensible
diesel or a super smooth petrol it's an
eight car that will blend into pretty
much any situation and add that tiny air
of class to it and its key looks good in
your hand or on the table in front of
you it's the kind of thing that you get
to show off your success and make others
a tiny bit jealous of how well you've
done for yourself the AMG version of the
coop a is a step above a car that has
room for family and what have you but a
rakish look one that's more about style
than space its engine will let people
know you've arrived long before you
actually park up and the smile on your
face will let the guy in the BB spew
stain c250 CDI know that while his
progeny may be the light of his life
lighting up your ears is more important
to you but you're ready for little
people when they come along it's an
everything car but with a snob weighing
in at 17 hundred and twenty-five kilos
it's hardly a featherweight but it makes
up for all that girth with power it's
the most powerful car in its class a
merc says despite all of that it will
manage nearly 33 miles to the gallon and
kick out just 200 grams per kilometer
of carbon dioxide which is monthly
impressive when you consider the weight
the power and the speed and that
everything about it now it's also
probably going to be one of the best
sounding in its class as well because
that's kind of AMG stick you've got
changeable driving modes and fiddle with
a bull traction control so you can
either drive through town nice and
slowly or go everywhere with the rear
tire smoking and the arts hanging out
drivers choice now if the saloon is
anything to go by then this is going to
be spectacular</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
