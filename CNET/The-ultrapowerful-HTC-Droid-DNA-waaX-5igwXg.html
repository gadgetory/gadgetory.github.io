cnet.com and right now we are at the HTC
and Verizon launch event we're taking a
first look at the HTC droid DNA so here
it is it has a 5 inch LCD super lcd3
screen has a resolution of basically
1080p and it can see it's very large has
a edge to edge design here it actually
extends across over the bezel it's
extremely thin they say it is actually
thinner than the galaxy s3 from Samsung
which is a very bold claim but you can
tell it has the red accents that our
signature of the droid franchise also
supposed to be reminiscent of a
Lamborghini design a fast sports car it
looks pretty cool it's very thin it
feels very light on the top you can tell
it's got the power button thats metallic
has a nice little texture headphone jack
up there the agency droid DNA is very
powerful it is run by a Qualcomm
Snapdragon s4 pro that's a quad-core
chip should be 1.5 gigahertz also it has
16 gigabytes of internal storage and
seismic amount of RAM the software it's
running is Android for dot one jellybean
so it's pretty up-to-date it's not the
most recent 4.2 it seems like a trend in
smartphones these days is wireless
charging and the HTC droid DNA is no
exception the back support a built-in
wireless charging solution by a chi it's
a standard that many companies are
jumping on board these days so if you
have an accessory that's compatible you
can drop it on the charger and charged
up without any wires it's pretty useful
it has a 8 megapixel camera LED flash
has a nice soft touch finish hair kind
of similar to the HTC One x+ the battery
is embedded but it's a 20 100 mil amp I
believe battery so should have enough
power to get you through the day all in
all it's a very nice package now the
droid HTC droid DNA is going to go on
sale
november 21st for 1 99 99 but you can
pre-order it right now I'm Brian Bennett
this has been a first look at the HTC
droid DNA</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
