here on the streets of San Francisco and
we had to ask people with phones doing
everything in anything and everything if
there's one thing just one thing that
you could have your phone do what would
it be I wish my phone could do my
laundry and make me dinner I wanted to
date me I'd want to drive me around make
puppies I'd wanted to be able to be that
perfect soul mate that is so elusive in
reality more specifically Bijan puppies
what is that one wacky thing that you
wish that you want your phone to do for
you I mean for the price it should get
me off off the bus or off you know by my
wallet and car keys
to make me dinner make me be on time I
wish if my phone could be my doctor and
you could just put it on your forehead
and like take your pulse and then it
tells you what you're sick with never
lose charge I'd be happy with the larger
and larger battery I want to stop
thinking and allow my phone to do that
I'd like to replace my laptop entirely
oh let Kevon my poem if you create a car
for me I can fly to work take care of my
laundry for me call my wife and deal
with the phone calls without me having
to do it or um help me track down
Beyonce get me to my where I want to be
in like a quick second physically wake
me up in the morning to come to work
where the hell are my keys or like this
my roommate home do that mom is my mom
home
oh why would you eat in open your mama's
home you never know you never know to
watch my cat when I'm gone silent away
oh but wait then I can have my phone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
