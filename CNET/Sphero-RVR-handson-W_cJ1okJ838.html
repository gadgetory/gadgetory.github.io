like a toy robot kick that could
eventually grow up to become a much more
advanced robot maybe something that
feels like a home robot that you could
program maybe once I'm like Sphero Rover
spiro has made a lot of robot balls and
toys may have seen Spider Man r2d2 the
rover is much more of a robot kit that
it developer reviews and the rover is
going to be hitting in the fall for
prime around 249 and there's a
Kickstarter campaign for it now it is
like it a little RC Rover and you can
see here it holds up 10 pounds to move
by 8 miles an hour and it can connect
not just with sphero's programming apps
in edu but it can connect with Raspberry
Pi and other coding kits if you want to
attach them to the top and connect them
with a serial cord that could mean that
you could develop this do all sorts of
things that the other spirit oice can't
do and if you've been following the
Sphero spin-off misty robotics which is
a home robot that is a much more
expensive higher-end device made for
robotic programmers well this is kind of
an in-between another cool thing on the
rover is this color sensor here this is
meant to sense colors and transmit them
very fast over Bluetooth what do you do
with that well Spiro acquired this
company called spectrums I got to look
at these color playing rings that turn
color into music pretty cool and the
idea that Tek was moved into here
spiros gonna have color coded cards and
you could lay on the ground that when
the rover rolls over them reads them and
interprets them as different actions you
can maybe even build coding mats or draw
your own use it to build boundaries for
it so it's another way to interact with
this that's very tactile and color based
down the road Spiro wants to build
custom toppers for this in addition to
Raspberry Pi kits that could be things
like Wi-Fi cameras and other things you
could build maybe you build a robot arm
for this maybe you just run around with
it and use it as a crazy fast robot
Rover in your house so this is still a
prototype and the app that it's using is
not the final version but it's
interesting a look at where toys and
programming robots for kids and schools
could meet more advanced robotics down
the
hey thanks for watching what do you
think about it do you program are you
interested in robot kids let us know in
the comments thanks for watching and
stay tuned for more</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
