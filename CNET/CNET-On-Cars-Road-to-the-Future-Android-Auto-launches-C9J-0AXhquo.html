phone and that combination normally
means some hodgepodge Bluetooth
connection for streaming and calling
some contacts transfer some variable
basket of apps with different interfaces
and this thing clipped on the windshield
or worse juggled in my hand here's how
we go into the future
this new Sonata has the first production
rollout of Android auto an affordable
car it all starts down here you cable
your Android phone into the system as if
you were gonna charge it let's say it's
not Wireless right now then you lose the
phone look up here on the dash that icon
just changed to Android auto when you
press that you're about to enter the
world of your phone but on the dash for
example right here your home screen if
you will it's kind of a Google now look
things you've done or looked at recently
or irrelevant to where you are right now
your round home button you recognize
that from your phone your phone icon
you're gonna have icon
here's music and here's a return to main
screen you get over here to navigation
if you recognize that interface that's
Google Maps your Google search box and
this is live and connected through your
phone plus the voice command to do that
beautiful freeform search that we love
that goes through the steering wheel
AT&amp;amp;T Park San Francisco here is AT&amp;amp;T
Park and of course the routing and
traffic calculations the same ones you
have on your phone but notice it's not
literally taking the whole screen and
putting it there it's artfully
translating it to the automotive
experience and limiting it to these main
hints of apps calling is very
straightforward again touch the call
nice big Clear button interfaces as well
to get things done on the touch screen
over here under music it goes to your
last streaming source from several on
your phone and if you want to get to
other choices it's got a drop-down next
to it here are some music services with
more to come now if you were listening
to say radio before you hit Android auto
it respects that and doesn't force you
to suddenly switch to streaming
customers have told us that's what they
want so they want the phone experience
that's where where their life is in a
lot of ways their music their calendar
the places they want to go it's in their
phone so they bring that into the car
and they bring it in a way that
minimizes driver distraction the beauty
of this is that it lets you live with
your phone the same way in the car as
you do outside
okay so your initial takeaway on this is
how consistent it is the experience on
your phone how it strips away things
that aren't essential to driving you
basically get what the big three here on
the screen imported from Android also
your interface is rock-solid you've got
a bigger screen mounted with good touch
response and integration to the voice
command button on the wheel though
blessedly
the voice command is still handled by
Google in the cloud not by a car system
now specific to this car the cost will
be nothing if you got a 15 or one of the
pending 16 sonatas this is a free
retrograde or upgrade now that free
upgrade has to be done at the dealer
right now but later this summer
Hyundai says they'll make a download
available at my Hyundai comm and that it
will be simple enough that you won't
have to figure breaking your ride it
takes a little bit of time that reflash
is the head unit you basically plug it
in and you do nothing until you remove
it when it's done and it will tell you
it's done so really almost no
interaction with the vehicle other cars
will follow later within their lineup
the other thing is you don't lose the
other Hyundai features not in this car
if you already have nav in the vehicle
you get back your places icon and you
can drop back down to Hyundai navigation
all the Hyundai media the Hyundai radio
choices so this is a dual stack strategy
later on Hyundai will have something
called a display audio system where
they're gonna strip out navigation and a
few other bells and whistles and you get
a lot of the Google goodness in there as
a primary function not an added function
and one of the most interesting things
about this is that it may signal the
beginning of carmakers admitting to some
degree that they don't do mobile as well
as the mobile company it would be
essentially impossible for us to keep up
with every infotainment option out there
so by letting Google handle that we're
able to bring just a variety of apps
into the car and meet the customers
needs send a message to Amy Johnson now
the other shoe to drop
soon is carplay which does basically the
same things in the same way but on your
iPhone Hyundai has that coming in early
2016 and the day after Hyundai put
Android auto in showrooms Chevy
announced virtually all its 2016 will
offer Android auto and apple carplay by
2020 it's expected that 40 million cars
will
Android auto and nearly that many
carplay according to a recent estimate
by IHS Automotive so here is our first
taste of the new vanguard apple carplay
Android auto together they are a
massively important story of Mobile's
becoming consistent in the - and finally
here hitting the market at a very
affordable price point</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
