Veronica Belmont and we're back from CES
back in San Francisco where it is for
wheezing that's why I mean we're my big
heavy sweater today anyway you're
Arielle Nunez and you're gonna help me
out today so what do you what do you do
here at seen it I'm associate producer
you may see all the first look videos I
produce all those and also I produce
gadgets quite i'm a guy in gadgets you
measure this is your video debut i guess
yeah here's Cena I'd seen it anyway
awesome so what are what some of the
stuff he brought for me today well I saw
the dream machine the dream machine FJ
machine if you look on the Craig website
basically you see a little baby bouncer
thing and then you see this this grown
man on a human-looking baby bouncer so
basically it hooks up to a gaming system
and you can actually play video games
while bouncing around so it's totally
interact that is so awesome become a big
baby a big giant stupid baby playing
video games but isn't dream machine
already taken by Sony I had an alarm
clock called dream machine so and jamba
juice has a drink called dream machine
oh really so talking about crazy
technology so you know cell phones are a
wonderful thing everyone carries one
around with you at all times but sony
ericsson speaking of which is coming out
with a cell phone in Japan that actually
has cents involved so you have it a
buyer you have it a buyer here and then
it wafts a refreshing or soothing scent
into your nose they have nine different
scent sheets and so you can plug one in
depending on your mood but I want a
phone that I can actually send a smell
to someone else right it's actually
pretty funny that you say that because
when I was in elementary school we had
an assignment to to invent our own
gadget or whatever and one of my good
friends invented the banana phone which
would permit a banana smell I don't know
why he didn't think of other sense but
it was basically so when when your mom
would call and she asked if you brush
your teeth say yeah and the new admit
this bananas bananas scented toothpaste
and what does that have to do with fresh
in your tea I didn't say it made sense
but it wasn't what it was oh but it
didn't make sense
no get it it made sense I killed me
anyway so another thing I saw in the
crave blog today is the disco keyboard
this is another crazy technology out of
a show they already have the best stuff
but it lights up underneath their keys
different colors you can set which
colors you want for each keys and then
it's kind of like I don't know I want
one no perfect for is seen as office
party that party atmosphere we're really
into that around here yeah definitely
and also you're gonna need your
champagne of course oh I would bring the
champagne color PSP come out oh man I've
been waiting for new colors of the PSP
you know at CES I saw a ton of different
gadgets I were going champagne colored
it's weird champagne is the new color
for spring folks so this guy has
developed wait okay are you a gamer yeah
what do you play what's counsel I've
been playing the Wii the Wii all right
well this is more for those xbox people
out there but this guy actually
developed a suit like in Halo so for the
army so he spent like two years of his
time developing the suit it's bomb proof
it's like knife proof and he wants to
sell it to the military to use and you
look like master commander so it really
is bomb proof yeah that's what he says
anyway I don't know if he's tested it
personally but I mean if it's if it's
good enough for halo it's got to be good
enough for the US Army right yeah
speaking of war in military you know I
got the great topic huh I got the sonic
bomb sonic bomb now it's not actually a
bomb it's an alarm clock oh I was going
to say it sounds like a really delicious
beverage oh yeah some kind of alcoholic
beverage yeah yeah you know we're know
what to talk about right but the sonic
bomb is basically an alarm clock it
emits 113 decibels of sound which is
similar to a car oh my gosh yeah which
is good for me because I know you
probably see me strolling to work around
yes I really do sleep Leslie so it's
probably something I need and also if
that's not enough you can have add the
12 volt bed shaker oh I thought you're
going to say like a 12 boat shock like a
Taser like what would it taste you awake
with those long nights sometimes I need
that yeah well I think that's all we
