today Mac OS hi Sierra now we talked to
the guys and we said there might be this
might be misconstrued but they assured
us this name is fully baked
so now hi Sierra is all about deep
technologies that provide a powerful
platform for future innovations on the
Mac but we couldn't help ourselves we
also added some refinements so I'm
pleased to announce that we're bringing
the Apple file system to Mac OS as our
new default
now a PFS is a thoroughly modern
filesystem 64-bit top to bottom it's
safe and secure with built-in crash
protection and native encryption and
it's ultra responsive with modern
features like instant file and directory
cloning and high-performance
parallelized metadata operations now
what does that really mean in practice
well let's take a look at a simple file
duplication inside of cear√° so we're
going to go up to the file menu select
duplicate on these very large video
files and it's going to copy and just
like you'd expect there's a lot of data
to be copied here so it takes a little
while just about done there we go now
let's watch that in high sierra well
we're going to go up to the file menu
we're going to sub duplicate and we're
done now Mac OS hi Sierra is available
for all of you today as a developer beta
and if you sign up at beta Apple comm
we'll also have a public beta available
later this month
and of course it's shipping to everyone
as a free upgrade this fall on all
systems that support Sierra</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
