with two little girls that's why at
lunch time at the San Francisco Chevy's
restaurant she's happy to put technology
into their little hands to keep them
busy my older one was watching I'm
cartoons the whole time we were eating
and she could navigate to the interface
herself so it was really easy these are
Chevy's z asks tabletop gadgets on trial
at 12 of these tex mex restaurants
nationwide diners can use them to order
appetizers dessert play games or browse
the news the cutting edge piece is nice
because it is a novelty something that's
different than not everybody has but the
big payoff for z oz is how it boosts the
bottom line of its wait staff our
servers have seen their tips go up
because it's you can tip with a press of
a button instead of actually having to
think and calculate it out but not all
restaurants give tabletop technology a
five-star review we lost a couple of
iPads we were a little naive we thought
oh we just leave here to host and it's
secure but it wasn't so the iPad pilot
program was abandoned and it was back to
traditional paper menus for this San
Francisco steakhouse powering down is a
move that many diners appreciate takes
away from that opportunity to actually
have a conversation I just don't see the
big advantage of it right now but
ordering your meal through a tablet
could be the next big trend in places
where you don't want to have
conversation like the airport thousands
of iPads are being installed in airport
terminals by the restaurant group OTG so
along with ordering meals delivered to
your seat passengers can check their
flight status and their Twitter feeds
now that's a recipe sure to satisfy any
techie in San Francisco I'm Kara Tsuboi
