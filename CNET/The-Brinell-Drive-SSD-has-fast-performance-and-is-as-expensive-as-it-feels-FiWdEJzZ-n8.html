drive SSD from Pennell now this is
basically a purple drive that hosts a
soul state drive on the inside but not
any source to drive but this samsung 840
Evo like the one I have right here this
is one of the best SSDs on the market so
pranali is a german company and if you
come by the german engineering on the
outside and the best SSD on the inside
what we have here is nothing short of
the ultimate storing device that's right
something is not only fast but also very
good looking for it to show off with now
my testing the drive here was indeed
very fast offering the sustained real
real copy speed of more than 220
megabyte per second via USB 3.0 now
that's not the fastest ever seen but
very fast Lundell is the driving also
works with USB 2.0 speed now this one
here is a bus power drive meaning you
all we need this include standard USB
cable to make it work on Asahi it has a
1 micro USB 3.0 port and nothing else
nothing else but just gorgeous looking
of a casing pure luxury the drive here
comes with steel frame and on top and
bottom here you'd come with black carbon
you can also find different drive that
made a black leather or other luxurious
material like stainless steel in short
the dry look absolutely fabulous and do
not have any scratch on it and to keep
that from happening it's also include a
leather carrying case right here a very
fancy white being piece of cloth and a
small pack of jewelry polishing tissue
now after Bob to drive here is pre
formatted for windows but you can also
reformat it to work with a mac it
preloaded with pure sing backup software
and true crib encryption software now
piercing worked very well in my trial
actually very helpful syncing and
backing up software but true quick I
couldn't make it work because it's just
too cryptic and by that i mean the
interface is all in german
of with my old vocabularies our preso
lagger and maybe bone swagga so anyway
what is the cost of this drive right
here now the preneur here is available
in different capacity ranging from
hundred twenty gigabyte to one terabyte
and generally it costs about almost
twice the cost of the Samsung internal
drive for example this 500 gig right
here cause some five hundred dollars in
the US or 40 60 euros in Europe but the
500 internal drive costs about two
hundred sixty dollars in the US but
guess what you cannot show up the
internal drive because is internal this
one right here is external and did I say
that is looking great so from all the
drive here check out my phone with you
at cnet com basically is a very good
drive that a lot of you gonna buy just
for the look alone and I don't blame it
but count me out though because I'm not
that superficial plus I have this one
here of free that's only because I'm
don't go and this has been the first
look as the drive SSD thumper now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
