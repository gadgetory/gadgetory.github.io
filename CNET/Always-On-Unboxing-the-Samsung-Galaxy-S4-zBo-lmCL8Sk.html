finally like everybody else has already
seen it but we have been waiting with
perfect discipline oh yeah look at how
not unboxed that is even a little bit
inside this box is the Samsung Galaxy s4
let's do it
this is the this is the follow-up to I
gotta say one of the most durable phones
that this show has ever tested yeah
and generally kind of the phone that
puts Samsung on the back right so here
it is let's kind of got this cool wood
box thing with the note 8 - they're
doing that kind of recycled look thing I
like that color
white frosting I like the blue one oh my
gosh you guys look it's three hmm wah
wah we have more adorable handbook
recycled looking adorable handbooks
something about that phones okay okay
the introduction so Samsung's thing with
the s4 has been like we need to try to
tell a story right about the user and
how they would experience the phone so
here we have our little family dad a
long time Galaxy user right tech savvy
guy mom still new to the latest
innovations daughter shy and reflective
son eager and curious we can't help but
see some positive stuff with the male
characters and negative stuff with the
female you're so gentle what is this
crap like really
she did learn how to take your call
though it doesn't seem like she's a
moron throughout anyway whoa you can
answer a call with air call that
explains why it was so so likes so like
still though you know people complain
about this plastic you feel you like it
I don't mind it I agree I got a problem
although I mean after having seen the
HTC one and phones like that that
premium feels well put everybody using
everybody who's got those being metal
back put some plastic case on their
phone anyway I know and I think that
this plastic and its ability to come
apart has been what protected in our
torture test like it's a it's a big one
for durability alright now that we have
the battery in I think it's safe to take
the sticker off we're gonna fire this
guy up meanwhile when you give you the
specs the Samsung Galaxy s4 has Android
4.2 jelly bean it has a 1.9 gigahertz
quad-core Snapdragon processor or a 1.6
gigahertz octa-core processor for the
international version the Galaxy s4 has
2 gigs of ram to help power that
processor and it starts with 16 gigs of
on-board storage but you can get up to
64 gigs and then add another 64 via
microsd card slot it has a 5-inch screen
with a full HD Super AMOLED display with
1920 by 1080 pixel screen resolution the
phone features NFC Bluetooth Wi-Fi of
course and support for 4G LTE networks
it also has an IR blaster because
there's software on board to communicate
with Samsung
these should you be all ecosystem minded
the battery is 2600 milliamp per hour
the front-facing camera is 2 megapixels
and the rear-facing camera a whopping 13
megapixels with an LED flash it's
available on all US carriers for about
$200 for the 16 gig or the smallest
version with a new contract so I have to
say despite the annoying manual and the
annoying introduction I mean it's a it's
a really nice phone I realize though
that says Life Companion on the
lockscreen that's more than just a phone
it's a life compared to Life Companion
I'm really excited to try out all the
hand gestures yeah I feel like vogue for
certain things
I think our road test should have a
dancer in it do you think that the phone
is too legit too legit to quit we'll
find out
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
