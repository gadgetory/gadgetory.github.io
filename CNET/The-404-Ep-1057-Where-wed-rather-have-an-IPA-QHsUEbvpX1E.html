very short but special episode of the
404 i'm jeff bakalar and I'm Justin you
this is the show where we'd rather have
an IPA like a 30-year something to get
us drunk so that we don't have to think
about Facebook going public anymore yeah
yeah rather have OPP you know me did not
think you would get that reference but
I'm proud of you my chama child of the
80s and I know there sell me short I
know my hip hop roots hip hop son I
think that came out in the 90s them way
before there was ever a myspace way
before there was ever a facebook so the
big news today Facebook opens up i think
they opened up at 42 dollars a share
valued at one hundred and sixteen point
six billion yeah drop in the book as far
as I'm concerned you know why I don't
care about this I mean I do care cuz
obviously it's a huge IPO and offering
but doesn't really have anything to do
with any of us because we're poor it's
like looking into a buffet window right
just like seeing other people indulge
themselves in piles of money it's like
Macaulay Culkin in the home alone 2 when
he's walking down the streets of
Manhattan and he call he can do is peer
into the window right and see people
having good times when he himself is
just basically a homeless kid yeah
that's how he's gonna really sad it's
pretty sad uh you know you chase bank
account open at the same time as like in
the news story about Facebook to happen
to me this morning oh you had it open
it's very depressing well I just happen
to be checking my account and frowny
face yeah um I understand where you're
coming from I put a little link up in
the in the top of the run down there
yeah show you how it's an image how I
try to invest in facebook this morning
they did not work it wouldn't take more
money I said take my heavy let me do it
nope that's not working did not work so
those sixty dollars remain in my pocket
yeah and you know we had a Jill
Schlesinger here from see
MoneyWatch trying to explain it to the
stupid people like us who don't get it
who don't understand how this works and
a lot of her advice you know she really
dumbed it down so we can understand a
lot of her advice was like wait you know
was just sort of weight because you're
not privileged enough to have dibs on
this from the Gecko right even after all
the vanguards of the world are done
selling their shares do you think that
you're even going to invest in it
because by the time we get to it
probably like fifty dollars I'm someone
share I'm still bitter over all the
money I've invested in friendster in my
space so there's no way there's no way
I'm getting into bed with facebook yeah
you know all that yahoo stock I've got
years ago they're really not helping
it's just not gonna last this morning we
tweeted out uh you know this is
something we're trying to do every
morning now hashtag ask 40 for you ask
us we answer you uh Vicky at link blue
says how interested are you in this
Facebook IPO thing also do you think
Facebook will change for better or worse
mmm now that are more put on our
thinking caps here for better or worse
it's a tough thing to really predict
let's be totally brutally honest we
don't know no I know I think it's safe
to say we're facebook will only get
worse from here with I have always
thought Facebook is god I'm a big
believer and I think we share this
feeling that Facebook has been getting
progressively worse since like the movie
came last I Facebook got better I was
there like it always worse there's never
been a new feature where I'm like oh
they got it yeah the second I started
seeing more pictures and more stuff you
know it starts turning into things like
myspace yeah um it's too complicated now
yeah it used to be cool it used to be
all right right used to be underground
make sure Facebook used to be understood
so long history for college kids only
yeah that dot edu as a high school kid
started getting facebook profiles and
then it was over alt and there's the
death of fun we need to start looking
for the next Facebook to invest in right
and now it's too late it's jumped the
shark yeah I started a vet inte R
accenture capitalist feel like pinchers
will be over before it even starts yeah
I don't know we don't know anything
about what's going to happen all right
but you know that's just the little news
for you vest in our startup
Cooper Cooper good the goop or groper
grow and grow / 2 that's not bad
reserved both everyone needs a hobby um
so we don't have a lot of time today

interactive relationships with our
listeners we really enjoy everyone

email from you yeah you're too filthy

leftovers going in Vegas has I've ever
seen in the East Coast me yeah you live
it up and reeking little girl a condo
bro it's not like I'm living in some
mansion and colts neck or something the
what percent sure um nick says now this
is gonna make you feel super old for
multiple reasons he says hey for four
crew my name is Nick well I'm a little
fifteen-year-old and today for the first
time I ever played Super Mario what on
Super Nintendo for the first time now so
if he's 15
okay and we were what was super Nutella
on like 90 sure like that she wasn't
even born yeah I remember when Super
Nintendo came out alright so he so he
says this is the oldest video game I've
ever played and I was wondering what the
oldest video game you all have ever
played can you bring up his screenshot
that's at the bottom of his uh his
technical thing right there okay so
let's look at it it's a photo of Super
Mario one right but it's not even the
original NES version is the super mario
all-stars version which is basically it
intends been doing it for 20 years yeah
they just slapped on new graphics and
make it look better that's not even the
original dude you're playing the reboot
but that's fine you're 15 you don't know
any better yeah um it was but I hope
you're able to keep your attention
focused on this boring game that you're
playing I really want to know what you
think about it though neck to be to be
serious which oldest game I've ever
played there's probably a couple months
ago when I was at the pinball arcade I
was able to play pinball machines from
the fifties right so I mean you're
talking you know almost 70 year old
machines there um I played the first
Mario birth like the first first Mario
Brothers game on NES at the Museum of
moving image wait timeout you're talking
about the NES the home comp yeah yeah
the home quite why does your first
exposure was at a museum with that uh no
no that was that that's like the oldest
game I played recently but okay I think
it's turtles in time turtles in time the
original NES good job but yet that's
what makes me feel old when I go to
museums and you start seeing these
consoles there with you know like
descriptions of like Oh Nintendo was a
Japanese multinational companies to make
playing car yeah actually used to make
button mashing consoles there's
something really really upsetting about
that yeah they had like a Sega Genesis
with the original sonic game 2 with
animal description kids in awe to play
it holding a console backwards like
children of the 80's and 90's themselves
was just three button and that was more
than enough yes crew unique oh no Nick
we appreciate the the email man that's
did you guys ever played the old mario
brothers before it was super mario
brothers on Atari yes when that was
basically there was like the PAL button
in the middle
I it was just pipe so you could go all
you know on one side come out the other
yeah right that was just call i think
that was just called Mario Brothers yeah
I think so yeah I remember playing that
would buy you I played pong on the
original atari okay babysitter had it
the first Atari this is not even like a
kitchen like like hipster thing when
it's after no I know this is like 9088
1987 yeah yeah when it was like cool
davon Atari for sure you know I find it
interesting because my dad introduced me
to Atari when I was I want to say like
three or four yeah whatever it was but
that was it like that was the extent of
his video game sort of appreciation
because after that it was just like pew
right over said how much do you think
the Atari cost when it came out original
wats good question i really want to hook
that up I'm curious I remember we had
space invaders we had like Missile
Command uh-huh and then I started
playing a lot of in television do you
know what in television television was a
similar sort of apparatus like Atari but
the controllers uh looked like TV remote
controls that you slid in this plastic
overlay right ok so each game had its
own plastic overlay look it up if you
and show a photo if you can what was it
called again in television just like
like intelligent but in television
sounds really familiar yeah when I see
it and when you put it there yet fired
up on the screen here so basically what
it was see that little like keypad yeah
you basically put in a plastic slider
over that or maybe it was in this room
there was rich and like you know if
you're playing baseball like number one
was swing number two was you know cat
whatever the hell no man look I mean how
many consoles have wood paneling like
let's really get right down to it you
know your old freaking school yeah when
you're not only your console but your
station wagon is rocking the world with
like that Foley would hold ugly gold oh
that like just creep gold and then like
other remote has a while like a cord
attached to it does it look like it's
some sort of freaking pulse hello
dialing telephone dude so I just looked
it up on a touch-tone the original atari
2600 when it came out in 1978
it costs two hundred dollars in hell for
two hundred dollars that's a lot of 199
dollars so how much is that for with
inflation oh my god probably yeah so six
five four million dollars yeah came with
two joysticks in a combat cartridge also
with the exclusive wood paneling oh man
yeah for two hundred dollars a lot of
money back then my baby said it was
ready to it I mean I feel like with
inflation occasions like a hundred
percent since then yeah Prison Mei don't
know I don't know but it's like a
four-hundred-dollar verges now that's
ridiculous think about it I mean you
know the current generation consoles
they all came out they were four or five
six hundred bucks right you know people
are ready to plumb plunk down a lot of
money and I was reading a survey that
says people are still ready willing and
able to spend that same amount of money
this next generation they're ready to do
it except for nintendo consoles no one
wants to pay more than three bucks for a
new nintendo console go figure arm you
know i mean i wish we could go longer we
really have to stop short wait what i
know we have this video voicemail you
wanna play one video voicemail okay
let's get to as many as we can uh this
one is from who real quick I don't know
guy he'll say his name okay I think he's
drunk oh alright that's fine we throw
for its Jose here Jose Justin Richard
hopefully everything is going good just
hanging out here watching the kings game
oh nice one right now yeah so we're
doing good I got my are you here in my
hometown of Alhambra California yes
anywhere we have the best Asian wedding
yeah you do all the weddings are Asian
anyways haha true good luck Jeff
hopefully you see you here now lay with
those Devils and all right man that's
six out but yeah do you hope for both of
us for sure i mean i'll be at neath if
the devil's do make it to the finals the
Kings will they're up three nothing in
their series um if the devil's make it
man i'll be there at the staple center
i'll be at my side of the stadium yeah
exactly beat me up kicking you when
you're down Oh camber is the best that's
so cool so thank you jose for that uh
that video voicemail was awesome we only
have a few seconds left let's plate can
we fit in one more
we have to go sure all right 404 guys
this is Chicago from Luke oh just
listening to your episode about Game of
Thrones and HBO and all that and I
really think that if HBO starts offering
like a pay-per-view service I think
that's what Jeff was talking about
comcast will literally burn their
headquarters down if they did that
because their relationship even though
as prestigious as HBO is is to symbiotic
and you know even though like the first
season of Game of Thrones is on like
Amazon video on demand right now I still
think that as far as pay-per-view is
concerned the providers will never ever
let that happen yeah he's right let's be
honest he's right um but like we said we
didn't know exactly what that
relationship was the HBO sort of provide
a relationship is but either way man I
just I don't know there's got to be a
better way also the video voicemail
saying that game of thrones is available
for three dollars an episode right on on
iTunes I don't know I just really want
to come out and then we'll talk more
about it on Monday but a lot of people
wrote in and gave their two cents on on
what it's like right guys we're so sorry
we have to end early a special episode
of reporters roundtable is coming up
obviously to discuss the entire facebook
IPO and all that good stuff just make
you realize how much money you don't
have I guess that'll do it for us 866
404 Cena is a number to call or you can
