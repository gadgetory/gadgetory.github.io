proven popular HTC itself is showing off
a number of brand-new VR experiences
edit food including front defense
developer phantom horn studios in
eternal start up within HTC developing
new experiences directly for the vibe
the world war two shooter hanging
standing static from in a barricade
fending off the waves of enemy is a
variety of weapons aiming reloading
we're all done by the vibe controller we
didn't throw grenades of the fleet and
routines and load and fire a rocket
water
Wow yeah that's actually loads of fun
puffing a little kind of snapper with
the controllers that was really probably
one of the best of the VR experiences in
terms of that straight up combat that
I've ever had gebo man by the local time
a nice outfit futuretown is a complete
change of pace offering bright arcade
style visuals as you take on an army of
space invaders you get a gun for each
hand and can swap different weapons on
the fly to shake up your game play a
nice touch for the show HTC has two demo
setup on a green screen the team is then
stitching together footage from the game
and get your videos of how you look if
people could actually see the same VR
world that you do so timely reminder
that you might look like an idiot from
the outside Peter a laser blasting hero
in BR alonia Fitness is an entirely
different style of experience it's an on
rail ride that's a great way of making
gym session feel a little more exciting
hop on the rowing machine and take
yourself to any number of worlds
okay that could keep me on a rowing
machine for quite a long time that was
loads of fun i started off in Antarctica
and they went on the Saturn it's a good
workout and it's just actually
completely cool I've never looked around
so much of a rowing machine in my entire
life</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
