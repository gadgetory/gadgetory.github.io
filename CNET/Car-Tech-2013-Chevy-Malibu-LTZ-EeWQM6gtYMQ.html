t-mobile in the big four but bringing up
the rear in sales let's see if an
all-new version 4 2013 can move it up
the rankings as we drive the Malibu LTZ
and check the tech now for 2013 the
Malibu is on a whole new platform in
other words the entire underpinnings are
new GM did that for two reasons one they
want to sell one Malibu and every market
worldwide also they want a better
platform to compete against Fusion
Accord and Camry that are ahead of this
car in the sales race in that order
they've also tried to take some Camaro
DNA hmm the gauges are like out of a
Camaro that taillights kind of suggested
Camaro but this is not a performance car
certainly not in this trim it's an
everyday car let's see how it does on
that front
now inside poor old GM just can't stop
doing fancy I mean what is this
upholstery
when the question is do you want caramel
brown dark brown black or blue stitching
the answer should never be yes but
that's what happened here and that
that's more chrome than on an entire
Audi this cabin looks like it's the
perfect car for a junior executive in
the pimp industry they got to tone it
down on a brighter note Chevy MyLink is
shaping up to be a real bright spot in
the Chevrolet product line okay this is
not the most ambitious head unit in any
car today it's no outtie killer but what
it does comes off pretty well like the
rest of the cab but it's a little bit
garish the icons are a bit much and
they're screen after screen of them
they've not done a good job of making
this a vertical stack it's a very
horizontal set of pages of functions
that got a little busy now one thing you
see missing here is a navigation tile
this car doesn't have navigation that
remains optional even with this rather
elaborate head unit instead we had a
reliant on star which you got to hit the
button and talk to the service and then
they'll feed the directions here to the
LCD I would much rather get the onboard
navin less you're really lonely I want
to have someone to talk to you've got a
picture of you were here
utterly worthless but someone's attempt
at doing cool
much more positively the Pandora
integration is the best I've ever used
all I did was pair my phone the first
time I got in this car I punched the
Pandora button and bang everything just
connected and worked usually you got to
fiddle around and kind of rock it back
and forth from the phone in the car
big ups on that and you've got all the
major modern sources here nothing
significant is missing though no HD
radio now check this out this guy's got
a flip up LCD 7-inch nice saturation and
brightness that gives you a little bit
here where you can put your smartphone
or media player but unlike some cars let
me see here now there's no power outlet
in here which would be nice and one
downside of having that flip up screen
is that it does give you a little bit of
flimsiness on the screen so when I'm
pushing buttons actually on the display
you got kind of a cheap feel not bad but
it's a little unnerving by the way
there's a base audio system and we have
the upgraded audio system it's a premium
pioneer ray got 10 speakers I believe
you don't get anything terribly advanced
in terms of the DSP or digital signal
processing but you do get a nice set of
EQ including something that is actually
going to be a preset variety or standard
basement and treble the backup camera is
optional at the LTZ level and it's very
simple no trajectory indication no
guidelines just a look off the stern you
can get a lot of different engines in a
new Malibu but they're all four
cylinders at this point there's a two
and a half litre for kind of the
bread-and-butter a 2-liter turbo for the
hotrod motor and a 2.4 liter lean-burn
hybrid power drink we have the
mainstream guy a biggish two and a half
liter for all the engines have direct
injection you're looking at 197
horsepower here 191 foot-pounds of
torque
pretty big numbers from a pretty big 4 0
to 60 though is also a pretty big number
unfortunately about eight point three
seconds mpg 22:34 sidesaddle front-wheel
drive only that six-speed automatic is
your only gearbox choice let's go for a
ride
like so many cars in the class of this
guy Accord Camry and others in different
driving is sort of the theme here let me
put it another way there's a very loose
relationship between the engine the
gearbox and what the pedal on the right
is doing these are not performance cars
in this category of vehicles they're
utilitarian they're grocery getters
they've got smooth rides but the basic
idea here is that this car is meant to
have few surprises and it's driving
transitions and that's what it delivers
on the downside if you're getting into
this car because you like to drive
you're going to be disappointed at least
in this one LTZ trim I don't even have
much to say about its steering and
cornering because the powertrain doesn't
beg you to even try that another bit of
a gripe I've got here that also adds to
the lack of responsiveness is as I
showed you no shift paddles on the wheel
which are kind of becoming standard
these days and to get shift ability
you've got to put the gearbox lever back
in em then you can use this little
fiddly toggle on the top to change gears
that's dainty not involved a lot of
folks ask you know how's the build
quality on a Chevy product it's real
good there's nothing about this car that
doesn't fit beautifully that doesn't
appear to be bolted down real strong
real well overall this is a great little
highway car a wonderful little grocery
getter but you're not gonna be very
involved in driving it it's a little
appliance like
let's price this 2013 Malibu we've got a
1 LTZ there's also a 2 LTZ that has a
2-liter turbo different car different
video 1 LTZ which is pretty high trim
starts at about 28 6 for this guy now
1,900 bucks for the electronics and
entertainment package that gets you
premium pioneer audio backup camera as
basic as it is and garage door opener
seems a little steep to me but I'd
rather do that to have some local shop
tear apart my audio system to upgrade it
795 is a great price to add onboard
navigation not rely on that OnStar stuff
and 395 is a steal for forward collision
alert and lane departure warning all in
you're looking at about a $32,000 car
that competes pretty well with Fusion
camry an accord</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
