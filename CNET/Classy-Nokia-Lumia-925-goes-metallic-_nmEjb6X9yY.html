Phone to date I'm Jessica doll court for
CNN this is your first look at the Nokia
Lumia 925 this is a global flagship
phone in the u.s. it comes to t-mobile
with 4G LTE one of the most interesting
things about this device that with it
nokia returns to metal there's an
aluminum frame around the outside it's
really lovely looking it's encased in an
aluminum frame the fit and finish is
really nice and tight there aren't a lot
of air gaps build quality is very good
still it isn't quite as sexy as the HTC
One but it is still pretty nice one
thing that makes it just a smidge less
premium is the polycarbonate backing
this is the material that Nokia usually
makes its Lumia line from this Lumia
here is much much slimmer than the other
Lumia siblings it feels a little bit
wide in the hand there's no real curve
in the back so it doesn't fit quite as
snugly also the buttons protrude a
little bit some people might find that
it pokes into their hands I personally
like it because it means that the
buttons are a little bit easier to press
the rest of the specs on this phone are
pretty much like the other Lumias it's
got a 4.5 inch super sensitive display
that means that you can wear gloves or
use your fingernails to navigate it it's
also a little bit glare resistant so
that when you take it outside outdoor
legibility should be pumped up a little
bit the camera is kind of a big deal on
this phone it's an eight point seven
megapixel camera like all the other
Lumias using carl zeiss optics what's
different about this one though is that
it's got a six element lens instead of a
five-element lens that's supposed to
increase some of the clarity and
brightness in outdoor shots there's also
a dual LED flash here and that comes in
handy especially with low light shots
it's used for focusing their nokia has
done a really bang-up job with the
low-light photography and that does not
change in this phone it's really
excellent you also have 1080p HD video
that comes with this video quality is
nice and smooth on the front you have a
1.2 megapixel camera with 720p HD video
capability on the inside there's the
same 1.5 gigahertz dual-core Qualcomm
Snapdragon s4 processor that you find in
the other Lumia so it's pretty fast
Nokia also outfits this phone and others
with its own suite of apps to bump up
the windows phone 8 experience for
example you'll find Nokia Music and
Nokia drive this is a really nice
high-end Lumia phone I really like it
overall one thing though is the timing
is a little bit unfortunate because AT&amp;amp;T
is exclusive of the Nokia Lumia 1020 is
looming and that one has a 41 megapixel
camera it will be much more expensive
than this device though t-mobile will
sell this for fifty dollars down and
about five hundred thirty dollars all in
after the payments but this is a
no-contract phone price is pretty
reasonable one tiny downside for this
device is that t-mobile's version only
has 16 gigabytes of storage instead of
32 as you'll find in some other regions
however Microsoft does add seven
gigabytes of free on line skydrive
storage so people who really download a
ton of videos and games you might want
to think twice for the most part 16
should be enough so that's been your
first look at the Nokia Lumia 925 for
tmobile the cnet I'm Jessica doll court
