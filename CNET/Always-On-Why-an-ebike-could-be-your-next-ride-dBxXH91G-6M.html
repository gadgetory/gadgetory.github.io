in the world might come as a surprise to
you it's a bike electric bikes are a hot
new cycling trend you get the benefit of
a little motor helping you up hills but
all the traffic free health benefits of
riding a bike this is amazing I can try
to keep up with us but we have a little
extra power
not all ebikes are created equal but
they all share similar tech each has a
motor a battery and a control system the
two main types of ebikes are pedal
assist which provides an electric boost
to your own pedaling and power on demand
which operates via a twist throttle kind
of like a moped most are designed to go
about 20 miles per hour and a good one
can last 60 to 70 miles on a single
charge at San francisco-based Faraday
they've created the Porter which is a
pedal assist bike the Faraday porteur
cost $3500 it has a 250 watt motor and a
195 watt hour battery it has a range of
15 to 20 miles with full pedal assist
riding and it weighs 39 pounds it's
effortless right it just feels like
you're riding a bike but if you decide
you want that assist right you can
switch it on into kind of a normal mode
right there and without ado basic is
measure how are you working and match
that and that's pretty awesome go cruise
along kind of a flat street like this at
17 18 miles
one of the really cool things you can
turn it off completely and ride it like
a regular bike wow I feel like I can't
ship fast enough to keep up with it
almost wow I feel like that girl I feel
like Mary Tyler Moore on this bike it's
totally noticeable when it kicks on Oh
like there's that one two pedals where
you think oh I'm riding a bike and then
it's there and then the cool thing is it
just it just goes faster the faster you
go
yeah the faster it wants to go I know Oh
full power full power boost mode this
bikes so fun there are dozens of e bike
manufacturers making bikes for millions
of riders all over the world from grace
to biruni to hero eco and the bikes
range from elegant cruisers to this
all-terrain monster called the stealth
bomber the stealth bomber costs ten to
fourteen thousand dollars depending on
the options the motor is 4500 watts the
battery is a whopping 1500 watt hours
and the range is 40 miles on a single
charge it weighs a surprising 116 pounds
tell me about the stealth bomber what is
this in a nutshell the self bomber is a
kind of a hybrid between a motorcycle
and our traditional bicycle what makes
it more bicycle like because it has a
nine speed sequential gearbox and what
that does it basically gives you the
ability to pedal it like a normal bike
in Gears 1 &amp;amp; 2 we're in the gear 9 the
top highest gear the hardest gear to
pedal you can still pedal faster than
the motor can go so in all the way from
0 to 45 55 miles an hour you as a rider
are still pedaling the bike unlike a
motorcycle where you're just basically
along for the ride alright but I want to
see you tear it up on this ok I'll do my
best
of course most people are not going to
be riding the stealth-bomber if you're
like me you just want to know if ebikes
can handle the hills we visited the new
wheel which is an e-bike only shop in
one of San Francisco's Hill iasts
neighborhoods they told me they have the
perfect bike for going up one of the
steepest hills around the german-made
kalkhoff
the kalkhoff tasman tour c8 premium
costs thirty three hundred ninety nine
dollars the motor is 250 watts and the
battery is 396 watt hours its range is
forty to seventy miles and it weighs 55
pounds so it senses how hard you're
pedaling which i've heard before but it
doesn't more than that it does more it
also takes into account the cadence of
your pedaling and the speed of the bike
so that it has a more complete picture
of how you're riding and so you turn it
on there and then you set a power level
from low to high but you can set it all
the way to no assist with no light Iko
which is very very low and then power
which is gonna take you up absolutely
anything quickly I can't lie I really
like the sound of absolutely anything so
I'm gonna start by attempting to ride a
little way up this hill on a regular
bike with no assistance just for you
know purposes in comparison in pain see
how far I get okay I'm on the lowest
gear okay okay here I go this is gonna
be no problem I can do it I can do it
I can do it I can do it I just oh my god
oh ah yep that hurt okay I'm ready for
electric now that we've painfully
determined that is not a good idea to
try that hill on a regular bike let's
try it on an electric bike you'll pardon
me if I'm slightly skeptical but I'm
willing to give it a go because I have
assurances that this bike can handle any
Hill even this one go
oh it's helping it's helping already oh
I feel it helping you know what they say
when you fall off you're right back on
oh my god it's totally helping this is
amazing
whoa you guys I owned this hill
this bike is awesome seeing this is how
you sell electric bikes in San Francisco
oh-ee bikes are a technology that Europe
has enthusiastically adopted as an
eco-friendly alternative to cars I can
only hope the US will catch up in the
future</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
