the apple pie for everything good at bad
inside the world of Apple it's a pretty
quiet news weekend I mean quiet when the
biggest apple related story this week
involves Apple's international online
stores selling sharps 32 inch 4k HD LED
monitor on their website a little hint
at the display Apple will be offering to
pair with its new Mac Pro until they
release one of their own now you can buy
the sharp 4k display at other retailers
right now but it only became a bigger
story after later on Apple removed the
listing like I told you it's been a
quiet week and we're still expecting to
see the new Mac Pro sometime around the
16th of December now in Apple TV news
the big a adds another set of channels
to its set-top box including watch ABC
that allows subscribers to some cable
services to watch content from their
local ABC affiliate through Apple TV now
this is awesome so I can make sure I
never miss an episode of scandal like
it's so crazy how Olivia and the
president they're like you want me and
me well like I've heard it's a really
good show uh yeah there are no dues yeah
I know I know that Mitch alright other
additions to the apple TV include
financial network Bloomberg Sony's
streaming movie and TV app crackle and
the Korean channel kor TV which i can
confirm does not place I videos in a bun
gotten them stock all right let's talk
about some of the things Apple might be
working on in the future after the US
Patent and Trademark Office published a
newly granted apple patent for a goggle
like video headset that allows someone
to view media on the go with a larger
immersive view compared to their mobile
devices screen now the patent also
allows for the possibility of 3d viewing
now it was originally filed in May 2008
but we've seen products like Sony's own
personal 3d viewer or the oculus rift
virtual reality headset on the market
and I can't guess why they haven't taken
off yet I mean it looks so cool to wear
and show off to your friends that you're
cool too now a cool pad that's also been
granted to Apple involves facial
recognition tech
to control a device like an iPhone or an
iMac what makes it unique is that the
face detection would pair that with a
known user and then make certain
functions or apps or access to
information on that device available
based on the user it detects and another
pan that we might not see implemented
anytime soon is for a unique curved
touch sensor now most touch sensor
panels like screens are flat and they're
difficult to produce because of their
thinness well this patent details a
curve sensor that would benefit from the
increased strength and enhance viewing
properties without warping the surface
now it doesn't mean we're seeing a
curved iphone yet but if they want to
take on the galaxy round or the LG G
flex they absolutely could all right
let's check out the quick bites in if
you're on a Southwest Airlines flight in
you can't live without messaging they're
offering the ability to send and receive
I messages for two bucks per day they
already have an eight dollar per device
in flight Wi-Fi plan for all access but
I can't stand not being able to I
message during a one-hour flight to LA
it's unbearable all right Spotify fans
will like the latest announcement that
you can now use their app on iOS and
Android mobile devices for free before
you had to pay ten dollars a month for
access the only restriction now is that
you'll have to shuffle who've the songs
on your playlist you create and you
can't listen to them in the order you
arrange them and here we go to fun
stories have you ever wanted to control
your dog with your iPhone or iPad well
that's the question pet remote is
answering with its vibrating one point
seven inch tag that attaches to your
dog's collar all you do is select a
command on your iPhone app and then it
sends a vibration that your dog will
associate to either sit go down or come
here and pop secret you know the popcorn
company might have created the
best-smelling iOS app of all-time with
pop topia after they created the pop
dongle to work with its game now what
you do is you plug it into the audio
port of your iOS device and it emits a
popcorn smell as you play the game each
dongle contains 500 to 1000 sprays but
it won't come cheap the only way you
guys can get it right now is through
ebay and this pop dongle is selling for
100
sixty bucks right now so yeah those two
stories made my day alright that's going
to do it for this week's show send me
your questions to the apple byte at cnet
com or tweet me at brian Tong we're
going to do a little ask me anything
episode for the holiday break and we'll
feature your questions on that show in
you know maybe I'll have some giveaways
for you too alright i'm brian Tong
thanks for watching and we'll see you
guys next time for another bite of the
Apple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
