and we're gonna take a look at the Sony
STR DN 1030 this is a 7.2 AV receiver
and it's selling for five hundred
dollars from the front this looks like a
pretty standard AV receiver it's not
quite as sleek looking as Denon and
Moranis models and the front panel has a
few more buttons and knobs that are
really needed the remote is also kind of
a mess with too many buttons and many of
those buttons have multiple functions
activated by a shift key it's all
confusing and really unnecessary
especially compared to Denon's much
simpler remote that gets the job done
just as well flip around to the back and
you'll see what makes the STR DN 1030
really stand out you almost never see in
antennae on the back of a receiver but
the sony has one because it has built-in
Wi-Fi and built-in Bluetooth that's not
something you're gonna find on any other
receiver in this price range
although Akio at least offers an
inexpensive dongle to add Wi-Fi
functionality there's also an Ethernet
port on the back and all these
networking features allow the Sony to
support a variety of features including
built-in airplay DLNA Pandora Slacker
and Sony Music Unlimited airplay works
great but the rest of the services are a
little hamstrung by Sony's really basic
user interface that's cramped in the
center of the screen and only offers a
few lines of text luckily you usually
won't see the user interface on a
receiver that frequently
especially if you're going to use your
phone or tablet to listen to music
through airplay or bluetooth but it's
still disappointing that it looks so out
of date the rest of the back panel is
adequate but not quite as good as some
competing receivers there are five HDMI
inputs three digital audio inputs plus
quite a few analog ports for your older
gear that should be enough to cover most
home theaters although you can get a lot
more flexibility from ochio's TX and our
six one six which offers eight HDMI
inputs for just four hundred and ten
dollars we had seen its resident golden
ear steve guttenberg take a listen to
the sony and he found sound quality to
be surprisingly good especially since
sony has been lagging in previous years
it sounded great with dynamic action
scenes from movies and also really
natural with music from both blue
Ray's and CDs we had it compared
directly to last year sound quality
champ the Denon AVR 1912 and the two
receivers were pretty much neck and neck
so altogether the sony is really an
excellent value at $500 especially since
it's the only model with built-in Wi-Fi
and Bluetooth on Chios txn are 616 is a
slightly better value overall but the
sony is a very close second and it's
also a sleeker option since so much of
his functionality is built into the
receiver I'm Matthew Muscovy ak and this
is the Sony STR DN 1030</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
