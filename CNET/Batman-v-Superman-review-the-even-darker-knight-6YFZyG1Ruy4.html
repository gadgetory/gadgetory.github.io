cinematic clash of the decade or at
least until captain america civil war
comes out with me is rich Trenholm hello
we've both seen the new movie and we're
going to find out what rich thinks as
our resident movie critic rich batman vs
superman is yeah biggest superhero clash
does it deliver on that cinematic
spectacle yes and no in terms of like
sheer scale yeah absolutely yeah it's a
huge movie with loads going on there's
hugely cinematic battles and set pieces
and the conflicts are likely between
these towering godlike characters
whether it hangs together as I can hear
and whole is another as a lot of matter
there's so much stuff going on in there
and there's even so much set up for
future movies that it's a bit of it it's
a bit of a mess it's a glorious mess but
it's a bit of a mess now this is the
first time that we've seen this
incarnation of Batman's jump played by
Ben Affleck how does Ben do and what do
we think of this Batman I really like
batfleck actually yeah I think he does
really well and one of the things that I
kind of came out afterwards and I
realized that I hadn't thought about the
Dark Knight movies all the way through
so it because it's so visually visually
distinctive and Ben Affleck does such a
good job of selling the kind of jaded
cynical world-weary older Bruce Wayne so
this is a very positive first outing for
Ben Affleck straight out the gate that
said this is not the Batman of your
childhood it's a very very dark take on
the character okay so that's interesting
is this I mean this obviously
superheroes enjoyed by all ages is this
something that you should take kids to
no no it's it's it's a very very violent
movie and not just that but it's like
really unremittingly unrelentingly bleak
like superman and batman these
characters who have been sort of fantasy
figures that have the you know delighted
and inspired kids for foot for like the
best part of a century they're presented
as these very very kind of brooding
conflicted troubles and very scary
characters and they only live in a very
scary world where random pointless awful
horrible mass destruction can happen at
any time so it's a it's it's yet it's
it's a very very few want to tell your
kids that you know bad
things happen to good people then just
let Zack Snyder envelop let's take care
of it for you thanks guys are doing all
that parents exactly so obviously this
film is going to be compared a lot to
the Avengers yet Marvel's Avengers is
that a fair comparison what do you think
I think the problem that they have is
that while Marvel took five movies to
get to the Avengers to have a bunch of
superheroes all in together in a shared
universe DC's had to really race to get
all these characters in this so there's
so many co new faces and it does assume
a lot of knowledge actually when you see
all these random people popping in who
are actually relevant to the main story
I really enjoyed it as a sort of as an
adult comics fan but I don't know if
they've got that just the same kind of
joy the Marvel movies have is it too
much to ask for a bit of escapism with
our capes eskape ism if you will it's
pretty good all right well that's what
rich thoughts but let us know what you
think as well guys if you've seen it
drop us a note although keep spoilers
out of the comments come on don't be
that guy alright thanks very much stay
tuned to see now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
