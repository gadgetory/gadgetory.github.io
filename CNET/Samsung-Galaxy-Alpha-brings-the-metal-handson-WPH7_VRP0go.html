for samsung to make a metal smartphone
and here it is it's called the Galaxy
alpha let's check it out let's start
with the design but first a little bit
of bad news this phone isn't metal all
over in fact it's only this band around
the edge that's made of metal the rest
is the usual flexible plastic that
Samsung normally relies on I have to say
though that doesn't feel too
disappointing when you're actually
holding the Alpha yes the back is
plastic but those metal sides really do
make a difference it feels a lot
sturdier to me it seemed classier
elsewhere this is a 4.7 inch screen
that's smaller than a lot of samsung
phone so a good option if you want
something a bit more pocketable it has a
resolution of 1280 by 720 pixels that's
not super high but because the screen is
a bit smaller it's not such a problem
and actually looking at it you'd be
hard-pressed to pick out individual
pixels I think there are a couple of
other nice Samsung goodies on board for
example the front has a fingerprint
scanner for unlocking the phone and on
the back there's a heart rate sensor to
keep track of your health also on the
back is a 12 megapixel camera while
inside this thing is running on android
4.4 also known as kit kat so the
hardware isn't as high flying as some of
Samsung's other phones like the galaxy
s5 but I do like the design and if
you're looking for something that's a
bit smaller and made of metal this could
be a good choice do you prefer metal or
plastic let me know and check out cnet
com / ether for much more
