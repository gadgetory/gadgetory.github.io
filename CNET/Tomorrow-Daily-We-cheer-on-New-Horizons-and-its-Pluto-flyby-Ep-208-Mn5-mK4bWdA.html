and we flew really close to Pluto no big
deal an amazon prime day is tomorrow and
it's better than Christmas get out your
wallets tomorrow daily
greetings citizens of the internet
welcome to tomorrow daily the best ski
talk show in the known universe I'm
Ashley sceva that's kill anonymous and
you're here with us so welcome welcome
to you my friends um hello we said get
out your wallets because we just want
you to give your money to us to keep it
safe before amazon prime day obviously
we're like a like a safety bank like a
piggy bank just please don't break this
open let's hit the headlines alright so
today let's yeah i think so i decided to
go um it got I just felt like maybe I
made it awkward uh let's talk about
Pluto not the did not the beloved
beloved disney character but the but the
ex planet the ex planet now dwarf planet
yeah this is big news huge news this is
amazing so New Horizons is a mission
that has been going on since 2006 and it
has been almost ten years and it finally
completed its closest approach to Pluto
and we got the first high-res images of
the plant of the dwarf planet that we
have ever ever seen it took over three
billion miles it past Pluto this morning
at about four about 450 in the morning
pacific time and passed it going 30,000
miles per hour so it was a flyin past um
scientists are really really excited
because this means we are already seeing
images from Pluto from New Horizons and
like we've already learned so much about
the planet we know how big it is now we
didn't really know before before we had
some really kind of iffy images from the
Hubble telescope that were really blurry
so in fact i saw this gif on the
internet today and thought it was so so
cool I think we have a screencap of it
so check this out this is what we had
before as an image of Pluto that was the
only thing we knew about Pluto and this
is what we have now like what a
difference that makes like that's an
actual picture of Pluto 3 billion miles
away I can't believe that's all we had
that's all we had before that's all we
knew about if I take out my contacts
what I see yeah exactly exactly then I
put him in a nice either venues
do this exactly it's like putting on a
fresh pair of glasses and so this is
pretty incredible so if that gift
doesn't sell it for you as to how
important this is for scientists
astrophysicists anybody who studies the
solar system and outer space in general
I mean I don't know what would so this
is a pretty incredible image so we
actually haven't seen the closest photo
it's going to take about 15 hours for
that to transmit back to earth so we're
going to see that a little bit later
tonight so if you if you're watching the
show usually we posted about four or
five o'clock so should be another few
hours before we see the closest approach
image that New Horizons snapped of Pluto
but high fives NASA yeah it's pretty
intense another fun fact that i read
online which I think you'll really enjoy
is that the the budget for this entire
mission costs about the same as the
creation and marketing budget of the
minions movie I mean that's how
everybody translates them yeah of course
compared to the minions movie we get
it's crazy and probably inflation too
right I mean this is just really amazing
what does NASA said they're gonna do
with this information besides just feel
like now we have a better understanding
of Pluto so they didn't really know any
of the geographical features on Pluto we
didn't really know anything about what
the surface looked like what the
atmosphere was like that's another thing
that they can study so I'm just to sort
of know exactly what's going on up there
uh a lot of people are saying oh maybe
Pluto will be a planet again but it
doesn't so far it doesn't look like that
although it is bigger than we thought it
was Pluto's bigger than we thought it
was which was one of the reasons but
amongst many that it was downgraded they
thought it was much smaller than
actually was but still smaller than our
own moon so it's not not quite not quite
planet e enough to maybe be upgrading
where's the new horizons thing go now
just flies off into the into the beyond
yeah it's just is gonna keep on hurtling
they're gonna keep getting images it'll
it's in the Kuiper you know the Kuiper
belt so it'll be it's out still kind of
a bummer I always feel bad for those
little guys I don't what if some super
vance alien race like picks it up and
turns it into a humanoid robot or
something I don't know it's always a
chance okay fine you're horrible I like
your hopefulness but i'm thinking Wally
just like God just gone forever um well
so so let's let me ask you this then
that's right this will be our hashtag of
the day hashtag TD fly by if New
Horizons if it could go anywhere in the
universe it's still hurtling out there
still going at 30,000 miles an hour if
it could take a picture of anything in
the universe for you and high def like
what we saw in that gift what would you
want it to take a picture of like a
candy planet like a planet just like
it's got you know candy canes and it
Snickers find out what chocolate water
and stuff like it's just like it's like
a candy but that would be a great
discovery like we're tired of fighting
ones where there's no air there's no
water and there's no life but let's just
adjust all candy I like it that's what I
want if and then what would we do would
like who would be excited like they
they're like this is our This Is It this
is where we're gonna live now Kane
planet let's go all of you Earthians get
on here hello would be on that show in a
heartbeat I'm not actually a big fan of
candy or sweet now you know just you
just want maybe just do a nice little
tourism flyby take couple pictures come
back I fish I like the visual the visual
aesthetic of candy and i think i think
it's it's a delight game candyland the
game i don't think a liner games
overrated like the best parts of that
really imparting it's super dangerous in
the back part why would you keep going
you're going to the castle what is even
there there's candy all the way you
don't need to go to the castle so that's
dumb and chutes and ladders is dumb too
hi ho cheerio now we're talking what do
you wear now to fly by us so I am gonna
pick something real but something that's
also pretty amazing in that it's a whole
planet made of diamond like there's that
planet out there I think it might be in
the kepler system that is a planet made
of diamond so I'd like to see what that
looks like in high def because it seems
like it would be pretty amazing to view
from space like would it be kind of like
a like a big giant prism look at the
kind of sparkly I'm sharing a giant
diamond know like a like a round where
it's like there's sort of a reflective
surface but not anything like you know
like a rough time in almost I just think
would be really cool to see what that
looks like because I i have no idea in
my mind about what that could even look
like like that seems crazy to me that
there's an entire planet out there just
that's made of diamonds that is pretty
cool pretty rad so I'd say yeah may or
may be so close maybe some of those neat
planets that they say like might be in
the Goldilocks zone for that might be
habitable like I'd like see some HD of
that
yeah I would it be amazing if they're
just dinosaurs just roaming on there
just Rando dinosaurs and then everyone's
like oh my god you guys although this is
crazy that's the planet killin head too
yeah but I wouldn't I wouldn't survive
very long cuz I would try and pet a
doctor in a second I saw it anyway so
there you go teasin fly by yeah TV fly
back moving on to something that I'm
very excited about and so is Ashley and
so is producer Logan okay so that is
prime day it is the 20th anniversary of
website amazoncom were of course can't
believe it have what what I can't
believe it 20 years 20 years of the
website amazon.com where you can go on
there and basically buy anything great
stuff but they decided they're going to
destroy black friday which is a huge
deal in the States it's called prime day
and it's going on for 24 hours so if you
have a prime account on there you'll be
able to get all kinds of crazy deals
with yet we have some here's some but
not by any long shot all I've got a 40
inch LED TV for 150 doll $115 which is
great 32 inch smart TV for under two
hundred dollars fifty percent off nikon
cameras rumbas for under three hundred
dollars and bose headphones at
quote-unquote their lowest price ever on
amazon well as seen that has a big
listing i'm sure there's going to be
more and i guess you can just check Cena
tomorrow for more update but there you
go i was gonna be some good video game
deals as well i think i was looking on
gamespot today and they've had some
stuff up like that they were assuming
would be happening at some point so i
thinkin like a lot of sites are gonna
have like you know what deals are when
if they could get them in advance so you
can always check seen it or you know
anywhere else if you're kind of looking
to look at a time something cuz
obviously a lot of these deals are
probably they're really good like they
say they are going to be which who knows
um they'll go out they'll sell out
pretty quick well they kept saying
better than Black Friday which is a very
bold statement that is very bold that's
very gold um for anybody who doesn't
have a prime membership you can cheat
the system a little bit i'm gonna tell
you how sign up for a free 30-day prime
membership tonight and just have your
credit card ready like have all your
info ready so that you can buy stuff but
you get a free 30-day prime membership
so you can take part in the sale and
then you can leave if you want yeah
there you go again and then you get your
free two-day shipping and everything you
heard it here first folks Ashley's
trying to cheat amazon
yeah make sure tweet them so they know
that to come out I've seen many people
talk about that little it's just a work
round is all all right I want to tell
you about you down you know Abby you
don't be associated with me you're gonna
want to be associated with me right now
though because I want to tell you about
this story and you i know you like Lego
and we both love when people can make
the lives of kids who have lost limbs
better yeah those are always the best
this is a marriage of both those things
so this guy who's a Colombian designers
in Carlos Torres he decided one day he
wanted to help kids with missing limbs
express their creativity through their
prosthetics and so he came up with this
program called the ICAO creative
prosthetic system which is this
artificial limb that kids can swap
pieces on they can swap out whatever
they want they can build whatever they
want with Legos it's amazing and so um
so he thinks that adding a play element
to kids prosthetic can really help them
in rehab like when they're
rehabilitating and learning how to use
their prosthetic limb and so um and also
get them a little bit more excited about
what's obviously a very life-changing
event like if you if you either were
born without a limb and get a new one or
if you lose a limb and then have to
learn how to use a prosthetic that's
still life changing any way you slice it
this is a big deal this is how it works
there's there's this sort of main unit
and then it has a sort of snap on you
twist on the top you can put on these
like attachments and everything and so
they have like I said robot gripping
hands but then they also have lego stuff
which is so cool so Lego got involved in
this he actually this guy traveled to
Denmark to Legos like very top secret
research and development labs and was
able to pick their brains and sort of
ask them okay like how can I sort of
make this work like what do you think
like let's work with the design and so
he worked with Lego designers and
researchers to kind of come up with this
concept and so we have a video of him
and this kid trying on an actual arm and
like having all these different things
and the prototype has a battery a
charging port a processor my electric
sensors and then a whole bunch of Lego
compatible spots to build on and so he
says he wants to make a commercial
product and he hopes that it might be
available late next year
early in 2017 it's fantastic just pretty
amazing yeah I good trying it out is
like just blown away well not only are
they learning to use a prosthetic but
there's using creativity and the fact
that Lego is actually involved means
it'll actually have it'll be more than
just an idea that's fantastic yeah and
this is great so um so keep an eye out
for that because I just think this is
one of the most fantastic things I've
ever seen in terms of prosthetics and
especially kids I mean we saw the one
guy who does the hero once with the Iron
Man yeah which is really neat and then
now these are sort of also fun in that
way where they can you know also play as
well as sort of use them for utility
which is what they would need them for
but you know with kids it's like why not
just give them a chance to be to have a
little fun you know you know I every
time we have on these stories I'm like
this can would be like a huge hit at a
bar because lovely girls like what are
you doing for them you're like I build
oh I I help kids get rehabilitated but I
also create this Lego things so it
builds your imagination I really believe
that they help use the prosthetics by
it's just like here's my number here's
my number nobody right now is such a
human sayers like oh my god how do you
compete with that yeah I goanna everyone
in the bar hates that guy I host like a
science lesson show and they're just
like I talk about that guy that's good I
talking about IM on my show sorry all
right guys we're gonna take a quick
break we'll be right back it's Tuesday
we have to talk about new releases some
great movies coming out this week and
then of course we have your user
feedback and our photogra for the day
still click away it's tomorrow daily
sky got to be the answer
welcome back to the show right before
the break we saw a really cool recut of
the ant-man trailer to make it look like
a 1950s b-movie what am i cool one of my
favorite things on the internet last
week I was dying to show it because it's
time for new releases
scale of one to ten how excited are you
for ant-man seven which is exactly the
score is getting on rotten tomatoes
seventy-five percent uh ant-man's coming
out this week a man I love Paul Rudd
yeah I'm sure I love Paul Rudd too but
this doesn't look like a like he has a
lot of elbow room to be Paul Rudd know
it seems like he's maybe a little more
confined to the Marvel Cinematic
Universe Cinematic Universe here um it
does look fun i will say that looks fun
and and i do think that if you go and
see this you'll have a good time but I
they were saying that this could be this
could be the very first Marvel movie to
come in second at the box office because
they've never had a not number one on
opening weekend and it might cut might
come in second to if minions keeps
holding on strong this weekend might
come in second yeah which would be crazy
big but ballroom it's pretty good I mean
I I would be I'm excited to see it i
love these sort of little like gag you
know ideas of that you know like all the
little train said it looks so intense up
close you know with ant-man but then
it's like it's just a train set falling
over in real life yeah i mean the
original ant-man Hank Pym is a really
interesting character but this isn't
Hank Pym you think you told me at one
point like kill kill educates me about
comic books then we started the
adventures like he was the one who sort
of started yeah more or less I mean
there's there's like different things
but yeah but he's one of tho i'd like
started the amine he was in the avengers
for sure yeah so I'm well you know they
got her face too and he's probably gonna
there's apparently too cool after credit
scenes that are apparently the best in
all of the Cinematic Universe so forth
that's pretty cool I already have my
theory as to what it's gonna be but also
ant-man is probably me join The Avengers
so of course there you go yeah I want to
see this next one though I'm gonna that
I think it's gonna be I'm gonna see two
movies this weekend the theater and it's
definitely this one the ambit is Emily
this train wreck which is coming out
this weekend it's an Amy Schumer movie I
think it's her first major like feature
film she stars in it I wrote it she were
so funny okay Amy Schumer is hilarious
to me she is in this movie somebody who
can not get her life together she's a
total mess hence the you train wreck
title and her and Bill Hader
it's like a rock kind of a rom-com but I
would say like a very subversive rom-com
and apparently it's very good all three
of these movies are tracking pretty well
on on rotten tomatoes this one I think
was like ninety one-percent as of right
now like I think I saw this morning was
like over ninety percent so looks pretty
good people are getting it good reviews
is getting good notices so I think I
think I'm into it i think i want to see
this for sure because i love Amy Schumer
she's one of my favorite comedians
happening right now um jogo know you and
then and then lastly um movie Ida hasn't
really gotten a whole lot of I guess
like promotion mr. Holmes is coming out
this weekend get has a ninety-four
percent on rotten tomatoes right now uh
it's everybody's favorite everything
ever face of butterfield um maybe oh I
don't know oh no it's it's a McKellen oh
ya makan yeah everybody's fair at
Gandalf uh it got all the all the great
things magneto come on like everybody's
favorite he plays sherlock holmes and
it's like there's a mystery is it's
supposed to be really really good but
I'd literally have seen like one
advertisement for this in the last six
months I just don't care about Sherlock
Holmes anymore you just over it oh my
god been a million movies and like I
like the TV series I love the TV series
people we don't need a million of these
things going at the same time I like
this kind of old Sherlock Holmes though
there's no Watson I think he talks about
like how there's no Watson any more like
he went away or something like that I
don't know it seems interesting if
you're into that sort of move your legal
alternative programming could be an
option for you but it's tracking very
well I don't know so we're tracking very
well and I the audience how do the
audience's split on this because these
are all for three different audiences
variables and then you have minions so I
may be still yes I think minions kids uh
ant-man like the nerdy pop culture
people or pop culture fans yeah then
train wreck any of the people that
aren't into the nerdy pop culture
rom-com and like and like to be
realistic women women yeah rom-com fans
that Holmes nobody old people nope
nobody old people
no you know who's gonna see that movie
sir patrick stewart cuz they're best
friends oh that's right it's gonna see
it okay night it's just her it's only a
job wait that was terrible alright
anyway we're moving on to our very last
piece of I don't know whatever the next
thing is gets user feedback really glad
I just really wanted out of that ferret
out of my like how vs all right
yesterday we asked you guys use hashtag
TD lux tell us what you'd want your car
to generate for you you guys came up
with some really good ones way better
than ours my most compliments and yours
is what mine was I would come up with oh
yeah you get like travel miles yeah
dragon lots of drugs so what Miles okay
Oliver wrote in and said comic-con
trailers are ice cream like ice cream
ice cream just generate calm like how
those things are kind of the same thing
to you let's go into baskin-robbins get
a count on to Dustin and Rhoda and said
I would have my car clean up pollution
everywhere I go to make positive impact
on the environment like that a pollution
eater because his name is dust man sure
why not know his name was dust me I know
is a little ironic a little bit of irony
Gail wrote in and said make the car
generate puppy and kitten videos that'll
give you that that that grew feeling I
don't know what has give me that maybe I
was a new new feeling it worked great
feeling great feeling sure let's say
group Rick read and said the car would
have a removable battery i would use the
saved energy as a battery for my home
electronics like TV pc xbox that's
that's where like that one's good Andrew
Ronan said I'd have my car produced more
fuel so it would be a perpetual motion
machine Andrew do you understand how
this works too hmm it's like kind of
like printing money but no we keep going
forever so it would they'd have to go
and create gas which it would then use
and then I just keep okay I don't know
how cars work so you're probably right
you're probably right Mitchell wrote and
said I would want it to generate organic
metals so when google's project ara
comes mine is obsolete like that jeweler
like everyone's creating like additional
thing additional things James wrote in a
via email said I think it'd be
interesting at the car generated an
electrochemical reaction that repairs
the Earth's atmosphere everyone's talked
about how vehicle emissions are
destroying the atmosphere with this
reaction you're truly being good for the
environment
going to be healing the earth one mile
at a time you even thought of a tagline
yeah he's already yours I'm sold so I
get healing the earth right but then
you'd be like a you be like a bad human
being if you didn't drive around all the
time they'd be like you cheated outside
driving healing the world listen go why
don't you go heal the world okay getting
your car go he'll something but it's
kind of like the one with that dust man
said I have my car clean clean the
pollution so it's kind of a similar
thing like that okay guys it's time for
our very last piece of user feedback
which is our photog refer of the day
Richie wrote in to us and said hi shut
this today around Hamburg Germany it's
