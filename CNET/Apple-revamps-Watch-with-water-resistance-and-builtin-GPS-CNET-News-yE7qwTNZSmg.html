has been completely re-engineered and it
starts with a feature that will change
how you use Apple watch the first Apple
watch was splash proof an Apple watch
series - is swim proof so you can wear
it whether you're swimming or surfing or
just doing that occasional cannonball
you can keep it on it's rated what a
resistant 50 meters which is the
industry standard for a swim watch but
what that means is the watch needs to
withstand the pressure the water
pressure equivalent of being at a depth
of 50 meters and that's pretty deep and
it's especially challenging for a
SmartWatch because there are so many
ingress points so our engineers have
been hard at work developing new seals
and adhesives and they've been able to
close all those entry points except one
the speaker you see a speaker needs air
to produce sound and if the air can get
in soak in the water and that's a
problem
so for series 2 we redesign the speaker
system and at the end of your workout we
use the speaker itself to eject the
water we've added built in GPS and with
Apple watch you can literally hit start
and begin your workout and during your
workout you'll get GPS accurate pace and
distance and at the end of your workout
and the activity off of your phone there
will be a route map color-coded to show
your varying speeds and developers can
take advantage of the built-in GPS and
like to give you an example of that I'd
like to invite to the stage Anna Kettner
lead designer for view Ranger I'm here
today to show you the Ranger the
first-ever hiking up on the new Apple
watch we
gives you the ability to enjoy a hike
like you never had before I've got the
popular Half Dome cables on here and 14
miles it's probably a bit too intense
this morning so let's take a look at the
four mile trail to Glacia point this
looks like it won't take me quite so
long and with that elevation gain it's
sure to still be a great workout so
let's get going here I can see my
directions and I can also scroll through
to see all of the exciting views and
destinations I have coming up at any
time I can swipe right to check in on
the map I can see my current location
and my route progress in fact any time
if I stray too far from the path B range
will let me know about it this really
wasn't possible before but now that
Apple watch has integrated GPS new agent
can look out to make sure I don't stray
too far off route that's the Ranger the
first-ever hiking up to take advantage
of GPS on the new Apple watch and we're
really excited for you guys to try out
on your next hike thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
