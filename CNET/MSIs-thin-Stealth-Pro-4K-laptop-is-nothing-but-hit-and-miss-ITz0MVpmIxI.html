the MSI stealth pro 4k comes in at about
half the price of our favorite slim
17-inch gamer the razor blade pro but
it's lower prices understood when you
look closely you do get some nice
features like the 4k matte screen with a
hundred percent Adobe RGB color space a
comfortable responsive keyboard with
three adjustable color zones many many
ports including a couple video outputs
separate mic and headphone jacks and a
Thunderbolt three USB type-c port Emma
sighs dragon Center software helps you
do things from fine-tuning the display
and monitoring performance to the
keyboard lighting and creating key
macros it's a fairly powerful gaming
system too with an Intel Core i7 7700 HQ
processor and NVIDIA GTX 1060 graphics
it's enough for VR but oddly it's not
quite enough for 4k gaming with detail
settings cranked up so you might find
yourself picking between high resolution
or high details also at three-and-a-half
hours battery life on our streaming
video test you shouldn't plan on being
too far from an outlet for too long when
not gaming the 4k screen comes in handy
for photo editing and you can enjoy 4k
content or just really tiny icons and
text anyway did I mention the body is a
bit flimsy for the money with flex in
the body and screen and because it's so
thin the fans really blow when taxing
the laptop and the lackluster speakers
are ok for games but music sounds thin
no matter how much you play with its
audio utility so basically it's not
perfect and a little more than 2 grand
it seems you're paying extra for the
thin chassis in the 4k screen which is
fine if that's what you need
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
