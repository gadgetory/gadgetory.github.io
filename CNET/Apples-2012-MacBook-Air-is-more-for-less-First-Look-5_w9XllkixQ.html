13 inch macbook air now while this may
not be as cool is that 15 inch Retina
Display MacBook Pro this is probably
going to be the macbook you're going to
want to buy at a starting price of 1199
it's a thousand dollars less expensive
than that big fancy macbook pro and the
feature set and size are a lot more
portable a little under three pounds
like always and some faster performance
as well as better battery life although
overall this is not really a huge jump
up from what we saw last year there are
improvements and when you're dealing
with that price drop it makes it a
better purchase over all the other
differences here are really under the
hood nothing that you can see USB 3.1
stead of USB 2.0 hard definition webcam
on top and you know it's still missing
Ethernet you have an SD card slot as
before you got the backlit keyboard and
not really much else that's new so maybe
you feel like it's not a tremendous
surprise in the laptop you don't have
any options for storage other than SSD
for instance although you can upgrade
that now to 512 gigabytes of storage but
for a lofty five hundred dollars more
than you'd be paying for the top-end
model they keep in mind the RAM is fused
so you may want to upgrade that at point
of purchase for a lot of people they're
going to want that larger screen and
maybe the SD card slot and the better
battery life this tested out at about
seven and a half hours on our test which
is pretty spectacular it's going to last
you a good long time for just about
anything they want to put it through did
I say there were no changes to the
appearance of this macbook air there is
one small one it's this AC adapter
connector here magsafe 2 which replaces
last year's magsafe there's a new
connector cord that comes with your
macbook air it's a little more jutting
out here and it's a wider connector that
attaches here important part is that
it's not compatible with your older
magsafe cables as you can see you'll
need to buy a 999 adapter to make sure
that it does I'm Scott Simon that's a
look at the gradually improved but still
really good 13-inch MacBook Air
