that we wanted the audience to connect
with the actors which is why we decided
to really push technology so that when
an actor spoke it wasn't wall of sound
it was big but you're like oh it's
coming from him and what somebody was on
the other side of the stage your ear
would go that ways and follow the visual
we have to measure to all those zones on
you see they're from every seat that has
a speaker pointing at so we sit in the
seat measure to the speaker measure to
all 14 zones measure to the other
speaker measure and so because we're
trying to work all this trigonometry is
happening forever every section of the
house and so basically if there's a
speaker pointed at you we've measured
from that speaker to a specific seat to
14 zones onstage so the stage is decided
divided up into 14 different zones that
we think the audience will perceive
sound moving from each actors wearing a
tracker that emits a it's like in a 6 to
8 could get heard bandwidth it sends out
this chirp and then we have radars all
around the theatre there's three across
the front of the stage across the
balcony 2 behind them and they're
looking for this chirp they're
constantly searching for it each radar
has three little receivers in there and
it says okay that I received a signal
and it's coming from down here and this
one over there says oh I saw it as well
but it's coming from here for me because
this tracker is lower and so it's
triangulating you know doing trig
amongst seven different radars and then
that's being all happening in real time
it sends the information back to a
computer which then decides how much
information needs to come out of one of
200 speakers so they're all receiving
the same information and it were just
constantly shifting time and volume to
trick your ear constantly to follow the
actor</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
