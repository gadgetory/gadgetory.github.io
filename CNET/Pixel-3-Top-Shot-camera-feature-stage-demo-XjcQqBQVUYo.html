capturing the finest details and
reproducing the the colors you can still
miss the perfect shot if you don't hit
the shutter at exactly the right moment
top shot solves that problem let's check
it out
pixal threes camera is smart enough to
know a good photo when it sees it our
machine learning is trained by analyzing
millions of images so knows you want to
see smiles instead of sneezes photos
where everyone in the group has their
eyes open and the perfect moment of
shock at a surprise party top shot
automatically captures alternate shots
in hdr+ so your timing wasn't perfect it
will suggest a better one you can also
scroll through the alternates and save
one of those instead and then there's
super resume anyone who's tried to take
a photo at a concert notice that phone
cameras have terrible zoom instead of
shooting a grainy photo pixel three
shoots a burst of photos each a bit
different taking an advantage of the
natural tiny movements of your hand you
can guess what happens next
you run the variations through a merging
algorithm to create a beautiful zoomed
in shot so you can get closer to the
details and frame your shot the way you
want this technique of merging slightly
different photos for higher resolution
has been used in advanced astronomy
research to surface the image of Mars
the image the surface of Mars pixel 3
puts this technology into a device you
can hold in your hand you might have
noticed the second camera on the front
of the phone let's see what it does
boys back up just a little bit back up
back up that goes in the plane well I'll
just stay in the frame guess where I am
gonna both fit
hey Mitch could you uh just couch in I'm
trying to take a selfie one sec hi three
two one
pixal users tend to get drafted as the
official photographer including four
group selfies and we want to help them
be great at their job so we added a
second camera on the front that captures
a hundred and eighty four percent more
of the scene than iPhone 10s now you can
fit everyone in the shot without a
selfie stick or unusually long arms like
mine just zoom out the difference is
striking you aren't just getting more
people in the frame you're getting more
details more scenery more of a story</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
