I'm Bridget Carey and this is your cnet
update courtroom drama continues this
week in the lawsuit between the two
biggest phone makers Apple and Samsung
Apple scaling Samsung a copycat samsung
says it's just being competitive the
Apple testimony in the trial has
revealed some interesting tidbits so far
we learned that Apple's executives
believed a seven inch iPad would be a
good idea the iphone was called Project
purple and was under such secrecy when
it launched it was joke to be like Fight
Club but on Monday Apple made the
argument that Samsung's icons look the
same as Apple's icons so what do you
think is it inspiration or outright
copying the Curiosity rover has landed
safely on Mars and it's touchdown was
truly an unparalleled achievement in
technology just that sky crane system
alone was quite a feat not to mention
every other element that piloted this
one-ton nuclear powered Rover but it
will still be a few days before we hear
more from curiosity scientists have to
spend the next week testing all its
instruments and later it will go for a
spin on the surface and we'll get some
better color photos eBay is testing a
same-day delivery service called ebay
now residents in San Francisco can order
from some retailers like target and
macy's and get the item the same day now
this would be a competitor to Amazon who
has also been talking about same-day
delivery last show we talked about a new
service called dial broadcasters have
worked together to fund a new way for
you to pick up live TV on your phone or
tablet no subscription just a one-time
fee to buy the antenna attachment you'll
start to see this on sale on the fall
and you sent in lots of positive
reactions so here's some viewer feedback
about the concept I have loved having
netflix on my phone the past couple
years and the NBC live Olympics app has
worked pretty well so if it's a one-time
fee I would definitely be down Bridget I
consider but under two circumstances one
that I could potentially poured it over
to my next phone rings only gonna last
about two years typical phone and two is
it going to be data or is it gonna be
over a stick transmission I'd rather
just look up some old-school rabbit ears
yes i would pay
2likes yeah maybe hundred dollar fifty
bucks I think that's a really cool
invention yeah I want to know what kind
of allowance that kid gets to pay for it
too cute but to answer your questions no
this is not data it's over the air many
of you said you'd like to watch it on
your commute but reception could be an
issue but where would work well is
tailgating for sure or catching the game
when you're out of the house and if
there's a hurricane that knocks the
power out you could still watch your
local news we'll just have to wait and
see how well this service shapes up
that's your tech news update for more of
the stories mentioned the show you can
head on over to cnet com / update from
our studios in New York I'm Bridget
