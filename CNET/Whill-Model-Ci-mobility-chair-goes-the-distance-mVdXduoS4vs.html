Pristina here at CES 2018 on the tech
West Show floor taking a look at the
will model CI so this is a four thousand
dollar person electric vehicle basically
that means anyone who needs a little
extra help getting around the house or
outside can just grab one of these
things during 4000 bucks it's available
now
it goes up to five miles per hour it has
an expected battery range of up to ten
miles so you can't go too far but it
does have an integrated lithium-ion
battery that takes four to five hours to
charge so you can get back up and
running pretty quickly it has a two inch
range of clearance you can't really go
through like total all-terrain but you
can go through wood chips gravel some
kind of different ink lines inside and
outside which is pretty cool but the big
thing about this is that it's integrated
with an app so if a family member wants
to know if the battery levels low so
they can come in and check on maybe an
elderly parent or someone else they can
just get an alert basically on their
phone telling them what's up which I
so if this device is available now it's
the wheel model CI and it's just one of
the many smart mobility devices we're
seeing here at the tech my show for</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
