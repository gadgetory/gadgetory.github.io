is about to get a little more awesome
I'm Jeff Bakalar filling in for Bridget
Carey this is your cnet update acer has
just introduced a new Windows 10 PC that
can be customized using modular stacking
blocks the Revo build em 1601 shifts
with a stripped-down base and it's up to
you if you want to add a block with
larger storage or other Hardware other
companies have tried something like this
before but it looks like a sir will be
the first to actually release a product
we'll know more about the Revo build
when it's released elsewhere in the
world in October for around two hundred
and fifty dollars but there's no word
yet on whether or not it'll be available
here in the US PlayStation 4 owners are
really going to dig the new features
plan for the system's 3.0 software
update which arrives in beta today
highlights include a much-needed bump
and cloud save space that's 10 gigabytes
up from just one a youtube streaming
feature to go along with the launch of
YouTube gaming and the ability to share
short game clips on Twitter players can
also invite a friend to watch their game
stream privately and much more there's a
lot more included in this upgrade so
head over to cnet.com / update for the
full list have you ever wondered why we
still rent set-top boxes from the cable
company it seems kind of absurd right
well get this cable companies make
around 19 and a half billion dollars a
year just in renting boxes so that's why
a story in the Atlantic talks about how
some are hoping that the FCC dismantles
this antiquated business practice and
opens up the floor for customers to buy
their own box which in turn would likely
drive down the cost of the box and
improve them across the board because
let's be honest it doesn't matter what
cable provider you have all cable boxes
are mostly terrible and finally it
sounds like Google hates mobile ads just
as much as you do well specifically the
ones that take up an entire screen
starting today Google will begin to down
rank sites that display ads that cover a
significant
portion of the screen and sites that
feature adds where that little X is so
impossible to tap you wind up hitting
the ad anyway which is the worst thing
on the internet that will do it for this
tech news update you can always get more

York I'm Jeff Bakalar</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
