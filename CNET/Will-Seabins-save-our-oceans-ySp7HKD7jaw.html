of C bean project and we're here today
in Val you know I'll marina here in San
Francisco and we're just getting ready
to put us even in the water steven is
like a floating trash can and we put it
in the water at marinas and we put on a
floating dock and we pull them water in
from the top and then we pump it out the
bottom and then we filter the the debris
and the trash and the oil with a filter
in the middle of that the filters that
we're using they're a fine mesh and it's
at the moment they're polypropylene
plastics so essentially we're using
plastic to catch plastics with the
current filter we're using we're
catching micro plastics to two
millimeters in size and we have
developed the the filter using a finer
mesh where we've been catching micro
fibers so stuff that you you cannot see
with them with the naked eye you need a
microscope and that's something that we
have under development as well
debris and trash and the marina's is a
much bigger problem that I think people
realize and it doesn't necessarily come
from our members or from within the
trash is carried across the water and it
comes in collects
in these little pocket areas and marinas
tend to be a good location for that it's
gonna be food containers water bottles
cigarette butts little pieces of like
twine and just the stuff that you would
see blowing around in any type of
natural environment
Stephen works 24/7 so it's an employee
24 hours a day for us and then we just
come by periodically and it also
collects a lot of the smaller stuff that
we miss it's just a great opportunity
for us to be able to do something that's
positive for the environment
we did a crowdfunding campaign and we
raised a three hundred and sixty two
thousand dollars and that gave us the
kickstart to to start this whole project
and so that was two years ago and now we
have the commercial sea beans and it's
ready to go in the water I think we have
about 70 different countries with sea
beans ordered and every day it's just
more and more the interest is just it's
huge the cost of the sea beans is 3,300
euros the maintenance costs is basically
the electricity for running of the pump
it's using 500 watts and it's only
drawing four amps which means that it's
quite a low energy consumption and yes
it is adaptable that we can have it run
by either solar power wind power or wave
we also have some concepts that we've
validated where we can get off the dock
and into the oceans because the the
technology is quite simple and it's very
adaptable and so this is our 10 year
plan so by 2027 we aim to be out
offshore into the gyres
