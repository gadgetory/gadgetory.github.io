displays Mercedes will put this to you
dice dynamic and intuitive control
experience it's a mock-up here of a
future vehicle but look what this does
you see the entire windscreen is being
used as a head-up display things can
appear anywhere in your field of view
not the limited space that we see in
cars today interacting with it is also
much more immersive your hand can create
this sort of cursor on the screen you
see as a grid of dots so you know where
it sees your intention by your hand
movement I can put my hand over this
restaurant let's say I'll get
information about it I might see a
message coming for one of my contacts I
can push to read it I can draw down to
save it into my main dash or i can go
sideways to discard it for the moment
the big idea here is to take the HUD
make it expansive but not make it
virtual reality that would blow out your
view it remains augmented reality but
with a full scope of vision so you're
still looking where you would look
anyway as a driver the sizes of head-up
displays will get larger and larger and
as you get into let's say a space where
you can do AG meant its reality you know
features and innovation like we have
shown here in this dice and it's dynamic
and intuitive control experience will be
possible this is very natural and very
intuitive you don't only have to learn a
lot of new behaviors in terms of where
your eyes go you just learn some new
gestures instead and of course the fact
that we are augmenting reality is a
trend that's bubbling up all over the
place in consumer electronics to be
especially able to project the images
you know further away from the car
because at the end of the day drivers
are still driving themselves and that
should be the primary task now you may
recall Mercedes has been showing google
glass integrated with their cars but
they don't see you using that while
driving the main reason why we do not
want customers actually to use it while
driving is we cannot control what is
being projected on that screen we would
never allow any information or anything
to be distracting you while driving
instead Mercedes see something like
glass as a pre Drive informational tool
and then perhaps a last block
navigational tool after you park and
arrive additionally it's not completely
in your field of view so that means you
would have to look away from the road
edmunds.com has done a survey of the
market that suggests the number of cars
with head-up display will have nearly
tripled in the last five years up to
nearly 40 models in 2014</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
