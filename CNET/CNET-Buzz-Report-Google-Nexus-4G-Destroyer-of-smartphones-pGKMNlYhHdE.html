buzz report the show about the tech news
that everyone is talking about this week
how to call someone a copycat in a legal
filing Google stocking goes to the next
level and stock advice of the buzzkill
variety but first it's the gadget of the
week the gadget of the week is the
rumored new google nexus 4g boy genius
report has the details on the next nexus
which will reportedly take the
smartphone arms race and turn it into
global thermonuclear war but in a good
way the nexus 4G will reportedly have
dual 1.2 or 1.5 gigahertz course but
with an ultra low-power snapdragon
processor so it won't chew through
battery life like a honey badger one gig
of ram an LTE radio 1080p HD video a
front-facing camera and a rear facing
camera with a really good sensor so that
finally an android phone can have a
camera as good as the iphone 4 oh and
also super thin plus it'll be the
reference phone for unaltered Ice Cream
Sandwich the next version of android
yeah right even speculation that it
might be an AT&amp;amp;T phone couldn't pour
cold water on this smartphone buzz hot
mess and now for the news apparently
when Google is mapping Wi-Fi access
points all over the world it's mapping
you to cnet news com reported that when
Google and skyhook wireless are
collecting public Wi-Fi access points
they can tie those public location
databases to specific Hardware IDs and
street addresses so if they've sniffed
out your laptop or your mobile phone as
a Wi-Fi access point then anyone with
that gadgets unique MAC address could
potentially track you to your house or
anywhere else you go and some
researchers think that maybe google has
picked up addresses even if you're not
using your phone or laptop as an access
point just like if it's on the Wi-Fi
they know where you are so that's fun
Google actually won't say whether it's
doing that they did say they're
definitely doing the other thing though
now yeah I know it's easy to get all
worried and want to freak out about
privacy and what
dis latian to force companies to tell us
what they're doing with our data or
maybe just stop hoovering up every
freakin move we make in our lives but
you know I find it's just a lot more
relaxing to just assume that Google is
with me everywhere I go like an angel on
my shoulder or an ingrown toenail or a
high-tech implant that watches my every
move crap i don't have an implant do i I
probably do in the great Apple Samsung
pissing contest of 2011 Apple is saying
that mean old samsung is harassing them
by asking for samples of its
next-generation iphone and ipad products
neither of which has been announced
Apple as you will recall requested
access to Samsung's future products to
make sure they weren't copying Apple so
then Samsung did the same thing to
support its counterclaim that no apple
is copying Samsung in the filing Apple
actually called Samsung the copyist
which is like as close as you can get in
the adult world to calling someone a
copycat I mean really you guys in fact I
think fashion police probably has the
best name for what's going on here bitch
stole my look mary j blige vs drew
barrymore and catherine malandrino the
bitches were scheduled to work it out in
court on Friday we'll be watching and in
the bubble is growing news it's tech IPO
season Pandora had its IPO this week
opening at twenty dollars a share with a
total market cap value of 3.2 billion
dollars which is totally funny because
of how their revenue is actually still
negative the royalty payments for
internet music streaming keep going up
and Spotify is apparently about to storm
us shores and kill them hey do whatever
you want investors how's that LinkedIn
stock working out for you and finally
let's see what's clogging the tubes this
week you know what I liked that website
stuff white people like and also white
wine calm a collection of first world
problems I really relate to those in a
slightly uncomfortable accurate kind of
way which is also how I feel about this
video which almost every single one of
my boo
you white friends has either sent me or
posted on facebook now I'm on the inside
looked in that my list organic chicken
kale salad in a lemon twist some girl in
yoga pants is looking at me funny I'm
just trying to find a decent Pinot Noir
ya know he's getting real in the Whole
Foods parking my own you know the deal
with the little shopping carts they got
check out what I say it happens every
day is how we live on the westside of LA
yeah that's me see it whole foods

pants and that's the buzz report for
this week everyone I'm mollywood and
