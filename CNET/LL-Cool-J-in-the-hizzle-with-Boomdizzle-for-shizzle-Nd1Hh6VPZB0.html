Cool J is joining me talking about boo
dizzle tell me about Buddhism boom
dizzle of is a site that we created and
actually a company that we created where
we designed this virtual studio and
basically I'm making it possible for kid
New York in a kid in LA for example to
record in real time and collaborate and
make music in real time you know not
online so it's kind of just changing the
world of recording forever it's pretty
much revolutionising recorders now this
is a piece of software software that
you're downloading or it is a day so it
is a piece of its web-based and there's
a piece of software that you use some
links that you'll download right now we
have you know we're sending out invites
but technology be out there and
available to everybody all right so how
did how did the idea come to be like
well I mean what was the problem that
you're up against you're like no I need
to help create this thing let's say the
producers in New York and I'm an outlet
you know either way I can't record in
real time I would have to make my create
my vocals email of vocals ahead then
he'd have to you know do something to an
email it back to me but it's not a
collaborative process I wanted to create
the studio environment that
collaborative environment online and
that was the problem that we solved it I
think guys are the site is also born or
to it well the boom does alessa site
we've aggregated thousands upon
thousands of upcoming artists and their
demos because this is a community that
is actually underserved and I wanted to
give them an opportunity to kind of
mingle with each other and get to know
each other as we were developing this
technology care now we've added this
technology to the mix and what that's
going to do is it's going to be a bridge
or a tunnel for all of them to get
together and just connect we actually
have a distribution deal with itunes so
you know you'll be able to you know
record with your friend in LA and you
know mix and then shoot it over to
itunes and get the ball rolling
I mean you know it's it's pretty it's
pretty sophisticated and then is it is
it just all in one sandbox or I think
you're telling me earlier that other
applications can plug in yeah I wanted
we wanted to have maximum flexibility
because there are a lot of producers out
there their concern is ok but I have
other programs I like I like you know
logic I like ableton I like this one I
like that one well we're going to make
sure that all of those all of those
doorways are there so that people can
come in be involved use whatever form
you know our board gear you want to use
to make this thing right now the
interface itself and you're looking at
the the recording right interface you're
looking at the multitrack layer you have
the multi track layout you have a grid
you have you know obviously all your
vocals you have your eq's you have all
of the different pieces that you need
not unlike some other programs that give
you you know an interface that you can
actually understand it kind of looks
like a mixing water laps in all these
gives you better use it has an analog
feel because that's traditional and
that's where I'm from I come from
recording on analog but it just has that
feel but it feels good it's right you
got me excited now yeah you got to come
out with it so is coming when is he
gonna hit Russell Russell real so we're
ready we're already testing we already
have people lots of users signed up
they're using it they're giving us
feedback you know they're gonna tell us
you know what they hate what they love
and will incorporate those learnings and
we're going to bring it out to market
for CES 2012 I'm Donald Bell here with
LL Cool J we'll see you next time cool</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
