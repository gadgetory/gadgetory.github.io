here with the Samsung RF to us are now
this is a fridge that sort of borrows
the aesthetic of the six thousand dollar
chef collection model and sells in a
much lower price at four thousand that's
still a very expensive fridge but a lot
better than that six thousand dollar
price tag it's built to appeal to
shoppers who like that chef collections
look and it does a pretty good job it
looks just like it with the same flat
front and recessed handles for door
design very interesting unique
good-looking fridge of all the four
thousand dollar fridges I've tested and
reviewed this is my favorite one on
looks alone and I also like that you get
a cool select plus compartment this
section down here this is part of the
freezer but you can also dial it up into
fridge mode so if you want an extra
storage space for fresh items it'll do
the job that said it's not a carbon copy
of the chef's collection you're missing
out on a lot of the features that make
that fridge really interesting you don't
get a chef's pan inside the fridge for
marinating steaks you don't get a chef
pantry that's a temperature controlled
drawer at the bottom you don't get the
chef's basket you can pull out all those
luxury features are gone and instead you
get a pretty simple interior you have a
fold in shelf and a fold up shelf to
make room for tall items and you get
some features that kind of don't make
sense
these shelf dividers here in the door
for instance they're just not that great
they kind of get in the way they block
things off you can take them out but
then you got to put them somewhere so
kind of a pain also this egg basket up
here doesn't really fit a carton of eggs
it doesn't make much sense to me and
just kind of made it harder to get into
the back half of that shelf so not the
greatest feature now this fridge was a
pretty consistent performer in our test
but it also consistently ran a little
bit warm a couple degrees in each test
at the 37 degree setting you can see
that it ran a little closer to 40
degrees with the light green and light
purple line there at the top being the
bottom sections of each door and then at
34 degrees it also ran about three
degrees warm averaging closer to 37 for
better cooling performance from a French
door model I like this LG model shown
here it was a little bit more consistent
in our test and more accurate to also
cost less in this model but if you just
want a fridge that offers pretty
stunning design at this price range I
think this fits the bill
and then the shortcomings are bad enough
to undercut that there's plenty more in
my full review it's seen that
calm check it out for CNN appliances I'm
right wrist</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
