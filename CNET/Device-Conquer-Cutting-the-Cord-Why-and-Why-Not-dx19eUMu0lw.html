it means saying goodbye to all those
expensive pay TV services cable and
satellite and instead filling that
television with content from a different
source over your home broadband
connection the one you already have and
pay for you still get a lot of the same
TV shows and movies still often in
high-def but in a whole different manner
that I think you might like a lot more
it's the future of TV no doubt about
that I'm going to show you how you can
do it why you would do it and also why
you might not want to do it just yet
a connected TV connected blu-ray deck
game console or connected TV set-top box
are among the tools you can choose from
and on them you'll find some combination
of Netflix Hulu Amazon Instant Video
iTunes streaming audio and even the
scene that channel now you won't find
every service I just mentioned on every
device I just mentioned so first
research the shows you want to watch go
to a site like clicker and research
where it's streams and then go buy your
gear accordingly and know that just
about every TV console set-top box or
DVD blu-ray player you buy going forward
will almost certainly be connected the
smart buyers of year they buy can stream
content their existing gear maybe cannot
now I should point out if you're a big
fan of Network shows and want to see
them right away sometimes the easiest
way to cut the cord is to install a PC
in your living room and stream the shows
on the network websites but I find this
kind of offensive too big too ugly too
noisy if you're gonna do that at least
invest in one of these quiet small form
factor computers but remember whatever
gear you buy the key differences it all
connects the same way over your existing
home broadband connection either wired
or wireless and after a pretty simple
one-time setup you're ready to discover
the good the bad and the bottom line
about cutting the cord the good
ostensibly it's real cheap 8 bucks a
month for Netflix or Hulu flat rate few
or no commercials and broadcast websites
they're free with very limited
commercial interruptions also its
on-demand it's ready when you are
no more worrying about when the show
airs or if you set the DVR now the bad
there's a lot less to watch than on
cable satellite and over-the-air TV
don't let anyone tell you otherwise
secondly you're gonna be missing out on
streaming local news if you care or
local major sports teams and finally
it's kind of complicated you're gonna be
hunting through many services versus
just one like a cable or satellite
provider the bottom line find out if
enough of what you like to watch is even
available to stream and then do a little
fuzzy math to determine if this is right
for you
or just a high-tech hobby first subtract
cable and satellite fees next you got to
subtract out some hip miss you're gonna
be seeing shows later than some of your
friends and the last thing you've got to
take out is gonna be access to local
news and your local major league sports
teams now add the cost of gear if you
don't already own some cord cutting
equipment you've got to go buy some
things you meant to pay for some new
services they're fairly cheap like
Netflix or Hulu at 8 bucks a month and
finally think about this when you break
up that bundle of cable TV and Internet
you have right now they may charge you
more for the internet portion alone okay
now you've got to multiply a couple
things multiply your frustration you're
gonna be spending more effort finding
what you want to watch on TV and oddly
enough we're gonna multiply the number
of commercials you see there aren't a
lot of them on streaming when you cut
the cord but you can't skip them and
finally divide divine pay TVs tyranny
now you're only gonna watch what you
want when you want and the way you want
to okay it's not real math but what do
you expect I was an English major but
this is what you've got to go through
the figure out if connected TV is right
for you cutting the cord for another
take on this in great real-life detail
