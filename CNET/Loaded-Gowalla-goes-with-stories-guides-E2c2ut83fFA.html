Wilson Tang on CNN com and it's time to
get loaded location-based services are
all the rage these days with many users
checking in on Foursquare and Facebook
gowalla has been four squares largest
competitor and now the company hopes to
reinvent its app to focus on just travel
and storytelling in version four point
out of the app you'll be able to see
where your friends are checking in
organizes stories complete with photos
of them hanging out the new gowalla also
brings guides from when you travel to
different locales the guides will offer
travel tips and must-see sites and can
automatically be generated you may
remember the startup company fusion
garage who got into a legal spat with
tech blog TechCrunch over the idea and
design of the crunch pad well it looks
like the company's newest tablet the
grid 10 will be making that October
first debut in the States but with a two
hundred dollar price cut the 16 gigabyte
Wi-Fi model which was planned to be sold
for 499 dollars well now retail for just
two hundred ninety nine dollars the
great 10 will also come now in a 399
dollar version with 3g I'm sure many of
you can relate to the fact that facebook
seems to be sucking more and more time
away from your day well be prepared to
spend even more time in the social
network as miramax will soon start
selling and renting movies on the site
while other studios have made similar
moves in the past Miramax will be going
a step further by integrating ojala
social so viewers can buy and then chat
about movies viewers will be able to
find movies like Good Will Hunting and
pulp fiction films themselves are bought
using facebook credits Google Docs is
updating its sharing options to a
comment only mode maybe you just want
someone to approve read your work or
maybe you're just afraid someone will
mess with your formatting the new
comment only sharing option will limit
access to those who have the link or
anyone on the web software maker mobile
tap has released its popular dolphin
browser HD for the iPad the app was an
android browser known for its gesture
and webzine mode gestures will allow
users to swipe the page to move back and
forth or refresh the page webzine mode
reformats the sites into popular
magazine style layouts like Flipboard
and zeit dolphin browser HD is available
in the iTunes App Store for free finally
concerned that your teenager is talking
or texting on the phone while driving
perhaps you're a culprit yourself well
Sprint is launching a new app for
Android smartphones called dry first the
app locks up your phone when it detects
you're in a moving vehicle phone calls
will automatically go to voicemail while
incoming texts will get an automated
custom reply sprint isn't just being a
good Samaritan here though the service
will cost two dollars per month after a
15 day free trial those are your
headlines for today I'm Wilson tank for
