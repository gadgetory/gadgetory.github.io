the apple pie for everything good and
bad inside the world of Apple let's get
to the show and the big a has officially
sent out their colorful invitation for
their october twenty second event in san
francisco with the headline we still
have a lot to cover seriously Apple do
you have to make it that easy for us
look I'm pretty smart and it's real
obvious they're going to announce a
whole new bunch of Apple cases get it
lot to cover or it could be iPads new
macs and OS 10 Mavericks but I let you
guys decide now French website mattg
claims to have had the release dates for
the new hardware we expect to see they
say we'll see the new macbook pros
available on October the 24th or 25th
the ipad 5 and ipad mini 2 on october
the 30th or 31st and the new mac pro on
november the 15th but based on what we
know in all the leaks we've heard and
seen what can we expect well the ipad 5
is expected to bring an all-new design
similar to the ipad minis beveled edges
the new a7 chip that's in the iPhone 5s
and an improved 8 megapixel camera and
there's still no confirmation about
touch ID integration now the ipad mini 2
is expected to bring a Retina Display
finally but there are rumblings at a
version without one have also been
tested possibly as an entry-level model
according to 9to5 mac and a variant of
the a7 chip will be used as well now
according to Macotakara the retina
display mini might even end up slightly
thicker to accommodate the new display
now with the new macbook pros they're
expected to bring Intel's Haswell
processors and give it a huge boost in
battery life that almost doubled for the
macbook air line and a front-facing
camera could be upgraded at 1080p but we
don't expect to see a new body design
we've also seen pretty much all the new
beefy hardware for the new mac pros and
it's the entry-level price point in
specs that we're waiting to see so
that's a lot of stuff already but we
have to imagine a release date for OS n
Mavericks will be the icing on the cake
mm now Apple has already released the
final gold master release of OS n
Mavericks to developers and it started
asking developers to submit their apps
optimized for mavericks so we're getting
real real close for a final release date
now an iphone news Apple has kept mum on
the sales of the late
I phones but that didn't stop localytics
who used iphone connections to mobile
and web apps and estimates a
three-to-one ratio in favor of the
iphone 5s over the 5c now the wall
street journal then followed up with a
recent story that apple is reducing its
component orders for the iphone 5c by a
third and they're curtailing iphone 5c
production they also report Apple has
raised orders for the 5s you know the
phone with new technology in it all
right let's check out our App of the
Week this week it's an app for your Mac
called Control plus it's real slick and
think of it as control center for your
mat it's a sweet fun utility that
appears on your menu bar you can change
your display to do things like adjusting
your brightness or setting your
wallpaper easily you can also control
itunes or even set a timer it's 99 cents
for the first couple of days and 4 99
after that but it's an app we're
checking out that has a really slick and
useful interface alright guys onto the
quick bites it looks like some iphone 5s
users are suffering from the blue screen
of death reports from forums say it
happens to people using the numbers app
in apples iWork sweet and some have said
it happens with ESPN scorecenter as well
not a good thing but one possible
workaround is to disable I cloud syncing
with I work for now but there hasn't
been a fix issued yet also Apple search
for a new VP of retail is over with the
hiring of Angela Ahrendts with the CEO a
fashion retailer burberry and I think I
have a pretty good idea what the next
Apple store is going to look like now

hook you guys the Apple biters up with
another killer giveaway thanks to my
friends at mophie check it out we have
five mophie juice pack helium switch are
