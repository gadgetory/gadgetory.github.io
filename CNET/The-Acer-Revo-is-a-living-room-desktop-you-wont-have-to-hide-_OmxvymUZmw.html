your TV a lot of people still are and
that's why they make Media Center pcs
like this I'm Dan Ackerman and this is
the Acer Revo this is a small white cube
like PC we call it a mini desktop and
it's not one you're going to feel like
you need to hide behind your monitor
behind a house but it actually looks
very nice very kind of living room
design this guy's got dual core
low-voltage Core i5 CPU it's kind of big
hard drive one terabyte and of course
it's got plenty of ports and connections
on the back which is really what you
want in a media center you want multiple
video output you want multiple USB
outputs there's even an SD card slot on
the top and if you can you want an
ethernet jacks and get really fast
streaming most people if they're going
to do media streaming on their living
room TVs they really just need a $99
Roku box that does Netflix Hulu Amazon
Prime HBO GO anything like that if
you're a little bit more ambitious and
you want to get the you know dedicated
windows apps for a lot of the TV
stations or you want to stream stuff
from YouTube and 4k or you want to run
your own 4k videos or just anything you
find online well then you're going to
need something a little more complicated
basically a media center PC like this
guy 4/5 79 you get that big hard drive
decent CPU they bundle in a wireless
keyboard and mouse right here you've
also got a lot of competition you do
have other options
HP's got their own version called the
mini you know it's also got a lot of USB
ports the processors not as fast in this
guy Apple of course still makes the Mac
Mini great little Core i5 machine
smaller harddrive in this for a 500
bucks so with the Revo you pay a little
bit more but you get a faster CPU and a
bigger hard drive together in one
package if you want to go super cheap
the Intel compute stick is actually a
nice little clever machine it's a little
Intel Atom
mini desktop that plugs in via HDMI and
it can do Netflix basic 1080p stuff but
you're not going to do 4k or anything
more extreme on it the nice thing about
the Revo is that it doubles as a really
effective just mainstream living room or
den or dorm room desktop PC I'm Dan
Ackerman and that's the Acer Revo
