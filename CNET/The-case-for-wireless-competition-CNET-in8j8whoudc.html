operators who can provide coast-to-coast
border to border coverage but the need
for regional carriers I think goes to
what I touched on earlier the fact that
with enough competition the market has
an opportunity to provide checks and
balances on itself as we've seen more
consolidation we've seen a need for more
more input from the federal regulators
to make sure that we have those checks
and balances specifically when you look
at a company like cease fire I think of
things like Hurricane Katrina which
struck several years back in our service
area the flooding Mississippi River it
happens periodically in particular last
year we had a severe about the flooding
even tornadoes that sweep across the
southeast it made nationwide news for
one of the large operators an area that
we cover can represent one percent half
a percent of their customer base but in
our area that's one hundred percent of
our customer base and we've been in
business for almost 25 years now and one
thing that we've learned in our 25 years
in business is that the largest
operators typically follow us when we go
out to these harder to reach areas so we
get to be their first we get to deliver
service but the fact that we're there
also brings competition in some of these
areas now in other areas certainly in
portions of the Mississippi Delta it's
one of the poorest regions in our
country year after year the plight of
the Delta makes national news and it
unfortunately contains some of the
poorest people in our country we have
gone out to the Mississippi Delta and
deployed 3g services and intended deploy
4G services as soon as we can and in
many instances provide those people who
live at or below the poverty line with
the one connection they have to the
internet and e-commerce and even learn
that device that they have is more than
just a luxury to them or a convenience
to them it's the one link that they have
to high-speed data and to everything the
internet brings to you and me that we
take for granted we do it a competitive
prices as well typically our pricing is
lower than you'd see from the quote
unquote nationwide carriers we offer
choice you guys are offering the iphone
4 149 dollars where everybody else is
still at 200 bucks that's right and will
even offer the iphone 4 at $75 the 4s at
149 dollars with service plans that can
be as little as half of what our
competitors charge</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
