welcome to google issues for all the
google that we can pack inside of a show
each week let's get to the show and
Google i/o is just a couple months away
and one of the big focuses this year
will be about design now Google has
added more sessions on Android user
experience wearable app design speech
interfaces and more and it's clear that
the googs really wants to make a push
around design now they've even released
three videos showing the design process
of making things simpler for glass maps
and even search and it's moved to voice
this is the way in which people are
talking to Google you're doing to this
tiny little box I said well why don't we
make that bigger it was very simple
design change and auto completions gets
larger and people started noticing
anymore I'm noticing the more if they
actually started using it more see
bigger is better for a search bars all
right Google i/o is also a chance for
the big G to reveal new hardware and
we've seen plenty of Nexus products from
them in the past it's been a
long-standing rumor but according to
digit times google reportedly plans to
release an 8-inch HTC made tablet the
Nexus 7 tablet has been produced by asus
and their Nexus 10 has been manufactured
by Samsung ACC and Google have work
together in the past so we'd expect to
see some sort of announcement at i/o if
this nexus 8 is coming this year and ACC
is known also for its elegant hardware
and you can look no further than the HTC
One but their camera image quality has
been a point of criticism because of its
four megapixel ultra pixel resolution
now in an interview with Vodafone ACC's
camera expert Simon Whitehorn spoke
about 4k video and DSLR image quality
but he also dropped a tidbit saying that
optical zooming on a smartphone is not
far off at all for HTC now they could be
one of the first to get a true optical
lens in a smartphone but they're also
the first to say this acc wants to own
the selfie market yes and white horn
added you'll see a lot more investment
in that area in some markets ninety
percent of pictures taken are selfies
plus he says selfies are a very
different imaging environment so guys to
some things all up the self-obsessed
market is the next battlefield for
smartphones all right let's take a
breather and check out a how-to with
Lynn law to get the most out of your gs5
camera first be sure to check that your
default settings are tailored to your
exact preferences to adjust them tap the
little gear icon in the corner and
scroll through each of these items
personally I always turn my
compositional gridlines on to help me
frame and straighten out my pictures for
frequently change settings you can have
three shortcuts directly accessible on
the viewfinders dash just long tap any
of these settings and drag them over now
there's one particular setting here that
brings me to my second tip you've
probably seen HDR or high dynamic range
imaging before but the gs5 now has the
option to toggle real-time feedback of
what your HDR image would look like
before you take a picture make this
toggle your friend HDR combines several
shots taking at varying levels of
exposure and composites it into one
image this can result in really striking
almost surreal photos that have great
contrast sometimes though it can also
create unnatural images that you might
not like so be sure to check by tapping
on and off the HDR icon which is
represented by this little Venn diagram
looking icon here third familiarize
yourself with photo effects you can
access some of them directly on the
camera through the settings menu here
it's indicated by the magic wand icon
and displays the filters in real time
other effects can be applied after you
take the picture these are accessible
through the photo manager just go to
your gallery tap on this Polaroid with a
pencil icon and several options will
appear fourth get to know selective
focus this is a new gs5 feature that
lets you change the focal point of your
picture by manipulating the depth of
field pictures can look more
professional and even dramatic you have
to turn this option on before taking a
photo so it's good to have an idea about
it while you're shooting to turn it on
tap the icon with the two human heads in
the camera dash the device will tell you
that for best results stand at most a
foot and a half away from the closest
object the object itself should also be
at least four and a half feet away from
the background tap on the object you
want in your foreground and click the
shudder to initiate selective focus
click on the icon here with the two
little heads three options will emerge
near far and Pam focus near will bring
your closest object into focus and blur
out everything behind it far sharpens
only the background and pan gets
everything in focus when you're finished
tap done to save your changes thanks
Lynn but I was actually hoping there
would be tips for taking selfies all
right now sticking with phones we're
still hoping and expecting to see a new
Nexus phone at Google i/o it's almost a
no-brainer we'll see one but according
to Chinese rumor sites google might be
working with chip maker media tech to
take on a budget Nexus device that could
be priced as low as 100 dollars in hopes
to broaden its global market share and
it would be a direct competitor to X
google company motorola that has had a
real success with the moto g's 4.5 inch
screen quad-core processor and all-day
battery at a ninety nine dollar price
point with contract and guys in some fun
stuff the googs is still pushing
smartphone innovation with project tango
we've shown off tango in past shows and
its ability to track the full 3d motion
of its smartphone while creating a 3d
map of the environment and space around
it now they recently took their motion
mapping phone and paired it with spear
robots in a zero gravity environment to
see how it would react and the data it
would capture in a near real-life space
scenario now they never reveal the
results but it's another really cool way
that Google could be able to even create
3d maps of space or build new
applications with project tango or it
was just an excuse to do flying monkey
tricks in zero gravity alright guys
that's going to do it for this week's
show email us at google issues at cnet
com or tweet me up brian Tong thanks so
much for watching and we'll see you guys
next week for some more of that ghoulish
