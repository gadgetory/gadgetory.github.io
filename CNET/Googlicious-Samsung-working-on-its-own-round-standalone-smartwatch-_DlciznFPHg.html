Google ish asst it's all the Google
goodness that we can pack inside of a
show the SmartWatch talk isn't going
away anytime soon after reports from the
reliable Sam mobile blog now we told you
to get ready for this crazy month i like
to call September and Sam mobile expect
Samsung to announce their SmartWatch
called the gear solo alongside of the
note 4 on sep tember the third that will
feature a sim card slot enabling it to
make voice calls independently now on
top of that everyone is starting to
realize that making a SmartWatch with a
round face that actually looks like a
traditional watch is the smart thing to
do and Sam mobile also reports Samsung
currently has one under development of
its own as expected to make it known in
a few more months especially since LG is
already teasing their own moto 360
killer with this trailer for what
they're calling the G watch are their
own rounded SmartWatch that will be
announced at Aoife 2014 sometime between
the fit and tenth of September and those
are just the watches we know about so
let's shift over to smartphones and Sam
mobile also reports that Samson is
planning to introduce their a series of
smartphones that follow in the footsteps
of the samsung Alpha and it's metallic
design after all the years of plastic
Samsung is getting more attention for
the alphas design than it ever has and
we're expecting to hear more in the next
few weeks now HTC doesn't want you to
forget about them and according to a
post from Chinese web site Weibo the big
green machine is working on a 64-bit
smartphone with an eight-core processor
this teaser image was included with the
post with a claim of a 64-bit phone on a
two tone phone design and again this
could be another product making some
sort of appearance at Aoife let's jump
over to Google News and we've heard as
far back as last month that there was a
nexus phablet in the works codename
Shamu the device is expected to have a
5.9 inch screen at a 1440 x 2560 screen
resolution with a fingerprint sensor
made by motorola now phoneArena reports
it will be launched as the Nexus X with
rumored specs including a 2.7 gigahertz
Snapdragon processor and a 13 megapixel
rear camera with optical image
stabilization with a launch sometime
around Halloween also we know the next
flavor of Android L is coming soon in
you can even download the dev preview
right now but there's still no official
name while android police believes it
will be called lemon meringue pie after
multiple sources in code and
documentation lists the release as LMP
now before we just jump to conclusions I
can think of quite a few other names
that could go with LMP such as lettuce
mango pickle or lovable mud puppies now
just a reminder android 4.4 was known as
klp and key lime pie internally but
turned out to be KitKat so don't be
surprised if it ends up being little
monkey poop and in an interesting behind
the scenes we've Google is acquiring
deco design a firm that helps develop
and design products for other companies
like Fitbit sling media and
hewlett-packard gecko design will be
rolled into Google's xlab the team
responsible for google glass and the
driverless car project so that's some
pretty sweet stuff but we wrap up the
show with something not so sweet and
just plain bizarre discovered by our own
team at cnet burger king is offering
free on contract smartphones for
customers yes the home of the flame
broiled fast-food burner the reality is
that there's nothing really that special
here you still have to lock into a
two-year contract agreement you can only
do this online and you won't find the
latest phones but you will find the
galaxy s3 s4 and HTC one m7 now you're
encouraged to download the Burger King
mobile app but you don't have to and
check out is done through Amazon now
don't worry you're not the only one
watching this with your hands in the air
screaming w.t.f the fast-food giant
recently changed its slogan from have it
your way to be your way which makes no
sense just like this smartphone
promotion all right guys and gals that's
going to do it for this week you can
email us at Google licious at cnet com

time for some more of that Google Isha's
judicious septic BRR you know I'm saying
