have LTE yeah we were surprised too but
whatever your opinions are Google's
anticipated flagship phone has finally
arrived hello everybody it's Lynn law
from cnet here with the LG Nexus 4 on
t-mobile the Nexus 4 has a 4.7 inch true
HD IPS plus display that has a 1280 by
768 in a straight edge touch screen that
LG phones usually have the Nexus has a
very nice very premium feeling display
that curves slightly into the bezel
powering the device is a quad-core 1.5
gigahertz Qualcomm Snapdragon s4
processor gameplay was very smooth on
this handset and the graphics were vivid
and rich there's also a 2.1 ampere hour
battery inside which roughly translates
to a reported talk time of 10 hours
above the display is a 1.3 megapixel
camera that can shoot 720p video and on
the back is an 8 megapixel 1080p camera
now as the Nexus phone of the year the
device offers users a pure skinless
Android experience and the most recent
OS known as jellybean it comes packed
with a bunch of new features
particularly with the camera which now
sports a tweaked UI with radial dials
and more editing features there's also
the photosphere shooting option which
lets you stitch together pictures taken
from every angle at a single point to
create these expansive 3d esque photos
other new jelly bean features include
easy access to Google now which is tied
into google search and voice search
because Google now isn't technically a
voice recognition service it's not like
iOS is Siri but it does have assistant
like abilities for instance it could
suggest local restaurants and estimate
your commute time the Nexus 4 also has
gesture typing which is similar to swype
two gigs of ram NFC and Bluetooth one
huge feature it doesn't have however is
4G LTE now the last model the Galaxy
Nexus didn't initially launched with it
either but LTE has been around long
enough that it's come to be a staple for
flagship devices instead the Nexus 4
runs on 4g ish technology known as hspa+
which can be as fast as LTE sometimes
Google Sites costs and battery life as
some of the reasons it opted not to
include LTE but it's hard to claim the
Nexus 4 is cutting edge when phones like
the LG optimus G and the motorola droid
razr maxx HD are both powerful high-end
and have LTE in general the device is
solid its internal speeds are zippy and
smooth the camera is packed with new
features and the UI is indeed sleek but
other than offering users a pure
jellybean experience the phone doesn't
have anything substantially new going
for it the Nexus is design isn't
anything we haven't seen before and
while its data speeds are respectable
its lack of LTE capabilities will
definitely lead users feeling behind or
slighted having said that however the
Nexus has always been successful with
devoted android fans and we predict that
this one will be no exception plenty of
cnet readers have anecdotally reported
that differences in hspa+ and LTE speeds
are negligible and what's more is that
the nexus 4 is extremely affordable it
will be available on November 13th
unlock starting at 299 for the eight gig
version and 349 for the 16 gig version
t-mobile will start selling it a day
after the 16 gig model will go for 199
alongside a carrier agreement again I'm
Lynn and this has been the LG nexus 4
for t-mobile
