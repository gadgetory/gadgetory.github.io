your first look at the HP photosmart
5510 a all-in-one printer the sub 100
dollar market is a pretty competitive
one for HP and this one competes well in
terms of print quality and speed but
homes and offices that take their
printing seriously can get more features
with other printers with a little extra
shopping around taking quick physical
survey of the 5510 it combines a printer
scanner and copier into a pretty low
profile design it's not going to occupy
a lot of space on your desktop the 2.4
inch display on the front is touch
compatible and it features virtual
buttons on the right side that help with
navigation and on-screen selections HP
also makes it even easier on the user by
only eliminating the relevant buttons on
any given action like I said it's only a
hundred bucks so I'm not really
surprised to see that it doesn't include
an auto document feeder on top or
double-sided printing either but I
should note that the design does falter
on it's pretty small 80 sheet paper
input capacity so by comparison the HP
stylus and X 4 30 can actually hold 20
more pages in its reservoir which makes
a big difference if you are a high
volume printer in addition to apple
airprint and Google Cloud Print
compatibility this one also features
HP's remote printing technology called
ePrint that lets you send jobs from any
connected device straight to the printer
all you have to do to set it up is
connect the printer to your computer
through Wi-Fi and HP will tell you its
unique email address that will come with
every single printer in our test labs
the photosmart 5510 registered slightly
faster than the average multifunction at
the 100 dollar price point but it still
did trail behind the stylus and x 4 30
black text quality does look a little
better than the NX 430 but i would
recommend either printer if output
resolution is your first priority over
all the HP photosmart 5510 is a
worthwhile purchase if you can get it at
a discount from the 100 dollar price tag
but if we're just talking list here the
epson stylus NX 430 is not only a better
performer but it also has more features
that won't have you constantly getting
up to refill the paper tray head over to
cnet.com for more details but that's
going to
for me I'm just in you you just took a
first look at the HP photosmart 5510 a
all-in-one printer thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
