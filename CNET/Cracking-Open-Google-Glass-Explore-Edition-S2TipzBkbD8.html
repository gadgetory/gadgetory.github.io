gadget generated more buzz than Google
glass so of course I wanted to take it
apart and explore its internal hardware
now unfortunately as I'll show you this
version of Google glass wasn't built to
be easily dissected or repaired I'm bill
Detweiler
and this is cracking open according to
google executive chairman Eric Schmidt
glass is still probably a year away from
hitting store shelves but true to the
company's iterative development style
Google is shipping 10,000 or so Explorer
units like the one I'm wearing to
developers beta testers and winners of
Google's if I had glass contest and
while the company may make a few tweaks
to the product before launch these test
units still give us a good idea of what
to expect in terms of overall design and
hardware so let's look at the specs
according to Google glass has a five
megapixel camera that can shoot video at
720p it supports 802 11 B and G Wi-Fi
and Bluetooth audio is provided by a
bone conduction transducer and the
display is the equivalent of a 25 inch
high-definition screen from 8 feet away
as for buttons and connectors there is a
listen button on/off button capture
button a touch sensitive area and a
microUSB port there's also a status LED
and a rear-facing sensor array now
Google notes that glass has 16 gigs of
flash storage 12 of which are available
to the user but they don't specify what
processor the unit has or how much RAM
it comes with and normally this wouldn't
be a problem as fans of cracking open
know this is the point of the show where
I show you how to pop off the gadgets
cover and get to the tech inside
unfortunately glass was less than
cooperative cracking open Google glass
begins by removing the frame and nose
piece now thanks to a single torques
t-50
processes relatively simple removing the
camera and display assemblies plastic
cover was also relatively simple
unfortunately this is where my cracking
open came to a screeching halt I tried
everything I can think of to get inside
glasses main and rear modules prying
poking even heating nothing worked and
because I wasn't given the green light
to destroy this unit during my teardown
cutting the plastic off wasn't an option
so what are the CPU and RAM specs for
glass well luckily there are published
reports of a developer using an Android
debugging utility to pull information on
the CPU and RAM from the operating
system if his information is accurate
glass has a Texas Instruments OMAP 44:30
processor which was also used on the
Amazon Kindle Fire and one gig of ram
given want other developers and
journalists have posted online glass
also appears to have a gyroscope
accelerometer and ambient light sensor
now I know this cracking open wasn't as
thorough as most and I hate not being
able to show you the circuit boards and
chips inside Google glass but as there
are so few of the Explorer edition units
available and given that they cost $1500
each I just couldn't risk damaging it
and perhaps that's the biggest takeaway
from this half teardown given the camera
and display Assembly's construction it's
not inconceivable that you could replace
it if it broke but I don't see any way
to safely get inside the main or rear
modules if they break you'll likely need
a complete replacement now for more
information on Google glass including
real world tests check out Rachel King's
non nerds guide over on sister site
ZDNet and of course CNET's full review
now c-more teardown photos and read my
