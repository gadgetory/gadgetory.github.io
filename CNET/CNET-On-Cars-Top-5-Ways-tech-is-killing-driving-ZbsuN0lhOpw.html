year since oh four Americans have driven
a little less per capita and while the
economy and urbanization are key factors
so is tech I'm Brian Cooley with the top
five tech trends that are keeping us out
of the driver's seat number five bike
sharing I put this at number five
because let's face it most of us are
lazy and the appeal of riding gets a
little narrow when it's snowing or you
have to go pick up your dry cleaning but
there's no denying an increase in City
bike fleets that wouldn't work without
digital technology that keeps the bike
secured and authorizes their usage by
members number four ride-sharing ride
share networks like uber or lyft or
sidecar transition you from driver to
rider in someone else's vehicle and taxi
services are also adopting apps to let
you interact with them as well
both trends make being a rider versus a
driver just more satisfying however I
rank this fairly low for now at least
because cabs are nothing new and the
impact of ride-sharing services is still
taking shape regulatory and otherwise
number three mobile phones not the use
of them but the cost of them one of the
major theories out there about why
younger people have been buying fewer
cars is that the money they would use to
do so
is already going to t-mobile and Verizon
a plan and a subsidized phone can pretty
easily hit one hundred and thirty five
hundred fifty bucks a month even well
that's a cheap car and basic insurance
number two ecommerce no kidding one of
the seismic shifts he used to be that
shopping and cars were synonymous but
today almost anything can be bought and
at your doorstep in a day or two without
the hassle of having to go get it at
fifty six cents a mile on the other hand
as big as this trend is I don't rank it
as number one because we still do a lot
of driving to go look at things in
stores that we then go buy online number
one is of course remote work whether
you're telecommuting from home or a
nearby shared workspace in your
neighborhood driving to work every day
is no longer a given this is huge
because commuting accounts for some 64%
of the total average my
driven by each of us each year in the
u.s. remote work technology nothing new
but increasing acceptance of digitally
being somewhere makes it more common and
less likely to raise the boss's eyebrows
stay on top of all the latest trends of
modern driving at CNET on cars.com i'm
