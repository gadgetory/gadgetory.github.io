very important one right now health
information especially mobile devices
very balkanize is very fragmented so for
people like me who are very excited
about creating apps that a large
audience can use need to have platforms
to help on board folks but also give
them confidence that the data is being
treated correctly and most importantly
connect the different apps together so
we can make a seamless experience so I'm
optimistic that with this new platform
we're gonna have a very different
experience of people looking for the
best ways to stay healthy the new
devices that are going to be announced
they will allow folks to gather
information about themselves without
even trying which means I can tell you
things about you eating them now with a
smartphone I can access not just how
many steps you're walking about your
body temperature may be insights about
how you're sleeping at night maybe your
blood sugar things that can give me
ideas about whether you're really hungry
or you just tired or is that why you're
cranky but also more important
observations about literally what you
know are you becoming perimenopause or
their hormones messed up thing is that a
lot of times people don't realize
because it can happen at very different
ages and different people but the best
part about this whole platform the
reason I'm so excited about being here
is because instead of basing advice to
you on last year's or last decades
information I'm going to tell you based
on what's happening right now to 10
million people just like you so I can
make it intelligent enough to educate
you going for it sees ahead of where
