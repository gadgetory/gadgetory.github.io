and we're here in Vietnam right now we
came to Vietnam with misfit from the
very beginning we were founded both in a
sense in San Francisco and Ho Chi Minh
City and it was really about going to
places where we had the most competitive
advantage in terms of recruiting and so
we've been able to find amazing talent
here and so it wasn't just about a cost
difference but also just about the level
of talent talent hunger speed that's why
we're in Vietnam here in Vietnam in Ho
Chi Minh City we've got nearly a hundred
people roles really range from
everything from supply chain logistics
finance or business operations to
customer service we've got a great team
here so the Vietnam tech scene is a
really interesting one you know in terms
of an indigenous market for consumer
products and apps and hardware I'd say
it's not that big yet it's growing but
it's it's really not there yet but in
terms of a pool a talent pool a place
where you can find some talented
engineers and designers I mean you've
got some pretty amazing people here in
terms of a consumer scene middle class
is growing rapidly here and people are
enjoying prosperity the that there's a
lot that's that's happening here in
Vietnam technology's transforming
society here just like it is in other
countries so what does Vietnam gonna
look like in five years I think the tech
scene is gonna continue to grow
I think the indigenous demand for
consumer applications services hardware
will grow as the middle class here grows
the wearables scene the Internet of
Things scene I think it'll be much more
commonplace than it is now I think
infrastructure hopefully will be a lot
better in terms of broadband speed and
access to Internet and access to
technology at the scene here is going to
be moving far beyond just manufacturing
and where people will not just be about
atoms but also about bits and
and code</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
