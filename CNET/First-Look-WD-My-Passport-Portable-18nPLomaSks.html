paper and I'm gonna fold it and each
time I do the thick let's get double and
if I keep doing this for about four
attempts it could be as thick as a
distance from here to the moon and more
it's true but of course I cannot do that
it's a limit to how many time I can
phone this about six times
and speaking of limit this is the brand
new my passport from WD which has
nothing to do with the moon or the
distance but in the first in the world
that offered to terabyte of storage
space now as a portable dry on the
inside unify a regular 2.5 inch hard
drive like this one right here now I'm
sure that there wouldn't be new
technology in the future but for now to
Terra is about as much as you can get
and for this little drive to store to
Terra by you have to squeeze about six
hundred and twenty billion bite on a
surface as small as my thumb and six
hundred and twenty billion is more than
the amount of star you can find in the
milky way's that's true
now as a portable drive the new my
passport come which is one port USB
three and one cable for both data and
power the DRI support sp3 but it's also
work with USB 2.0 in my testing is very
fast offering about eighteen ninety
megabyte per second now even at that
speed you can take you a few hours to
fill it up despite the large amount of
storage the DRI is really poor bow and
light and it's also very very sturdy
it's about the size of regular passport
just thicker but you can put it in your
pocket now the good news is the new
passport is not too expensive it can be
found online for between $200 or 250 to
find out more check out my full review
