show by DIY tech and how to i'm eric
franklin and i'm donald bell and if you
like taking pictures whether with your
smartphone or your DSLR cameras we got
some great tips for you guys yeah we're
gonna start off with a great DIY project
for taking time lapse videos 360 degrees
with just your smartphone there are lots
of ways to go about shooting a time
lapse but if you want yours to stand out
from the crowd on instagram and
everywhere else on the web why not shoot
a panoramic time lapse the setup is
really simple using a few household
supplies so you'll need a wind-up
kitchen timer this one's from ikea and
it only costs a few bucks you'll need an
l-shaped bracket like this you can pick
it up at the hardware store you'll also
need some adhesive so i have tape and a
command strip you'll see how i use that
in a second i'll start by adhering my
phone to the l-shaped bracket for that
i'm using the command strips so that it
comes off easily so i'll put the command
strip on one of the sides and stick my
phone to it there we go now all i have
to do is put this on the kitchen timer
and that's where the tape comes in
that's your setup it's really that
simple when you're ready to shoot your
time-lapse you have a lot of options
there is an app called laps it which is
available for iOS and Android and of
course a lot of phones have built in
time lapse options but today i'm going
to use hyperlapse which is a new app
from instagram that lets you shoot up to
45 minutes of raw footage so I've got
hyperlapse set up here it's all secured
on my kitchen timer so let's go out and
shoot this time lapse I really like the
hyperlapse app it is by far the easiest
to use time lapse photo app that's out
there Elsa like that you can slow down
your head really slow yes I love the
whole sloping it's kind of taken over
right now a little bit overused but I
still like it alright it's time for a
quick break and when we come back we
show you how to make an inexpensive
camera slider to capture really cool
cinematic video shots
you
welcome back we're all about making diys
that are fun useful and affordable and i
gotta say i found the inspiration for
this next how 2 in my own house I stole
toy for my six-year-old son father the
early hey it works no I'm excited to see
it especially because this one uses a
remote-control truck you got yourself a
video camera and you're thinking about
making your own personal Citizen Kane
one thing you should add to your bag of
tricks is a dolly shot or a slider shot
now this is a kind of shot where you
have a stationary camera and instead of
panning it left and right you're gonna
glide it smoothly to get this shot a lot
of the pros use a crane or expensive set
of tracks for a dolly rig I'm gonna show
you how to make your own DIY solution
for under sixty dollars now I've seen
some super budget versions of this that
you use broomsticks and PVC pipes I'm
gonna step it up a little bit and use
PVC pipes for our tracks and I'm going
to add a camera tripod a flexible one
like this and a thirty dollar remote
control truck this is the maisto rock
crawler and what makes it so awesome is
that it's got a little bit of
flexibility in the base and these nice
big wheels that are set wide apart and
this whole thing can actually support a
DSLR or you can even use a smartphone
with this particular camera mount now
these are our bold tires here but
they're perfect for fitting over the PVC
pipe the grooves in the wheel well
they're gonna slide gently just like so
now we're going to use a screwdriver to
take the truck body off so we have a
nice level surface to mount our camera
on
alright the screws are out and we're
going to take off the top and there's
this bit of wire here that's the antenna
we don't need this there you go all
right now we've got a nice level surface
for our camera and we've got the wheel
wells exposed here at the guy that's on
the tracks you can use whatever length
or diameter PVC pipe you have around I
had this three-quarter inch pipe handy
so I'm going to use that now I've got 15
foot section of pipe I'm going to
connect these two shorter sections to it
using elbow joints next up we're going
to take another five foot section of
pipe and we're gonna put a slip T joint
on it now this is a critical little
joint here what's so great about it is
that you can slip it over a pipe and you
can adjust the gauge of your tracks for
exactly what you need now we're going to
make this a little fancier by attaching
a pulley to one end and using some
strings to pull your truck across we're
going to drill a small hole and we'll
add a nice crew attach the pulley
turn the pipe inward so that's facing
your truck and then attacked a string to
the truck so that we can run that
through the pulley alright the next step
is to add our camera a flexible tripod
mount like a gorillapod gives you a lot
of options this one even comes with a
phone mount really want to make sure
this thing's secure especially if you
have a nice expensive camera you don't
want to top one down all right now that
it's all set up let's take this thing
outside and play around with it and see
what we can get
so mount it up on the table like this
here's what the shot looks like the wide
base of the truck is strong enough to
support a DSLR but I actually had the
most fun using this setup and the
hyperlapse app on my phone for making
smooth time-lapse videos
so that's all there is to it that's how
to make your own DIY camera slider a lot
of fun and as a bonus in your downtime
you can use a remote-controlled truck
probably the most fun looking do I've
ever seen on this channel just because
it has the truck ones and also I use a
pretty short length of pipe to get the
slider going here you can use as long as
you want in fact the longer pipe you use
the better and cooler the shots going to
be awesome now if you're into taking
portrait shots you might want to use
like a direct light source to add a
unique look to these ya a ring lights
probably what you want but they can be
really expensive so let's see sabinius
is going to show us way to make a DIY
ring light using tech you probably
already have using a ring flash or a
ring light is a really great way to get
a nice even look for your portraits and
also your close-up photography it helps
to give a nice shadowless effect on your
subjects face and also gives a cool halo
effect in their eyes but traditional
ring flashes or ring lights can be
expensive especially if you only just
want to experiment with a technique I'm
going to show you how to make your own
DIY ring light using tools that you
hopefully already have at hand like a
big screen monitor or a TV what you'll
need is a camera that gives you exposure
control a tripod and that big screen
that I mentioned you'll also need to
make sure that your monitor or TV can
display an image on it step 1 download
the ring light image from the how-to
article on cnet or you can make your own
what you'll need is a black background
and then on that you'll need to draw a
white circle and inside of that a
smaller black circle step to display
that image on your monitor or TV full
screen turn the brightness up all the
way you can if the blacks start turning
into a bit more of a gray dial the
brightness back a bit and boost your
contrast step 3 put your camera and
tripod in front of the screen in the
middle of the center black circle you're
going to want to crank up the ISO
sensitivity to around 1600 or 3200
because you'll be shooting mostly in the
dark turn out all the lights and
position your subject right in front of
the
camera so the ring light is providing
all of the light onto your subject to
position yourself or the subject you
might want to use a camera with a
flip-out screen turn on auto focus and
then take a few shots trial and error to
see exactly where the light is falling
the circular ring light works best for
the most even look but feel free to do
things like triangles squares any other
shape you can imagine this DIY ring
light isn't exactly the most portable
solution out there but it's a great way
to get bang for your buck with gear that
you already own that's it for this
week's show we hope you enjoyed it and
we hope we inspired you to go out there
and take some great photos if you did
you can email us the fixed at cnet com
