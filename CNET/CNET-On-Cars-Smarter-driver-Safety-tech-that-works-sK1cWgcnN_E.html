when buying a car rear cameras they'll
be mandatory in all new cars by May 20
18 meanwhile they're becoming pretty
common but look for differentiating
features like a variable angle rear cam
a front cam or surround view cameras
cross traffic alert this warns of cars
that are about to t-bone you as you
creep out of a blind spot if another
vehicle is approaching from the side the
system notifies you with warning lights
in the side mirrors and a warning beacon
adaptive or smart cruise control this
maintains not just speed but the
distance between you and the car ahead
cruise control without this is beginning
to seem like unguided missile mode
forward collision technology it'll
either warn you and lights up a warning
on the dash and sounds an alarm to alert
the driver to the vehicle ahead and
there's the warning or actually apply
the brakes when you're closing too fast
on something in front of you and there's
the auto break people stop by itself the
insurance industry has found that either
version of this can make a real
difference in the rate of claims lines v
tach like forward collision it will
typically warn you of a car in your
blind spot you'll see an Amber icon
illuminated in the mirror to the same
side as the overtaking vehicle and on a
few cars it will take active measures to
keep you from drifting into its path
Blind Spot Assist can take active
measures by applying the brakes on the
wheels on the opposite side of the
vehicle the vehicle is steered out of
the danger zone lane departure tech also
available as a passive warning or a
corrective version note the calibration
of this when you take a car on a test
drive this is set at the factory and
some are just sort of off adaptive
headlights these steer with a car's turn
they can buy you up to 15 feet of
reaction time at 30 miles an hour that's
about 7 pedestrian whips 6 more than you
need to avoid hitting so
object detection this calls out people
or animals straying into your path
especially at night that you may not see
a variant of this is night vision
display which gives you a real-time
infrared view of the road ahead it's
night vision the driver sees
approximately three times further than
is possible with conventional low beam
lights the display shows the driver a
clear black-and-white image of the
driving scene drowsiness warning this
one is still fairly rare drowsy driver
alert systems use a variety of sensors
and cameras to monitor your driving
behavior new innovations in this area
are coming a few model years down the
road most of these technologies are
factory installed and not something you
can retrofit so it pays to double check
if your next car offers them or if the
other car on your list does more
