Counting traffic can be a nightmare
that's why we're taking a look at the
future of transportation your aircraft
is outside and will depart in five
minutes
welcome to what the future on today's
show goobers vision for on-demand air
travel the unveiling of the world's
first Hyperloop passenger pod and a
lunar lander that aims to bring us
closer to Mars let's get into it the
most obvious way to ease traffic is to
add a third dimension
that's why Ober aims to take us to the
skies with uber air uber has been
developing its electronic vertical
takeoff and landing aircraft for some
time now the design seats up to four
passengers it could someday move at
speeds of up to 150 to 200 miles per
hour and travel up to 60 miles on a
single charge
uber has also shared several potential
sky port designs the Skyport components
will be modular meaning they could be
combined in different configurations and
scaled up or down with relative ease the
unique design could handle up to 200
flights per hour when they arrive at the
Skyport uber aircraft will enter an
autonomous queue where passengers can
board and disembark Los Angeles and
Dallas have been selected as the first
to launch cities along with a third
launch city that has yet to be announced
there are many safety and regulatory
hurdles standing in the way of this plan
the aircraft needs to be built an FAA
certified first uber is pushing to get
its flying taxis in the air by 2020 for
some demonstration flights and the
company hopes to have its paid air
service up and running by 2023 uber says
that uber air will cost about five
dollars and 73 cents per passenger mile
at launch
however if it can realize its goal of
creating a mass-produced automated
aircraft that price could fall to as low
as a buck 84 there are many companies
trying to stake their claim as the
future of Transportation comes into
focus Airbus and Terrafugia both have
their own airborne rideshare systems and
development and beneath the surface of
the earth a different race for
transportation domination
rages on I'm talking of course about
Hyperloop Hyperloop transportation
technologies also known as HTT recently
unveiled the world's first Hyperloop
passenger pod the 100-foot tube weighs a
whopping five tons and has been designed
to send passengers whizzing through
magnetic tubes at up to 700 miles per
hour the pod contains two layers of a
new smart material invented by HTT
that's called vibranium where have I
heard that name before
because by bringing him on the strings
this titanium all around HTT vibranium
is basically a type of carbon fiber
that's embedded with sensors that can
wirelessly transmit information about
temperature stability and integrity the
pod has a double layer of vibranium so
that there's a backup in case the outer
layer gets damaged hgts main competitor
is virgin Hyperloop 1 which has its own
prototype pods including a cargo pod and
a prototype passenger pod in Dubai that
was designed by BMW as cool as those
pods are it will still be several years
before you can take the Hyperloop to
work Richard Branson says he wants it up
and running in three years but with
safety and regulatory hurdles to be
overcome it could be even longer than
that sometimes the journey is less
important than the destination
especially when that destination is Mars
Lockheed Martin is developing a reusable
lunar lander that will live on the
moon's surface
never returning to Earth instead it will
shuttle astronauts to and from a space
station in lunar orbit which NASA calls
a gateway the lunar lander can carry up
to four crew members and enough supplies
to equip a lunar encampment for up to
two weeks
the lander can also use water collected
from the ice on the moon to produce
liquid oxygen and hydrogen propellant
the lunar gateway will serve as a
logistical Waypoint making it easier for
astronauts to explore the moon's surface
both NASA and Lockheed expected this
lunar gateway system could be an
important learning experience for
developing something similar to help
explore Mars in the
future it's time for a question from one
of our viewers richard Perryman asked us
on facebook who or what controls the
uber air traffic thanks for the question
richard uber says that urban air space
and current air traffic control systems
could accommodate up to hundreds of
vehicles without making any big changes
however to handle the air traffic
density necessary for this type of
flying service to become mainstream new
air traffic control systems will be
needed
uber envisions low altitude operations
will be automatically prioritized to
avoid conflicts while the vehicles
themselves will utilize a set of visual
flight rules similar to those used by
pilots when flying independent of air
traffic control
uber says that developing these new
control systems will take years and it
could end up being a limiting factor in
uber airs growth what makes you say WTF
let us know in the comments that's all
for this week thanks very much for
watching I'm Jesse Aurel filling in for
Andy Altman's we'll see you next time on
what the future</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
