clipping coupons on Amazon I'm Bridget
Carey and this is your cnet update
facebook is now in the fitness game the
social network bought a smartphone app
called moves it uses the sensors in your
smartphone to record your walking biking
and running and it puts all that data on
a timeline so you can analyze your
fitness habits facebook said the moves
app will remain as a separate app and it
is popular it's been downloaded more
than 4 million times but why does
facebook want a fitness app the name of
the game is data and with data about
your habits it could sell that
information to advertisers and perhaps
target you better but that's not all
facebook also wants to be a newswire
service the network has created Facebook
newswire it pulls news stories in that
are shared publicly on facebook so other
journalists can see what news is being
announced on facebook and then encourage
more reporters to depend on facebook so
facebook is your news channel but it's
also your gym and it's your telephone
service with messenger it wants to
provide internet with flying drones and
if that wasn't enough it's also trying
to control virtual reality with its
purchase of oculus VR it tried being
your phone but that didn't work out so
well and it tried being your email I
think Facebook just wants to be Google
but Google struggles to be Facebook the
google plus social network is not as
popular and Google was late to the
social game but the man who built
Google+ Vic Gundotra he stepped down and
announced on Thursday that he's leaving
Google after eight years with the
company now the vice president of
engineering for Google+ is stepping up
to lead the network and another giant
tech company news amazon has a new
grocery delivery service it's called
Amazon Prime pantry and if you subscribe
to prime which is now a hundred dollars
a year you get the option to buy a bunch
of dry goods and home supplies to be
delivered to your door and you can buy
cereal canned goods soap but it doesn't
include fresh foods that can spoil even
though you pay for
prime is still have to pay for delivery
there's a flat six dollar fee to fill up
one box and that box can hold up to 45
pounds you can see how full the boxes
while you shop and there are coupons to
clip to ease the pain of that shipping
fee but you better not be in a hurry it
could take up to five days to arrive
that's your tech news update you can
head to cnet com for more details on
these stories and be sure to follow
along on Twitter from our studios in New
York I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
