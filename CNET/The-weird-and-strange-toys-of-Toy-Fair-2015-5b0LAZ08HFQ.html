the 2015 Toyota t-ten to check out some
of the stranger toys little weird toys
perhaps basically I'm just trying to
fill the gaping holes in my childhood
because someone's parents didn't let
them play with everything they want to
do
these are to a modular robotic
construction kits we got two different
kits here the larger cubes are cubelets
it's a foreign up product and then this
one over here with the white blocks
that's moss it's for eight and up the
basic concept is that you have robot
pieces that come apart and each is
pre-programmed to do a specific function
way bracers is really cool because it's
gonna change the way kids play with toy
cars Robin says you turn the car on and
you wave your hand over the sensor and
that's when it's returned at how fast
the car goes on the track cool whoa
they're super fast they can up to nine
kilometers an hour and we tested them in
the office they can go to 140
consecutive loop this is two tracks we
combined it into one using our expansion
pack okay the track start at 1999 and
they go up to $39.99 I'm about to try
out this IO Hawk I mean if this guy can
do it I can do it just keep your body
upper body real quiet I'm moving to the
right this is how I always go to the
right think about turning the other way
you think I could go to the bathroom
like this what
with Nana piano the makey makey is a
keyless keyboard where you make your own
keys from everyday objects that conduct
electricity
I can ground you and then you can start
playing the bananas yourself - okay
right through each other
that's sick that's something I wrote
this morning yep that was close
please get me something more difficult
Brian so this is sands alive and it's I
cannot describe what this feels like
it's like it's amazing like what you
almost imagine a cloud would feel like
when you're looking up at a fluffy
totally right it's like clouds it's
actually made from real sand that is the
main ingredient really wonderful product
really I wouldn't lie to him on TV you
can mold anything and as soon as you do
it'll hold its shape you can bounce it
around you can play with it until you
reintroduce oxygen into it and then it
goes right back to its light fluffy
state oh my goodness the barber out and
then you catch your fish in a big wide
mouth bass so there's a real hook goes
in there I realize I learned a lot today
about some weird toys turns outs and
gonna have a big year not just for the
beach anymore also really enjoyed that
IO Hawk where I learned how to gyrate in
ways that I didn't think my pelvic
region could do but hey I'm here to
learn and that's just what I did thank
you so much for watching I'm Jeff
Bakalar we'll see you soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
