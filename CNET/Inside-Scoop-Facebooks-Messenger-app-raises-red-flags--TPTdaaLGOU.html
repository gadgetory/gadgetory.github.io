on CNET scars to boy today joined by Ann
Scherr senior writer at cnet.com thanks
for joining us Ann and today we're
talking about facebook Messenger and how
Facebook has basically forced its users
to migrate over download this app and
there's been a lot of backlash people
are not pleased yeah a lot of people are
not happy about it primarily because
there are a couple of things going on
right part of it is that they don't a
lot of people just don't like having to
have another app I've seen a lot of
people on Facebook complaining about why
do I have to download yet another app
from Facebook and then there's a lot of
questions around the privacy as well
because especially Android users are
getting this little pop-up saying it
wants access to all sorts of information
right and what's going on right right
okay so let's let's unbundle that one
first of all why is facebook making you
download a second app onto your mobile
device well this is a trend that's
happening throughout the technology
industry and the idea is that they can
create a better experience by doing this
right you have a more kind of defined
use for the app when you're going in a
messenger you're actively messaging
people versus when you're on Facebook
and you're kind of searching through the
feeds so that's part of the logic behind
it and I guess some of the positive news
has been that the messenger app is
pretty fast once you do actually
download it oh yeah I mean it works
exactly like Facebook generally right
it's pretty it's pretty reliable it
works pretty well I've been using it for
months and months of months and it works
now when it comes to the privacy issues
you said it mainly targets are specific
to the Android users was it's the
privacy the part of it is that the
privacy things have come up for Android
users so it's part of it is a is a
function of how Android works versus the
way Apple works so when you download an
app on Apple's iOS you will once you try
and do something like take a photo and
send it to your friends it'll say hey is
it okay if this app accesses the camera
and you say yes or no right with Android
they ask for all this upfront so
something you have this whole list of
things that it wants access to your
address book here are your camera and
all your microphone yeah right all of
these things oh my god right and so the
idea is it wants the same stuff that the
Apple one was right if you want to take
a photo instead of your friends it has
to has access to the to the camera if
you want to invite your friends to you
messenger it has to have access to your
contacts database it's just the way it
works and then for those people who just
are very resistant to are downloading
this new app or using it what
can they do to get around it you know
you don't have any options you know
there's always the option leave Facebook
that's that is always the last option
that you have but in the meantime if
you're if you still want to use Facebook
you you would go to the web if you don't
want to use these two apps or you stop
using messenger right altogether and you
just email or text friends the
old-fashioned way yeah fashioned by
today's standards thank you so much
