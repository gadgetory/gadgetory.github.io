jump right into the games you should be
looking out for in October up first is
rock band 4 hitting the ps4 and Xbox one
it's been a while since we've had a
plastic instrument game so if you've got
your old ones laying around collecting
dust they're going to work with rock
band 4 uncharted the nathan drake
collection hits playstation 4
exclusively on the ninth including all
three uncharted games in 1080p targeting
60 frames per second if for some reason
you didn't play these old games now is
absolutely the time to do it also
hitting the ps4 is the Kalos principle a
first-person game that tells a
metaphysical story while challenging you
with cerebral puzzles the wii u gets
another noteworthy game on October
sixteenth it's Yoshi's woolly world as
the adorable platformer finally makes
its way to the US the next chapter of
Assassin's Creed takes us to Victorian
England and Assassin's Creed syndicate
but the first time players will be able
to switch between two characters let's
just hope it's better than unity and on
October 27th WWE 2k16 hits the mat with
new features wrestlers and modes from
previous games in the past and on the
very same day the highly anticipated
halo 5 guardians hits the xbox one
complete with a brand new campaign story
and a fully featured online multiplayer
mode that'll do it for October I'm back
next ones with November's newest games
