editor at cnet and i'm here at Mobile
World Congress 2012 in barcelona spain
or LG's booth and i want to show you a
few things first we're to start with
LG's new elle style phone but three
phones in this is the l7 the l5 and the
l3 they all kind of just range and
features I'm going to start at the top
though I'm going to start with the l7
first you need to know that all the L
style phones have this real slim shape
very very thin they come in white they
come in black it's an eight point seven
millimeters thin and it has a sort of a
metallic finish so it really does look
nice nice 4.3 inch display pretty bright
pretty colorful this is running Ice
Cream Sandwich thats Android 40 also has
an NFC chip it has a 1 gigahertz
processor pretty nice features there
this is the optimus l7 now I have the
optimus l5 so looks a lot like the
optimus l7 as you see has that same
finish on the outside really thin just
as these facts have been scaled down so
instead of a 4.3 inch display we have a
four inch display we have 800 megahertz
processor instead of one gig still SFI
mexico camera still has a NFC chip and
it's going to have all the other
features you might expect but just those
top features have been scaled down but
the great thing is it does have ice
cream sandwich as well so yet another
good sign that manufacturers take an ice
cream sandwich seriously and we're
getting phones introduced to your mobile
Congress with the OS the last handset in
the else I'll series is the l3 as you
can see it is smaller than the other two
it's gonna have a 3.2 inch display it is
actually it's a little thicker than the
other phones it is just over 11
millimeters but still pretty thin I mean
it doesn't really make a difference has
a nice feeling in the hand you'd have a
texture material on the outside and it
still has that LC restyling it's just
that the outside is a little scale down
this the finish doesn't feel quite as
sharp you know the metal isn't as shiny
so but it is just scale down for the bud
for people off maybe on a budget specs
are also scaled down it's going to have
a 3 megapixel camera so there's no NFC
chip it is gonna have gingerbread so no
ice cream sandwich and it's gonna
800 megahertz processor otherwise you're
going to find all the other Android
features you might expect but as L style
series phones go this is the one that's
in the lowest of the scale I'm Ken
German here in mobile Congress 2012 in
Barcelona with LG's elle style phone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
