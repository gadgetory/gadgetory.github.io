David Katz Meyer after Amazon first
launched its original echo smart speaker
in 2014 it was a hit and it ushered in a
new era of voice computing but Amazon
has always kept its speakers in a sweet
spot the low end but a new report this
week says Amazon may release a high-end
amp receiver and subwoofer David can
Amazon do high-end audio I mean I think
Amazon's opportunity is not necessarily
high-end like ok so it's it's an
amplifier it's a AV receiver you can't
build one of those things for 99 bucks I
mean you can i mean maybe somebody has
but you know if amazon is gonna do this
product right you know it's gonna have
hdmi switching it's gonna be able to
amplify 5.1 speakers it's gonna have the
ability to be the hub of your you know
entertainment system not just like a
soundbar something like that so I think
it's gonna be like $2.99 for an AV
receiver with Alexa built-in that would
be a pretty sweet spot you know again
this is all conjecture we wrote an
article kind of kind of riffing on this
stuff another cool thing I think would
be if they integrated the fire TV cube
yeah which was a product that I really
liked it's basically a little Alexa
speaker that can control all your a/v
gear by using infrared emitters and and
IR codes and all this stuff so it's kind
of like the glorified util so remote you
can talk to build that into the AV
receiver and now you're talking you have
streaming you have all of this you know
speaker control amplification TV
interfacing built-in that's kind of my
dream really gonna do well is that the
idea that if they have this sort of
central node for your living room then
Amazon can sort of be your living room
is that the idea by having something
like that and and they've gone down this
road pretty far already by saying you
know Alexa turn on my TV and like it
really feels really cool like I use at
home for example like kids are watching
TV and they refuse to turn it off or
they can't find the remote I'm like
Alexa you know take care of this problem
for me the TV turns off and the kids
like oh and I have to mute it of course
cuz then they'll go like sigh turn on
the TV but Alexa ruining children's
happiness everywhere
absolutely all right TV OS so apple also
released this week an updated version of
its TV OS it's the operating system that
runs its popular Apple TVs so what's
what's the big what are the big changes
so we've been getting we got new iPhones
we got an Apple watch we didn't get a
new Apple TV sorry guys no Apple TV 8k
but you know there is some new software
out there it's in this he makes a pretty
minor update they added Dolby Atmos
which is the headline feature here so
that's Dolby's best sound thing it
actually creates height channels so
there's extra channels more speakers and
you know again it requires a pretty
high-end system to take full advantage
of so and also the correct content so of
course Apple's there to save the day
with iTunes and Atmos you know they're
actually promising the largest library
of films that have Atmos available
immediately which is cool and they'll
actually upgrade your existing Dolby
Digital only stuff to for free so you
don't need to pay extra to get that you
know high resolution audio so it's cool
for high-end dudes otherwise is kind of
minor the other thing is that they also
have the ability to be controlled by
third-party remotes so that's a new
feature and you can picture a Logitech
Harmony one of these remote control
companies coming in with a voice
operated remote you know that does Siri
which would be pretty cool you know if
they want to play ball together so
that's a future thing no no
announcements yet but that's one of the
things that might be enabled by this do
you think that an update like this does
it really matter like if you're not
getting a new box does this update
really do much for your the guy with you
know height channels and you're doing
backflips to be able to finally watch
you know whatever film in in at most no
it's it's it's a small update but there
are things are some other small little
tweaks like zero sign-on is that truth
came in this one yeah so zero sign-on is
the if you're a charter subscriber you
can immediately get all of your TV apps
turned on you know without having to
sign in so that's pretty cool there's
some other new features but yeah that's
that's it's it's again it's pretty small
alright thank you that's it for us I'm
Joni Salzmann David Katz Meyer thanks
for listening
you know we did we hit that
four minutes
all right thanks everybody for joining
us for the recording of the audio
podcast that we'll publish later today
you can get links to subscribe to that
in the description down below right now
it's time for me to go digging through
the cesspool that is the chat I kid we
love you you send in great comments and
questions and we keep the conversation
going
first up right out the gate James fever
wants to ask will it cost
this of course referring to the alleged
new Amazon smart I don't want it to say
the trigger word Amazon smart speaker
high-end audio model with a cost as much
as the Apple home pod I sure as hell
hope not it's expensive to build one of
these yeah and the kind of the the while
the wild card here is that Amazon can
have a loss leader like they can price
it less than they make it for yeah
they've done that before in other
products what do you think about it yeah
I think again their opportunity is to
come in lower than the denims and the
Sony's of the world and really kind of
you know $2.99 is a very cheap baby
receiver could as vibrant one and and a
bunch of HDMI inputs and and and all the
stuff you'd expect any of you receiver
plus Alexa maybe they'll go a little bit
higher than that I can't see them really
building something decent for lower than
that there's also the amp which isn't
really touch on in the podcast the any
amplifier basically to me means like a
two channel thing so so knows which is
in this game as well those guys just
released their own amp which they've had
for years and it's always been really
expensive and it's still 600 bucks
and so if Amazon come in and undercut
that again a bureau speaker a little box
that you entertainment guys love and the
has Alexa and allows you to do all the
fun stuff that you know it already does
sorry guys
a lax a as we say home or the a word The
Scarlet Letter would you say is that any
way that you know that's a cool product
and there's a subwoofer what's the
subwoofer from Amazon gonna be it's like
a thing that talks really deep right
like I can't do that
my Wi-Fi is disconnected like I don't
know but yes it's subwoofer so yeah who
knows and I'm not familiar with this the
market for you like what kind of markets
is Amazon really have to
look towards what well I'll tell you the
general trend we'd review a lot of home
audio products has seen that the general
trend has been away from AV receivers
and separate boxes toward speakers not
necessarily you know echo speakers the
denying dollar price point but
integrated sound bars are really the
thing right so and of course there's
already Alexa enabled sound bars out
there that we mentioned Sonos they have
one at 399 or the Sonos beam and then
there's also cheaper product called the
pulk command bar which is a big sound
bar made by paul clone an audio brand
and it has like a dot like kind of
embedded in the middle of it you know
it's a weird you know Franken product
but that's another thing that you can
talk to that gives you good audio you
know so it's it's a it's a small market
I think I would say for the amp and the
receiver yeah unless they do something
really cool which who knows Amazon they
can yeah yeah we have a lot of money to
throw out do you have other questions Oh
plenty yeah from James is Amazon making
or Amazon is supposed to be making eight
plus voice assistant integrated products
by the end of 2018 is this one of them
or is this a complete red herring here
yes so you're talking about that leak
the CIC report and eight-plus was in
there among the products that you know I
don't care as much about but other
people do is a microwave yeah with Alexa
and Rach our gadget they said specified
car gadget yeah so we'll see and we do
expect we've already written extensively
about this but we do expect a new Amazon
show echo show which is their thing with
it with us with a screen on it yeah and
what else new dot I think they have so
many products I mean there's already
eleven Alexa powered gadgets period and
yeah and the line um so all I have to do
I mean like that gives them plenty of
opportunity to update one of them well
does it stick that's kind of what it
feels like a receiver a subwoofer and a
microwave and a car gadget right right
just might as well just you know what's
next you know my shoes have a Lexington
man
walk don't trip don't trip you trip
though you have the Apple watch should
be like oh I'm tripping oh that's right
Falls and it tells you which is a very
good feature I think you know for safety
for our older listeners if you fall over
and you know you have an Apple watch
series 4 on it will alert the
authorities if there's a long period of
time when you're you know not responsive
so that's actually pretty pretty good
for I think I think that's great but I
will admit that my knee-jerk reaction
when I saw is like do I really need a
device to tell me if I fell I'm pretty
aware that I fell you will in a couple
years BVG going back on to what we were
talking about with Amazon mark dybul
wants us to expand and wonders if Amazon
and their voice assistant is going to be
starting to make a stronger move is this
the next step for them is to move into
the automotive industry mmm I mean the
automotive industry is interesting
especially with audio because the vast
majority of listening especially
traditionally has always been in the car
I mean that's like and then because car
replacement cycles are so wide because
the development cycle of a car is so
much longer than a smaller device it's
been one of those sort of very difficult
areas to break through with technology
also you know like it's how long has it
taken to get connectivity in cars well I
think that's really the issue is you
know when you're driving around your car
you don't necessarily have perfect
reception for Wi-Fi which a you know an
Alexa requires and you can't even have
your home Wi-Fi go down and have it work
so you know once you get past that
hurdle of you know 4G in the car then
you know you're in a really good spot
and I think that is you know one of the
more promising products that has a
really use case I mean there are ways to
get Alexa in the car today but for
Amazon to come forward and say you know
here's how we're really putting this
thing in a gadget with a cigarette
lighter adapter or whatever and and and
maybe some kind of cellular connection
that would be pretty cool
yeah quickly to the Prime mobile Louis
Furman points out that Bo's already came
out with a smart speaker that has a
voice assistant in it that's opposed 500
James and Matthew were both wondering if
Amazon is going to try to develop their
own sound bar mmm yeah so you know like
everybody says they're a crap-ton
metric crap-ton of a speaker partners
out there for Alexa and one of the
things sorry for the scarf or a so once
Amazon you know it gets these things
they usually start with their third
party you know developers and then they
progress to yeah hey we're gonna make
this ourselves and sometimes if you're a
Bose or a so knows you're like me I wish
you wouldn't do that Amazon but in
Amazon comes out with a thing that's
cheaper and just as good you know that
sells massive amounts cuz they put it on
the front of their webpage so maybe
that's gonna happen with these smart
speakers if you're a Bose or a Sonos you
might not have as much to worry about if
you're a pulk and it's somebody that's a
little lesser known brand that doesn't
charge as much you're in a different
market then maybe you're kind of quaking
in your boots about what's gonna happen
here but we'll see I mean again I think
there's room for a lot of this stuff
people's appetite for you know far-field
smart stuff in their home seems to be
you know pretty ravenous right now so
yeah we'll see you know ya could
amazon's unnamed voice assistant ever
workout 4G or 5g mmm
yeah surprised I haven't seemed age that
it wasn't already that that seems like
101 kind of thing yeah I again with the
gun back the car that's the best use
case I mean it there's no point in
building special if you're Amazon and
you're building to a price point putting
that in in the home but yeah if you're
talking about something portable you
know the the tap speaker comes to mind
which is basically a portable little guy
that you can bring out to your backyard
if you had enough Wi-Fi and get that to
work so you know I think that's again it
cost money to put a cellar antenna in it
costs even more to pay right you know
the fee or whatever it is and you know
to get that that activated so yeah
absolutely technically possible and I
wouldn't be surprised if you know at
some point Amazon came out with that
Timothy do says cats why is there no
love for the DTS ma HD I have no idea
what you're talking about
oh he's is that DT is that master audio
I don't know what he's talking about I
literally don't maybe you could expand a
little bit but it is the master audio
okay the lossless codec from DTS yeah
yeah that's been out for a while um I
loved it as much as any other 5.1
channel surround sound lossless codec
but yeah when when you probably talked
about Apple TV and the fact that has
Atmos
DTS X is their atmospheric equivalent
from what I understand that doesn't
really stream all that well so DTS X is
the high-end equivalent of Dolby Atmos
form DTS which is Dolby's main
competitor in the surround sound space
for codecs and DTS X is available on 4k
blu-rays right now but I haven't heard
of it being available to stream from
anybody maybe correct me if I'm wrong so
you know apples obviously chasing the
thing that is the most important in the
marketplace right now which is
unquestionably Atmos DTS X has a late
start on that so maybe they'll catch up
and you can always add another audio
codec with software maybe so what does
the industry response going to be to
Amazon releasing higher-end speakers you
think Google's gonna jump back into the
fray how hard is Apple going to like
slam on their quality of the home home
home pod and their whole audio fidelity
well I'm surprised if Apple went in the
direction of like an amp in a receiver
yeah
because they're they're all about their
thing is making it all in one and making
it easy and making it beautiful and the
idea of these products is that you are
an aficionado you can cobble together
exactly what you want and not what Apple
tells you is the best way to have it
combined yeah you can buy on speakers
and write and and and that's a pain in
the butt I mean you think it's hard to
wire you know a sound bar imagine 5.1
speakers with their double wires going
across your room and it's a nightmare
no it's same same thing especially with
Google like they have the googled max
which is their equivalent of the home
pod it's a $400 you know smart speaker
you know we haven't really heard of
Amazon going that way and and to
understand the home pod in the max are
relatively disappointing in terms of you
know market penetration and sales they
you know those are high-end things and
you know Apple at least has a bunch of
enthusiasts they're willing to pay
whatever Google can't really say that
you know so an Amazon even less so so
I'd be surprised if Amazon came out with
a max style 303 and $50 speaker yeah
just a couple of minutes left here's one
from Josh Buddha who is this actually
going to be for I thought most people
already just connecting their echoes
into high-end speaker systems that's
what I do at home great question so yeah
we didn't talk about this but you can
already connect your dot with it even
with an audio output but you know
there's ways to interface it even more
deeply into your audio system a lot of
AV receivers for example a work with
Alexa now so yeah
again I think Amazon's angle is gonna be
cheaper that's what they've done in the
past you know that's my safe bet is that
they're just gonna make something that's
all integrated all-in-one and you know
undercut all these are their AV
receivers out there and the benefit
there if they do make it a product where
they lose money on it the idea is that
if you establish yourself as the
assistant in the home in your living
room in that heart then that sets you
for the entire next stage of that
computing that's a really good point
kind of getting in there and being like
alright I'm the ecosystem now sorry
Apple and Google you know you're using
Amazon stuff it's a short-term loss for
a long-term game if that's the play that
they're actually making yeah yeah we'll
see I mean the it and you know the
reader has a good point it's hard to you
know
think of people in the audiophile
universe going oh yeah Amazon great
sounding stuff
so kind of snobby bunch are they gonna
come up with a brand you know maybe
they're gonna come up with a new brand
like they did for clothing or you know
it's not an echo product I mean echo has
weird audio audio connotations anyway
anyway anyway but when they do come out
with the thing maybe they'll use their
Amazon music brand we wrote that you
know I feel like that's a brand that
Amazon might want to push and maybe
they'll start saying you know here's our
audio gear that's for Amazon music who
knows you know what they're going to do
yeah
our nesto says that the Sonos Beam is
killing the game for me linked up to the
Sonos one sure does the job that makes
me want to ask cats and Joan what do you
guys run it for audio at home he answers
gonna be very boring because I live in a
small Manhattan apartment with very thin
walls and so my audio system is like a
Bluetooth speaker that's very small but
I put right next to my husband and I in
bed so that our neighbors who share our
wall can't hear anything yeah so when
we're watching Game of Thrones it's like
right next to our ear nice yeah I live
in suburbia with you know a decent sized
living room and I just have a Denon 5.1
receiver I've some appeareance speakers
wired for surround uh Atlantic sub
everything's controlled with a logitech
harmony which is you know a little bit
old-school but you know again I have
that logitech harmony does talk to my
Amazon product and I can do a lot of
stuff with that interface and it works
really really well a lot of people out
there are using you know again Alexa
with a bunch of other gear like I am
already and it's it's pretty sweet and
you know if anybody hasn't had a real
5.1 system and you move into a space
that can support it I highly recommend
it it's wonderful for gaming and for
everything else oh yeah no it's it's
worth it come out to the suburbs
for me I'm running a Samsung 5.1 system
that's got some miles on it it's really
nothing all that flashy but I'm a
similar situation with Jonah I've got
neighbors not quite as tight but just
enough for me to try to be considerate
until I pump up the Yamaha RN 303 when
it's time
to listen to Steely Dan at night and
then I apologize profusely put my
neighbor's we are just about out of time
Ernesto goes on from his prior comment
to say I want Google assistant on Sonos
one and beam sonís have been saying
they'll update since January still
hasn't released anything yeah we got
some Google fans in there we got some
immense Amazon fans in there no one's
bringing up the XP though
shocker no love is that is that Apple's
product whose product is that well no
Bixby and Siri are both sort of in their
own little corner of the party where
nobody actually wants to talk to them
yeah that's just why picture he's got
like a top hat and like a I don't ask
I'd make sure bowtie and renders right
right he's and like pants that go up too
high showing his ankles poor Bixby
eventually somebody will be his friend
just out of pity I think that's a series
doing serious his friend at the party
out of pity
she's really nice she's alright yeah ok
ok anyway is that it yeah we're at the
end of the show before we go closing
thoughts where is the next place that
Amazon's voices system is going to
infiltrate mmm
we got microwaves we got TVs we got
speakers maybe shoes yeah hopefully not
the bathroom that's a little weird
Alexa flush you know like the
dishwashers there you go don't forget to
wash your hands and your prime sink in
the kitchen right yeah that's everybody
well I mean they don't the show yeah
they don't do like microwaves yet so I
really hope that happens Alexa and
Alcorn automotive yeah it's a big it's a
big wide open field for anyone to want
to it's gonna be everywhere won't it
being is the real world
hopefully the bathroom alright take one
last sip of your prime soda it's time to
say prime bye thanks everybody for
joining us on the 359 podcast we'll be
back tomorrow and hopefully maybe we'll
talk about that new Playstation that we
miss the boat on yeah prime by from ok
