to the Apple buy for her things good and
bad inside the world of Apple I got it
check this out I finally got my iPhone
6s and it looks exactly like the iPhone
6 but can your phone do this see I cap
ich and pop just like that pick a pop
all right Apple announced they sold over
13 million iPhones in the first three
days of availability and topping last
year's 10 million unit sales record I'm
enjoying the 6s and even though 3d
touches in its infancy the potential is
huge there's nothing out there on the
market like it today
and it will be a game-changer moving
forward pick a pop now what else might
be Apple up to with 3d touch patently
Apple reveals a newly granted patent for
3d animated maps that could be
manipulated by touch and logically 3d
touch the example shows a body of water
that could be touched to then animate it
and in 3d view that water could even be
reflected against the surface of
buildings ooh
not sure why I would ever do that also
they told us touch ID was twice as fast
but it's so freakin fast that you can
only see your lockscreen for a split
second I know I'm not the only one with
this homescreen quickie issue now the
other standout feature we know is the
updated iPhone 6s camera camera plus
co-founder Lisa Bettany has been doing
her iphone camera comparison for years
at snap snap snap that show off the
differences with every generation of
iPhone cameras side-by-side now it's
really worth checking out to see how
each camera handled things like backlit
pictures daylight against the yellow
helicopter low-light situations or a
group of pencils in a macro shot her
verdict not surprisingly as the 6s is
the best iPhone camera today but seeing
how it is involved is really cool and if
you're having trouble with bad low-light
photos on the iPhone 6s users have
discovered that it's best to turn the
live photos feature off in these
situations the reason a live photo is
constantly recording at 12 frames per
second and it cannot leave the exposure
long enough to capture more light for a
clearer image so the tip of the day in
low-light situations
don't use live photos
also Apple hasn't advertised improve
water damage protection with the success
but as I fix it found they've added a
perimeter gasket around the 3d touch
display and there's new silicone seals
to cable connectors that will greatly
help to keep liquids out of its
internals now the silicone seals were
described in an Apple patent earlier
this year and it looks like they've
implemented them with the 6s Zac strahle
kept both the iPhone 6s and 6s plus in a
bowl of water for an hour and they were
both fine afterwards but I device help
put the 6s under 4 feet of water and it
didn't fare as well so the new iPhones
are pretty water resistant but
definitely not waterproof all right you
can guess there's already a few iPhone 7
reports floating out there I know
there's this one for a strengthened
waterproof casing and a report that
Apple may ditch the metallic casing all
together for the next iPhone really guys
the iPhone 6s just came out but maybe
something that has a little more
substance behind it from patently Apple
check this out Apple has recently
granted 28 patents and the most fun and
intriguing one an iPhone with a
wraparound display the product with the
diagram shows off a transparent housing
and a flexible display assembly and
closed within that housing you can see
how the wraparound screen increases the
available display area Samsung did it
all right but it's a fun look at what
could be coming in the future now Mac OS
10 El Capitan is now available for
download as a free update featuring a
split screen view faster app launching
and approved spotlight search and faster
performance so we'll be checking it out
this week but it looks like a solid
update and it's the best price for free
apple also released its latest iOS nine
point zero point two update that helps
with bug fixes Apple's podcast app from
crashing and more and Apple released the
third iOS 9.1 beta to developers is the
iOS you've been waiting for with new
planet wallpapers and the only emojis
we've been waiting for like the burrito
and taco more emoticons and the middle
finger that will be able to change skin
tones you know I've always felt like I
was missing the right thing two emoji
sometimes so thank you Apple
alright that's gonna do it for this
week's show email me at the Apple bite
at cnet.com or
tweet me at Brian Tong for new baking
recipes thanks so much for watching
we'll catch you all next time for
another bite of the Apple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
