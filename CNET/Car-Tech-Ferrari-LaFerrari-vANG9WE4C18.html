generated as much attention as this new
hybrid introduced into 2013 geneva auto
show well this hyper is a Ferrari so
that's probably why this model is called
laferrari it's a very limited edition
Ferrari was only going to make 499
examples of it and it uses a hybrid
system that Ferrari has been developing
for a little while and as shown in
development forum at a number of auto
shows this hybrid system is called
hikers hy ke RS that's answer hybrid
kinetic energy recovery system this
hybrid system is composed of a 6.3 liter
v12 engine plus and 167 horsepower
electric motor attached to a 7-speed
dual-clutch gearbox it all comes in one
big long component and the whole unit
produces 950 horsepower and 664
pound-feet of torque that electric motor
provides a lot of boost gets this car to
62 miles per hour in under three seconds
according to Ferrari they also say a top
speed of over 217 miles per hour there's
a lot more high-tech features of this
Ferrari it actually has a magnetic
adaptive suspension and it also has an
electronic differential the entire body
and chassis is made of carbon fiber and
this carbon fiber is actually built
constructed in Ferraris own racing
department so Ferrari owners will have a
little bit of f1 development in their la
Ferraris this is of course a road car
but it does use active aerodynamics as
well to increase downforce it has veins
underneath the car that flip up and down
to channel air and also an active
spoiler that moves up depending on speed
to add downforce and improve handling
the cockpit is also f1 inspired it uses
a 12 point 3 inch digital instrument
panel and the driver can actually have
it show a standard tachometer more
traditional for re sense or a modern
racing display because there's only
going to be 499 units you probably won't
see too many of these in the Y
ferrari's aiming these at the dedicated
Ferrari collector I'm when cutting them
here at the 2013 geneva auto show</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
