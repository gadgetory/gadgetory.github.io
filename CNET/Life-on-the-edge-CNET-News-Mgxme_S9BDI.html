to the border of the countries there's a
camp here called whore gauche very few
very little running water absolutely no
electricity here there are lights solar
lights they charge throughout the day
and then they can keep some light at
night but they don't work very well they
can also charge phones but they can only
get like 10 percent and that's useless
and there's no Wi-Fi here there's
connectivity if you can buy a SIM card
then you can connect and you can talk to
people but other than that there's no
Wi-Fi here you have to walk about an
hour to get someplace where there's
Wi-Fi you know it was really an
interesting contrast for me kind of
realizing you know how essential these
devices are and also how worthless they
can be at the same time depending on
what you're able to do with it the
people that are migrating now not
exclusively but tend to be poorer
they're less educated and they have had
less access to technology there was
essentially no tech in this camp and
it's basically because the government
both Serbian and Hungarian don't want
the people to be there they don't want
them to be comfortable so they're not
really doing anything to make it
hospitable you have over 600 refugees
and asylum seekers waiting majority of
them women and children and living there
in dire conditions that's not a place
for human beings to beat earlier today
we saw a newborn baby six days old in
one of these tents
and it's just incredible to think that
there's an infant living here so I took
this 360 camera with me to the camp
and a lot of people came up to see what
it was they really didn't understand
what was going on but for them the box
that it was sitting on was much more
important than the actual camera in
these camps like they're these
possessions these phones are basically
worthless like they're less valuable
than a brick or a box because you can't
even use them for housing
when refugees get to Serbia they find
that the border is closed and they
really have run out of options they
don't have anywhere else to move forward
to so they come here they come to a
center called info Park and technology
has seemed to be as much a curse as a
blessing to these people it's a way for
rumors to spread someone started a rumor
that it would be open for three days and
so a bunch of people went to the
Hungarian border for that three day
window when people would be allowed in
but never existed we always think of
technology as this huge tool that
connects us to the rest of the world
most of us we would rather like give up
like our shoes then give up our
smartphone there's nothing that's really
happening there to change the situation
to to help these people with technology
