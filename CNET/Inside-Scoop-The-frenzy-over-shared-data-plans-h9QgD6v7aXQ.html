inside scoop in here with me today is
Maggie Reardon author of the ask Maggie
column you can find every week and she
just recently explained the differences
of these new data plans we're seeing at
AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon where you share your
data but you have unlimited voice and
text and I have to ask what is the
number one question you get when it
comes to data plans from readers Wow
well the number one question I get is
how do I keep my unlimited data that's
something that that verizon has taken
away from a lot of subscribers out there
people who are grandfathered in now when
their contracts expire to be able to
keep their unlimited data plan they have
to buy a new phone or come with their
own phone but as long as you don't take
the subsidy you're okay you get to keep
it as long as you want and and that's
the question that everybody asks because
people are just deathly afraid of losing
that unlimited data yeah I don't I want
to keep my unlimited data I and a lot of
people are really focused around them is
it that much worse are we that much
worse off compared to keeping with our
unlimited plans well you know it's kind
of an irrational fear because people
don't actually need the unlimited data
plan most people are using on average
between 400 and 500 megabytes of data I
think the fear is that someday they're
going to need it you know they're going
to start streaming a lot of Netflix or
watching a lot of YouTube and they know
that it's out there and once you get rid
of your unlimited data plan you can't
get it back now with AT&amp;amp;T they're not
only offering this data share plan
they're still offering their old plans
and you cannot you can keep your
unlimited plan to if you decide to keep
upgrading with it you can hang on to
that unlike verizon right right so with
AT&amp;amp;T the unlimited data plans people
people can keep forever if they want now
they are putting a cap on how much data
you can use with that plan so they start
to slow you down after three gigabytes
but the other thing I think a lot of
people are confused about is I keep
hearing this even from the experts the
consumer advocates who say these plans
are terrible they're going to you know
people are going to pay so much more
than they ever were before and and
really people aren't paying more for
these plans for the share plans they're
there
just getting less and I think that irks
people and and also the ATT is giving
people a choice they don't necessarily
have to get these plans now with verizon
when they announced that when you
upgrade you're going to lose this
unlimited plan people were in an uproar
we heard from lots of readers who were
upset and AT&amp;amp;T didn't go down that same
route you think they try to learn a
lesson from verizon well I think it's
more that Verizon can do what it wants
because it's just a better carrier you
don't hear people complaining about
dropped calls or really crappy data
speeds because they have a solid network
they've always invested in their network
you know I'm someone who actually am an
ATT customer and I've thought about
moving to verizon because it's a better
service but it tends to be more
expensive they tend to be a little bit
more restrictive but but that's the
trade-off and they know that and so you
know if customers are really upset about
it they should vote with their wallets
and go someplace else well thanks Maggie
