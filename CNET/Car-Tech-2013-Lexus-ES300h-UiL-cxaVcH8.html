can't get with a hybrid power plant
including this the kind of hot looking
es let's drive this ES 300h hybrid check
the tech now the es used to always get
kind of some snide remarks for being
sort of dowdy a tarted-up camry you've
heard all the lines this is a pretty hot
looking car in this sedan class you've
got that trapezoidal mouth what does the
new Lexus look you come to so much
swoopy your lines down the roofline into
the rear and the cars got a little bit
of the Lexus LS bearing without being so
overbearing let's get inside now first
off when you get into this ES this is a
really nice car really nice materials
nice and soft I'm always amazed at how
smooth they polished this wood part of
the wheel in the Lexus but then it
starts to jar me a little bit there's
every single aspect of a French curve
used somewhere on this - you've got
trapezoids and you've got the Lexus
grille echoed here then you've got
tapers and it's kind of chaotic my other
problem is this color of the interior
I'm sorry but chamois colored hard
plastic doesn't do any carmaker any
favors and Lexus is no exception now
notice here we have a screen on this car
but we don't have navigation but this is
what they call a display audio system I
think it's optional but I doubt you'll
ever see an es hybrid that doesn't have
it you've got a knob controller here but
it's different than what you'd get with
nav which would be that Lexus palm
controller so everything changes but you
still have nav and controller for a
bunch of basic settings the most
interesting of which are your medium now
of course you've got AM and FM radio we
have HD radio on this car as well that's
part of an optional package though that
is not strictly bass if you go to the
media setting we have our CD slot right
here you see we get nice readout of the
text from the tracks there Gracenote
database and here's our bluetooth
streaming player now this is my Android
phone I'm not getting metadata it
doesn't mean that you won't on yours but
on at least mine ain't happening and
that's always annoying to me the good
news is we have very reliable AV RCP the
remote control protocol so this track
adjustment pause and play worked really
well for me every time I have a great
feel about the radio screens where they
do the actual meta tags coming in from
the RDS system they don't use all the
real estate that they could that second
law
in there where the tagline is it always
seems to be cutting something off and
sometimes it's kind of funny and of
course you see here we don't have Toyota
Lexus generally excellent app support
they call that into non Toyota inform on
the Lexus it's one of the best in the
business but you've got an option into
that now the other knob on the console
after you get rid of all this head unit
stuff is this one over here for your
drive select it's very interesting we've
seen it before on the CT you've pushed
it to go to normal mode you rotate once
to go to sport which also turns your
left gage from an eco gauge to attack
and lights everything up in red you go
to the left counterclockwise for eco
mode below that's a button for evey mode
to force it to an electric more often
than not and then on your transmission
you've got a sport mode this is starting
to become madness it's not just Lexus
this transmission by the way is a CVT
it's got a traditional shifting gate but
it's just a continuously variable
gearbox no real gears in there and you
do have a rear camera on this car but
that is optional although again I bet
every es hybrids probably going to ship
with this you get a wide-angle camera if
you go to a higher trim with now last
thing I want to point out in this car is
well the seats are very comfy they're
also very hot the seat heaters go from
position 1 which is ok that's too hot up
to position 3 which is good grief call
the Consumer Product Safety Commission
they kind of give me like a half point
in here somewhere these things are
serious now the EES has always gotten
lots of ribbing for being some kind of
fancy camry here is one place where it
does share the guts with a camry it's
hybrid motor this is not the Prius
powertrain it's the camry hybrid
powertrain 2.5 litre lean-burn inline 4
in spite of the fact this car is called
a 300 it's not a 3 liter couple that
with electric motor of course front
wheel drive only in that one choice CVT
gearbox 200 horsepower doesn't sound
like much but of course hybrids are full
of torque unfortunately Alexis doesn't
quote a torque number for this car so
we'll have to go on the road and see if
it has enough they do quote mpg of
course 40 city 39 highway for a car that
weighs nearly 3,700 pounds compare that
to the v6 on this car the standard gas
engine you'd be getting a much lower 20
1:31 MPG there is a real difference okay
it's a hybrid with a strong electric
mode so you put it the gear you start it
nothing happens the car just runs to
move a little odd to begin with this car
can go a few miles I think it's about 2
miles or so in Puri V mode and depending
on the conditions that can do that at
relatively high speeds up to about
freeway speed I think now there's a big
difference between sports where it
really pours on the torque electric
motors are good for that
and here's eco or it's really kind of
reticent to move well normal is actually
a great plan the ride quality dialed
together like a Swiss watch as you might
imagine nothing rattles at all on the
other hand the ride was a little bit
unrefined I told that they were trying
to get a sport ride which sometimes is
just how to place this car to me is a
luxurious kind of an affordable premium
sedan
and I got too much road input and the
real-world mpg we were seeing was
somewhere in the mid 30s a combination
of driving on freeway city up and down
hills in some trenches storms we had the
last few days that's a really nice real
world number one more thing about
driving this car there kind of anoint me
there's a very slight high-pitched whine
on deceleration or acceleration coming
from somewhere over here on the left
side of the dash the hybrid might be a
power inverter thing I'm guessing but I
can hear it my ears are pretty damn good
I guess that sounds like it's up around
15k or more but it annoys me after a
while I want it to stop
Arlis price this 2013 ES 300h about
thirty nine seven is your base with
destination won't have a lot of tech at
that point you can add about twenty six
hundred bucks to get navigation premium
audio and a few other niceties that
would be kind of your main entry point
to go see that style to go hog-wild
though you spend ten thousand six on top
of the bass and that gets you every tech
toy in the book and these guys do all
their technology pretty well so very
little if any of it is going to be waste
