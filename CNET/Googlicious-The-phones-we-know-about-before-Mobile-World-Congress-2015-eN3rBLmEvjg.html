google inches for everything that we can
pack inside the show let's jump into it
and we know that Google Wallet has been
around long before Apple pay but it
didn't get any major traction at all
because really it just wasn't that good
well the success in buzz around Apple
pay has helped to educate people more
about mobile payments bringing some
momentum back to Google and they're now
primed to make a big push with wally
google recently announced that of Google
Wallet app will now come pre-installed
on some of the carrier phones from AT&amp;amp;T
t-mobile and Verizon running Android
KitKat or higher Samsung is planning on
rolling out their own payment system
after the recent acquisition of loop pay
sometime in the next month and a report
from The Wall Street Journal also claims
google is planning to completely revamp
its wallet service at this year's Google
i/o developer conference now rumors and
reports have connected the big G with
the mobile payments company soft card
that allows you to tap and pay with
their app right now so finally mobile
payments are becoming a reality here in
the US in 2015 just a decade behind some
other countries but hey better late than
never now we're just about a week away
from Mobile World Congress where all the
heavy hitters will release their latest
smartphones but there's still plenty
that's being teased or just outright
leaked t-mobile showed off more than a
sneak peak with this complete profile
shot of the galaxy s6 edge version with
a pink glow on the side for effect
Samsung even put out a little teaser
video for the s6 on their Twitter
account to get fans hyped up for the
announcement or you guys and gals should
just look at this pic we showed you last
week HTC is teasing a bigger boom for
their upcoming HTC One m9 a clear
reference to their boom sound technology
there's also plenty of renderings for
the expected m9 codename kima that I've
been covering the interwebs and we
expect to see that at Mobile World
Congress as well pebble is jumping on
the hype machine and by the time you see
this will know what their newest pebble
smartwatch will look like well it
probably looks like this after this
image accidentally appear on the website
and was
and removed whoops now the next gen
SmartWatch is expected to have a thinner
design a color epaper light display and
an entirely revamped operating system
that's been redesigned by the team
behind Web OS and check your mail boxes
Motorola is inviting select members of
the press to an exciting announcement
later this month but even cooler a
mystery box is scheduled to arrive to
those select members on febuary the 25th
now there's no word on what's in the box
but I'm sure it won't be this and before
we see what the next LG g4 might look
like LG hit us up earlier with four new
mid-range phones that share a striking
similarity in design to the g3 they are
the LG magma spirit Leon and joy now
their screen sizes range all the way
from five inches down to four inches and
even their exact specs will be different
depending on market but we're still
expecting to see the big boy g4 at
Mobile World Congress all right make
sure you guys stick with us at cnet com
next week we'll have all the in-depth
coverage of Mobile World Congress major
announcements first impressions and
really everything under the Sun and
since we're on the topic of son I'll be
out of town next week so we'll be
skipping an episode of the googs so you
guys can always email us at google
issues at cnet com or tweet me up brian
