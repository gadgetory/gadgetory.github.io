my name is Stephen Beecher i am brian
song and I am hollywood welcome to buzz
out loud the show that is one day late
today it's episode 15 little late and 86
it's a little bit late but we're here
both of us in the same building for the
first time in probably months rare this
is very rare there's a lot going on and
so we actually want to start the show we
want to just dive right in with our big
announcement which I'm really nervous
about gonna have to do it again my
heart's beating I know I mean yeah tone
of her voice goes buzz that lot is going
away April fail your me one second april
fifth april fifth will be our last day
our last show we are ending cnet live in
general is going away it's part of a big
shift at Cena we are really changing our
focus away from audio podcast moving
really heavily into on-demand video
there's some really exciting stuff going
on and i'm doing exciting stuff and and
and i think you know in a few minutes
you'll understand part of why i like
I've been on the road so much and we've
all been on the road but a lot a lot is
changing you're going to see major
changes to seen it live most of the
podcasts are going away and and will be
eventually replaced by on-demand video
shows in some form or be significantly
changed the 404 is remaining but they're
making major changes to the format there
um but this is really hard for us it's
really hard like this is the show's been
six years of my life like it's pretty
much my it's my baby yeah but everything
everything even even I Love Lucy had to
end that's
Bonnie our producer keeps up sure
everything has to change your errands
and back shows you know the other thing
guys is you're not leaving we're still
here we're still things you'll see
there's nothing that will probably make
the community that you guys have really
built this show and made it what it is
the people in the live chat room we see
we see what you're saying we hear you're
saying a lot of no's and we're gonna
still be here for special major
announcements and events yes but overall
it's it's a shift philosophically with
what cnet as a whole is doing and we're
not leaving you we're still going to be
working on more things we're going to
show you something a little bit but it's
just the natural transition of what
we're doing here at cnet and yes
sometimes business gets in the way we
still don't get us wrong we love what we
do we're still here at cnet none of us
are leaving cnet but this is going to be
a natural transition for us as a company
to to do things that are going to help
us and still be able to provide you guys
with content in just a different way and
you know change can be hard but change
is always for is for the most part for
the better I mean those of you listening
I change is not good and some people
have been even telling us it feels like
the shows going away and our schedules
have been all over the place and you
know it's it's a thing with other
obligations and things that we're
working on as a whole has started a pull
away from this and I think you guys
would rather see us do great content
that you enjoy then something that is
kind of limping on its way out maybe you
know and so that's the we you know we
love you guys like you guys have meant a
lot for me just to develop my skills as
a podcaster and to be a part of this I
mean Stephen is amazing he's still going
to be here producing shows there you
know reporters roundtable will still be
one of the on-demand shows right I'm
still going to be doing round table and
we're pitching a bunch of new shows and
there's a whole bunch of things in the
oven right now that are getting baked
and it's going to be really exciting and
I just want to say it's been an honor
and a privilege to produce this show and
I had a blast it's like changed my life
you know it's been a year I'm getting
alpha clamped right now you but uh it's
my phone see the buzz out loud fans have
just like embraced me and been so nice
tweeting me nice things and just been
really awesome ride and I appreciate
everything from you guys so don't worry
everything's going to be awesome
I was going to go on or not this show
but shows will go show I cnet show will
go on and we we will before we get to
what we're working on next we will have
an epic final show for those we hope
there's going to be an epic final show
so please tell your friends make sure
you're here april fifth is going to be
our final show tom veronica and Jason
the house have all agreed to be in the
house and and I'm hoping that that you
guys will start sending us your
reminiscences your your thoughts your
favorite moments you know send us a
video a piece of audio embarrass us feel
free and and we're hopefully you know I
mean I think we should just make this
sucker like a two-hour-long blowout
maybe the whole day I don't even know um
it's it's gonna be super hard but I want
you to know all of that said that I am
so excited about what's coming next so
justjust even what is coming at cnet you
know you're going to get there's a
loaded is morphing into a new show
called Cena update that with Bridget
Carey which i think is going to be
amazing it's just going to be it's a
very like newsy daily cool show it will
be available in audio form so there will
still be some audio options and that
one's gonna it's going to be really
focused on mobile delivery and I think
that's going to be really exciting and
um I've been working on a project that
i'm really excited we should you want
one we just feel time and show you guys
show well I want to talk about what
you're working on too well I'll talk
about it after we talked about your
family and it's I'm not gonna really
tell them what I'm working on I got I
got guys a little further along than
because I got secrets he has secrets I
have been working on developing a new
long-form show for cnet that I hope to
eventually transition to broadcast with
CBS but we really want to start it as a
web show because I'm super excited about
some of the innovative like stuff that
we can do in terms of delivery and in
terms of interaction with the show it's
going to be called always on and we
actually have a trailer let me roll it
here we go yeah hi I'm Hollywood and
welcome to always on the show where we
test torture and occasionally destroy
new tech so that it can stop driving you
crazy and start making your life better
every week we will stress test the
hottest new gadgets in our custom lab
and give you creative tips on how to
master the tech in your life plus the
latest news in-depth stories and
interviews with a unique interactive
format that makes every viewer part of
the show Google's deal to buy motorola
mobility is almost done anonymous has
hacked the vatican again the new ipad
comes out this week in surprise we're
expecting lines at the store
this is the pantech element from 80 they
say it's waterproof we're going to find
out look at but um don't use your tablet
in the bathroom that's gross on today's
road test we're gonna find out if the
Kindle Fire can take the heat in the
kitchen it's called chef's kitchen times
and it lets you run multiple timers and
if you're watching your weight you might
want to track calories it's really bad a
freezer bag oh yeah it still works they
say its military spec so today's road
test is actually a stairwell test so
works no cracks I want you to know we
threw this down the stairs 10 times so I
think it's safe to say it works imagine
if one single blood test could test for
HIV malaria tuberculosis and even some
kinds of cancer all at the same time and
all in about 10 minutes now I'm going to
try to control this skateboard with my
mind
did you run a man yell stop thinking
stop thinking so this is called little
bits and what they are our individual
circuit boards that you can attach
together via magnets and make whatever
you want alright our first piece of mail
comes from Facebook and it's about the
story we did on self-driving car after I
drop my headphones in the toilet I asked
you guys on Twitter which new ones I
should buy always-on is the show for
today's world where tech is part of
everyone's life we make that tech fun
accessible and we decode it to keep you
ahead of the curve stay tuned
hey I have a little chat room and I'm so
excited to see this because I'm so right
i feel like this is the show that's
gonna bring together so many of the
things that we've been doing it seen it
and I've been doing it seen it all this
time like this and this is how we get
mail bag coming back you know like the
little man is in there um so that yeah
this is what I've been working on we're
going to launch this show in June nice
launch date it is coming we're going to
be doing like it's it'll be a 30 minute
show on the web you know we'll deliver
it to you in shorter chunks on mobile
I'm I want to build an app for it but
we're going to we're going to be
building a lab we're going to be you
know freezing things and superheating
them and throwing them down the stairs
and and all of that reviews and
interviews and just and great cool
segments about like what's happening in
the tech world the out there out there
in the world how dare I think another
thing that also that you guys it eluded
to in the video that you guys may not
have caught necessarily is the fact that
we have this kind of new cool initiative
and it will be developing but we're time
out a second-screen platform yeah and
this is stuff where we've developed
in-house the ability for while content
is being served to you on your computer
while you have a tablet device and yes
we just like said Oh will the tablet
market really mature anymore but there
are still at least in the tech audience
the people that we serve people that
have their tablets and love them and the
ability to interact to get additional
content while this video and the things
that you're watching is plain real time
so we're super we're super excited about
that I mean that's just one of those
nuggets it's not like we're sitting here
twiddling our thumbs I know I don't have
anything to show you right now but trust
me you have you have you heard some of
the trick stuff that comes out of the
shed trust me he is a working on him
yeah and we're we're fired up it's
basically like this is the teaser and
then he's teasing YouTube because all
what were what we're really doing is
that we're kicking it up a notch yeah at
Cena in terms of production right like
nobody I feel like nobody does tech
video better than seen annuls that's a
fact that's a fact that's a fact we
really are yeah we are investing mean
the great thing about this is that
although it feels like we're taking
something away what we're really doing
is investing in original content at Cena
like you
that that is a huge part of what's going
on in the media world right now you see
huffpo you know a hundred million
dollars for original content Yahoo
Google everybody original well we're no
we're no different were no exception
we're going to be making incredible
video and I'm I'm just so I've been
working on the show for a year you guys
like I'm so excited about this show and
what we're going to get to do and about
the the new shows that are going to be
happening at Cena it's going to be I
know that this parts really hard for you
and me but it's a big it's a big
exciting shift I mean there's there are
always going to be skeptics we know that
many of you are like whatever we're just
going to go to twit and that's fine like
this or that they serve a purpose they
serve our purpose and we serve a
different purpose and we're going to
we're gonna you know bet big on our
strengths and that's what we want to do
in it we the thing is that mall and I
and Stephen we're still going to be here
on the big events yes we all have fun
because I know I'm not I know reading
what you guys say yeah someone's like
we'll miss the dynamic between Molly and
Brian and Stephan just the fun that we
have and how we talk about tech we're
still gonna be able to do that and it's
not just only going to be Apple events
right you know when Microsoft is going
to end up rolling out with windows 8 big
right you have Amazon that'll probably
have some crazy tricks up their sleeve
some of these major press conferences
will be there so just you know just
understand that like everything i'm sure
many of you that have listened have may
not have had a job for six years
straight and have done something else
we're still here at the same place we're
just doing something else at the place
that we still love ya so that's that's
the best way that I can put in I hope
that you guys continue to support us we
appreciate so much of what you guys have
done I mean it's amazing so and we hope
we so hope that you will watch our new
show I mean because we're it cuz like we
just feel like we need to reiterate this
again we're not leaving right like we're
giving you more exactly giving you more
and we're excited so and and for the
person who said it seems like it's less
radio more TV i think that's that's a
really appropriate description that is
totally what's going on cuz like we
don't want to just sit in this room with
it but these cans on we want to get out
there and ride mind-controlled
skateboards wouldn't you and the
community the do we know the live
audience that the community and even
just kind of the fraternity and or
sorority whatever you pick right that
is here live there's nothing that
replicates that and we hope potentially
in the future we can still bring some of
that those community elements into some
of our future shows but um you know that
I think that more than anything that's
probably the part that you know when I
thought about going away that's what
we'll miss you know what we and you guys
will miss the most is being able to
real-time interact and goof around with
everyone and like that's that's awesome
but we can take slices of that and bring
them into other stuff and I want you to
know that is actually going to be a part
of always on specifically so every week
when that show airs it's not going to be
a live show but when we brought when we
post it at the actual posting time I
plan to host a live chat so that we can
all watch it together and comment and
have this live interaction because i
love this audience so much and I love
this chat room and I just I don't want
that ago to go away so kind of just like
right now for about a half hour a week I
hope that you will join me in a live
chat so we can watch always on together
and talk about it and and and just like
Jaclyn our chat room I mean and who
knows that there might be times where we
might feel like we want to itch itch to
the little scratch you know scratch that
scab or scratch you know scratch that
itch scratch that it scratch that itch
and we'll just do like a random mystery
show like that's kind of fun like
yourself like a little mystery up so
that you know whatever it's gonna pop
out of nowhere and we just want to help
you know we don't we're not leaving no
oh you're the best she's like tweet it
and we will come I love it there will be
yeah so let's oh I mean that's just like
I'm just throwing that out we've learned
so much from from buzz out loud right
like I've learned that I want that I
want this audience to be part of every
show like oh if you're building a
fire-breathing robot in your backyard
I'm gonna come to your house we're gonna
do video and we're gonna have a chat
room when we first watch the show and
we're you know it's like they're I will
never ever do anything in my career
again I think that doesn't involve the
community in the same way that buzz out
loud is involved this community because
that's I get like about a year into buzz
out loud it was like oh I know it's
special about this show yeah yeah it's
like it see the secret sauce it is a
secret test so I appreciate that the
secret sauce accepted my secret sauce
yeah i gotta say my favorite part that's
true my favorite part disgusting I gotta
say my favorite part of the show every
day was the feedback loop like once we
got through all the news and all that is
check out to the feedback no I can sit
back and have fun now now speaking of
which next week we want we want to give
you the chance to let it all out like
next seriously let it out let it out
we'll be here i'm going to read we will
read whatever you whatever you write
when evers with theirs it's only fair
hey we rip on apple with praise apple we
you guys have praised us it's time for
you to praise us or also vent your
frustration on we might have to use the
beat button but if you want to write
bleeps right bleeps and I yeah it's like
I got it like that just be yourself be
who you are and I think it's only fair
to tell you that i actually won't be cuz
i have to go to second so pretty much
Steven and I will be your official lunch
bags let it out unless you do the show
next friday maybe we could talk about
that we could talk about that cuz i
could be here for a friday show it would
be it would be trouble if we brought
some sort of like pinata and for every
negative email or just sad you know yet
we beat the pinata and see voodoo doll
if we get enough we'll see enough if we
get enough of those and we hit the
pinata nuff then candy will come out
which means great things for the future
and you will come out all right so
please I was like shut up with the spin
Tom bring it on shut up with a spin
bring it on I love you guys we'd love
you guys and we are with that we're
gonna take a little bit of a break
possibly cry a little bit more and then
we will be right back with some actual
news we got so we got news all right
news news
anyone
we're back we now return to our
regularly scheduled buzz out loud show
already in progress hey hi hey guys do
you want to talk about some news or
something let's talk news okay uh those
of you in the chat room who joined us
like 10 minutes into the show just as
man ask jeannie what happened justjust
assets just ask the chatroom just what
happened all right yeah all right but
let's do some tech news because frankly
that's what we do and it's good to take
our mind off of things um I lost my ever
lovin mind when I saw the story
yesterday I could not believe that this
was really associated press reporting
this week that job seekers which is
particularly awful particularly awful in
this particular economy uh job seekers
are evidently being asked on a
semi-regular basis when they apply to
turn over their Facebook user names and
passwords so that employers can check
out their private profiles and just see
what's in there I don't we have a lot of
listeners here and I'm just even curious
if in general even if a few of our
listeners have had to come across this
but it's blatantly asking to dig deep
inside your personal information things
that you like people you're associated
with and then making decisions about you
being hired from that it's like it is
the most insane violation of privacy i
think i've ever heard like turn over
your pan apparently it is most prevalent
with public and government agencies so
like the city of Bozeman Montana
apparently for a couple years has had a
policy of asking applicants for
passwords for their email accounts and
all their social network account so they
can like check out their private crap
yeah that's that's awesome I can't even
really say this more clearly that is an
insane violation of privacy and it ought
to be illegal if those facebook profiles
are private and employers can't see them
then what do they need to be worried
about in terms of something being on
there it's not your business it's
private profile so up until this point
Facebook pretty much you know they were
laying low it broke a couple days ago
but facebook is now come out with a
public statement on their blog and so
they made their own position pretty
clear they say just going
kind of paraphrase some of this as a
user you shouldn't be forced to share
your private information and
communications just to get a job unless
you work a facebook now they didn't say
that as the friend of a user you
shouldn't have to worry that your
private info or communications will be
revealed you know we've made that a
violation of facebook statement of
rights and responsibilities to share or
solicit a facebook password employers
listen it's insane I know I really do
understand that uh companies are trying
to figure out how to handle social
networking in this digital age we know
that all too well but that's just insane
and you talked about Facebook right just
being like no thank you yeah yeah faces
like i'll be doing that don't don't do
that i mean really all right speaking of
facebook they just purchased 750 new
patents from IBM as an attempt to kind
of build up a war chest of patents
because they know that every bit like
when you win the lottery every is coming
out of the woodwork now to sue them for
various patent infringement claims yeah
Yahoo is actually suing Facebook
claiming that the social network is has
infringed on 10 of its patents so some
of these are related to advertising
privacy controls social networking which
is what Facebook is based on so Facebook
as a defense and we've seen this with
hardware companies have acquired some
pads from IBM to kind of hopefully
alleviate or help them use it as a
defensive shield against yahoo yahoos
just kind of mad that Facebook is doing
a lot of things they wish they could do
and so they're trying to get money for
it and that also happens in the hardware
space yeah it's interesting there
definitely I mean it's useful for them
to have these patents some people are
like do they really need to even defend
themselves against Yahoo because that
seems so like such a patently absurd
case hey we but uh but you know I mean
you can understand why they feel like
they're in the they're in a position
that they need to because I'm sure this
is hardly the last patent infringement
lawsuit that will be headed their way
possibly bad news and then good news
maybe for the windows phone plan babyish
have you guys heard of this game called
angry birds
space never played it ya ever played ok
is it like a new one I don't even try to
figure this out because uh here you know
what I just download the game because
I'm like what is this all about and we
all were talking about we're like kind
of tired of Angry Birds my like well
let's just buy it and see what happened
so yeah it's an angry birds look it's in
space except it's like in this little
gravitational pull little area yeah it's
angry birds but anyways the story it
made a cool space sounding name yeah
well do you guys hear about how they did
that demo at Space Needle in Seattle how
they like flung an angry bird off a
space needle to kind of promote the
launch of this game oh my god even
though that has nothing to actually do
with space but its Space Needle
shouldn't they have flung an angry birds
on like a shuttle in space off of a
shuttle but its Space Needle what are we
using the Hubble still I don't think so
I would get off the Hubble I wish I'd
been in the meeting where they discussed
that like well it's kind of weird
because space is not actually space I
should have just drive but it's a space
needle it's the closest thing we've got
people will get it it's high off the
ground it looks tall it's really not
that tall in life in person anyway it
was not going to appear on Windows Phone
and Windows platform at all they were
just like we would have had to totally
rewrite it that's like a lot of work for
windows phone yeah I mean it didn't it
did not launch a windows phone at all
and this this whole chicken and egg
right you need users and you'd have to
drive users or you need apps you know
users and apps kind of drive each other
but if you're not going to get angry
birds and you're not going to get users
that doesn't look very good analyst said
it was a quote worrying development for
windows phone because it suggested that
rovio did not have much confidence in
its future it being Windows Phone well
Rovio CEO did say that they're working
on a version for windows phone with a
yet-to-be-named release date but the the
bigger thing is just the sign that it's
whether they had to rewrite it or not it
clearly wasn't a priority because if you
launch on Android and you launch on iOS
the two biggest platforms that pretty
much tells us that's where you want to
go and that's where the momentum is I
mean we've we like in this room we've
all said we like the interface of
Windows Phone 7 it just has a lot of
catching up
to do mm-hmm but this is just another
one of those things if the largest most
popular game isn't going to be on that
platform and let's say it comes out six
months later that's a long time right
it's really long time yeah I mean it's
out and that comment to from the CEO
kind of just makes it sound like what
happened is that Nokia prop more likely
Microsoft called and lost their
ever-lovin mind right and then Ravi I
was like oh okay we're totally working
on that were delivered yeah you know we
got the gummies and we got gummies in
the supermarket i'm sure those took a
long time to develop yeah you see those
little gummy is there everywhere I mean
like gummy Angry Birds that's the
supermarket's at 7-elevens really front
counter prime real estate point-of-sale
right on the front whoa angry birds is
everywhere I had no idea that gummy I
only shop in the hippie stores I guess
chatroom you you guys have seen the
gummies right that's assault they've had
to assume the girl that's easier than
rewriting the entire code base that's
what I'm saying yeah clearly hiring a
factory over in Asia that hurts about
Harry gummies I bet I god I can only
imagine the phone calls that were coming
into rovio headquarters for me I bet
Microsoft which is like how what's it
gonna take what's a good hundred million
dollars what are we talking it was a
Microsoft earlier when they released at
windows phone seven saying how they were
gonna pay developers to get them on
their platform blah blah blah yeah I'm
sure that they were hey they're writing
checks or you know lobbing bombs um now
or birds angry but nicely done we
arguably though angry birds is totally
over because the only game that anyone
has cared about for the past six weeks
of its existence was a draw something
booya from OMG pop and in fact
apparently they loved it so much that oh
my god Zynga rather than in pursuing a
new strategy for Zynga actually rather
than just copy the game outright they
probably were actually really impressed
that draw something is just pictionary
they were like oh nice we wish we
thought of that one but instead they
apparently paid a hundred and eighty
million dollars plus another 30 million
in employee retention payments just go
ahead and buy it games been out for six
weeks made 220 million dollars on
pictionary why did I not think of that
the well it's it's the whole formula
right make a classic game and add a
social networking element and just see
if it takes off right and draw something
is hot I mean if you have not if you you
know what a lot of times people get all
caught up and they say I'm not gonna
jump on this bandwagon I'm not gonna
jump on Angry Birds i'm not gonna jump
on cut the rope you need a jump on draw
something I'm doing it with my 5 i'm
like playing it with my five-year-old
niece yeah and it's it's it's amazing
but I I was I was like wow zynga
dropping the cash again this app has
only been out for pretty much has gained
its popularity in six weeks alright so
they instantly dropped 200 million
dollars on it I think they've been
getting something like um one report
said 1 billion ad impressions per week
from draw something right the app is
free with the ads you pay 99 cents if
it's not free it had 25 million
downloads of the app and within the
first few weeks or so and doctoring dr.
Kyle the chat room just pointed me to
their Facebook page where apparently
they post the best pictures of the day
oh yeah they're amazing oh my god you
are using this for are also welcome I
can't go back and see my pits at
facebook.com slash play draw something
how come I can't go back and see my old
drawings but they can grab them and post
them on their facebook cuz they're
stored locally on their server good to
know I'm mad about that cuz sometimes i
think my drawings were like so funny
they're not good but they're funny like
the one I drew for Sweden I thought was
genius what'd you do I drew this like
blond lady with really big blue eyes and
then I drew a plate full of meatballs
and then I drew a little IKEA store
that's cool sweet name I like to draw I
was cracking myself up see look at that
Lenny Kravitz I mean that is
unbelievable and the funny thing about
this is you if you play this game right
the hook is that you earn coins or
points based on the difficulty of the
drawing you make and you let someone
guess it the only reward in this game is
you can get more colors to paint with
okay the other care of other than seen
the replay of what your friends draw and
laughing every time they erase that line
because they can't get the correct
thickness of the line
it's to get more colors and to draw your
network on so no I'm plus amazing I am
in a game with Jeff Sparkman who works
here uh you I'm sure you guys have heard
us talk about it before but dude that
guy he's a good drawer his Darth Vader
blew my mind here's the thing you can
take two perspectives on draw something
you can draw the stick figures or you
can spend half an hour of your time on a
single drawing beautiful pads only worth
one damn coin you go three coins I
expect some are you go one coin give me
a stick figure the people drawings are
the hardest because it has all that okay
weird Wow anyway you can we do why like
once you start talking about this you
could understand why people get all my
guys so far we're like when you see your
friend guess the word and they keep on
guessing wrong and they shift the tiles
and you're like you're an idiot I know
you're an idiot ah all i do i googled
once one time i did google what i did i
did it new new phenomena also while you
guys are listening people are buying
styluses specifically for draw something
i kid you not oh my starting to hear
that from my peers I'm starting to see
that cuz on the phone it's a lot harder
to draw on an iPad it's amazing right
you have more space but on the phone it
can be a little tricky you know what I'm
talking about you know what I'm talking
about i bet i don't want to play with
Sharon because I bet that Sharon has
hurt one of her custom styluses that she
built with like a toothpick in it like
the Chi macgyvered oh the foil foil foil
she did this amazingly make your own
stylist one um interesting actually once
I started playing on the ipad 2 is a
whole different whole different universe
and trust me you don't need the ipad 3 4
draw something in fact you don't need
the ipad 3 dear everyone you don't need
that baby oh my gosh all right let's uh
let's keep it rolling here google wallet
no surprise not turning into the massive
market changing juggernaut that Google
may have hoped and now there are reports
that the first stage hasn't been going
very well and Google might be wooing
AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon to join sprint and make
some partnerships to try to get the
wallet thing off the ground this
prediction has already come to fruition
from you and I
I know we both said the exact same thing
like mobile payments will not take off
because of the fragmentation there's the
distribution of it the concept of course
we're gonna see this take off but it's
still going to be a few years away the
idea awesome but look google launched
with their Galaxy Nexus on verizon where
the feature was already crippled on that
specific phone right I mean if it's not
available on your flagship phone on the
country's biggest carrier I think it's a
little bit of a setback wouldn't you say
God's sake you also have the competition
with Isis who's a it's a conglomerate
between carriers and some of the phone
providers and pretty much a platform
that vendors can choose to jump on or
off of google wallet was completely on
an island separate from Isis Isis is the
one that's really looking to kind of be
that platform that pushes forward and if
you want to make the argument of VHS
versus beta Google might have tried to
be the VHS but they're the beta right
and people will still tell you that beta
was probably better technology what
doesn't really matter it was when you're
facing illegal collusion between the
various I mean really anyway so they may
be pursuing partnerships with the
carrier's then I guess we'll we will
continue to wait for something that
Japan's had for like 10 years well it's
out assault by Southwest I a guy came up
to our booth or a little our setup stage
where we're doing interviews yeah any
happen to be from Isis oh we and we
started talking and picking his brain
and he would not say when they're
actually gonna officially roll out
because Isis is still working on these
agreements behind the scenes before they
launch it and roll it out they were
showing kind of proof of concepts at
South by Southwest like because in
America people like wait America you can
still touch a phone and it pays would
America sorry about that I channeled my
inner Midwest am I gonna get stoned
right now yes okay I'm gonna stop moving
on in case you have not read it you guys
should go start following Maggie
Reardon's ask Maggie column it's awesome
she is like the the mobile phone and
mobile policy reporter for cnet news
calm and she has this great QA about
mobile phone issues
and today's is basically just like yeah
um did you know that brezin is also
throttling your unlimited data plan just
a little FYI laughs why I think a lot of
people did not realize that and and
we're like 18 d throttles nuts rude
people throttles nuts rude and she just
wants everyone to know in the QA just
just in case you weren't aware verizon
also bez that so that's our like PSA
from us to you and check out her column
it's one yes it's not just AT&amp;amp;T Verizon
system like will throttle you down
depending on the load on their overall
network and then bring you back up it's
not as blaine whereas it sounds like
with AT&amp;amp;T they just pretty much put the
hammer on you yeah no matter what their
network overall is doing whereas verizon
at least it will fluctuate based on the
overall network congestion so totally
just a little different way of doing the
same thing they also do and then some
insane thing happen with apple today
they're screwed i think apples over
right apple's totally over that's after
they heard after they heard us talk
about the ipad 3 the market responded
with a flash crash that scared the
bejeebies out of investor so somewhere
in earlier in the day in the afternoon
apple's stock dropped about ten percent
out of nowhere it fell as low as 542
dollars he was hovering around whatever
596 hundred it was an erroneous trade
known as a flash crash they halted all
trading at ten fifty seven a.m. eastern
time and resumed trading normally at
eleven but everyone was pretty much
going bye bye bye but there you go
totally just in case your portfolio take
a dip for the worst it's 45 minutes
don't panic don't panic battle mimic
you're still rich i think some people's
entire retirement is probably an apple
stock right now so like I'm be sure that
that is not yeah that's I'm not gonna
say that's not a smart move right now
they they're happy if it fell down to
542 and the target price is still seven
hundred dollars like by oh yeah yeah bye
if I could I probably would good i would
i'd buy my one little share maybe two
you'll still get like a what something
like an eighty percent return on it i
know
exactly so why not buy one and that
would be fine then I could get then if I
bought one and it got to 700 maybe I
could afford to buy any map just use it
for your macbook I cannot full
disclosure I can't describe apple stock
nor do I ever get to and will disclosure
we can't purchase any technology stopped
not by any tech stock which is the
source of endless frustration which is
really where everyone makes their money
to us and our financial advisors such as
they may be like the dude at the bar by
Apple what but i did my undry in a good
scotch I like the hiccup that was nice
yeah that was very subtle did you hear
that hiccup I did all right guys this is
a fun story that we just can't get away
oh my god this it boggles the mind nokia
filed a patent recently and it just came
to light it's let's just say it let's
call what it is a technology for a
vibrating tattoo i love would you like a
vibrating tramp stamp that should have
been the headline of this not this
article but the mobile company filed for
a plant patent that would let it place
haptic feedback technology on to a
tattoo to alert customers to a new call
that's outstanding it could also be a
patch to just like you don't want to
patch you want the tattoo I want to
tattoo I don't want to tattoo that
vibrates now Molly knows a thing or two
about tattoos I thought that might go
totally different way um i would
definitely dude i would totally get a
vibrating oh really yes you just know i
mean okay for one thing girls are the
legendary problem when it comes to
answering the phone right guys are
always like you never read through no no
Michael I didn't hear it cuz it was it
and my person a little bit and if I
could get like a cool like a really cool
little tattoo and then it would just
like every time the phone was ringing
wow that's awesome alright so here I
also like I want all the implants I
wanted yeah yeah yeah like I'm on board
with the singularity I'm i want the
google goggles or you want implants you
don't want to work the last implants
okay see that's what i'm saying so
here's the technology nokia will use
magnetic waves to create the effect it
could be extended to an invisible tattoo
what's what's the fun in an
visible tattoo there is no point you're
either talent you're either tell me you
freeky deeky are you really about your
art on your body or you don't get an
invisible tattoo yeah i mean i can see
why an invisible tattoo would be useful
for people who don't want to have a
tattoo like that makes perfect sense in
some ways cuz then you still get all the
benefit but but i like the idea of
having some cool i don't know like it
incoming can I tell you a fun little
story that why this is great why this
story made me laugh tattoo can I tell
you a fun little story please this is
for the bol audience only if you're
under 13 close your ears okay so am I
designed this tattoo for a significant
in the past and she got it placed right
down here nah right down here like here
all right I designed it I thought what
if it vibrated ah now moral the story
Jack Toby was like I'm 14 ma moral the
story that reached a moral destroyed
that trick cheated on me I should have
known because she got that little tattoo
in that special place and but but it
could have vibrated if it was if I met
her like 20 years later it's gonna
change the industry the industry when
you can have when implants at only just
enhance the experience and I'm not
having about the normal implants I was
getting these days like the whole new
I'm just saying there's a little world
out there that's for a different show
and you sing a song from a kids show I
cartoon it's so bad just that were there
were there were some you know messed up
things in Disney movies so let's not
pretend like they're innocent too true
too true but I this also this technology
would allow different patterns like you
could have a but you know your ringtones
are different they vibrate differently
like how on is that if like what is your
mom's ringtone vs like your significant
others to tattoos into specific new
tattoo tattoos all right let's uh uh huh
we're gonna we're gonna have to move on
i think to the assisted
save yourselves china is the new hot bed
of smartphone technology they have
surpassed the United States in
activations of Apple and Android devices
not too surprising because they have way
more people a lot more people that's
more like a lots more also just a couple
days ago Twitter turn six you all know
about this if you didn't know well maybe
you should know now they turned six
years old with 140 million active users
now what's kind of cool is our own
social guru nathan bransford he pulled
up our first tweets did you see this no
so I don't remember like ours like
Steven I tried to find your first tweet
but I really wanted to track it down but
nathan bransford in the article whatever
he puts some of ours I like to read your
tweet if you open up the link and we can
read mine looking tell me when you got
yours okay here we go mollywood first
tweet wondering how many morning
Twitter's include drinking coffee and
preparing to podcast with a baby
strapped to my chest drinking coffee
very first tweet oh my god I remember
because I totally got on Twitter when I
was home on maternity leave with Eli and
I was super I just needed to be
connected to the world again and then
veronica was like you should tweet and i
did and that's hilarious ah brian tongs
first tweet getting down and dirty with
playoff football that sounds like a 13
year old wrote it yeah wow they're all
in here this is amazing stephen
shankland well i joined twitter to give
it a shot too bad the IM link is good
bust reports of twitter flakiness are
validated CNET's first twitter was not
personal at all it was an article posted
in april of 2009 you know we made our
twitter account a little later than
others like in 2009 netsol here I mean
there were vibrating tattoos back then
Wow ATT increases their bounty on fiber
vandals to 250 k
for reals give me something josh Josh
Lowensohn scratch in my ears that's
pretty much Twitter fair that's pretty
cute yeah he didn't see that was that
was self aware it was self aware
tweeting by the ones in there yeah not
surprisingly Brian Cooley finishing up a
car tech podcast then heading out into
rush-hour traffic I need a drink I'm
demic cars drinks again self-aware very
self-aware again so there you go there's
Twitter's a six years of Twitter pretty
outs and it's made our life so much
better it actually has it's amazing I
think it's cute that they have 140
million users Oh what's on their
birthday not important that's interested
oh that's got to be a priority that's
how high are they I know I was like I
think that's not that's total crap
trivia fans were unhappy about the
ending to the mass effect 3 game Lala
don't tell me well i also don't know
what the ending was but apparently they
were so mad about it that they're giving
it a new they're considering giving it a
new ending they won't do it no no there
here's the thing okay just like doing
angry birds for windows phone place your
bets down which one's more likely so
what happened is the ending for my
friends who have finished I'm still
playing the game because I've been a
little bit out of town it was really
kind of ambiguous and this is a trilogy
where people have literally spent for
each game approximately 40 plus hours so
you're kind of hoping for a payoff if at
the very minimum you've invested 120
hours of your life and they just weren't
satisfied with it bioware earlier had
said that they cut out some of the
details of the ending because they felt
it would draw it out too long and I've
got to imagine Bioware says they're
working on DLC that will address some of
the shortcomings because they wanted to
respond to the audience who's really so
passionate about this franchise which is
which is what is another thing that's
amazing about our current state of the
Internet in the world is that look we
can voice our displeasure or a favor and
some of these developers will actually
be like you know what you guys are right
we're gonna deliver the goods and we can
change the zoo we're going to change the
mass effect ND so they're going to
address that sometime in April they said
they're going to talk about it I like it
my friends were kind of bummed overall
overall sentiment people were bummed
people were bummed but I like the fact
that they're changing it all right I
think we should I think we should let
Stephen because we're running low on
time here we should let Stephen do his
thing all right do is they do you thing
and set up real quick you're supposed to
do your thing it's time for my segment
he's mapping because I skipped a story
it's my promise my fault thanks for
scribe Hollywood I know don't Larry I'm
sorry listen Mia oh good i'll talk a lot
let's get ready to judge some products
based on one poorly red Center I'm into
it I'm not into it all right welcome to
intuit not into it where we quickly run
down some recent tech product releases
and decide if we are simply into it or
not into it let's get started number one
robotic jellyfish researchers for the US
Navy are developing robotic jellyfish
which are self-powered using high-tech
materials in seawater and will be used
for surveillance and environmental
monitoring Mollywood are you into
robotic jellyfish environmental

Monterey Bay Aquarium fan into it
