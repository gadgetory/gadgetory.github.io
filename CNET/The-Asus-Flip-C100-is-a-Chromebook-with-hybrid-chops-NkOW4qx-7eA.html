least expensive option out there I'm Dan
Ackerman and this is the a sous flip C
100 Chromebook 1 of a new generation of
Chromebooks that Google is promoting
using different components that's got a
CPU from Rockchip as opposed to Intel
and it's also got some features you very
rarely see in Chromebooks it has a
touchscreen first of all we have seen
that before but only I think one other
time ever seen one that also has a
hybrid hinge which means you can fold it
back like this into what we call kind of
the kiosk mode or you can just fold it
all the way down into a tablet and I
find that the accelerometer here
actually works really well in terms of
flipping the image this way if you can
read it's sort of a portrait style as
opposed to landscape style and then of
course when you're done you can just
flip it all the way back around now with
this different architecture inside we
found the battery actually lasts a
really long time more than 12 hours in
our video streaming test however and our
benchmark test this guy was
significantly slower than other
inexpensive Chromebooks that we tried
however it's a Chromebook so you're
really just going to be surfing the web
that shouldn't make too much of a
difference in day-to-day use because it
can double as a tablet when you flip it
over it deactivates the keyboard and if
you tap on a text field you actually get
a little on-screen keyboard right here
that you can use it's a special compact
chrome key where you could switch the
full keyboard if you want to that means
the keys very small and hard to use you
can also use handwriting recognition in
this keyboard field down here so a lot
of ways to interact with the device now
it's got an aluminum body which is
better than the plastic Chromebooks we
see from just about everybody else even
though it's still very inexpensive $250
considering the the metal body and the
touch screen of the hybrid hinge however
there are full Windows eight systems
such as the $200 HP stream 11 orchid it
Intel compute stick for about $170 that
actually cost less than this so even
though it's a budget Chromebook it's
nowhere near the bottom of the price
barrel I'm gonna equina and that's this
is Chromebook flip
