here I didn't get a count on here but it
doesn't matter because my name is Jeff
Bakalar you have found yourself in the
best place to be every Friday afternoon
that is here inside cns conversation
show where we get some drinks and talk
tech with you people who are watching
live this is your chance to chat
directly with cnet editors so send us
your questions right now in the live
chat on youtube or tweet using hashtag
open tab joining us this week is cnet's
section editor mr. dan ackerman ever
ever in how are you sir hey ah also
joining us the newest member of the Cena
team here in New York Alfred in hello
Alfred thank you for being here sir glad
to be here you're enjoying your time so
far yes all right good you're right yeah
yes there's this might be where it all
went sup okay you'll see Elijah uh so
Dan you are here because you have a very
special project you recently published a
book hi yourself not that I have a
letterpress at my house and I just stamp
them out he's been out for six months
doing why it took so long ah here's the
book can we a shot of this it is called
the tetris effect the game that
hypnotized the world Oh congratulations
thank you sir thank you very exciting is
a very big deal oh you can get this
wherever wherever you buy bar everybody
bucks um so I want to talk to you about
one just a little side note is the UK
version and now the UK and the US
version are like fighting each other
it's right you wish by boat and
both right cuz like we said before the
show all the all the use and all the
weird grammar is in this pound symbol of
they went with the Cold War angle they
did yes it did well there's a lot of
that they're in your straighten you know
they're still paranoid about that so I
want to talk to you about the the book
what is it about Tetris because I would
about like we need a technician
it's not that interesting by itself okay
and I looked at her I said okay there's
an interesting history there if you know
anything about the history of video
games or technology you may know that
Tetris came from the Soviet Union during
the Cold War and there are a lot of
fights over who owned it and let you
know legal battles and things like that
that's fine the more I looked into it
though I realized this isn't a game
story it's actually a start-up story
very similar to the startup stories that
we obsess about over at Silicon Valley
and elsewhere sure but the startup story
from the Soviet Union in the middle of
the Cold War in Moscow and that's made
it super interesting to me that we were
taking this modern you know startups or
that we talked about but finding um the
most unlikely version of it possible
that had a huge global impact over 30
years so I mean the way you described
like that almost makes it sound like it
was this sort of accident though or at
least its popularity of course it is how
is a little software program some guy
makes in a Russian you know science
academy all of a sudden become a billion
dollar global business is the most
unlikely of success stories so like how
and I don't you give away too much about
what's what's in the book but like how
does ownership work they're like hey and
I'm obviously that you get into that but
like how did that play out that's a huge
part of it it's almost like like a cold
war you know business spy thriller with
all these big companies backstabbing
each other and trying to make deals with
these secret Russian groups alexey
pajitnov the guy who created tetris he
was a he was a computer scientist at the
Russian Academy of scientists he was
actually working on some very advanced
stuff things like artificial
intelligence voice recognition for the
Soviet Union in the 80s that's like
super cutting edge yeah in his spare
time he used his ancient computer
ancient even for them at the time to
make this a game that mimic this puzzle
game used to play as a kid many friends
liked it he passed it around and to go
viral back in the Soviet Union in the
80s that means making a big 5 inch
floppy disk and walking it over to the
other people in Moscow who have a
computer at the time ago and hey check
this out yeah it's it's sneakernet it's
dude we still call that sneakernet but
that's all they had and somehow him
probably it just spreads and spreads
because what else you can do for fun in
Moscow in 1984 they got a lot going on
you're not unless
just want to like stand in a red liner
yeah exactly that's right and then it
makes its way to hungry which is an
eastern bloc country but a little more
open to to commercialism in the West
okay that's where Rubik's Cube comes
from that was also Eastern Bloc
invention that made it out into the West
they really love their squares and a
business guy from the UK saw it and said
hi wonder if I can sell this somehow
maybe I'll try to talk to I'll find out
it's from rush i'll try to talk to the
Russians they don't understand
intellectual property rights or
licensing their communist right side is
good all right below the not all we're
going to deal with these guys but in the
meantime I'm just gonna start selling
this out of the back of a car okay and
that led to you know many many
intersecting lawsuits in this huge
tangle that takes us through this whole
you know legal and business thriller
cool alright sounds like you're already
working on like the movie adaptation I
feel we're just gonna act it out right I
feel like I feel like there's their
substance there it could have the stage
as a stage show a 203 hander now now
I've read half of the book don't spoil
the ending for me but the ship sinks in
the end here's the spoiler it's let
zigzag piece was the murderer well I
there's no point of me reading the rest
of it anymore but I think one of the
interesting things though you put a lot
of detail into the losers in the tetris
race and you know most books it's
essentially just alright here's this guy
did a really cool thing that's their
story but you know how did you get in
contact and you know why did you decide
to put so much like focus on you know
people that didn't like when the rights
to tetris when you were telling a
history story or good non fiction story
I think it's really all about it's not
just about what happened it's about the
character do you really need characters
that that make the history come alive
and what I found was this story had so
many fantastic characters in it alexey
pajitnov and Hank Rogers on one side but
also the guys you talked about who lost
out in the end guys like robert maxwell
and robert stein and a lot of the other
russians and the guys that like kangin
an Atari and spectrum holla by and they
were also interesting I thought it was a
great sort of you know large cast of
characters that I could walk through and
a lot of them were very you know happy
to talk to me and tell me
you know their stories and a lot of like
interesting anecdotes that hasn't been
you know published anywhere else before
so I found it was a great it was a great
human story behind it and that's what
really helped me to kind of put it
together in that way and make it make it
a character piece what was the most
surprising sort of maybe even shady
thing I mean a lot of shade is a lot of
shady my favorite surprising thing was a
little bit later when Nintendo is
finally negotiating with the Russians
for various Tetris rights for the
famicom and nes a lot of game play
tetris just within Tendo true and
nintendo was a was kind of a
johnny-come-lately to that but they're
the guys who really mainstreamed it
after it was a kind of a cult hit on PCs
and of course we go to CES every year
there's a big scene set at CES in like
nineteen eighty-seven where the game is
just on PCs but when Nintendo Howard
Lincoln who's a famous you know figure
he later went on to become the president
of the Seattle Mariners I think he just
retired a few months ago M&amp;amp;R Arakawa who
was the founding president of Nintendo
of America there in Russia trying to do
some of these negotiations and there and
they're sitting in a room and the
Russians come in with a cosmonaut I they
go uh comrades this is comedy so in
total Kozma he wants to talk to you
about Nintendo sponsoring the Russian
space program maybe we could send the
Soyuz capsule up it'll have to be
Nintendo logo on the side these are very
forward thinking right yeah right uh and
then later they take our relation right
and then later they take Howard Lincoln
and his son to the secret top secret
Soviet the space training town hall town
they have set up to Train astronauts and
they show them all like the training you
know modules and everything so so the
fact that they tried to do that I think
that was the the coolest surprise thing
huh yeah cuz I you know most people I
feel like a lot of people don't even
realize it is a Russian sort of
institution where like this came out of
oh yeah uh yeah go ahead but you think
about the game that you remember with
that the Russian plinky music the
backwards are in the title and the and
the cathedral on the Fox that's all the
invention of Western publishers mirror
soft in the UK and spectrum holla bite
in the US the with sister companies
owned by the maxwell's uh they said you
know what we have this kind of plain
looking game let's do it but it's from
Russia let's play that
let's make it the first big import from
the Soviet Union make it kind of scary
sort of forbidden and that's really what
what causes huge mainstream breakthrough
how is it that such a simple game like
this has a back story that's more
complicated than like the Jason Bourne
movies because we were dealing with at
the time this tie in credible tension
between Russia and the West and we were
dealing with the very beginning of the
computer era and and the beginning of
people starting to this is just before
Gorbachev came in and we moved from this
very strict communist system to glasnost
and perestroika and this opening up so
it was really the exact right time for
people to start testing the waters
mixing these two cultures finding things
that's what Hank Rogers did he was kind
of a software anthropologist he would go
around to different countries he was a
naturalized American from the
Netherlands living in Japan at the time
and he would go around and find software
from other countries that he thought
would sell well in Japan you know
without a lot of localization so he said
Tetris this is going to be this will
work in any country you don't have to
read the instructions you don't have to
understand any story you could just
watch it for 30 seconds and you know how
to play it so that and the Russian stuff
and that just the arrow computer stuff
we're at and the birth of the NES and
the Game Boy yeah this perfect storm
came together and that's why you know
instead of just being an 80s you know
curiosity EA just sold 500 million
Tetris downloads on smartphones and
that's blows my mind 30 years later yeah
still ice Tetris really ended the Cold
War it was yeah this was right this was
like the silent assassin it was the
first Russian thing that a lot of people
were exposed to that actually was from
Russia right it kind of gave us the it's
like the old sting song we're like oh
the Russians are just like us they like
video games too right no yeah it's an
amazing story you can get the book
wherever books are sold I think we might
be giving one away I'm hat we're happy
to give one away I don't know if it's
designed it for you to the excellent
know if it's this one in my hand it
could Beit but we'll figure it all out
so we're going to pass this along to
someone in it was watching live but
you'll lot of rules on how to do that I
think they're going to be up on screen
or something like that awesome eight to
one thing very quick that was super
happy
to do which was finally be able to get
some cool blurbs for other people I
really admire and I think the most fun
thing was to get I got Steve Wozniak
word a little blurb on the back and
Ernest Cline I wrote ready player one to
the fantastic book Doug rushkoff is a
great tech author he he actually can't
coin the term viral media back in the
90s there i was able to send all those
guys early copy than of super excited
the day that they were what's that like
when like you're you're looking for a
quote like was i he literally cold email
was yeah like because he was a big
Tetris fan zactly eight is he would send
his high scores into gay magazines oh no
they would stop and they stopped running
them at some point because he was in
there every month you're always the one
who always in here when I so he started
sending his scores in under an anagram
of his name and they started running it
again and I knew that beforehand so i
just said after the fact that you know
what I bet he'd like to really tell them
is that great send it to me and we got a
nice we had a nice blur problem is they
even verify those scores now that I'm
thinking about it can I just you used to
have to take a photo of your TV screen
get it develop when you're dealing with
a camera how you gonna do that on an old
35-millimeter camera travel back in time
do it oh that was so we are looking for
our a hundred Twitter follower for the
handle of the show that's per that's a
big accomplishment that's seen it open
tab if you are our lucky winner you will
get a signed copy of the tetris effect
by mr. dan ackerman thank you so much
for being here really appreciate it my
flesh and good luck to everyone with
that out of the way we're going to take
a break we have a great video it's an
oldie but a goodie luke westaway in our
london office is currently spending his
last week at cnet it's very upsetting
but back in 2013 he made in adventures
in text segment that spotlights both
Nintendo's gameboy and the tetris effect
so we have dug that up and we blew the
dust off it we're going to play for you
right now we'll be right back these days
if a piece of tech isn't the fastest the
biggest and the brightest gadget in town
is tempting to write at office of
failure but this iconic gaming gadget
proves that sometimes less really
and be more here's why
the end of the 80s or Nintendo Sega an
Atari all competing for the handheld
gaming crown of these three Titans
Nintendo's console was the least
powerful by far and yet the Gameboy
blasted past its rivals to become a
genuine gaming icon the game boy was
devised by Nintendo's R&amp;amp;D one division
led by gunpei Yokoi a legendary figure
who was the brains behind Nintendo's
first handheld the game and watch it was
a series of bold decisions from your
Coy's design team that made the Gameboy
an unlikely success the Gameboy didn't
have the fanciest tech around quite the
opposite it's processing power wasn't
noteworthy it only had a few buttons and
its tiny monochrome screen could only
handle four shades of grey which sounds
like some very lackluster erotic fiction
and then she kissed his hair or
something but he didn't like it compared
to Sega's game gear and Ataris links
which both had backlit color screens the
game boy looked retro even in 1994 what
seemed like this consoles weaknesses
were actually its biggest strengths with
their big bright displays the links and
Game Gear each required six AAA
batteries which they drained in just a
few hours the Game Boy by contrast
lasted way longer and by deploying more
modest tech Nintendo was able to keep
the price down less is more that's the
key to the game boy puzzle and speaking
of puzzles if you really want to see
what made the system so popular you just
need to flip it around tetris was born
in russia but the rights to distribute
the game on consoles were bought by
dutch born entrepreneur Henk Rogers
Rogers says he approached Nintendo about
using the game telling them that if they
bundled the gameboy with Mario to tell
it to kids but if they went with Tetris
that sell it to everyone indeed while
say who was busy pushing Sonic the broad
appeal of tetris gave the Gameboy a
flying start that left its rivals in the
dust Tetris got us all hooked on the
famous type a music which is actually a
Russian folk tune and is the source of a
mental phenomena called Tetris syndrome
which can cause hardcore players to see
falling shapes while drifting off to
sleep or in the corner of their eyes
ook hey I just got off the phone with
came from finance man this plugin is not
very weird problem with your with your
expense report this is it true you
actually commissioned an entire work to
extension of unit for the office with a
cunning design and a brilliant bundled
game the game boy stormed the world
eventually getting a color makeover in
1998 in the US nintendo sold a million
game boys in just a few weeks while the
colorful sequel took combined sales to
nearly 120 million units these consoles
paved the way for the game boy advance
and SP as well as quirky accessories
like the Game Boy camera and Game Boy
printer the game boy also served as a
launch pad for the Pokemon franchise
which is ballooned into movies trading
cards and TV the game boy line has died
out now replaced by the even more
popular Nintendo DS but it's cultural
impact is still felt this original model
that was demolished in the Gulf War but
still functions became an internet
sensation while today bands use old game
boys to create 8-bit music
the Game Boy proved you need more than
just cutting edge text to capture hearts
and minds something would do well to
remember in today's world of bigger and
bigger screens and more powerful
processors one in ten dough made was an
unlikely masterpiece and I loved it so
much I could kiss it but I won't because
I don't know where this one has been for
last 24 years do you have fond memories
of the game boy and can you think of any
other gadgets that have proved to be
unexpected winners let me know and check
back next time for another adventure in
tech hey welcome back to open tab and
right now it is time to dick fiend oh
and this week's geeky cocktail so this
company HobNob makes wine they sent us
some wine and we happen to enjoy adult
beverages here and we used about all
their Chardonnay to make a sangria
recipe that you are seeing on screen
right now so there's like pumpkin spice
in this thing there's all kinds of
situational fall stuff we got going on
here it doesn't look it doesn't yeah so
hey just chill overnight okay chill
every night just chill chill every night
so here it is what are we calling this
seems like autumn sangria autumn sangria
alright so cheers to the book to make a
book thanks and to alfred welcome hmm no
no no this is I this was great no this
will go here of this bottom sangre yes
uh I was telling them this tastes like
no I'm not gonna say what I thought it's
just not the best it's not our style
it's not our style there's a lot of
fruit in there that's nice for you know
people who like fruit and
draw in their drinks I like it with
peanutbutter outside of a drink so I'm
gonna pass what do you think Alfred
autumn sangria brought to you by what
what is this what is disappointing paid
for this it is brought to you by autumn
the season autumn because it'll make you
fall Oh watch out is that there's a
youthful which I've heard so much about
aha alright that was great let's move on
to our next segment this week I tried
out Sony's new slim edition of the
PlayStation 4 everything about the
console is the exact same except that it
is thirty percent thinner it comes with
HDR support but now all ps4s have HDR
support and it will be available in 500
gigabytes or one terabyte of storage it
also loses that optical audio output so
if you're like me and you're big nerd
you're upset about that I want to talk
about the system I have it right here i
also have a pic i thought i had a ps4
original but i guess not but here it is
so I don't know are you do you like to
play games are you a gamer Alfred love
do you do yes so are you so you haven't
seen this yet I am NOT all right so I
want you to wrap your you have a ps4 I
don't you don't you know what are you an
xbox I'm gonna get like a Nintendo guy
so what are you putting right now I
super smash brothers so you play wii u
brothers is what you do no I plan on the
3ds but I play the game cube super smash
brothers okay you are in neva the rabbit
hole here in varies because it's
incredibly competitive yeah I guess no
that's fine that's cool um anyway here's
the the ps4 slim and i gotta say
someone's your thinkpad yeah it's super
light it's it's got a really small
footprint I just don't know if I'm super
psyched about that optical port yeah
leaving like I used to let my HD mi mi
mi audio yeah like that's a thing I use
third-party surround sound headphones
okay games and I can't do that now on
this ps4 slim because it doesn't have
that coveted optical audio out and I
don't understand like there's no way
that took up a lot of realist
like there's no way like that put them
over the the top for keeping this under
three hundred dollars so we just don't
know why it's not there you haven't
heard it's like the cool new thing now
to get rid of jacks it is the cool new
thing I get it like headphone jacks suck
now right but but yeah I don't
understand why it's just not there ever
had the ps3 started with a whole bunch
of little slots and ports and every
revision review just have a compact
flash card slide I have that one do and
then every time they did a new version
to got a little smaller and it lost one
of those slots yeah it was just like oh
and shrunk but also lost you don't do
that process I get it Sony makes a lot
of proprietary stuff that you only need
a USB slot for to hook up headphones too
I understand that but come on don't like
alienate the fact that i would i would
venture to say tens of thousands of
people who own third-party headsets like
that it's a it's a big deal other than
that this thing is is exactly the same
so it's not even like the xbox one s
that has like tiny tiny tiny hardware
improvements this is one to one pretty
much the same exact thing you could even
replace the hard drive like you can on
all these systems it's funny the only
thing i don't like about it is that you
can't really stand it you can stand it
up on its side today finalists and but
they sell estate i also would totally I
wouldn't do it by like the other one I
would let you guys stay ended up in its
fine paper this one it just seems a
little wobbly because it's so thin so
maybe you got to buy that two hours dad
it's always that twenty dollar piece of
plastic that they sell you there's
twenty dollars for stand and an optical
audio out yeah I wish see hopefully this
thing I would that's what I would pay
for but yeah other than that standard
affair it runs quieter doesn't really
run cooler I know a lot of people
thought it would be like a cooler system
temperature wise but not man this thing
heats up you cook an egg on this after a
while and that's really it well it looks
like a George Foreman grill it does oh
you know what else like this is super
lame we carry the console all around a
lot of the office right so the original
piece force it's super sharp it's like
pointy it's got like really
uncomfortable edges and they rounded it
out on this guy so thank you to
something for appreciating the move
people who carry a calm where's the
power button so the power button is
right up front is tactile okay and the
one next to it is these new jack because
on the original PS for the power and
eject buttons are so identical I can
never tell which one is which I can make
them turn it on Rose really jack
guessing and they they did fix this in
later models of the old one but the
touch buttons are also kind of crappy on
actually there was a problem with older
ps4s that they would just eject for know
okay so that was a total bummer that's
why they made buttons on the new one and
obviously on this one you're all set so
that's about it this does also look like
the ps4 pro that's coming out peace for
pro basically just has like another
piece of bread on the sandwich if that
makes sense and yeah that's it ps4 slim
it's a replacement not an upgrade if you
already have a ps4 don't buy one of
these you're wasting your time and your
money anything else that I think we
covered all the bases there you're still
playing gamecube I think that's amazing
I used to play eternal darkness on that
or what oh yeah literally only super
smash sometimes Super Mario strike have
you ever played eternal darkness I don't
think I have go find that game and put
it in your gamecube that isn't amazing
one of those game is like really hard to
find you probably found on ebay for like
40 bucks by me like in like an actual
like store like one it's a gamecube yeah
okay okay we're a bunch of stores in the
city that I guess nothing like jl has it
i don't know anyway thank you the
viewing audience for joining us together
on another edition of open tab have a
fun and safe weekend keep the
conversation going in the comments
section tweet us what you think make
sure you buy the book make sure you
enter to win a copy of the book will
have a new geeky cocktail idea next week
but if you've got your own send that in
to open tab at cnet com we will see you
next time thank you so much to Dan to
Alfred to Joe and to be V G in the
control room see you guys soon have a
wonderful wonderful
