lookit you watch that one okay until now
Jacqueline Walker and her three-year-old
daughter Leah couldn't afford to get
online on try Cartoon Network oh well
the laptop was a gift the installation
fees and monthly service charge for
internet access were prohibitively
expensive let's try www that equipment
isn't really useful if you don't have
the wireless access to get you out on
the internet where you can look for jobs
and do job training take classes from
home so what free the net likes to do
whenever possible is to bring that
access in so that the tenants can then
apply for those programs so why not two
people go down to the sixth floor and
put one in either corner on that floor
and then we'll put an additional one up
here Louis schoenberger and her team of
volunteers are installing these donated
wireless routers through apartment
buildings in San Francisco's Tenderloin
neighborhood streets that have been
riddled with drugs crime and
prostitution over the years these
actually act as the source for the
wireless signal from here we then
installed repeaters that all they need
is power and they basically capture that
signal and carry it farther the goal is
to blanket as much of this low-income
neighborhood with a Wi-Fi signal all for
free our hope is that the tenants
appreciate the service that we're
providing and will respect the equipment
we'll just hop up to 10 and 11 and then
be done with the top it's pretty good
for people who can't afford internet
after this installation just about every
single window you see behind me within a
few blocks will have a wireless internet
connection the volunteers will then move
on to Chinatown and other neighborhoods
to provide free Wi-Fi one building at a
time in San Francisco I'm Kara Tsuboi
