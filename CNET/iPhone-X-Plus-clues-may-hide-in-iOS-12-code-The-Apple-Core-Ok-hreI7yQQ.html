the virus and the iPhone 10 plus clues
hidden in the iOS 12 code we're breaking
down the biggest rumors this week on the
apple core to say that Tim Cook had a
rough start to his weekend would be an
understatement the Apple CEO was
probably looking forward to a relaxing
celebratory weekend with some champagne
after Apple hit a trillion dollar
valuation this week instead the CEO woke
up Saturday morning to news of a virus
at one of his factories according to a
Bloomberg report Taiwan Semiconductor
Manufacturing Co or TSMC aka the company
making the a12 chip on the next iPhones
was hit by a virus Friday night that
shut down production over the weekend
now most of the factories were up and
running by Monday but two days can be
critical especially if you're up against
a September deadline with Apple okay and
as bad as this sounds we as consumers
may not even notice a difference first
off because apparently not all the
facilities were infected so there is a
chance that the ones handling the a12
chip for Apple were spared and secondly
it's not Apple's first rodeo
meaning they usually bake in a little
bit of buffer time for this type of
unforeseen delays now tsmc also said in
a statement on Monday that the company
would be able to make up the lost time
in the fourth quarter what I still have
questions about is how this happened in
the first place apparently it wasn't a
hacker attack but a Mis operation during
the software installation process for a
new tool which sounds a little vague to
me I want more answers sometimes the
best source of leaks can be the source
itself and I'm talking about the iOS 12
code and apparently the latest beta 5
release for developers came packed with
hidden treasures luckily there are
people like eerm a Rambo of 95 Mac to
help us find them his latest discovery a
sketch or render of the iPhone 10 plus
or whatever it is we're calling it a
alongside a smaller counterpart which
could be the current ten or its sequel
the images also show an icon of
something that looks like an iPad with
slimmer bezels and no home button just
as the rumors had suggested for a while
but what's most interesting in
particular is the square shape which
just could serve as a placeholder and
not the actual form factor of the next
iPad in a previous post he had also
discovered double sim support which had
been a strong rumour about the iPhone 10
plus now just because there's support
included in the iOS 12 code doesn't mean
we're necessarily gonna see it in this
round of iPhones but at least we know
it's going to be a possibility in the
future and if you still had any shadow
of a doubt the Apple will be releasing a
gigantic iPhone 10 in the next round of
launches there's this Brazilian blog I
helped BR revealed a code that showed
horizontal interface support for this
gigantic iPhone we can see in the images
here that it looks a lot like what we
already experienced on the iPad and to
some extent in the current Plus models
of the iPhone but these features handing
it made it to the iPhone 10 the report
also suggests that this iPhone Plus
version would have a resolution of 2688
by 1242 pixels that's the highest
resolution of any iPhone
okay so now that we think we know so
much about the phones themselves let's
take a look at what's inside the box or
in this case what's missing in the box
according to a Barclays report published
in MacRumors this year Apple will not
include the headphone adapter in the
iPhone box now the company has included
that tiny little dongle in the box since
it launched the iPhone 7 when it first
eliminated the headphone jack that I
personally still miss now if you're
still holding on to a set of headphones
with a 3.5 millimeter input you will
have to buy that adapter separately for
about nine dollars okay now here's where
Apple could redeem itself at least
according to the rumours Apple could
include a quick charger in the box of
the new iPhones
according to images leaked a few weeks
ago in Japanese blog site Mac o Takara
Apple will supposedly switch to an 18
watt wall charger with USB C port at the
moment that fast charger in the Apple
store costs you almost $80 so I
personally would rather have the fast
charger than the dongle but why not both
alright so moment of truth are you going
to miss the dongle leave your answers on
the comment section below or hit me up
on Twitter and remember to come back
next week for more apple core</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
