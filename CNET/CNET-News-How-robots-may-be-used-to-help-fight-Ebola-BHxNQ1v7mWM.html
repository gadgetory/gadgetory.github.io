it's become a difficult disease to
contain because of its contagious nature
we're going to have to stay vigilant and
we've got to make sure that we're
working together at the encouragement of
the White House Office of Science and
Technology Policy scientists are meeting
in Massachusetts Texas Washington DC and
at UC Berkeley see if robots can be of
assistance so the great thing about
putting a robot in there is that you
could then basically keep people out of
harm's way UC Berkeley robotics
professor Ken Goldberg says in the
coming months they're looking at whether
telepresence robots like the ones
created by in touch health could help
doctors remotely diagnose an Ebola
patient when you're trying to diagnose a
patient there's a lot of nuance you want
to be able to look from different angles
look at different parts of the of the
patient robots could also help with
cleanup and decontamination though
there's one major obstacle to overcome
most robots have wheels well those can
immediately get it contaminated and we
don't know actually how to sterilize
them because there's too many intricate
moving parts in the long-term several
years down the road Goldberg says the
focus is on whether robots can assist in
treating Ebola and other patients by
inserting IVs can we use new imaging
techniques to be able to find the vein
more accurately and then robotic device
that would actually be able to position
a needle more accurately robots may also
be tapped in the future to help with bio
lab experiments involving contagious
diseases the right now robots have a
tough time perceiving transparent glass
vials like beakers Goldberg says this
current Ebola crisis is a wake-up call
to accelerate technology the reality is
that robots are not the capabilities are
limited right now there's lots of
research that needs to be done so we
just want to set expectations that we're
not this is not going to save the day
but he says they hope to be ready for
the next health crisis in San Francisco
