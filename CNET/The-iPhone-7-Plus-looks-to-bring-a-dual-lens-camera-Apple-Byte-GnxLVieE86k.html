Apple buy for the good and bad inside
Apple there's plenty of new rumors we'll
get to apples earnings but we start off
with the iPhone 7 and a report by KGI
securities ming chi quo that claims
there are two 5.5 inch versions of the
iPhone 7 plus one with a single iSight
camera and the other with a dual camera
design now the iPhone 7 plus with the
dual camera design would take advantage
of last year's acquisition of Israeli
camera technology company Lynx imaging
lynxes technology brings multiple
sensors at a smaller size which could
help eliminate the iPhones protruding
camera nipple now their cameras can also
take SLR quality photos with
significantly better noise reduction
improve low-light photos and even
includes 3d depth mapping so if you were
wondering how much better can the
iPhones camera get this could be it also
a new report from 9 to 5 Max's Apple
will likely debut the new iPad air 3 at
a mid-march event targeted for March the
14th it will be the first update to the
mid-sized iPad since October of 2014 and
an unconfirmed design schematic showed
it off with potentially four speakers
like the iPad pro and even more curious
a possible flash on the camera for the
first time I don't want that now the
long rumored iPhone 5se formerly known
as the long rumored iPhone 6c
will also be announced at the event with
its curved edges shown off in this
purported photo from the one more thing
forums now the new iPhone 5se is
expected to bring Apple pay live photos
and the a9 m9 processor chipset so that
it's not completely behind when the a10
equipped iPhone 7 releases but that name
like what could have stand for the
iPhone 5 special edition or maybe self
esteem or the iPhone Cinco sa I'm for
reals new Apple watch bands including
new colors for the rubber sports bands
more colors for the ermes bands and a
black version of the Milanese loop are
expected at the event as well a nanotech
reports Intel release an updated
processor list that include
new skylake chips that could be used for
an updated 15 inch retina macbook pro
all of these are quad core options and
the delays in getting these out have in
turn pushed back an update for Apple's
MacBook lines we could hear something
about an update in March but more likely
it will happen at WWDC in June where
Apple has introduced new macbook
hardware in the past all right let's
talk apples financial results it was
another record quarter with Apple
posting 75 point nine billion dollars in
revenue and a net quarterly profit of
eighteen point four Apple sold a record
seventy four point eight million iPhones
in the quarter just beating out the
seventy four point five million sold the
year before Mac sales were down to five
point three million units compared to
five point five in the same quarter last
year and iPads took another nasty hit
down to 16 point 1 million compared to
twenty one point four a year ago even
with the introduction of the new iPad
pro ouch now Apple also touted a record
Apple watch and Apple TV quarterly sales
but still declined to actually give
sales numbers wop-wop but when you look
at the numbers Apple's iPhone growth has
really hit a wall that's their bread and
butter and Apple is expecting its first
decline ever of iPhone sales for the
next quarter and also in its other
categories like the iPad and Macs
they're declining as well especially the
iPad I've said in past shows the iPad
pro was just so niche and then it really
wouldn't change the iPads fortunes and
guess what that held true now 2016
really looks very flat with little
innovation happening for Apple right now
and during the earnings calls Tim Cook
was asked if virtual reality was a geeky
niche or something that could go
mainstream Cook said he does not believe
VR is a niche and he said it's really
cool and it has some interesting
applications we know Apple has a small
team working on augmented reality then
Apple has recently hired some experts in
the VR space the big a has filed
multiple patents for virtual reality
products over the years that we've shown
you including their own video goggles
and 3d virtual interfaces but they
aren't pioneering this stuff and they
are very late to the game really they
aren't even in it right now all the
innovation is happening with oculus
Samsung and many more but not Apple and
if you're someone who loves the idea of
an
Apple car a report from Apple Insider
says there has been a hiring freeze on
project Titan after multiple execs
including Apple design chief Johnny I've
had be kind of happy with the project's
direction in progress this comes after
the Wall Street Journal reported that
project Titans head Steve's a desk II
told colleagues that he was leaving the
company for personal reasons so we're
just gonna pump the brakes on the output
car for now all right that's gonna do it
for this week's show you can email us at
the Apple byte at cnn.com or tweet me at
Brian Tong and I'll answer them after I
finish my personal arts and crafts time
thanks for watching we'll catch y'all
next time for another bite of the Apple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
