how to a contributor it's that time of
year again we're sitting down writing
out cards and taking pictures with
friends and family to send the cards to
those same friends and family is going
to happen luckily this year there's a
great new app for the iPhone their iPad
that allow you to create cards directly
from your device let's take a look
alright so I went ahead and installed
the sincerely Inc app which is brought
to us by the same people who made posta
Graham this time around they're letting
people saying holiday or Christmas cards
using pictures that are right on their
iOS device and they've actually launched
an ipad version of the app as well as an
iphone version so once you launch the
app you'll be able to preview cards
you'll see a great outbox with the plus
symbol that's where you're going to be
able to enter a picture from your camera
roll so once you enter a picture you can
zoom in on it you could zoom out you can
move or move it around a little bit
adjust it and then once it's there it's
going to carry over to any other card
selections you have that include a
picture so you can get a good idea of
what the card is going to look like once
you're happy with the card and how it
looks you have a few different options
the first is you can change the filter
that's laid over the picture you have
black and white and sepia you also
notice some blue text blinking right
there that is a text hint where you can
enter your family name or any other text
that you'd like and once you're happy
with the front of the card you tap on
back flip over and you could enter your
holiday greeting for whatever family
member you're sending the card off to
once you're happy with the selection tap
on let's ship it and here it's going to
check to see if you haven't sincerely
Inc account already if you've ordered
postal gram cards in the past go ahead
and enter the same email address you use
here it'll pull up your same account and
have all of your information ready if
you haven't used in this is your first
experience with sincerely go ahead and
enter your email address and set up an
account alright so i went ahead and
entered my account information it found
my account and remember
my address from past experience each
card is going to run you 199 you can buy
cars in bulk to get a bit of a discount
we'll go over that here in just a second
so the last screen before you ship off
the card gives you a preview one more
time what the card looks like and asked
you for your payment information they do
it a little differently it's not an
in-app purchase that is processed
through your iTunes account you actually
need a credit card in order to place the
order so we'll go and back out of that I
don't want to send myself a Christmas
card but we have our settings for our
account down here if we tap on that
you'll see buy credits and this is how
the credit structure works for the
sincerely Inc holiday card app you get a
bit of a discount the more credits you
by sending a card in the US it takes 10
credits sending a card internationally
is about 15 credits so you have you
could buy up to 147 cards worth of
credits which is going to run you 250
bucks or you could buy you know 50
credits for nine dollars and ninety
cents it's really up to you to send a
card in the US it's a dollar ninety-nine
to send it internationally it is 299 so
now that we've taken a look at how to
use the sincerely egapp to send holiday
cards this holiday season make sure to
join us over at how to cnet com and
follow the link in the post if you want
to download the app it's absolutely free
it's not going to charge you anything
unless you actually decide to send off a
few cards with the app</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
