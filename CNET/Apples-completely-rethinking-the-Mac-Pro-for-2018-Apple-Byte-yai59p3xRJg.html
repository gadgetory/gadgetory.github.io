the Apple buy for everything good and
bad inside the world of Apple would you
believe we have a story about new Apple
products coming out in 2018 but this is
not a rumor it's coming directly from
Apple now Apple is going to give the Mac
Pro a major makeover and yes it is
coming in 2018 now realizing Apple Pro
users have been fed up with the Mac Pro
and the lack of updates with nothing for
over three years
Apple opened up for the first time to a
small group of tech journalists in an
openness and honestly a little bit of
desperation we have never seen by the
company in the history of Apple Phil
Schiller admitted we're in the process
of completely rethinking the Mac Pro
Craig federighi said in retrospect it
didn't suit some of the people we wanted
to reach and we'd found ourselves a bit
boxed in by a circular shape the new Mac
Pro will be an all-new modular design
unlike the current Mac Pro where
upgrades were external via Thunderbolt
now professionals will be able to
configure the new one the way they want
it and Apple will also be doing a pro
display specifically for this new Mac
Pro it will not be an LG display it will
be an apple Pro display now Apple
declined to comment
how far along they are in the process
but they made sure to say you won't see
any of these products this year now
could you imagine if they stayed silent
for another year Plus like they normally
do people would be burning Macs on the
street just like they did to their
LeBron jerseys ok maybe not and where
are those people now and look at this I
mean he's posing here I just passed yeah
now Phil Schiller said this we made
something bold that we thought would be
great for the majority of our Mac Pro
users and what we discovered was that it
was great for some and not others enough
so that we need to take another path one
of the good things hopefully with Apple
throughout the years has been a
willingness to say when something isn't
quite what we wanted it to be didn't
live up to expectations to not be afraid
to admit it and look for the next answer
see again this is transparency that we
have never seen before and yes they took
a chance they really did screw up on the
Mac Pro but at least they're getting
their message clearer to pro users we
still care about the Mac you're just
gonna have to wait until 2018 but at
least they're doing
Dean and for that right now a humbled
Apple gets a good Apple all right now if
you can't wait and for some reason you
still need a MacPro
right now they've made some updates the
entry-level mac pro for two thousand
nine hundred and ninety nine dollars
will now come with a six core Xeon
processor instead of four and upgraded
dual fire pro D 500 GPUs now the
high-end 3900 $99 model will bring eight
cores and go from dual D 500 to dual
d700 GPUs but there's still a lot of
other nuggets that came out from Apple's
powwow now Apple confirmed to TechCrunch
that they are working on new iMac models
that they expect to launch later this
year including some new configurations
designed specifically for pro users who
are already fans of the all-in-one
design now after the Mac Pro came out
they found a lot of pros were actually
shifting to the iMac but do not expect
touchscreen Macs when Mashable asked if
Apple might consider a touchscreen one
Schiller clearly said no he added for
pro customers when talking to them about
the things they're most interested in
this doesn't even register now also
during the conversation how to confirm
to website Axios that there are no plans
for macs to be solely based on arm chips
after many rumors have claimed Apple
might take their mobile chip platform to
the next level and what about the Mac
Mini so many of you have asked about
that as well Gary fireball reports
Schiller said on that I'll say the Mac
Mini is an important product in our
lineup and we weren't bringing it up
because it's more of a mix of consumer
with some pro use the Mac Mini remains a
product in our lineup but nothing more
to say about it today I'm sorry Mac Mini
lovers I know how you feel right now so
a lot of juicy news around the Mac Pro
this week actual real news not rumors
not fake news real stories but let's get
to a couple of those rumors stories you
love so much
according to digit times the third
generation Apple watch is scheduled to
be released in the second half of 2017
with battery life and performance
improvements LTE has been a long rumored
feature few details are really known in
know parts from the supply chain of even
leaked out which would indicate we
aren't really that close or the design
won't change that significantly but what
would be an apple buy show without the
obligatory iPhone
story of the week we're used to seeing
new iPhone releases in September but
according to the economic daily news
suppliers are having technical issues in
the production of the upcoming iPhone
due to differences in the OLED display
lamination process and integrating the
new 3d sensing front camera system that
could delay the rumored high-end 5.8
inch OLED iPhone sometime in October and
even November no
Oh remember all right that's going to do
it for this week you can email us at the
Apple bite at cnet.com or tweet me at
Brian Tong thanks so much for watching
we'll catch y'all next time for another
bite of the Apple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
