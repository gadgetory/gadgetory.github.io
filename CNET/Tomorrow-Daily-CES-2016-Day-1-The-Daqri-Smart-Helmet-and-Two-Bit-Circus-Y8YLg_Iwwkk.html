daiquiri smart helmet which is pretty
amazing we're also talking to the CEO of
two bit circus Brent Bushnell guys we're
here it's Las Vegas this is CES 2016 and
this is tomorrow daily
greetings citizen to the internet you
can clap it's cool we should clap let's
get excited nothing like begging for
applause show you know what I have no
shame and I will beg for that applause
welcome to tomorrow daily the best geek
talk show in the known universe I am
Ashley sceva and i'm jeff cannata and
this is my first CES Ashley this is I'm
so excited for you because there are so
many great things at CES this must be
like Candyland for you it's a bit
overwhelming I have to say but I have
seen the televisions and they are
glorious I have experienced the the VR
and it is a magnificent we've met the
robots I have touched the cars I I it's
all happening it's all happening I mean
I saw an amazing XO skeleton that
simulates aging it's over here in south
hall it's unbelievable people put on an
exoskeleton that limits their mobility
and then also limits their hearing in
their site with a headset it's pretty
amazing stuff but just being on the show
floor at CES simulated aging yeah that
too no it actually it just ages you just
I went grey look at the show went so
show is so hard I went grey okay so
let's get to first things first we have
a very special demo guest to come out
and talk about one of the products that
we were pretty excited to see if the
show is pretty interesting this is the
daiquiri smart helmet it was at the
Intel keynote there's a lot of
interesting things happening with that
so we are we are welcoming to the stage
are our good friend our good friend from
Intel hello how are you uh ya know
Prince Prince second half or a second
half okay so let's bring out the helmet
and take a look um and we can we can
show it and you can talk a little too
what exactly it is and this is something
that actually unlike a lot of things at
CES you can buy right now exactly yeah
as of yesterday available and shipping
it's also a little bit different in that
it's designed for an industrial use case
and it's also not trying to be both
industrial and consumer at the same time
really takes the considerations of an
industrial environment and an enterprise
setting into consideration but provides
that immersive wearable experience that
everyone is looking for so oh go ahead
so this is actually a
a piece of safety equipment as well as a
piece of technology yep exactly yeah
provides safety both physically but also
the digital content make sure that
you're doing the right thing that you're
in the right place you know and that
you're safe by virtue of doing that and
you can take it out of the doctor right
and mostly it's control at AR is the the
main augmented reality is sort of the
main feature of this and is this running
on the new platform to Curie platform
not in the Curie it's on the intel core
m 7 so it's you know pretty heavy-duty
architecture and really that horsepower
is what's necessary for that industrial
use case and also to drive the complex
sensor package that allows us to
understand what it's seeing so the intel
realsense camera actually was a perfect
fit for us as well because it had depth
sensing had you know high quality
capture of that data that drives the
overall system so we're seeing some
video now of what it might be like for
somebody wearing the helmet so you're
saying we're on a work site where you
know we're safe because we have the
helmet on but we're also seeing
augmented reality information that's
telling us what maybe needs to be worked
on is it architectural perhaps we're
seeing the idea of stuff that's not
there yet but that will be there as we
build it it can be that way it can also
be maintenance procedures it can be you
know electrical mechanical and really
even multiple people can see different
things while looking at the same
environment so depending on your skill
set and the things that need to be
addressed in that particular situation
it's going to serve up the most
contextually relevant pieces of
information and at the point of views
and without taking up your hands which
is really critical because they've had a
lot of this technology for quite a while
but it's always kind of taken up one or
both of their hands do you think this is
something because for me I'm looking at
this and as you said in the workplace
kind of frees up your hands do you think
this is something that may be astronauts
could use in the future because that's
obviously a thing that they are trying
to sort of work out with robots that
help free up their hands and free up
things for them to do is this something
that you could potentially see maybe
someday in the future embedded into
astronaut helmets absolutely I can't
give a ton of information about it but I
can say we've had a number of really
interesting conversations and our
working on interesting projects that are
very close to that sort of use case as a
are sort of catches on and becomes more
mainstream and people understand the
capabilities of it do you think that
integrating it into the workplace first
is actually a strategy to make it seem
more commonplace absolutely i think you
know people's work is becoming more and
more of a centerpiece within their lives
and they contextualized who they are and
what they're able to do based on what it
is they do for work and so the helmet
really gives you capabilities and
abilities that you didn't have prior to
that point and I'm positive that people
will take this and bridge that gap into
their everyday lives into the consumer
space and it's you know really got a ton
of horsepower for those sorts of
applications as well now did you start
developing this in conjunction with
Intel or did you start on it and then
Intel you kind of worked with Intel
after you had worked on it a little bit
prior to working with Intel we had
documented a lot of the kind of
environmental requirements and system
requirements that would be necessary to
pull off a truly industrial enterprise
class device and that was when you know
we went out and looked at what
architectures would support that kind of
you know use case instead of needs and
Intel really you know met that perfectly
when we looked at all of those needs and
the fact that Intel already has such a
substantial base within the enterprise
so the systems integration challenges
become a lot easier when you've got
similar architecture on both ends so are
you envisioning this like a foreman
sitting in a control room at some point
and having an entire team of guys
wearing these that are all networked
together and so he's sending information
to different groups and different crews
and able to sort of orchestrate what
needs to be done and show visually in
the heads-up display you've just
described our remote expert application
where one foreman can then reach out to
dozens of helmets and otherwise that
Foreman would have needed to go out to
each of those job sites and and would
have had to perform those operations
himself or herself and and assist the
people on the ground now they can tell a
straight kind of John Madden style for
that worker exactly where that next step
is or you know other things to check to
resolve a deficiency or take care of an
issue so cool is there
can you explain some of the
considerations with that look of it is
it looks very futuristic as well was
that it was a design aesthetic something
that you were concerned about being you
know accepted onto a workplace the thing
that people forget about wearables a lot
of the time is it has to be something
you actually want to wear and something
that fits in the context of where you're
going to wear it you know if it seems
unnatural for that place or that time or
that social context you're not going to
pick it up even if it gives you
additional capabilities so here I think
we we've got a really nice balance or
marriage between something that is
clearly a tool it's not a toy it's
something that fits into the workplace
and sits alongside other tools it's not
it's not till I cuz like I kind of want
it to be a toy okay construction person
this would be a really fun toy but also
a useful toy yeah yeah but a lot of
tools are toys yeah that's very true
that's very true um thank you so much
for talking to us about that I this is
really exciting and and as we mentioned
this is something that is available now
I so unlike a lot of things you see at
CES that sometimes never even make it to
market this is available the daiquiri da
qri smart helmet and and powered by
Intel so thank you so much and we
appreciate it huh thank you so much for
having me by yeah appreciate it thank
you thank you all right Jeff well while
we say goodbye to this they decorate
smart helmet we have to we gotta talk
about VR okay I'm having such favorite
thing I spent seven hundred dollars on
it this morning I'm having some pains
I'm having some pains about the price of
the oculus rift and I wanted to talk
that out with you because you you bought
one u.s. reordered i SAT there this
morning in my hotel room here in Las
Vegas and I clicked and clicked and
clicked and was told sitedown site down
site down and I finally got in and got
one pre-ordered I did have a little
sticker shock and I think my wife if
she's watching this is gonna have even
more sticker shock go home and you have
to explain i accidentally pre-ordered i
accidentally fell onto my keyboard and
pre-ordered an oculus rift this morning
uh so five shows 699 is a price that are
599 fact it's about seven hundred
dollars after tax and shipping right now
so 599 is a little bit of a high price I
think a lot of people online we're
talking about how they were hoping that
that price would also include the
touch controllers right which it does
not and so virtual reality this is kind
of a this is kind of a big moment the
pre-order of oculus rift because this is
now the first official available for
order fully functional VR headset that
you do not need a phone to put into yeah
I mean I think that the the gear VR is
an excellent entry level thing I think
it's going to convince people that the
technology is real and it's really
immersive and really interesting I'm
hoping that for that premium price we
really get a premium product I'm
certainly hoping that a premium product
arrives at my doorstep because that the
thing that I think oculus understands
and certainly I understand is that if
people don't have an evolutionary
experience the first time they try VR
it's going to be dead in the water and I
don't want that to have the price point
means it's only going to be the most
enthusiastic early adopters and so when
you have an early adopter who's even
slightly disappointed about a product
that they invested quite a lot of time
and energy and money into that's when
you run into problems so I I really
agree with you and I don't think it just
has to be super polished on the hardware
side it also has to be so good on this
on the software's and compelling
software titles and compelling gaming
experiences I mean another beyond VR
there should be things beyond gaming
that I feel should be available at
launch yeah April April is coming out so
you got a few months to wait I i I've
definitely seen a bunch of other VR
headsets here on the show floor and
everybody is gleefully saying things
like half the price of oculus yeah this
and I just was a big deal i hope that
that these other headsets aren't half
the quality of all oculus as well I
really hope that this this premium price
really results in a premium product and
it can convince people that it's it's
worth the money I hope it's worth my
money I hope your money or my money to
it the vibe on the other hand is saying
we are a premium product and we're
probably gonna be you know they kind of
insinuated they'd come out of the gate
more expensive than oculus well you got
to figure the oculus is coming with a
xbox one controller a
a wireless adapter but it's not coming
with those touch controllers and the
vibe also supposedly will have the you
know the room sensors and the touch
controllers it's going to be a more
expensive product I'm a little scared of
what that might run people you guys have
got to get your wallets ready because
the virtual reality revolution is coming
and it cheap it is not going to be cheap
but we are going to take a very quick
break and then we're going to come back
with the CEO of two bit circus Brent
Bushnell is going to join us and we are
excited to talk to him about making
events that are sort of at the
intersection of Technology spectacle and
and the future so stick around we'll be
right back tomorrow daily
welcome back to the show we have
returned we haven't we have a new guest
yes you guess red bush mail from a two
bit circus which is a really fascinating
company tell me a little bit about what
you guys do we're literally a high-tech
circus so we replace we basically use
lasers fire and robots to make new
styles of entertainment are you hiring
we always job we are looking for nerds
everywhere we can find them yeah all
right so show but I I mean I'm just
saying like just in case you need a you
talk show about events we could do it we
wanted where you're trying to create
experiences using technology that are
more interesting more exciting exactly
well you know tech has gotten so awesome
computer vision cheap sensors all this
fun stuff we basically said what kind of
new ways can we play given all that
entertainment so we spent a lot of time
with virtual reality we run our own
traveling carnival they use a bunch of
high tech entertainment to get kids
excited about science engineering so
there's really sort of a lot of options
here now speaking of the word carve a
laser or you serve triggered my memory I
believe on your website i read that
you're CTO used to be in the circus in
addition to being a genius roboticist it
was a clown in a circus is an amazing
fire dancer he even is a ranked Whistler
exact same resume so weird there's no if
there's just no space fellow agent I'm
sorry Barry took a job I hope house you
quickly here is a unicycle rising least
you could play the cymbals yeah yeah so
how do you find people to work at a
company like this because obviously you
are really at the intersection of
spectacle technology and future tech and
so how do you find people that are
really kind of imaginative but also
grounded in the way that you sort of
need to build these installations that's
a great question a lot of them actually
find us you know it's sort of a random
set of skills that would be electrical
engineering unicycling and a you know
whistling or not and so a lot of those
folks will reach out and be like oh my
god I did my thesis on circus but my
backgrounds education and and so that's
been really fun have a home these people
they finally has amazing so tell me
specifically some of the things you've
done you have this traveling circus for
example yeah
that's geared at kids it's its focus to
kids 8 to 14 but it's really fun for all
I mean the kinds of games we've been
making it we've brought to amazon's
holiday party of all adults or Intel's
conferences and so the entertainment
really all ages but then we also pull
back the curtain and show everybody how
we made this stuff and one of the things
it's so fun is all of this tech is
easier than it's ever been you look at
you know Intel's curry module and you
know Scratch programming you know what
used to take 20 lines of programming you
can do on your iPad in pictures now and
so there's really a lot of opportunity
and we basically say hey you can do this
too and if we do our job right will
inspire a whole army of inventors it
reminds me of that great quote that you
know any sufficiently advanced form of
technology is indistinguishable from
magic you know it's that kind of idea is
that making technology feel like magic
to the end-user right absolutely so so
here's a good example remember the old
dunk tank where you throw a ball when
you fall in water ours is the dunk tank
flambe where you're literally immersed
in a 10-foot fireball now that sort of
feels like magic right parties that
sounds like the scariest thing ever so
the best part is you don't die you know
the with the tech this amazing new text
bodysuit you're able to literally
withstand those flames and you're off
and run out oh so it's not just an
optical illusion you're actually
dropping people into a fire bonfire but
that feels like magic right yeah that
definitely would seem like magic to me
yes so are you guys actually inventing
the things that you take with you on
these uh these tours yeah so you know I
mean it's sort of tough to say inventing
what we will come up with with the games
with the interactions we're gonna be
leveraging lots of other people's tech
robots and lasers and whatnot we've done
some of the stuff we've done with VR you
know Samsung's gear VR and then we sit
you in a motion platform we built our
own 360 camera and captured what it was
like to be a racecar driver for the Indy
500 and so then you get to you know we
assembled all of those pieces built all
the content and then we take that on the
road so you take it on the road in in
the way of I mean how do people find
like it do they have to be and privately
invited to these events or is there an
actual you know circus that people can
go to just like the days of old where
you could buy your ticket and get some
peanut
some popcorn nailed it there it is a
physical event will be in this year
Seattle Charlotte Dallas in Chicago
starting in April and then the second
half of the year were planning right now
how many how big is the is the traveling
company it is so our core team is 30 the
event itself is massive it's about
120,000 square feet so think like two
football fields so and helming out
different attractions for lack of a
better word we're probably up to about
50 now 50 or 60 and every that's
everything from a drift trike race track
using local motors verado you know i
mean it's literally like a like a big
kid big wheel but but with an electric
motor in it so we have a whole drift
trike race track and then rooms are
laser beams walls of buttons all sorts
of fun stuff I want to go to there due
to I want to live there I heard a rumor
that you are based in Los Angeles which
means we could potentially tour your big
top facility oh my god we would love it
in fact our big tops of old power plants
and if you know the term steam for
science technology engineering art and
math and so it's adding are 10x you
often hear in a stem right but I think
art is it at to fundamentally be
creative and be as you know G what you
can any other sciences you need art I
think fundamentally you know engineering
this kind of problem solving is
fundamentally creative and we felt like
the arts made it more accessible
especially for kids who are not excited
about science and engineering the arts
make it fun and exciting and so it's
sort of a fun way to lever what they
love and then sort of deliver the
learning sort of secretly yeah it starts
like putting spinach and macaroni and
cheese yeah the same time in the
cupboard vitamin very nice here at CES
are you wandering around and going all I
could use that oh my gosh that's a
really cool thing absolutely and in fact
I'm desperate for a VR headset for out
of home you know a lot of the VR
headsets are consumer but you know you
try to put i could sell yeah yeah i mean
the daddy thing is gorgeous so so r you
know looking for that you know it's fun
to see a lot of the interactive devices
you can now use to augment your VR
experience so you're tracking your hands
just saw the X immerse thing that allows
you to just with a regular Samsung gear
VR track your hands so that's really fun
so trying always to find whatever sort
of new things we can incorporate
what is your what is your sort of
ultimate wish I mean you guys are you
guys dreaming of a hollow deck type of
situation is that the end goal it's jeff
ER c michael douglas in the game ok so
we you know that you are not controlling
a video game with your thumbs and that
he was the character in the game you
know we want that kind of total
immersion so you know we love VR wheel
of a are we you know our sort of final
place is is that kind of entertainment
for everybody you know short of bearing
you live in mexico right sounds pretty
traumatic yeah it's called fear factor
so what is what would you say is your
favorite installation that two bit
circus has built uh man probably hard to
choose a favorite cuz they're all like
your children yeah that's a good
question I I gotta say that dunk tank
that fireball dunk tank is wonderful i
love rag yeah i'm dying to try this
ashley that's good i want to be
submersed in fire yeah i just want to be
dropped into I know I don't I you know
what I'll do I'll throw the ball drop
right in there and then I'll wave and be
like oh my gosh looks like you're on
fire and then and that you can jump out
and be like I'm not sorry fine my mom
refused to throw the ball she was like
no way not gonna hurt her yeah this is
good mom be like give me more can I do
like six times felt like yeah please you
I'm gonna get back at you for being like
a terrible to bring a terror okay so two
bit circus uh here's another question do
you I think I saw some of this do you
create things for more corporate
installation so for example like a like
a Dave &amp;amp; Buster's is that something that
you would work with their corporates or
create something that everyone can enjoy
absolutely so Dave &amp;amp; Buster's been a
longtime partner of ours in fact we have
some really fun stuff works installing
with them in q1 that are sort of shrunk
down versions of this kind of stuff we
take on tour so very excited to show you
guys that stuff we got a few things in
there right now and a few more coming so
it's gonna be a brother down version if
now you have two bit circus does a lot
of VR things particularly like right now
it seems like you're very interested in
that aside from the total immersion end
game let's let's play a little game
let's get a hypothetical here
so the keynotes here at CES are fun but
you know I say a little dry I'm dare a
little dry feel like we could really
spice them up with two bit circus so
let's let's take an example it's let's
throw one out there how would you make
any of the keynotes better here at CES
20 what's a Quincy has 2017 what's the
what's the keynote that you'd want to
give people that is an awesome question
and and and really I would follow a
Brian krzanich is lead from Intel who
you know they had a whole bunch of
different kinds of interactive things
that they had on stage you know the only
no touch instrument like until recently
was the ferryman right that sort of rule
sci-fi instrument well they had a whole
bunch of no touch instruments where
people had different sensors on their
hands and we're dancing and moving
around and I feel like there's a lot of
room for sort of new styles of
entertainment experiences using that
kind of technology to you know sort of
augment and sense you know what people
are doing on stage and then have crazy
visuals that happen as a result all
kinds of different kinds of musical
triggers that could happen so I feel
like there's really a big great domain
their drones so drones especially when
you mount a bunch of cameras and you
have them under computer control you can
do all sorts of crazy styles of
entertainment of you know shows that
would have them all you know
crisscrossing and doing the parrot but
as the dancing Jones thing yeah it's
very cool and so you know put a little
display on each one of those and all of
a sudden you could start to have a very
you know augmented kind of visual
experience that I think would be quite
neat we talked about a few maybe a
couple months ago we talked about these
very micro drones that had small LED
screens on them and they were able to
sort of very similar to the fish in
finding nemo they were able to sort of
can all come together into and yeah and
into an image and each one of them sort
of acted as its own pixel and that seems
like something that would very much be
right up your alley I love that that's a
great call and then the other place you
go is audience control you know you
finally have everybody with a device or
you know really cheap sensors that would
allow you know the whole audience to be
able to start control what's going on
you know was that you were controlling
the audience the audience that's me I
love it that's so cool yeah that is the
Samsung booth here at CES also had a
bunch of there
you know ultra HDTVs but mounted on
things that they would all move so the
images would interact as the screens
came together and moved apart and stuff
it's a really exciting time I think for
technology because it's enabling stuff
like what you guys are doing that is
this intersection of sort of magic and
stage performance and technology and all
I said it's really really cool you know
there's this this period of time from
when tech sort of comes out of the lab
and before it's may be ready for the
home that there's really a special place
to do it in out of home and you know as
an example the camera that powers the
kinect was a ten-thousand-dollar camera
before was a hundred bucks you know and
so on just about every domain you can
think of that's true and for VR right
now the best experiences you get are
going to be the ones in out-of-home
because now you can be in a motion
simulator or in a walking solution and
also all the sort of other stuff that
that you know it maybe isn't ready for
the home but you can do in and
out-of-home context all right so last
thing and then we'll let you go and
where we're going to wrap up the show
here I'm just gonna pitch it to you now
I think you could bring it here next
year an instrument lesueur castra with a
drone ballet oh I like it I thought
you're gonna say burn my co-host well
that's after no not burn you not burn
you not right I'm sorry I fancy suit I'm
really slowing a gun to pick up on I
just put me in the thing I don't care
about me in a fireball take a fireball
anyway yeah that's all um thank you so
much you can find two bit circus online
there at two bit circus on Twitter and
then two bit circus com it's really easy
to find them you guys should definitely
check out they have an amazing array of
pictures and video of all the different
installations that they've been involved
in and it is is actually really cool all
right thank you so much appreciate it so
if you want if you want to stick around
while we close out show it's all good
let's do it alright guys so that is it
for the show today we will be back
tomorrow with a a slew of guests uh oh
man CES gonna keep rolling we're gonna
keep doing shows tomorrow yeah epic
time we've got Nick Cannon come to the
stage tomorrow my gosh it's fancy
iJustine yeah maybe you forever and joey
graceffa and they are they are the
ambassadors for entertainment matters
yeah we made use
an amateur burning of a co-host I don't
know I know you know what I've been
inspired the sky's the limit on tomorrow
daily everybody that is it for the show
please feel free to hit us up on social
media we are tomorrow daily all over the
internet that's right uh and again two
