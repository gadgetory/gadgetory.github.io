welcome back to the Apple by returning
to your normally scheduled programming
after a couple weeks of break and the
madness that is CES plus I'll finally
announce the winners of our favorite
things give away all right lots of news
this week and the buzz is all around the
Apple watch now apple recently released
the fourth beta of the upcoming iOS 8
point to update and previous builds have
included watchkit support for testing
out apps in the bluetooth section now
the latest update adds an Apple watch
connection link and also revealed there
will be a standalone Apple watch app now
9to5 mac has shown off some of the
features of this companion app including
an over-the-top virtual view of the
Apple watch home screen so you can see
how your apps are organized a new watch
face called monogram will allow you to
include one to four letters typically
your initials directly on the watch face
to personalize it now I'd go with B t +
Z since my friends call me btz but I
probably didn't need to tell you that
I'll write a subtle red dot will appear
on the top area of the Apple watch's
clock face for new notifications and
since there's no keyboard you can
respond either using Apple's dictation
which is world's better now or record an
actual audio message the companion app
will also let you activate Fitness
features like reminders if you've been
sitting on your butt too long your
activity progress or completion of
activity goals and the Apple watch app
will show you storage capacity number of
songs on the device photos and apps
confirming that it will indeed have
actual usable storage space the Apple
watch was rumored to be shipping in
spring of 2015 but the latest reports
point to retail associates starting
training on the wearable in mid-february
with the actual apple watch targeted to
ship by the end of March all right now
one of the cool new pieces of tech from
Apple's watch is force touch the big a's
pressure sensitive touch technology that
can distinguish between a light tap and
a deep press now a new rumor report
coming out of taiwan claims apple's
considering using the force touch tek in
its next iPhone that's realistically
about nine months out can you believe it
nine months
and they're also considering moving to a
dual lens design that would allow for
optical zoom capabilities in the iphone
for the first time now I like the idea
of both of these features but I wouldn't
expect them to throw these into the mix
with such a short lead time this sounds
more like iphone 7 stuff instead of
success but I'm just hoping that I too
can draw hearts that someone can feel
from my iphone sooner rather than later
I love you all right in Mac news there
are still many of you waiting for a new
macbook air with a Retina display
according to digit times apple supplier
quanta computer has begun ramping up
production for the upcoming air ahead of
its release that's targeting the first
quarter of this year the new 12-inch air
is expected to feature Intel's Broadwell
core and processor with its fanless
design making it thinner reports have
also claimed it will get rid of almost
all the ports found on current macbook
airs and contain a headphone jack a pair
of microphones and a USB type-c port to
handle charging and connectivity alright
shifting things to the smart home it was
a huge theme at CES 2015 and we showed
you I devices switch the first home kit
compatible smart plug we talked about
how it worked through its own app or
with Siri with voice commands now that
all works fine and dandy if you're at
home on your Wi-Fi but if you're at work
or heading out of town The Verge reports
that you'll need to have a third
generation Apple TV or later to remotely
control them now that will serve as the
hub for these smart devices when you're
away so quietly the apple TV is becoming
a more important part of apple's plan
for the home and the more cool apple TV
news a recently granted apple patent
hints at an in-air 3d gesturing user
interface for the apple TV Mac and
future products apple acquired 3d sensor
company primeSense back in November of
2013 that also works with Microsoft's
Kinect and the patent grants a 3d UI for
use with crime senses motion sensing
hardware that is now all under apple now
look the apple byte was away ahead of
the curve on this one and imagined what
this could be like a few years ago whoa
do that it's called bright TV
then wait yeah here I got you pause
checks out bright TVs the best yeah it
is so yeah coming soon to a living room
near you and in our do not try this at
home story a Chinese man yes my people
decided to come up with his own Apple
wearable and tried to smuggle 94 iPhones
from Hong Kong where they're cheaper
into mainland China by wearing them
inside his clothes attached to his body
now The Huffington Post reports the man
was pulled aside by custom officials as
a result of his weird walking posture
joint stiffness and muscle tension now
