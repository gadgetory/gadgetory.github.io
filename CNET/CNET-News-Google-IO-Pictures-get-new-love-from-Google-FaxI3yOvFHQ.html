some major changes to its google plus
social network i'm dan farber from cnet
and i'm joined by our google
correspondent seth rosenblatt sets so
there's some big things going on with
Google+ apps competing with Facebook
absolutely there's actually three big
changes to the network will go over the
two smaller ones first you'll notice
that google has a new layout for Google+
it's more of a sort of its Pinterest via
cards google now's so let's get into it
so Pinterest means lots of pictures lots
of pictures ins in the net cards means
lots of data that can be brought out
metadata that can product so the big
change really out of all three is what
they've done to photos you now can
upload your vacation photos for example
and Google will do a number of things to
them that they think you want them to do
this includes getting rid of bad photos
photos that are how to focus photos that
are overexposed underexposed photos that
don't really seem to be of anything it
just Flags them oh it doesn't just dump
them into the door no it doesn't delete
them but it filters them out at the same
time eight filters in photos that it
thinks you care about for example if you
tag a woman in your photo as your wife
with her name the next time you search
for that name it will find other photos
that look like her it will also flag
things like mountains and sunsets and
beaches so if you go on a vacation to
Thailand and you type in Thailand beach
it will be able without you doing
anything to simply pull out all the
photos that are thailand and beach from
your photo stream or from the public
from your photo store but also i would
assume from a public five streams i
would assume that too and i was that is
that using some of the technology from
knowledge graph which which it where it
knows about lots of entities like 500
million entities absolutely and all the
connections between those entities yes
so we are seeing behind the scenes sort
of a tightening of the strings of
Google's knowledge base the various
things that it's doing are becoming more
integrated with each other this is
something that we saw with Google+ over
the past year as Gmail was brought in
and Google Drive was brought in
so these things are really becoming
components of the same hole and you get
your screen 16 gigabytes for free yes
and they just announced Monday that you
now have 15 gigabytes that you can use
across gmail across Google Drive across
Google Plus for your photos how do you
think this is going to play out photos
is a huge part of what Facebook does an
Instagram which also part of Facebook so
is this a Google's attempt to really
make its photos much more competitive
than than what's out there Oh without a
doubt one of the interesting things that
the new photo features can do is
automatically stitch together panoramas
it can tell when photos look like they
have a seam between them and so it can
stitch those together there's also the
ability to do automatic gifing those
short little animated gifts this can now
do that automatically which is really
quite incredible well thanks for all of
that inside Thank You den for cnet I'm
Dan Farber thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
