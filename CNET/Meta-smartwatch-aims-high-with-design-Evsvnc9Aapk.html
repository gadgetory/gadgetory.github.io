show in New York width of the meta
SmartWatch now metawatch was around a
couple years ago by the arrival of
franklin lobo who is the chief designer
at virtue and nokia has created a whole
new design reboot for this watch which
is coming out in May it actually is a
design that melts and fits around your
wrist with with a unique hinge system on
the side and the idea of the wash and is
highly reflective screen is to take at a
glance information and presented all in
one be a variety of apps and little
quadrants on the screen there could be
pedometer information missed calls
sports games you want to catch all that
but at a glance at once much like the
pebble the meta is intended to be used
mainly for notifications and information
and it works across iOS and Android so
you're not going to be making phone
calls and talking to people on this
thing but it is going to be used for at
a glance information to make your watch
smarter and look at it and then go on
with your life more information is going
to be available soon it has a fancy
leather band a very nice heft to it and
it feels very comfortable around your
wrist certainly one of the more luxury
design smartwatches that I've seen so
far this is the meta SmartWatch quick
look at it from New York Scott's
on the CNN</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
