CNBC got some information directly from
Samsung's president of mobile
communications DJ ko ko' said that
Samsung will bring quote cutting-edge
features to its cheaper models first end
quote
ko said they're moving to the strategy
to get more Millennials buying Samsung
phones but wait there's more
ko told CNBC that details of Samsung's
foldable phone are coming later this
year samsung has been showing off
flexible screens for a long time now
it's no secret the company is trying to
get a folding phone out to the public
before anyone else so when can we expect
to see the folder CNBC says that Koh
hinted details could come in November at
the Samsung developer conference on
two-way mo way a new report by the
information says that way most
self-driving cars are having some issues
on the road one person says she almost
hit a whammo car because it stopped
while making a right turn the report
says that quote more than a dozen local
residents who frequently encounter one
of the hundreds of way mo test vehicles
circulating in the area complained about
sudden moves or stops end quote
other issues include Wayne mo cars
having difficulty turning left
identifying groups of people issues with
merging and intersections near highways
we talked to Wayne Mo about the
information article and a spokesperson
told me quote way moe was founded on a
mission to make our roads safer and
that's why we built a cautious and
defensive driver the way to responsibly
deploy our fully driverless technology
is to robustly test and validate in a
geofence territory that grows over time
anything less than that undermine safety
and the promise of this technology and
quote let's head on over to update

Google fit or any of you wearing a wear
or less watch and if you do can you tell
me what it's good for because I'm
generally at a loss Google assistant

your chromecast if you're watching the
video and you ask about something like
the weather Google assistant will
overlay the information on what you're
watching at the time YouTube has
a new feature to your account page you

binge on to comment Cove this is the
part of the show where we shine a
spotlight on the most amazing audience

shame that Google could not come up with
its own original design just shameful rx
MacLaren's 7 says do you think the red
phone will be worth the hype and wait
I've been looking forward to it since it
was announced so long ago you know I'm
not sure it's worth the hype I like the
fact that the red phone does not look
like any other device I like that red is
trying something different with this
display but it's the company's first
phone we'll have to see what kind of
bugs need to be worked out
designer Grant says I did enjoy my stay
this week but as a wireless carrier
salesman I'm always excited to sell new
phones people want features they don't
care about price now I find that very
surprising thanks for that insight
Christopher says can't wait for that JBL
sound bar this should change the future
of Android TV if more companies follow
this will kill the competition that's a
good point
Android TV could really get a boost if
it was integrated into more devices in
