a car sometimes you've got to learn all
these different tech terms that you then
don't need to care about for another
five or seven years until you're buying
another one
I'm Brian Cooley here at Best Buy trying
to make it simple here's how to figure
out types of TVs okay first of all LED
LCD TVs are the new mainstream these are
extremely popular it's like the LCD TV
you probably have today but with LEDs as
the light source behind the picture
instead of fluorescent tubes as we used
in the past the benefits here are a very
thin TV that can have better performance
in terms of illumination of the picture
and also lower energy consumption that
said the fact that these have taken over
makes us a little sad because they're
pushing out our favorite which is plasma
plasma TVs have been around since the
dawn of this HD flat-panel era in fact
CNET's favorite TV over and over again
tends to be a plasma even right now the
downsides to them are they aren't
terribly thin they don't like to be used
at really high altitudes or in extremely
bright rooms and you're not gonna wow
your friends with some new technology
when you bring one of these home but get
over it it's what our editors spend
their own money on almost every time and
you get an outstanding picture for a
great value by the way plain old LCD TVs
are pretty much non-existent right now
they've all become LED LCDs you may find
a few models still being sold they're
not bad televisions they're just not the
latest television now let's get to the
latest the avant-garde televisions
beginning with 4k or ultra HDTV
this is a television that has twice the
number of lines of resolution counted
from top to bottom and therefore four
times the number of pixels as today's
best high def TVs it's an amazing amount
of detail what they do is bring you so
much more finest of each pixel that it's
almost impossible to see them but we're
finding it's not that impressive in
actual use because 4k pushes to and
actually beyond the limit of what your I
can discern also 4k TVs to do what they
really do well need native 4k content in
which there's almost none right now
and lastly 4k is best on a really big TV
above 65 inches at that point you're
pushing up against a different spec the
saf or spouse approval factor if you can
get past that and get a really huge one
you might see the benefit now OLED
technology is what we're really excited
about it stands for organic
light-emitting diode or only lawyers
executives and doctors because nobody
else can afford them right now
these TVs will come down in price in a
few years when they do they will bring
with them the holy grail which is that
they can show black perfectly when you
get black on the screen right all the
colors around it really pop they're more
saturated and more natural
additionally OLED TVs are incredibly
thin down to a third of an inch and can
use very little power it's the first TV
you may buy from the side as opposed to
the front you'll gasp when you see one
3d TV is still out there but it's a
feature in high-end televisions not so
much a different kind of television bear
that in mind it's not really going
anywhere because there are right now
about 800 3d blu-ray discs on all of
Amazon compare that to 25,000 streaming
titles on Netflix and yet we complain
that that's nothing to watch so a lack
of contents an issue so are the glasses
and recently even ESPN decided to cancel
their 3d sports channel role that
altogether and 3d is something that
would be nice to have but think of it as
just an augmentation of a high-end 2d
HDTV finally HDMI cables I have three
words about these by basic ones you can
spend 10 bucks on an HDMI cable or 300
and I will tell you this the picture
will be the same we're in the digital
era now where the digits that make up
video either
at the TV or they don't this isn't like
the old analog days where a better cable
or fussing with your antenna would give
you a little better picture it's either
there or it's not
so don't go nuts buying HDMI cables get
a good basic brand and be good with it
now notice I didn't clobber you with a
lot of specs like refresh rate contrast
ratio and subfield pixel drive that's
because we find you can read every speck
on the box and still not know if a TVs
good or not that's where we come in at
our C net labs we use expensive
instruments and very experienced odds to
tell you which ones have a great picture
regardless of specs and which ones maybe
don't so much find all those reviews at
