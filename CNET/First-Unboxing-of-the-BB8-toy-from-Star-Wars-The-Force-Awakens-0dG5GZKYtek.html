first time I want to make out with it
but I want what we're gonna do let me
bring this table forward because I know
you're gonna kind of show us this is
kind of like a unboxing of bb-8 and a
hands on a bb-8 I mean this is this is
pretty killer okay the goal was to
create a world within a world
so this is our bb-8 box and so think
about it if you bought a real droid in
real life it might come in a box like
this it's a very special container you
know and we give something away here
because if you hadn't thought if you
hadn't figured it out yet
bb-8 is BB and the number 8 I know I
read about that how that's kind of the
BB and 8 in the logo and it all kind of
comes together like that so the bracelet
it's a little hidden thing there you
know if you again most people figure it
out but if you haven't and then inside
we went you know Star Wars yeah zero and
here we go yeah
here's bb-8 now we do have a little bit
of instructions they're very very simple
yeah so I'll take them out and we can
kind of take a look at what you can do
awesome all right you know all of
Sierra's in the past of an inductive
charging so is this which means that
basically I don't need a connector on
bb-8 to bring him to charge him up pull
him out of here and the way that some
people like to think about this is that
when he's in here he's sleeping and
we've seen kids actually say oh he's in
his bed well he technically is sleeping
I mean it is a computer and just like
your laptop he does go to sleep so
that's him</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
