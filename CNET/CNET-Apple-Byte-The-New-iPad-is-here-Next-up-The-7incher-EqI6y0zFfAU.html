to the Alpha bite with a big hug from
our producer Jamie see that's how we get
your attention for all the good and bad
inside the world of apple with hugs from
cute people all right let's get to the
stories and with pre-orders online sold
out and slipping a two to three weeks
out before they ship the only way to get
an ipad on its release date is to get in
line with stores officially opening at
eight a.m. on friday now AT&amp;amp;T and
verizon have also confirmed you'll be
able to purchase units from them but
what's the fun in only waiting 15
minutes in line and come on you know you
want to see this guy now analysts are
already predicting that Apple could sell
over 1 million units on Friday alone
with the iPad new launching in more
markets this year a teardown in
benchmark tests have revealed a duel 1
gigahertz processor that's the same
classes the ipad 2 and an improvement
with one gig of ram running geek benches
test scored a 756 for the new ipad and
that's pretty close to the ipad tues 751
but it's not built to factor in its new
graphics performance and if you're
wondering how did anyone run tests on
the new ipad well the good people at
tint a who have been credible before
acquired a package ipad new before
anyone else and i know you might be
thinking oh you're really jealous are
you well i'm not special delivery oh
what's special coverage what is it what
is this look behind you career yeah i
know we'll check it out okay
so painful scream I think I'm gonna be a
little little time with this close the
door Jamie thank you
for god bless me
I say
Oh
my gosh oh alright i was confused by the
scrip oh my god wait it's not what it
looks like well the good thing is that
none of that actually happens in real
life right guys all right now don't
forget about the 7 inch iPad which makes
no sense to me for Apple to do right now
The Korea Times reports an anonymous
Samsung executive says Apple is
committed to purchasing nine point seven
billion dollars worth of components
driven by the new ipad macbook airs and
get this he said the smaller iPad and
they'll be using a new pls based LCD for
the baby iPad now didja x is also
keeping those rumors alive saying the
seven point eight five inch tablet will
use a slimmer bezel to maximize the
viewing area resulting in your fingers
covering the viewable area when you use
it now even with all this talk I'm still
not buying into the idea that Apple
really has to do this right now alright
let's take a breather with a few hidden
photography tricks that you might not
know about for your iPhone the iPhone
the latest software it lets you snap a
photo using the volume up button it's
convenient but what's even cooler about
this is that you can plug in your iphone
headphones and use the volume up button
here to snap a photo as well that means
that you get super study shots and you
can mount your phone on a tripod and use
this as a remote shutter release now
let's talk about lighting and focus when
you're taking a photo you can tap the
screen to set the focus and exposure for
any object but when you move around
those settings change so to lock those
settings tap and hold until the blue box
pulsates and this message shows up here
now as you move around those settings
won't change you might have seen a new
grid option on your iPhone's camera tap
options turn the grid on and hit done
now with this grid you can use something
called the rule of thirds some people
believe that if you align objects along
these horizontal and vertical lines or
along these intersections you can create
a more pleasing photo
so with this flower I'll put it on this
intersection tap to focus and now I have
a more interesting photo than just
placing it in the middle once you take a
photo you might want to crop it to
change the composition iOS has that tool
but here's an even easier way to do it
open your photo in the photo gallery and
pinch to zoom to change the composition
now hold the home button and tap the
lock button to take a screenshot now
your cropped photo will show up as a new
image in your camera roll alright thanks
Sheriff for the tips now the iphone 5
rumors are quite right now but we're
sure to see them soon with WWDC coming
in june see i made a rhyme but the
hottest rumors right now are all about
apple television set and a new report
from a Jefferies analyst claiming
there's evidence that an ITV or whatever
it's called is in the works with
specialty parts and components shipping
to apples Asia panel suppliers right now
now the report says it will start
commercial production in May or June
with 225 million units expected to be
built and a cue for launch now Apple
still isn't any closer with the rumored
streaming subscription TV service that
they've been pushing with resistance
from studios like our own parent company
CBS and others according to reports CBS
CEO les Moonves turned down a
partnership in november when steve jobs
offered to split the revenues for the
subscription content but the thing we
know studios don't like is losing money
on you platforms even if they can't
create them for themselves and there's a
reason why CBS isn't on hulu I'm sorry
Apple biters but I just don't expect to
see anything like this anytime soon and
in an update we told you last week that
movies from Fox and universal we're not
available for iCloud streaming due to
specific agreements with HBO and movie
studios now HBO is said that they should
be coming to an end within a few weeks
and they're working to loosen its
arrangements for the Fox Universal
content so that's good stuff there and
in a nap we're checking out for you road
warriors tether has launched their html5
based solution to use your iphones data
connection with your pc or mac laptop
now it also works with android and
blackberry phones and you don't need to
download anything
from the actual app store but its own
service that cost $15 for the first year
and thirty dollars feature after that so
check out tether this is really going to
give you a lot of value for your devices
and I'm excited to try it out alright
that's going to do it for this week's
show the new iPad craze is on and you
guys can send us your email to the apple
byte at cnet com i'm brian Tong thanks
for watching we'll catch you guys next
time for another bite of the Apple
you're right it is amazing it is amazing
look touch right there together told you
I'm gonna remember this moment for the
rest of my life it's all I</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
