here tonight to show off the new
daiquiri smart helmet and we've been
working with Intel to redesign the
helmet from the ground up the result is
an extremely powerful piece of
technology it has a six generation intel
core m seven processor and realsense
camera technology built right into the
helmet that's amazing that's an amazing
amount of technology and this is truly
different that's right we think we're
changing the way that people think about
safety and it's going to have a dramatic
impact on workers and it's something
that you really have to see so Sam here
our industrial worker he's going to show
us how powerful the helmet can be now
normally the smart helmet is Wireless
but we've attached a cable so the
audience can see exactly what Sam is
seeing here the smart helmet is
recognizing the equipment Sam is working
with and it's going to use computer
enhanced vision to actually read the
gauges of the equipment if you look it's
identified a potentially dangerous
pressure problem so it's going to use
augmented reality to give Sam
step-by-step work instructions to fix
the problem knowing what steps to take
and in what order can reduce the time
and increase the safety of these
activities it's amazing I mean it's
truly an amazing system thanks and and
when it's done it's actually going to
have help Sam order a replacement part
but that's not all let's show you
another aspect of the daiquiri smart
helmet if you look on the adjacent wall
there's another set of equipment and
from outward appearances everything
looks fine but let's switch on the
thermal vision with this it's like
giving the worker x-ray vision he can
actually see through objects and
identify potential problems before they
occur in electrical mechanical and even
plumbing systems</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
