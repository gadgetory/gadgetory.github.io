head-to-head today in a battle of the
cameras we have Samsung Galaxy s7 edge
versus Apple's iPhone 6s plus let's see
how these specs stack up in the real
world with an old-fashioned shootout
we'll start with your average landscape
photo Alto this is not your average
landscape the iPhones LCD display is no
match for the s7 s 2k OLED display so to
be fair we'll take the shots out of the
phone screen and on to yours I won't
reveal which is which until the very end
outside of the phones it's hard to tell
the difference between these two images
the one on the right is slightly sharper
with higher contrast while the one on
the left is more muted in this case the
image on the Left highlighted the bridge
better but they were neck-and-neck now
let's do it for close-up both lack the
depth of field I would have liked out of
a portrait shot but the one on the right
seems to have brighter colors and better
definition and now for an extreme
close-up up-close they did blur out the
background the one on the right more so
than the one on the left but it's a tad
overexposed and the colors are richer on
the left
and speaking of close-ups let's try the
front cameras with a selfie as with most
of these shots it comes down to personal
preference I'm more of a group selfie
girl so I appreciate the wider angle but
the one on the left has left the sore
shin and better color Samsung made a
point of highlighting the s7 faster
autofocus and if you've ever tried
photographing kids or pets you know that
time is of the essence so let's see
which one is better at capturing the
moment with an action shot both phones
snap the dogs may they're no problem I
like the warmer hues on the left but the
right seems to be sharper the s7 s
camera was easier to launch with a
double click of the home button which
saves you time but it was not always the
fastest at taking the picture
but all of these have been best case
scenarios and it's hard to get a bad
shot out here so we're gonna make it
harder and turn off the lights these two
shots were taken seconds after each
other but the difference is huge the one
on the right is sharper and much
brighter same goes for this bar shot and
by now you may have guessed which is
which the wider aperture of the s7 means
you get more light edging out the iPhone
in both low-light settings and with that
let's tally up the votes the s7 was a
winner in my eyes but not by a landslide
the iPhone fared better than I expected
considering it's one generation behind
and we'll have to wait a few months to
battle it out again against the iPhone 7
which one did you pick as the winner let
me know in the comment section below or
tweet me and be sure to check out the
