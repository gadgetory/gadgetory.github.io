going to need a set of indispensable
tools among them are a camera a video
camera a white noise generator a random
random word generator a thermal imager
and @na a digital tape recorder today
I'll be using the spirit story box app
developed by Roger and Jill Pingleton
it's a random name generator that gets
triggered by electromagnetic frequencies
the theory is that the spirits are able
to manipulate it and deliver a word that
is relevant to your situation we named
it spirit story box in honor of other
spirit boxes that had come before and we
do still consider it a very basic ghost
hunting tool it's portable it's easy
it's it's very simple and that's why we
did it is anybody can be a ghost hunter
anybody can put an app on their phone I
think it's a great conversation starter
so it comes up with a word and okay so
start asking questions about that word
good evening I am of course Professor
Mortimer noted academic on all things
supernatural and we're of course here in
Washington Square Park at Washington
Square Park was formerly a potter's
field estimates say that up to about
twenty thousand bodies still remain
under our feet at the moment so if
there's any place we're gonna find a
little bit of supernatural activity here
in New York City this would be a prime
spot among them you can see that this
was actually working quite well it's
picking up the lights that are hot
and something actually looks hot in this
foreground here and clearly there's
nothing there
the city is littered with spirits and
you'd be surprised how often that you're
right next to one another extremely
important and indispensable to love
paranormal investigation is just the
camera for instance we just took a
picture a few seconds ago and if you
look into the picture you can see the
outline of a face it's an incredible
piece of evidence now there we didn't
see this with our eyes but clearly the
camera is picking up things that the
human eye cannot when we talk about
ghosts and spirits I think what we're
actually talking about is human
consciousness just surviving the
physical body we believe that if a
spirit a human consciousness that
survives death can manipulate a random
number generator then at the time they
want it to choose a word they can
manipulate it so it will choose a word
it'll become non-random at the point
when the word comes up the activity
starting to pick up on the spirit story
box and we just picked up by actually
three words throughout shack friend a
friend diagnosis in villages can you
tell me how some of that might apply to
Odd Thomas me I can definitely tell you
how a friend diagnosis and dilligent
would relate back to him he after he
came back from France helping with the
French Revolution he actually grew very
unpopular here in America he wasn't
happy with the Constitution didn't allow
women to vote so love for slavery all
that kind of stuff and so he was trying
to tell people hey you're living your
lives wrong and he was very very
diligent about this so diligent that he
grew very unpopular here in America and
and he died in 1809 was buried
actually buried back upstate but his
body didn't stay there pieces of Thomas
Paine's skeleton continued to be kept as
souvenirs around the world it said his
spirit continues to hang out here
continuing to talk people say they've
heard him talk trying to continue to
convince us to make this world a better
place
we get stories from people every day
that have had amazing experiences
that part and parcel of that is that you
have to be open you have to be aware
that maybe you're getting a message that
you don't understand people will turn it
on run it for five minutes say this this
doesn't work we just ask people you know
go to someplace where there might be
some spirits you know have an open mind
let it run just see what happens see if
you can make sense out of what it is
telling you and you know maybe telling
you something that you know isn't part
of your experience but as part of a
spirit or or another humans experience
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
