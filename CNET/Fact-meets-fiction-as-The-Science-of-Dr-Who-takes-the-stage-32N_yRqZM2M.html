we've got a really special treat for the
who viens out there today I've got
robbed Lloyd the science buff Whovian
and all-round comic genius behind the
new show the science of Doctor Who the
show that explores the fact and fiction
alongside three scientists of the
longest-running sci-fi show in the world
thanks so much for coming to join us
today well well thank you so much for
just building me up a little bit too
much oh no you got it you gotta build up
a genius like you well I don't want to
say I'm a genius I'll just I'll just let
you do it and pay you later look um it's
a really cool show I'm really excited by
all the ideas behind it but when you say
the science of Doctor Who I must I must
admit I don't immediately think that
things like time travel regeneration a
TARDIS there's much larger on the inside
than it is on the outside I don't really
think of these things as scientific
possibilities well you can't explain it
well that's that's that's my opinion of
as well when I first got into the idea
of this show was and talking with the
the people behind it arias is sort of
like their outlandish ideas that's the
great thing about the show it takes any
possibility and it takes it as far as
they can but then sitting down with the
scientists involved with them finding
out how does this actually work from a
fundamental scientific basis the process
of being able to travel you know travel
forward in time or backward in time what
realities do you need to have and to
actually sit down with a group of
scientists and not go oh it's just
fantastical they go okay well let's look
at it from a realistic point of view
what you need to do to travel forwards
in time is actually have a machine
that's fast enough and they can actually
sustain the pressure of traveling
forwards in time and if you go fast
enough at a certain point you can go you
know move at the speed of light and when
you're moving fast enough time slows
down and so that means you can move
forwards in time but you can never
actually go back so you'd have to be
really specific and we're in the future
when I go and you have to really like it
there the thing that's great about the
show is that it seems to sort of go
through different versions of science
and different ideas that are getting
picked up I mean how how much do you
think the science of doctor who has
changed over its 50 years it's evolved
so much as 50 years five decades of
announcements of theories of ideas of
concepts of just way out radical
thinking so in the 60s there was X
explorations for the first time of
cybernetics and replacing human body
parts that was very new with science
fiction in the 60s that's where the
cyberpunk movement was first developing
and so dr. Kipp peddler who was one of
the writers on doctor who wrote the
Cybermen and created the submarine from
there and the 70s black holes were just
named for the first time and so that was
explored in the three doctors which was
the 10th anniversary story in the early
80s christopher h bid meet who was one
of the script writers he explored
nothing but the latest in scientific
theories he wanted to make the show less
funny and whimsical and make it a really
hardcore science fiction show so
exploring dimensions and other
dimensions and universes and how time
works and can be manipulated so it's
always been at the forefront of what is
being explored in science as kids coming
to access to show I mean there are some
scary elements to the actual doctor who
series but the science behind it you've
obviously targeted that as a young
audience and bringing them into the kind
of scientific fold if you will why is
that why is that so important how have
you done that well you know it's doctor
who can be scary but also science can be
quite scary as well and for me it's a
scary concept to try and wrap my head
around all these big ideas and big
thought so too have a show that is
welcoming for people of all ages to come
along and go no this isn't something
that's difficult or hard it takes a lot
of hard work but there's a lot of
excitement and possibilities behind it
so to bring kids in from a certain level
to go these are the possibilities this
is what we want to achieve and this is
where it starts we want them to start
asking questions that's what the
sciences have been saying it all starts
when you a scientists ask questions and
try and find those answers so if we
start them asking questions young that
means they'll stay with the love of
science all through their life so that's
really cool and all what I love at the
end of the show we have 20 minutes where
they can actually the audience can make
the scientists ask some questions or if
they have any doctor who can in
questions they can come and know
with me and the scientists just get
blown away with how many legitimate
science questions they get from from
from young kids in primary school or
high school kids University students who
are fascinated and interested and want
to actually find out more about you know
the science of not only Doctor Who but
also their world around them awesome and
so the show itself you were talking
about audience participation and stuff
you've kind of got a bit smart and savvy
and techie with the audience
participation tell me a bit about that
well yeah we have to keep up with a Mon
technology because now you know doctor
who's got special effects that actually
looked legitimate and then makeup and
all that type of stuff is up to scratch
so we've got a website that people can
access from their smartphones or the
tablets or whatever they're Androids or
synthetic life-forms that they bring in
and they go to this website on their web
browser and questions we have games and
activities where they can directly press
a button it registers within our system
and we showed up on the screen so we
asked them whether they want to travel
in time the past or the future we asked
them about what do they think about life
and other planets we also have big games
like run or fight so we have a clip of a
companion and finding out whether they
run away from a situation or stay and
fight and the big one is monster
showdown where we have for the big
monsters each of the scientists and
myself have been allocated them and we
plead the case and the audience decide
which is the greatest monster of all
time and who do you get to be I get to
be the weeping angels oh yeah yes the
but the other ones the beat of the
Daleks always yeah doctor who explores
scientific theories that could happen
that may happen that and take it to the
farthest possible possibility and that's
what we explore in the show as well what
is possible what is possible what could
be possible in the future thanks so much
for coming in and sharing your
passionate about the show it's really
great to have you and hopefully you'll
be able to share that passion in that
love with a whole bunch more people
awesome hey thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
