needs to get its act together this is
the Xperia XZ and while it's definitely
Sony's best phone to date it still does
not compete with his main rivals let's
start with the good things it looks
pretty nice with its blue metal design
it's water-resistant and while the 5.2
inch display is only full HD it's still
nicely bright and bold inside the phone
is a very potent processor that tackles
all of your everyday needs without
breaking a sweat that's when my
enthusiasm starts to dwindle the 23
megapixel camera is I guess fine but it
doesn't match up to the iPhone 7 or
galaxy s7 when it comes to dynamic range
in color on the side is a fingerprint
scanner unless you're in the US where
for some reason sony has decided to
disable that function perhaps Tony
doesn't think Americans have
fingerprints the battery life or the
ex-head really doesn't impress either
and I'm definitely not happy with all
the pre-loaded garbage sony has decided
to load onto the phone out of the box
it's not that the phone is bad far from
it it's a decent all-around phone and
it's the best Sony phone you can buy but
it's far from the best phone out there
the samsung galaxy s7 has a better
screen a better camera much better
battery life and you can pick it up for
less money than the sony x said it
really doesn't take a genius to work out
which is the best phone to buy I'll give
you a hint it's not the Sony</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
