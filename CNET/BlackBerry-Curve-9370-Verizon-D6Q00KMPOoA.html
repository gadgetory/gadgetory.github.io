Cena taking a first look today at the
blackberry curve 9300 phone for them and
one of the things that's most
interesting about it is that it is world
capable so you can take it to other
countries and pop in a GSM SIM card and
use it there as well as using it here
now the phone itself is very similar to
the 93 50 and 90 364 t-mobile in Sprint
it's a little bit smaller than the
predecessor model and it's also much
sleeker the design looks pretty nice
there's a sort of textured back cover
the keyboard here is pretty small and so
is the screen screen is 2.4 inches it is
not a touchscreen you do need to use
this optical keypad here to get around
even though the keyboard is a little bit
small I found it pretty easy to type
although the keys are a little plasticky
and it's not the best keyboard I've ever
seen from RIM there are definitely
better blackberry keyboards it is an
entry-level phone and it has a 5
megapixel camera on the back I was
pretty satisfied with the shots there
it's got this volume rocker and the
camera button on the side that are very
thin and I felt very uncomfortable to
use the phone costs $99 for Verizon
after a $50 mail-in rebate or online
rebate this is sort of an expensive
price for an entry-level phone but if
you are a BlackBerry devotee and you are
looking for something of this caliber
then this is definitely a step up from
the previous model of curve for Verizon
however if you don't really care about
the platform then I think that your
money could go a little bit further with
an Android phone once again this is the
blackberry curve 9380 Belcourt you're
watching CNN and you can read the full
review and all other reviews at cnn.com</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
