what-you-see-is-what-you-get with the
display while you can adjust the
brightness you have no control over the
contrast or the color
luckily Samsung isn't like most
manufacturers I'm dan Graziano and I'm
going to show you how to change the
screen mode on the galaxy s5 in the
companies note an S line of smartphones
Samsung gives the user the ability to
adjust the display to meet this certain
needs go to the settings menu click on
display and select screen mode from here
you'll be presented with five options
adapt display dynamic standard
professional photo and cinema by default
the phone is set to adapt display this
will optimize the color range saturation
and sharpness of the display while
inside the camera gallery Internet
Google Play Books Smart Remote and video
apps however this mode may not work with
some third-party apps it's best to turn
on add app display when using the phone
and high ambient light like so when
you're outdoors on a bright sunny day
when the display is set to dynamic and
standard modes both will over saturate
colors quite a bit dynamic more so than
standard but if you want colors that pop
and don't care about accuracy this
modes4u professional photo offers good
colors and should be used when viewing
high-end Adobe RGB photos such as those
taken with a DSLR camera but if you want
the most accurate colors you should go
with cinema mode the folks over at
Display mate found that while in cinema
mode the Galaxy s5 had the most accurate
display of any smartphone or tablet
they've ever tested cinema mode is
perfect for viewing photos of friends
and family and watching movies and TV
shows when shopping for products online
having the display in cinema mode will
ensure that that blue shirt you're
buying is the correct shade of blue
cinema mode performs best when used
inside areas with low ambient light I
also recommend disabling the Galaxy s5s
auto adjust screen tone setting this
option attempts to reduce power
consumption by adjusting the screens
brightness based on the on-screen image
at the same time however it can also
reduce color
accuracy and contrast ratios disabling
this feature will help unleash the
phone's full light output capabilities
while also improving color and contrast
this option can be turned off by going
to settings clicking on display and
unchecking the auto adjust screen tone
box for more information about the
different screen modes on the Galaxy s5
