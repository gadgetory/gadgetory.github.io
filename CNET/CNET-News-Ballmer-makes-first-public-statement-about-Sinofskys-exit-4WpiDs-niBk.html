that's been in the news recently is that
transitions in leadership and obviously
the most interesting question for

future of the organization look like
kind of where you're going is a strategy
changed is this what is this signal for
where you're going well real excited
about you know both the work we've done
and frankly the spectacular start that
we got off to with with windows 8 and
from a strategy perspective with all the
caveat senses were always innovating in
the next release but from a strategy
perspective we're kind of all in on what
we've done building on this notion of an
integrated experience a new user
interface it's alive and active a
product that's got the best of work and
play tablet and PC coming together touch
and keyboard we love what we've done and
we're off to a to a very very good start
we got a very good team and you know
Stephen as Muslims he wants to do in his
life and he's made one of the most
amazing contributions anybody will ever
make any company in terms of guiding a
lot of our key activities and and doing
sort of great work on our engineering
systems and so wish him well and he's
always recommended if you're going to
make a change you make it on a product
boundary and he he's living his his
principle so to speak and and certainly
we wish him wish him well our new team
is fantastic maybe a little less well
known but the lady is taking over the
product development functions been with
us 20 years his work done internet
explorer and office and windows and has
been a driver behind the vision and you
