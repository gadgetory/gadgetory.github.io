the Pam Tech perception for Verizon it
is a mid-level Android device but it's
still pumped up with some pretty good
specs it's got a 4.8 inch Super AMOLED
display it's pretty large looks really
nice it's running Android 4.0 Ice Cream
Sandwich and it does have a little bit
of pantech skinning there's an 8
megapixel camera on the back with
autofocus and flash and a 2 megapixel
front-facing camera the rear camera also
captures 1080p HD video I thought
overall the camera quality was passable
but it is not equal to the high-end
cameras that you see on the market today
similarly the phone does have 4G LTE
which usually is blazing fast on Verizon
but for some reason seems a little bit
slower on this phone inside there's a
1.5 gigahertz dual-core Qualcomm
Snapdragon s4 processor and I would say
that overall the phone's design is
really nice pantech pays attention to
detail so even if the phones don't cost
a whole lot they sure look good overall
I think this is a nice choice for
somebody who's looking for a phone in
the middle you're not gonna get that
excellent camera quality that you might
expect but things work I'm Jessica Dahl
work for CN n to Sisseton the pantech
reception for Verizon costs $99 with a
new two-year service agreement you can
