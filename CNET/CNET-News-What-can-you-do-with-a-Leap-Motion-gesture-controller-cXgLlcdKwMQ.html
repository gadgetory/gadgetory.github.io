controller those are the major
components the actual hardware itself is
fairly simple it's all off-the-shelf
components all of our IP and all of our
secret sauce so to speak is in our
algorithm in our software we track all
10 fingers it's very precise and very
lowly in scene so you can see that's
actually the raw data and the top
right-hand corner in millimeters it's a
very very fluid movement using the leave
controller in Google Earth there's a
sweet spot in the middle where if I hold
my hand the earth doesn't move and if I
move it downwards it zooms down if I go
upwards it goes up you can imagine you
know you can do all this with a keyboard
mouse but you know you wouldn't be able
to do it nearly as fluidly and as easily
as you can with this controller it's
kind of like a music finger dancing
puzzle game you know there's no other
good way to explain it than just to play
it the goal is to hit these little dots
here and you kind of have this line
that's connected by your two fingers and
you can see with this game you know how
responsive it is
based on the latest movie record Ralph
and it's you know if you ever watch the
movie they have a scene with the race
they put your hand here put your hand
here like you're holding a wheel and
then you're essentially driving you can
use Lemos controller to explore anatomy
and learn different body parts so this
is the skull right now I'm trying to
piece everything back together again and
then I can grab different pieces so this
is called block 54 essentially our block
stacking game just like a game of Jenga
you're essentially really pulling blocks
apart in 3d space but you're really
pulling off the blocks just like you
would in real life so this is kind of
like a three brick-breaking game so you
can push this forward you know it tracks
even the angle of my finger so I can
really direct where I want it to go so
this is a space exploration app that's
in our store called exoplanet and
essentially you can use the leap device
to navigate and explore the universe so
you can see it captures every little
movement as I go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
