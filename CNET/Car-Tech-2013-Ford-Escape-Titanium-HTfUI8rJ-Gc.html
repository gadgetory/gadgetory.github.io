changes like this one all together now
that's an escape yep let's drive the
2013 titanium Edition and check the tech
if Ford set out to escape the look of
the old escape they did it this is a bad
as different from the previous rolling
brick as they could have gotten this is
their kinetic design you recognize the
lines and especially the face from the
new fusion and the redesigned focus now
the first thing I notice on the inside
of the new Escape is it looks uncannily
like the outside of the new escape look
at the shape of the dash in this Lord
bolster now look at the outside kind of
the same part isn't it do they just put
a dash on the front and paint it blue
anyway here's where the real design has
to be questioned it's what's going on
with my Ford touch and Ford Sync now my
Ford touches this interface they have on
this central unit they've taken a bit of
a beating from various sources us
included about the earlier incarnations
of this let's see how they've cleaned it
up I like these much bigger transport
buttons and generally larger buttons all
around if I go to my sound settings
things get a little more dense I'm
starting to get a little nervous here
but everything's still pretty touchable
and readable if I go down here to the
information screen oh dear God it's like
reading a phone book that's not clean
enough little slow to transition between
modes you see but generally I'm pleased
with how this screen looks in terms of
its various zones I'm not so pleased
with how its implemented in this vehicle
with this this this and this you've got
four physical bumpers all around the
screen look what I got to do I got to
navigate over this plastic Ridge and
find this tiny thing at the bottom same
thing goes for hitting the nav I've got
to work around this eyebrow it's just
too tightly surrounded in this plastic
Canyon and it's kind of far away
I've got monkey arms and it's not hard
to reach this thing and of course you
may never touch this thing if you use
the voice command let's see how it's
working - 35 second Street San Francisco
California sorry please say the address
and city say each digit individually
like 1 2 3 4 - 35 second Street San
Francisco
asking what can I say well two times
earlier today I gave that same address
that's 235 and it got it I gave it here
in single digits and it didn't get it
however you get things going there's a
lot of good sources here as you can see
you've got your RCA jacks SD card two
USB slots and of course am/fm HD
satellite radio everything's in here
except a hard drive no hard drivers
solid-state drive to rip music - and I
don't miss that a bit see now here the
system is stuck on AV jacks I don't even
have anything plugged in - this is all I
think part of a central need for more
processing power or more software
streamlining on this car navigation by
the way is optioned into this car by
getting the SD card that has the
navigation on it it's not something you
have to buy necessarily until later as
you own the car go get the card stick it
in there and it graphs that
functionality on I like the way for it
does that rear camera technology is
pretty good on this vehicle you've got
trajectory
you've got distance you've got sensors
all around the car front and rear part
of a parking package and you've also got
active Park Assist this guy will park
itself and does it quite well now I
think the first self parking system I
ever demoed was in an O 7 Lexus LS and
it was a disaster I mean you had to do a
CAD cam drawing on the center screen
first and then allocate most of an hour
for the car to do its thing and it still
left the nose hanging out cut him some
slack it was early days today's system
works really well quick thorough simple
and requires about as many new
ingredients as leftovers for dinner
so here's a scenario you just came out
of Costco or somewhere bought a whole
bunch of stuff saw some jackass on the
TV screens and they get to put your
things in the back but your hands are
full you don't dare put them down
because there's a steaming pile of the
homeless guy left behind your car so
what do you do
Ford's got an answer you just wag your
foot over here and the tailgate opens
all by itself now of course this is a
two row vehicle there's no room for a
third row but when I show you the second
row you wouldn't be blamed for looking
at that flat thin backseat and saying no
it's okay I'll take the waterboarding
option but it's actually not a bad seat
in spite of its looks got some good
dense foam and some good sculpting by
the way Ford's big on the fact that
these foam pads are made of soybeans and
the carpets recycled water bottles and
the key here is you've got one hand fold
flat let's say I got the groceries again
I just pull this lever and the whole
thing goes flat with no other screwing
around now this engine is more than just
the engine of the new escape this may
become Ford's new bread-and-butter maybe
come to the future what the 302 the five
leader was in the past this is the
2-liter turbocharged direct-injection
four it's an EcoBoost motor that's what
Ford calls it when they put DI and turbo
together but then I have a patent on
that 240 horsepower 270 foot-pounds of
torque
it's a Torquay little beast because
that's how they've decided to use the
turbo charging among other things zero
to 60 happens in about 6.8 seconds on
this vehicle which weighs 3,500 pounds
your mileage is going to be 20 to 30
front wheel drive if you go all-wheel
drive you shave a few off down the 21:28
and it all goes out through one
transmission on all escapes a 6-speed
automatic that has a sport mode but
unfortunately no paddles on the wheel
one of those lame little rockers on the
left side I'm not as crazy about those
well let's go see how it works
on the road it comes together a little
better than the sum of its parts if you
will that engine may seem very small the
power is quite good
the build quality in this vehicle is
real good and in general you've got this
feeling of high style and good quality
inside this vehicle if you like the
looks you like them if you don't that
obviously won't get you very far but
most people have shown it to really
liked it inside and out
okay let's price this guy 2013 escape
titanium top trim is about 31 with
destination ad 1754 all wheel drive and
take a 2 mpg hit on your highway mileage
as well navigation the system is still
slow and bulky but it's a pretty good
bargain at 795 and the one that I really
love is that parking package sensors
camera and the self parking logic that's
like magic 4 9 95
