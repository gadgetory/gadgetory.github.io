router from Synology that's right now
before this one here technology is known
to make network attached storage servers
or NASA server so this router he
actually can also be a goodness over by
itself when hosting an extra hard drive
through is ESP through angle port in
this case it can do a lot more than
other routers that had the same feature
for example you can make it download by
itself using this download station right
here and you can shoot for things very
easily as you can see and once
downloaded it can also use the media
station to share the content with the
rest of the network
now the router can also be the host for
time machine back up a VPN server a
server for your DNS and many other
future feature too now all of that can
be controlled by this very comprehensive
interface called Synology router manager
it actually the most comprehensive
interface from where I ever seen
now it's not the fastest nor is it with
the longest range but it's not the most
expensive either basically if you want a
solid Wi-Fi network and a very
comprehensive network storage feature
this is a great bar to have in fact I
fight the best AC 1900 rudder on the
market completely worthy of is current
price of one hundred and eighty dollars
on the other hand if you'll have a NASA
over from synergy which I do the story
feature of this router here is kind of
redundant stander I have not one but two
of this bad boys here we go and that
means when I say is great it's true and
when I say I like it I mean it and when
I say I don't know I really am</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
