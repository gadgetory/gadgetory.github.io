utility I'm Bridget Carey and this is
your CNET update the debate on net
neutrality is heating up again as the
chair of the Federal Communications
Commission releases his latest proposal
to enforce net neutrality that concept
means all Internet traffic should be
delivered the same to you regardless of
what site you go to or what device you
view it on to enforce it FCC Chairman
Tom wheeler wants to regulate internet
providers like a utility that includes
both wired broadband and wireless
Internet the FCC has rules that let it
enforce customer fairness for telephone
service but it wants to extend that to
Internet traffic that means broadband
providers like Comcast Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T
cannot favor some traffic over another
their proposal bans blocking content
throttling content and paid
prioritization it means a website can't
be charged a toll to get to your home
faster get ready for the internet
providers to fight back in court the
providers cry out that more regulation
hurts innovation and some promise legal
action to prevent the FCC from getting
this authority this net neutrality issue
is going to keep playing out but in the
meantime there's some security news to
be aware of millions of Android users
may be infected with malicious apps that
pop up ads on your screen three of these
bad apps were reported by the security
firm Avast and are now we're moved from
the Google Play Store but there could
very well be others out there with
similar bad code one user posted this
video on YouTube showing what happens
when you unlock your device an app opens
an ad in a browser and a pop-up asks you
to click OK to fix a security issue and
that just sends you to download another
shady app one of these malicious apps
was a card game called Duroc it was
aimed at English language users it was
listed as being installed 5 to 10
million times since December of last
year other two apps targeted
russian-speaking users people don't know
these apps are bad right away because it
can take a month for the
pop-ups to start the app works like a
normal game so you may not realize
what's causing the pop-ups then speaking
of unstoppable ads Instagram is now
looping videos on repeat by default that
includes video advertisements it's just
like vine but Instagram videos are a
little longer and you can't pause the
video twitter is also making changes it
wants to be easier to understand for
brand new users because let's be honest
twitter is weird when you're new to it
but to save you from hunting for
accounts to follow Twitter's just going
to autofill your feed with accounts
based on who your contacts follow
