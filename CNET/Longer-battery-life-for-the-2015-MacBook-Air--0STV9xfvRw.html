not that much I'm van Ackerman and this
is the 2015 update to Apple's MacBook
Air now I say I have the 2015 MacBook
Air right here the 13 inch version but
you know it could be the 2014 or 2013
frankly it's kind of hard to tell this
is a laptop that is look the saying for
several years now the only real changes
have been internal every year gets
updated with Intel's latest processor
maybe a couple other little tweaks here
and there this time we're moving to the
Intel fifth generation Core iSeries
processors also known by the codename
Broadwell to get faster performance well
no not really is the price different now
still starts at $9.99 the only real
change here is that we get a nice
battery life boost last year's version
ran for about six and a half hours on
our video playback battery drain test
this version again the stock $9.99
macbook ran for 18 hours which is really
amazing on a much more challenging test
where we were streaming HD video over
the internet non-stop ran for more than
10 hours which is still great which
means that this is pretty much you know
an all-day laptop no matter what sort of
strenuous task load you put on it on the
downside because this thing is not
evolved very much you still have some of
the dated things that it started to
bother us about the air the screen is a
lower resolution screen 1440 by 900 not
even a full HD screen or the better than
HD retinas down screens that the other
MacBooks have and you have this big
thick and a silver bezel around the side
you have a lot of dead space here the
screen is inset from it doesn't have
that edge to edge glass over the display
if you want something that's like super
slim and super fancy of course there's
always the new 12-inch MacBook which has
that higher resolution display and that
cool edge to edge glass over it but it's
more expensive only has that one single
USBC port if you want something that's
more powerful and more of a you know
stay in the office work laptop there's
the MacBook Pro the 13-inch model is
also excellent battery life is not as
long but you do get a lot of ports and
connections and again that higher-risk
screen with the edge to edge glass but
if you want to spend less than that and
have an all-day system I think for
mainstream stuff you can still get away
with using a MacBook Air it's not going
to be the head
it once was but all-day battery life and
a low price really do count for a lot
I'm Dan Ackerman and that is the 2015
