the windows hybrid movement the latest
version of it takes a model we saw last
year and we like to lock the yoga 900
and actually makes it smaller gives it a
cool new color and some other cool
features this is the Lenovo yoga 900 s
and as you can see it's got these gold
keys against a black background they
call that champagne gold I think it's
really it's really eye-catching this is
actually thinner and lighter than the
regular 900 this is about half an inch
thick 2.2 pounds because it moves to
Intel's second generation core and
processors which are designed for very
slim very light very high-end premium
systems and of course it's got that very
unique watch band hinge like this and it
folds all the way back again like other
yoga's and then you can fold it down
into a tablet in which case the keyboard
and touchpad on the back or deactivated
they're still there but yeah but you
can't mess around with them with your
fingers and then when you're ready you
just flip it back into a regular
clamshell laptop and that's what the
yoga line is always done really well
it's given you a clamshell laptop there
was really well as that and then also is
a great part time tablet like a lot of
other modern hybrids it's got active pen
support and it's also got USB type-c
that's that new reversible smaller USB
plug we can plug the plug in either way
and you're not going to go us a wrong
way and have to flip it around again I
always like seeing that in a new machine
this guy is going to start at 1099 this
is the Lenovo yoga 900 s</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
