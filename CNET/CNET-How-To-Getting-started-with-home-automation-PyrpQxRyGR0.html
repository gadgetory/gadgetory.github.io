an intimidation factor associated with
it that's because there are so many
different products that fit under that
umbrella and even more ways to put those
products to good use in your home
add in the inherent do-it-yourself
nature of these products and a beginner
could get scared off pretty quickly but
I'm gonna show you how to strip the
smart home down to its most basic level
so you can get started with automation
quickly and hopefully simplify your life
I'm Meghan Willerton for CNET and this
is a how-to whether you realize it or
not you've probably been automating
parts of your home for a long time now
take this analog timer I got this at a
local hardware store for about five
bucks and you can use it for your indoor
lighting to set schedules when you're
way on vacation for example so while
these old-school rigs can get the job
done they're updated smart home versions
called smart plugs like this Belkin Wemo
switch right here that can strip away
some of that radial dial clunkiness and
actually add features like remote access
on your phone now the Belkin Wemo switch
is about as simple to setup as it could
possibly be
just download the Belkin Wemo app on
your Android or iOS phone or tablet then
open the app and it will ask you what
device you want to set up the first one
on there is Belkin Wemo switch slash
motion we're not going to worry about
the motion part so just click on that
from there it will tell you to plug in
your Belkin Wemo switch to go to the
settings section on your phone and find
the Wemo Wi-Fi connection once you're
connected to that go back to the app and
it will pair your new Belkin Wemo switch
the last step then is just to add in
your local Wi-Fi information so that's
basically just adding in your local
password and then your Wemo switch is
set up you can hook it up to a lamp like
you could with this analog dial or an
iron or a space heater or a fan or any
other small device in your home that you
would like to control so if you left
home already but you think you might
have forgotten to turn off your space
heater just go to the app and it will
tell you and if it's on just press the
button and turn it off it's as simple as
that now a Belkin Wemo switch will study
back 50 bucks this thing was five
dollars so it's definitely a
a bit more but for the peace of mind it
affords I think it's definitely worth it
there are products in categories ranging
from home heating and cooling to smart
security that can do what the Belkin
Wemo switch does for lamps and other
small appliances so just think about
what you want to make easier in your
home and in your life and there's
probably a really great home automation
product out there for you thanks for
watching this smart home how to be sure
