for the 359 podcast episode 300 now and
I'm BVG and full house today your hosts
include then Fox Ruben Roger King and
Scotty stop we got something special for
you today yep combination we haven't
decided whether we're gonna say iPhone
10 or iPhone activex all the way x-phone
X I'm saying tankers I've heard a lot of
TV appearances it's gonna get weird if I
say X all right worried but you can call
whatever everyone's gonna call it X yeah
we're gonna we're gonna focus entirely
on the iPhone 10 today as you would
expect and send in whatever questions
and comments you want let us know if you
already pre-ordered the phone or you
plan to stand in line
Brian we'll get to as many as you can at
the end of the show let's get to the
podcast and then we'll get to the
questions afterwards let's do those
leaves
stand by everybody we're gonna record
the audio podcast way back to take your
questions and comments in the chat i'm
from 315 and 3 minutes and 59 seconds
from 3 - welcome to the 359 I'm Ben Fox
Ruben I'm Roger Tsien and with us today
is ace mobile reviewer Scott Stein much
more asleep than last time
well how much sleep have you got either
way we've got something special for you
today Scott has the iPhone 10 or iPhone
X whatever you want to call it he's been
messing around with it for more than 24
hours now and it's got face ID it's got
a new screen new design it's got the
knotch got all sorts of different things
but the bottom line I just you spent
some time with it I know it's it's been
like about two days now - a half day or
two days
bottom line should we buy this thing if
you like this size and your early
adopter person you got the money yes but
not everybody's gonna need to get this
thing and I think that you know it's
definitely position is like not
necessarily the phone for everyone
that's what I think I think it's would
be great if it wasn't a thousand dollars
you know that's a lot of money you have
to basically pay up up above the eight
plus and I think the extra features
there are nice I want to see them in the
other phone line the rest of the phone
line but you know you your your your
spending into a different realm though
you do the math and really that's and
that's why we decide to my wife decide
to get an iPhone X or 10 yes the
difference between 256 iPhone 8 plus and
the iPhone X 256 gigs or $200 right yeah
you're spending that much money didn't
you guys good - what's up let's not talk
about that if you're a frequent phone
person I don't mind getting the latest
and greatest which is true with like TVs
and a lot of other things you don't need
to get this one but if you've been
waiting a while and you want to get the
best iPhone get this one yeah this is
the one I mean this is the one that's
gonna have all the bells and whistles
and so if our face ad is working yes I
mean let's get into that you actually
did a very kind of felt like a unique
test of face ID you went in and shaved
your beard which is commitment to your
job there but you shaved in different
ways you had he had a little props and
everything like how did face ID handle
all those different wrinkles yeah I was
just curious I really was thinking is it
gonna work all the time obviously
there's there's mundane reality of like
you know when XIV yeah the shower or
what happens if you shave you get a
haircut what if I take off my glasses
and use it for some reason or the
darkness but then I just went to the
ridiculous cuz it was Halloween and also
because I'm just curious what happened
so generally it worked it worked with my
face I worked with all the things I did
to my face but every time I added
something more ridiculous it did have
failures mm-hmm now face ID supposed to
adapt and learn within reason if your
face or what you're wearing changes we
need to check that adaptability and see
maybe even has more use cases yeah I
know you covered half your fate of scarf
that's when it didn't work
yeah it's not gonna work scarf an habit
it's supposed to work with scarf so it
might be that again in some instances
but yeah when I work goggles it didn't
work when I were gold crazy glasses are
work my sunglasses it worked so what
about the screen the OLED screen is also
a big change for the iPhone 10
is this a big selling point for you have
you really enjoyed using it I really
like the getting to the edges of the
screen and I like how how good it looks
I do think that already Apple's displays
have looked really good I mean I think
the difference between you know their
their regular displays and an OLED
display I think a really minor for the
casual user but I do think this is like
even crisper the black levels are really
great but it's like I think if you put
them side-by-side in in a normal room
other than filling the edges of the
screen and that snapples Testament I
think they've already made really great
displays so I just like it for the size
to display ratio alright lastly we can
only get to one last point but the
knotch controversial does it bother you
um sometimes if I expand a movie to fill
up but everyday stuff actually it
doesn't really factor in there's two
ways to look at it's like is the notch
cut out part of the screen or are those
two bonus bits above but what I mean is
that almost all apps default to below
kind of like the essential phone from
what I saw so that means you're actually
getting a little bit smaller display
than a technically a 5.8 so for most
things that's what it feels like it's
still larger than an eight or seven by
the notch comes in if you only if you
expand movies that the default is it
doesn't fill that space okay that's fine
yes like don't expect if you're really
hoping that would fill the entire thing
like just put your finger there and go
that's really that's really the space on
the iPhone 10 display it's nice I'm sure
apps will figure out ways to use it but
also this bottom bit usually is not used
by apps it's used for a navigation bar
so this little narrow strip over here
tends to not be part of the picture well
either way Scott unfortunately we're out
of time but thank you so much for coming
on yeah if you want to read more about
our coverage about the iPhone 10 check
us out on seen it I'm Ben Fox Ruben I'm
Roger cane
I'm Scott Stein a lot more to come
thanks for listening
all right thanks everybody for sitting
through the podcast I'm gonna go ahead
and delve into the chat pull out some
great comments and questions from all
you lovely listeners until then Scott
you want to continue in the conversation
with Ben or yeah definitely and also we
are doing an ongoing QA piece for for
CNET which I'm doing answering questions
from Twitter and posting on a jet Scott
we've answered a handful there we're
answering a lot more anyone who's done
it has it got an answer if I faved you
that means that I bookmarked the answer
I want to be able to answer in the story
this morning so don't be too upset but I
can also answer questions now but this
was one element that we didn't get to in
the podcast because obviously it's four
minutes but and you mentioned in your
video the gestures we're different
because you got rid of the home button
yeah for anybody that's paying attention
Scott and Roger I think like two years
ago wrote a feature piece about the home
button would eventually get taken away
and lo and behold they were although we
did we did float the idea that there
would be a touch ID sensor underneath
but yes we I think we both sort of stuff
correctly that did not happen
yet like who knows I feel like companies
there are companies exploring that idea
I still feel like that is an interesting
idea I don't no idea whether I ever show
up on an iPhone but we were hoping for
that this year and the fact that it
didn't happen from any of the major
flagships was disappointing yeah yeah it
definitely shows there it's a lot more
complicated than we realized I may be
having issues with speed was a soos that
actually did show off the phone that's
not rain until next year but said it'll
be the first next I mean no one's gonna
buy here in the US but it is technically
feasible but I think especially doing it
at the scale that Apple would require
would be really complicated I think
that's why Sam's book Samsung and Apple
kind of with them it seems like they
punted on it but yeah going back to
those gestures the home button was such
a regular feature on the iPhone up until
now
the iPhone 10 was are you still getting
used to those different features or
those different gestures yeah it
definitely takes getting used to I would
say it's it's a little weird especially
even if you're walking around you know
you're on the go
using one hand were you doing they like
the quick check stuff with the home
button it's a different feeling and so
swiping up is the new home button and
that's the part where I go oh wait a
second I don't know how I feel about
this I know I rather like tap or do
something cool yeah uh day two it's
interesting I kind of got used to the
swipe from the bottom in the sense that
you're kind of flicking away apps so to
me it's it's like if you're using an app
and it's like yeah it was a really a
long learning like it didn't take that
long for you to adapt to the new
gestures it did take a little while to
add a guy especially something like
control center so there oh yeah thanks
control center I really don't like the
placement it's at the top right corner
and you have to swipe down only on the
top right corner because if you swipe
down anywhere else you get notifications
that's like an easter egg
and to me I love control center that is
yeah thank goodness that's there I like
the new shortcuts it was so easy to
swipe on it dude that's the phone is
pretty long like you'd actually kind of
have to really make an effort to reach
up therefore the control center right
well and here's the crazy thing unless
you're in an app now if you swipe up on
the phone nothing happens nothing
happens
it's unused unless you swipe from the
bottom edge and then you get reach
ability I'm getting confused you're
getting confuse it's okay sure if you
want to take a screenshot it's at the
side button in the top if you want to
turn off the phone it's now the side
button and the bottom button there's
there's a lot of people so much muscle
memory related to these gestures that
right yeah people that are gonna
transition over to this phone it is it
does seem like it's gonna be a bit of a
learning curve but not impossible
we can't muscle memory transition from
using buttons we can handle oh yeah we
all we can we got used to yeah we we had
we have to get away from actual tactile
buttons so we are totally fine getting
used to it and I work in all sorts of
weird tech obviously we were learning
new things and you know adapting virtual
reality AR whatever else but here's the
thing
iPhone if this had been a clean change
if you had said like from here
and this is the new phone we're never
going back and everybody's got to learn
it right it's very Apple thing then
you're like okay we're all learning it
but interesting thing that's happening
now is that the iPhone 10 still has the
8th and the applause which I'm a very
damn language and you have the iPad
which now with 11 is also a different
language that has a slightly different
thing for multitasking everything else
so they're slightly different languages
going yeah I can imagine
I can imagine some confusion getting
used to using your iPhone in one way and
then going back your iPad and like
swiping a tribe like oh wait that's how
you do it right this is the swipe does
that and I understand that there's a
language that might fit this phone but
I'm just I would like the languages to
be roughly the same this part in the
podcast that I would like to remind
people that the actual name of the
podcast is first world problems
yeah problems a too busy leading edge so
hard having expensive game has a home
button the other one doesn't
I try to look out for someone who hasn't
had this and I'm on the cautious side I
always hangers it's that that was
another phone and somebody knows what is
it gonna feel great and if I'm not
feeling it's absolutely great all the
time that I would go I don't know but
most people I know again first world
problems on people have the money a lot
of people seem to just be buying this
and they're like it's fine it's the one
it will just get used to it get used to
it probably over worrying it has that
element of exclusivity because of the
thousand dollar price tag yes Roger
continually mentions nobody's gonna buy
the thousand dollar one yeah but most
people won't buy the thousand dollar one
they'll buy the even more expensive one
well I guess some people are because the
wait times are for the 64 gig are
actually extended you know sorry let's
kind of question I might write a story
called the case for the boring phone
which is like why when you want to get
the one that's not sorry but Brian let's
get to our questions yeah go figure we
have a veritable bleep ton of them thank
you there's some fantastic questions in
here and a lot of em are details that
get fleshed out a little bit better when
you read the review but for now since
you're here with us will bug Scott about
them and maybe get a more personal or
more
yeah less objective kind of response to
these questions
let's just Kevin asks how is the battery
life yeah so far but you know it's very
early days what were you running like
let's put in perspective as far as you
know intensive we haven't done our
intensive video test right so this is
very early days we're gonna come up with
all those details and results soon but
right now I've been using it not as my
main phone I've been using it alongside
so it also changes things but even then
like let's say this morning I wake up at
7 I've been using the phone I mean at
work it was at about 68% at 10:30 a.m.
so that's not great but although on my
commute on your Jersey Transit which has
bad cell connection signs it affects
things it's constantly pinging pinging
it's pretty standard for me in the way I
listen to music that my battery on on
iphone 8 plus and others is about 7 it's
always been about 6 percent that's maybe
the better question is not how the
battery test is working is how does it
compare with an 8 plus cousin longer
really hard to tell now I would say it
does not feel longer it feels maybe a
little bit shorter it feels maybe
equivalent or a tiny bit better than an
8 or 7 you know one thing I definitely
think is gonna factor in and we're gonna
try to figure this out is how much
you're using that that true depth other
things that they scan again and any
things that use it like an emoji I've
noticed when I use that stuff a lot for
demos right now the phone gets warm like
pretty warm now a lot of the apps are
not heavy usage for that they're meant
to use it for short periods of time an
emoji is 10 seconds but Apple has even
it's been suggested that you know that
is obviously going to cause some battery
life so it may also mean that not a lot
of apps are gonna heavily use that for
games and stuff right more questions is
what I would say jazz productions now
James Martin did a fantastic camera
review of the iPhone X so far but let's
go ahead and touch on how it directly
compares with the eight Scott I know you
took some pretty cool photos yourself
when you're out running about yeah so
your little adventure exactly my little
fun adventures with my hat so adventures
in Scotland
so the good news for someone who just
wants like a good camera the core
camera-like ISP and basically taking a
photo just in everyday use are pretty
similar across the eight eight plus and
ten everything is about like bells and
whistles after that because they plus
you add the the dual camera you've also
got portrait mode for the for the rear
what you gain in the ten is also optical
image stabilization on the telephoto and
the telephoto does that make a
difference though so far it's hard to
tell but I'd say at least the telephoto
seems to be taking pictures that are
about as good as the wide-angle which is
nice because in the past when you zoom
in to X to take a photo you kind of feel
like you're losing a little something
yeah in darkness or totally um so far I
actually like the I'm trying to take
pictures just in telephoto like going
out trick-or-treating and things like
that
and also the selfies the zombies it's
significantly improved
okay so selfie mode now adds portrait
mode and that's great portrait mode
looks great it's an additional mode
nishan of the regular things you get
that depth of field effect I tried that
with like going on TV and having others
try it it if favored is generally one
person although you get really close
together you'd share focus but it but it
that's something to know portrait
lighting is there too I've not liked
that so far for my face at least on
selfie it has a lot of fringe and like
it doesn't look like yeah it does look
really crappy for my face but for but
for other people it might be better
James who's a much better photographer
took great photos with that one think
you have to really set it up I found
that the from the front there the rear
one with portrait mode can sometimes
take fantastic photos other times not
but I think it's a I think it's a better
experience right now on the rear then on
the front unfortunately it doesn't mean
means I'm not gonna be taking my my
stage lighting red shot I don't know how
I'm gonna be taking selfie but am I get
a real ego try that's a real first world
yeah do you know what my face is the
nonstop it's ridiculous because it is
all about your face with this phone mmm
right everything's at the face camera
they should have called it the face
phone face phone expert on steel that
get X phone face huh we've taken some
more yeah how we doing on time today
we'll keep going we got a lot of
questions we do have questions where
what's lightning round yeah we try to
keep these snappy at this point Mohammed
Ahmed says how thick is that X compared
to the 8
it's thicker um it doesn't bother me
though because I I kind of feel like
bones got a little too thin yeah there's
a nice heft to it is it fuel solid in
your hand
I'm curious man oh it feels solid it
feels nice it feels kind of dense it is
expensive
yeah better hold it up right over here
let's get it we go we got oh there goes
up there if you want to compare it to
the I got the plus here sorry for the
clicky snappy bunch of tilted down you
know birds
yeah oh yeah you're right in here not a
time some gratuitous iPhone it's gone
[Laughter]
these are all meant to be the same
durable glass as the 88 plus and all of
those we did a drop test for the A+ on
CNN so you can it did ok at 5 feet it
shattered oh
all right well after a couple of times
please don't do big case on on your
thousand-dollar phone oh yeah yeah also
it it's all glass and it's kind of
slippery slide pocket it's gonna slide
right out and then that's it okay
questions more questions all right this
is something I've seen coming up in a
lot of chats and discussions and reviews
of face ID I don't think we've seen it
properly represented how was the face ID
functioning in the dark Scott we had
another video I thought a little bit
touched on the dark but I think people
really want to see well I think it's
warm I think I shot that but I don't if
we included it that might be important
because it's the one recurring thing I
keep seeing as totally works it totally
works fine cuz they just laugh already
completely right right it doesn't
usually there's light other cameras now
the one thing we still need to test more
and the thing that people are reporting
problems with is bright sunlight
and that might be the trick and I was
thinking all along I wanted to do like
Astro be disco thing we're still gonna
work on doing that oh yeah they'll be
interesting yeah I'll set you up like
studio dance party let's see I will be
there
disco face ID party but I think bright
light if you're if you're like stayin
the Sun right you know behind you or
you're in like a brightly lit world
we'll have to test yeah infrared is a
big part of this and and that does give
infrared problem with other technologies
that use stuff like that like some VR
tracking so more to come so on the flip
side of that razor 2048 I want you to
test it how it works in direct sunlight
where the IR per dot projector will
possibly not function to see if like a
curved photo can work on unlocking in
direct sunlight so on the flip side
let's see if you're gonna wait like
showing a curved photo to the phone yeah
possibly so if we're gonna take this
sucker into a blinking dance party
pitch-black let's go right out into like
the scorching Sun too and see what well
kind of wrong time of year for that I
can you do with the ton of studio lights
give you a tan standing and standing in
front of spotlights and can you unlock
your star yeah can you can you unlock it
in a tanning bed I think we can pull
that off we will test light well it's
not gonna work the cucumber eyes right
it could oh that's tension so one thing
is that did no one asked this but I'm
gonna tell you it requires your
attention to be looking at the phone to
unlock however that can be deactivated
in the settings kind like what's a
couple of other phones that do that type
of like Samsung it something like that
where you have a get attention type
thing you can deactivate that which
means that it won't require your eyes to
be looking at it or you wouldn't even
need eyes there so that question
accessibility or quality yeah I mean
people it's an accessibility I mean yeah
if your I mean if you're blind if it's a
situation where you just need to have a
face I'm walking and you don't know or
maybe your eyes yeah maybe your eyes
aren't able to focus like that or maybe
you're just wearing sunglasses that
don't work or you're in a situation
where you don't want to deal with that
gotcha
yeah let's get a few more in here
Michael Brown or buddy Michael Brown
Michael Brown got let's talk about how
you have to hold up the iPhone x2 get it
to activate you need to have that right
up like eye level or can you just kind
of like wink at it or something do it
now
good question do it now so I again we're
gonna do more detailed stuff on this I
would say it up a bit so if I do this it
worked and that's casually off the table
looks about three inches off the table
so we do this let's see first I didn't
even turn on wait that was already off
but make sure you flip over for a min I
did that's not working out no let's try
it again
it worked there we go right there is a
pretty casual an incline about so so
yeah it's fairly perpendicular to your
face but not I level and then terribly
close either you're about two feet a
foot and a half away from your face is
it yeah
arm's length easy let's see uh it worked
right there so you don't like we're
doing it no no sorry we don't we have
enough we don't cameras in here to show
that properly but will vouch for it if
you're like quick draw mcgraw and you're
like basically like ooh you want to pull
the phone out of your pocket it just
jiggled just told me no yeah that's good
they don't even try if you want to bring
your phone out of your pocket
touch ID and you're like I'm already
making it work like out of my pocket you
can't do that
so I think that would be another great
idea for a video is to actually do a
quick-draw test quick-draw we're gonna
try that say touch ID is gonna do
six-shooter holster yeah exactly touch
ID you got faster in other years and but
you know to like reach into your pocket
put your finger all the touch ID sensor
before you even have pulled out yes I'm
gonna do that how do we know they're not
just like clicking that in their pocket
and they bring it
I need to really make sure the
thermistor we can observe that yeah all
right really clicking we got it we're
gonna try it we got enough time for for
a couple more it's got any experience
with the speaker so far Daniel wants to
know how's the bass bass seems fine no
the speaker's so I think there's they're
similar to eight eight plus yeah all the
speaker quality has been improved
these phones you definitely notice it
with the eight and eight plus and it
seems pretty similar on the ten it
doesn't get any better with the
increased price right you do not get an
extra base with the ten but they all
actually sound noticeably better I'm not
a huge speaker right but some people do
and there's a lot of reasons basically
they sound good enough that if you're
like you want to play some music where
you're washing dishes yeah you're in
you're in heaven sure well it's fine so
we're kind of heaven that you're just
[Laughter]
playing the music when you're blank when
you're vacuuming that says I don't think
that would work yeah occasionally though
I will like listen a radio or like do
something or play music or watch a show
and I'm too lazy to put in headphones
alright not on a train like at home if
I'd like if I'm like hanging out like is
it night
yeah I'm downstairs kids are upstairs
are down like able to watch a Netflix
and I go yeah I don't even put on the TV
for some reason why am I like that not
the same way actually very strange yeah
all right so uh Lord Zen rack hello
lords
how is landscape mode in Safari could
you actually bring that up for us and
point it at the camera again Scott yeah
I may just like that different right
it's just it doesn't use it not that's
exactly a lot like the Samsung GSA in
the note 8 the screen is longer right
because it's so here it takes away all
the edges one thing to notice is that
once again the notch doesn't factor in
it actually okay your browsing
experience is piller boxed pillarboxing
to not include know if I really like the
pillar box thing further oh okay all
right it's just not you can't like tap
to zoom you have pleased point you got
appointed at the cameras guy I have
please alert over here over here over
here
- here we go up a little higher you can
see it's the notch but it's avoiding the
knotch so I would say here's a here's an
important No
related to that how does it feel
compared to the Plus nobody's asked but
I think the plus in a lot of ways still
feels like it is a larger screen
experience yeah wider right it's partly
well it's super wide like yeah the Plus
comparatively yeah has a giant like now
that I picked this up again I'm like oh
wow this like well that's this is an
issue that I had with the the GS 8 you
know they talked about this whole edge
to edge screen the screen got longer and
taller but it was narrower and so it
didn't feel as long yeah so I mean it's
overall bigger screen you can fit more
but it's not that much more when you
play a movie depending on the movie or
just imagine it's got like the black
boxes everywhere right like it's well
double yeah like pillar and letterbox
yeah yeah fits that so the speed ratio
is almost 2 to 1 which is not how
Holden's got right so when I played
movies I played Steven Spielberg's AI
which fit the dimensions you play like a
video moving on Noah can you show make
it quick will try to else we talk to
lawyers no no show us you know here I'm
working on it sure Scott pressure that's
game on meantime in the meantime just
with this one should be easy for you
sweeping that you don't expect five
point eight equals oh it's a bigger
screen than the Plus yeah that's not
very good point while you're bringing
that up Scott how was using Apple pay
how did that feel using face ideas to
the touch ID give you it so your your
personal reflections did your like have
my money it's weird it's weird I need to
do a lot more Apple pay I actually like
so my Craig is a good personal story my
credit card got like frozen because I
was doing so much Apple pay testing
across I know I was doing shots from the
vending machine
and canceling them and then I tried to
get an uber home and they was like this
is the making of the video you know
prominent like they were like now you
can't use your credit card and I was
like there's something wrong with the
frauds apartment they were like like
five any machine canceled
I was hungry I was me okay well that's a
weird thing and they like did you set
this up on like six devices recently
than that last month and I was like yeah
they're like so again that's like a
fraud department but that's why we're
getting us we're flagging you because
you should seem like unusual activity
again firstworldproblems I was like I am
it I'm a tester and they were like okay
you can use the cardigan it's actually
pretty like this pretty laid back so
anyway we almost don't point being I
don't know the I didn't answer the
question Apple pay is weird sorry
everybody were ill-prepared for the show
- as expected for this bias is so
prepared now this is fun and everybody
thank you so much for all the great
questions of comments and jeff answer
your questions and I'll cue it as we
talking I don't want to like don't wait
for me to qlq okay so let's talk
finishing my thought from earlier thank
you everybody for contributing it's been
a blast I know we're being goofy now but
thanks seriously this is all great
critical thinking Scott we fodder for
Scott to go on down the road
real quick Scott while you're finishing
those keyboard size and functioning
keyboard in landscape mode thoughts
reflections wait I'm actually doing
these up I'm doing it so I'm doing these
actually sync up you really don't know
now I'm like obsessed with this now
we're boy you want this we're gonna do
it we're just gonna do wow oh there we
go was worth the wait
look at that so now you'll see it's
getting looks better too bad it's
getting compressed down the YouTube
algorithm so it's not it's super
represented but take my word for it that
is quality quality the screen brightness
screen brightness is is different from a
little bit hey go so yeah the OLED looks
really nice but you can see there are
black bars there that kind of crop out
notice a size difference if you're
looking for pure
Green size a plus is still baby plus now
this is what happens if i zoom in hardly
a good eye but I second that if I
there's a notch here we got not a
dreaded nut do you want to watch a video
with not ch
I prefer not CH oh my god there's an eye
that's two video
how long until Apple fills the notch
with ads if you take a screenshot with
the notch the notch disappears
interesting medicos story we're watching
an iPhone X video on an iPhone as I talk
to you about ten you mean this is iPhone
10 so there I'm calling it so that's
that's information on what the screen
size is like so now you know it's better
than the seven or eight but it's
actually I think it's much like when I
first reviewed my first iPhone or have
you ever seen it was the 5mm way back
the five was a slightly bigger display
that's kind of how the ten feels to me
where it's like oh it's nice murder back
then the five was a big deal because
you're like oh a game or screen yeah
yeah that's how it is but don't expect
like a quantum leap where you're like
this is the most screen I've ever had in
my life so it's gonna be like that it's
gonna feel like a nice upgrade let's get
back to that previous question about
keyboard yeah knock that out real quick
we are literally down to like the last
couple minutes we can afford here yeah
keyboard actually put something on
Twitter which was a screencap of using
the keyboard Rose typing so if you want
to see that go my Twitter feed you'll
see 30 second screen captive like that
secured layered Scott at jet sky it
feels about the same size and width as
the eight but there's a lot of wasted
space people are commenting about how
the keyboard is leaving out space below
the keyboard that's true there's a gap
where there's just two buttons there's
there's an emoji and a dictation button
and then just like a lot of empty space
now I didn't it finger wise though it
seemed to fit where my thumb's would fit
so I didn't mind that I think it was
like an ergonomic placement but I just
think there's a lot of wasted space or
you could have put more space above the
keyboard to view things that you're
writing or just figure it out a
different keyboard layout maybe again
there was only so much that want to be
done but it's a little weird when I
first started using it I didn't think
about it but then I suddenly look down
and I went oh there is space there like
I
kind of weird but it's again the
continuation of a horrible it's fine
yeah it's fine
it's just not like don't it goes back to
like is the eighth gonna optimize all of
your interaction dreams in ways you've
never imagined no like the keyboard is a
keyboard you know it's not like there's
not a brand new like you know I have
experience looking for a phone that
would optimize all my dreams and ways
your dreams be optimizing also the other
thing is we're looking at this
pre-release for the not that one but a
lot of other apps have not been
optimized yet so I'm noticing non
optimized apps default to being boxed
into about an iPhone 8 or 7 shape mm-hmm
Kent Kindle app like basically like oh
there's no more extra screen apps will
get updated but like all things like
going back to the plus I remember for
months and months and months there were
apps that weren't updated to close now
then all that happened was that games
were fine but then think tech seem big
problem at the 8 is the ratio is
different so you're losing you're
missing out on X do you mean 8 or 10
thank you the 10 the ratio is different
it's tough when they release them
back-to-back like that all right all
right we have left the lightning round
we are in the quantum round Scott real
quick if there is one thing you could
change about this Arkansas one thing you
could change about the iPhone X
excluding the notch what would you
change I still would like to have a
backup fingerprint sensor right now even
though I know Apple would never do it I
just like the idea of it as a comfort
thing
great question and finally Matthew - are
the - on the Chad Scott you shaved your
beard for this you get lots of props for
for committing how far is Scott Stein
willing to go for his art Wow
great last question my shaving
experiments are done you're not gonna
shave your head for this no more shaving
any other part of me yeah that's the
thing is you know I I'm not too extreme
so like I you know I I'm not gonna jump
out of a plane and probably not gonna
like horseback ride in the ocean I mean
I'm not gonna I'm probably never going
to inject and embed I'm never gonna have
like a
like an open medical procedure to like
you know like already more PlayStation
tomorrow or Katy Collins has a chip
embedded in her hand yes if I feel that
that I think it's amazing deep-sea
diving water test I know a family of
doctors I kind of feel like I don't that
actually makes me not to do that I kind
of like it's like anything be good on
path where I'm like yeah I don't know
it's okay I've never gotten LASIK for
that reason because I'm still terrified
of something like Total Recall like
procedure we're like you know disinfect
your brain right just yours all right
just I will I will
there are some medical there are some
wearables that stimulate parts of your
nervous system and like on your brain
and I actually have one test unit that I
haven't tried that yet I might try but
we sent a terrifying something messing
with your head
probably something you're not gonna want
to engage in wearables and mobile is to
be a human experiment there you go all
right we are officially over time this
has been a fantastic show sorry why
every yeah we tried but you guys are
fantastic and we'll try to cover more in
the next you so much everybody for all
the questions thanks to Scott for
shaving his beard yeah I think I'm gonna
grow back honestly bring it back bring
it back I'm just wow beards are better
