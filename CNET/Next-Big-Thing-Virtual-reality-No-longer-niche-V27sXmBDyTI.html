reality head gear has become absolutely
reality rift Morpheus and glyph they
sound like three brothers from a fantasy
novel but it's a fantasy come true not
just watching being there that's the
essence of virtual reality it brings me
into this world that I've never been in
you can actually see your hands holding
an Xbox controller that's kind of got
war they want to create a world that
feels real that sounds real I was able
to interact with a night with swords
with a crossbow it's essentially two
independent displays and they render
different angles on the game so you get
a 3d effect with a wide-angle field of
view what you get is that sense of
immersion which is what the VR is going
it's using texas instruments based dlp
technology to project right on my retina
I wish everybody at home was able to see
what I saw was extremely promising a
popular fascination with the basic idea
of virtual reality goes all the way back
to the late 80s on Star Trek The Next
Generation number Geordi LaForge had the
vision headgear then flash forward to
the mid 90s and something called verbal
virtual reality markup language that was
going to make web pages of 360 immersive
experience still waiting for that but
today the dream definitely lives take a
look at oculus rift fair to say it's the
darling of the bunch right now it
creates this 360 immersive media world
based on panning video as you move so
the concept here is that you don't have
screens literally all around your head
but the video is passed around through
your immediate vision and your periphery
by sensing the motion of your head and
body that's using right now a camera
that is external and led emitters on the
head gear to index with it in the future
we can expect all of that to be built
into the head gear itself and it will
continue to get smaller now Sony's
project Morpheus looks similar but it's
a little different in its connectivity
it cables into a ps4 obviously it's a
sony thing and there of course it graphs
into existing motion control and
tracking technology that that platform
already brings in as well as the base of
developers
who were already tied into that motion
and tracking so it's got a leg up in a
sense now clearly the initial use cases
for both of these would come to mind as
serious gamers but if you really want to
find the hot spot for these I think you
have to look at what our dryly referred
to as vertical markets it all before she
kills again for example look what the
Norwegian army is doing with oculus rift
and cameras mounted around tanks a way
for tankers to get a completely
unobstructed view from outside their
vehicle while remaining protected inside
of a livid against air n would do
moisture Emma daddy call this court
collude or imagine virtual reality head
gear for an online meeting and finally
for the first time feeling like you are
there as opposed to the very clumsy
technologies we use today that are not
so much present as barely present think
about going to a hotel without going
there take a look at a room in real
detail before you book look at open
houses and masks before you decide which
few you want to actually drive to go to
a car dealership and actually get inside
a car and look around the cabin before
going down to take that test drive and I
need not even mention the possibilities
with telemedicine and it's called a
virtual retinal display finally there is
avegant glyph what they do here is more
about attacking the media world giving
you a full immersive screen for media in
front of your eyes but it's not one
where you look around and move through
it more it tracks with your vision this
is about going after the world that has
already been in love with imax theatres
big curved TVs and Beats Audio kind of
mash those three together it's one that
has a lot more immediate acceptance
compared to the other two that are still
trying to build and educate the consumer
market now all these products are in
about the same phase of their
development they're heading off to where
new technologies go to live or die and
that is the hands of developers who now
must take the ball and run with it over
the next year or so to create compelling
understandable use cases to bring these
to as many consumers attention as
possible
