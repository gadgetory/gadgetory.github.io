surround sound as well until vizio came
around we would have told you you were
crazy but in the past few years vizio is
true surround bars have captured a
previously uncared for part of the
market the vizio SB 40:51 co is the
company's newest system and it's
undoubtedly its most attractive the
black and real aluminum color scheme
evokes a much more expensive system and
certainly doesn't look like it costs
only 350 bucks while is no real display
apart from volume on the unit itself the
remote control offers a menu system for
making changes to settings and it works
quite well this is a 40 inch sound bar
which comes with a small wireless
subwoofer and tidy surround speakers the
surround is connected the subwoofer
which means you will probably need to
put the sub next to the couch the sound
bar offers a wide number of connections
including do HDMI ports optical digital
and Bluetooth with optic support if
you're watching movies the vizio
supports both dolby and DTS the video
offers a much clearer sound than its
previous sound bars with excellent
dialogue clarity perfect for movies but
one thing the company hasn't got right
is that the subwoofer is still too loud
even with the sub volume all the way
down but with most content this will
only be a minor nuisance if they can fix
the subwoofer problem in a future
firmware update the Vizio SB 40:51 will
be a worthy successor to its previous
models but as it stands this is still a
very good option for surround sound
enthusiasts this is ty Pendlebury for
