the airwaves imprints of man's
never-ending path of progress
silhouetted against the ageless canvas
of the sky the era of television there's
the CBS
we are well into the 21st century at
this point and the growth medium is
mobile in fact some recent numbers
crunched by emarketer showed that mobile
data growth has gone up Sevenfold TV
remained basically flat print and radio
seeing pronounced declines we need more
space for the one that's growing so the
FCC has announced something called a
broadcast incentive auction the
incentive is cash being dangled in front
of TV stations who will let go of their
airwaves put those into a lottery and
then allow the FCC to repack the usage
of the airwaves making more room for
wireless data the focus here is on UHF
broadcast stations that are on the air
and sort of the mid to upper UHF
channels it's the so-called 600
megahertz band where they operate that
is so tasty because that kind of airway
tends to reach a long way get through
obstacles work its way around buildings
do all that very well companies like
Sprint and t-mobile tend to have a
paucity of this kind of spectrum they're
in higher frequencies there are no more
brittle if you will in their propagation
AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon on the other hand have
a fairly good amount of lower frequency
spectrum that behaves well like this 600
megahertz stuff the problem is if you
dissuade them from buying more of it you
then lower the amount of money coming
into this auction which the Commission
needs to incentive e stations to give it
up in the first place regardless of how
this auction is massaged wireless
carriers need more spectrum to move data
over the air a recent
PricewaterhouseCoopers study estimates
it from 2013-2018 wireless data usage is
going to go up 61 percent now a lot of
that demand will be carried by putting
new towers or additional bandwidth
through towers the kind that you see in
your neighborhood and that you hear have
all kinds of real estate and neighbor
objections to their installation there's
also a push out there to use UHF channel
37 that particular slice to create a new
area for Wi-Fi hotspots which may not
sound related but it is because carriers
are pushing hard now to move more of
your smartphone traffic onto Wi-Fi
hotspots that automatically recognize
you as a customer as you move around and
put less of a load on towers now as you
can imagine this is a complicated and
contentious process dealing with some
public airwave assets that have been in
place for a long time
moving them is always a little touchy
right now the nab the broadcasters
association has a lawsuit filed to block
the FCC's plan until that takes hold we
have an auction set for mid-2015 in
light of all this interesting study from
gfk research indicates a multi-year
trend of Americans moving gradually but
noticeably more toward airwave TV
reception now a lot of these homes have
always been rural homes that's all they
ever had take them out what apparently
accounts for the trend line up our cord
cutters people who are saying wait a
minute I want that broadcast airwaves
signal for local news and sports and
then I'm going to augment everything
else coming off internet streaming and
cut out the pay TV in the middle bottom
line local TV stations have basically
five options they lay out like this stay
on the air in their current channel but
the FCC might move that channel to
defrag the airwaves after this auction
move off of UHF which is the choice pot
for this data and down to a VHF channel
leave its current channel and share one
with another station leave broadcast and
go to cable satellite or online only or
take the cash and leave the airwaves
keeping your station alive only on other
platforms this auction is historic the
first time that broadcasters have been
allowed to sell their allocated public
spectrum for a profit because it is that
important to reform it right now and
allocate it to mobile data carriers it's
an indication that mobile data is
central to our lives not peripheral</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
