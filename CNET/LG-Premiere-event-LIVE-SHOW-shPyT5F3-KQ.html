in the morning on the west coast
welcome to seeing alive i am brian tong
miss lexi say hi to everybody and steven
beach i'm running the show as usual good
morning we just wanted to kind of reach
out to you let you know off the top of
the show we're having some technical
difficulties over in new york at the
lincoln center right now so we're
working through that but while we wait
we're gonna actually show you pretty
much exactly what you're gonna see at
the keynote because LG last night
released the official product videos for
what we expect to see so we're gonna
start off with a rumored v10 phone i'm
gonna show you what they showed us just
you guys can kind of get a sense of
pretty much what you will see later
today once we get the keynote
sorry that was the LG v10 the smartphone
that LG is going to be launching they
actually released it technically last
night so that was the video that's
available now on YouTube but also on the
agenda today we are going to see a
SmartWatch there is going to be the LG
watch urbane second edition it's an
upgrade to the original LG watch urbane
let's take a look at the video and see
what's in store for the SmartWatch hey
babe yeah I didn't want to bother
I need my hands-free all day
Yeah right
all right everybody there you go that is
the look at the LG watch urbane
second-generation and just one thing to
note that is a the first Android wear
based watch that it will be a completely
independent you know doesn't need a
phone it'll be based on your direct LTE
connection with it that's innovative in
that regards but we know that remain is
pretty big and chunky yeah it's not the
first SmartWatch that has LT cuz LG g2
version and it was not running Android
where it was running their own the riot
Rio s that everyone thought was webOS
but actually turned out to be kind of
their own tweak on it so it's not the
first but it's the first Android wear I
don't know LTE in the SmartWatch I am
NOT hundred percent sold but that's your
thing that's your thing exactly yeah I
mean if you if you want to pay for it
then I I mean I think there are people
over there that want that maybe you know
if this is the only one right now you
know everyone has their own different
taste of which watch they want so ladies
and gentlemen we are still working
through the difficulties technically out
over New York we will keep you posted
with what's happening out there we will
have all of our coverage on SEANET comm
but just hang out and we'll let you know
what happens with that the keynote is
expected to start around 8 o'clock and
Pacific time but at the moment we are
working our best to get that all out for
you but stick around and we will see you
guys in a little bit ok hey we actually
we just got word from LG that they're
having a connection issue in New York
and they're gonna actually gonna push
the start time back a few so stick with
us and hopefully picture soon but they
are working on it and it is a net
Ethernet connection issue so so we can
have a little graphic so stay tuned
thanks Angie cool all right cool guys
we'll see you guys in a little bit
hopefully fingers crossed I will see you
soon
ladies and gentlemen boys and girls
miracles do happen we have picture from
the NYC what we have is you know we've
had this rig set up to stream their
keynote here it looks like from what we
can see the keynote hasn't started yet
is that correct
all right they're waiting on us okay
well we're just confirming things we are
the exclusive carrier of this event so
quite honestly LG and us working
together they're gonna wait on our end
just to get the green you know the green
light that okay we're good to go that is
what it looks like inside they have not
started yet so we'll just kind of keep
it on there right now
but obviously the LG v10 is just hanging
out on their monitor it's their new
phone we showed you kind of the video of
it earlier what did you think about it
you know obviously they have some
features that are trying to make it a
more unique phone that top screen quick
access to applications but more
interestingly for me is the so-called -
sorry when you know there were a few
like you know indications that we were
gonna see two forward-facing cameras on
this new phone and it turns out that
they're not for 3d purposes they are for
taste taking really wide selfies there's
like an 80 degree camera with a field of
view of 80 degrees and then a 120 degree
field of view so you can take really
expansive Groovy's
are they just stitching the pictures
together wider angle so the two fields
of view like make it a wider picture I
mean they're trying I got I think it's
war on the selfie stick you know I know
I'm declaring war on the selfie stick
I don't even but here's the thing the
whole word groovy actually doesn't make
sense it doesn't because it should be
groupie
it shouldn't be groovy there's no
there's no I don't hang out with a group
of friends take a picture of myself but
I don't take a picture myself Wow selfie
roofie I didn't roofie
it's got it it's got a ring to it you
never know you never know maybe 2015
2016 is gonna be the year of the groovy
it could be so um we'll just yeah we'll
just go down some of the specs of what
we expect to see in this phone it's
bringing a Snapdragon 808 processor so a
capable one it's not the most current
most modern Snapdragon processor out
there 5.7 inch quad HD IPS display 2560
by 1440 resolution that's a 513 pixel
per inch density there's a secondary
display that is that little top right a
little ticker display that they call 2.1
inches it's 160 by 1040 resolution that
also is a 513 resolution pixel per inch
four gigs of ddr3 RAM inside this bad
boy looks like us and then what else we
have 16 megapixel camera with an F 1.18
aperture Frye front-facing camera will
be 5 megapixels through thousand
milliampere our battery it will be
running android 5.1.1 lollipop so ok
looks like we're starting what's gonna
go kick right to it
now here's the happy back what you can
happy about the amazing new bellboy is
the belt system dancer today for twenty
one who must be available at all times
the set is still working one can I pick
up the pictures of Thursday the stairs
there can you make a note of that and I
write it down there what's going for
well then let's say Tuesday I mean two
days earlier no five days later I
thought as much
oh yeah when you hang up on it
now it's shorter
you know what I'll make sure you have
the best table in Spain so it's not just
a pretty face then there's million
Americans it's everything you need so we
do you I'm sick of this and quiet at the
clients at this point I'm not sure how
we do business
check out the swing the sources can be
anybody anywhere
security I'm telling you it's like I
can't trust nobody
did you with the resources I've had my
side
ladies and gentlemen please welcome LG
director communications and account
marketing mr. Frank Lee well hello and
welcome to the premiere of the LG v10
we're here at the beautiful Walter E
theater the home of the New York Film
Festival and it's all about movies it's
about moving pictures it's about video
we talked to you a while back about the
visual generation at the LG g4 day and
that has continued to evolve we've seen
more and more movement from photos to
videos we also see a greater demand from
people like yourselves for higher
quality and our customers people want
more and we're here to give them more
more innovation for a better life a
great first example is the innovation of
the LG G watch urbane second edition LTE
you just saw a preview for that it's the
first wearable device featuring cellular
connectivity in an Android wear platform
with the option to connect through 4G 3G
Wi-Fi and Bluetooth it works seamlessly
with your Android smartphone or on its
own when carrying a smartphone is just
not practical or convenient of course
the cellular enable features will vary
from Android and also for iOS but the
whole idea is that it's a continuation
of LG's vision of creating an awesome
SmartWatch while capturing the essence
of a timepiece it's the perfect balance
of style connectivity and convenience
but I promise today that the preview
isn't the best part of the show so with
that in mind let's get to the thing that
you're all here for our main feature so
please turn your phones and your cameras
on
ladies and gentlemen here's the star of
our premiere the new LG v10 the LG v10
is designed to provide a rich multimedia
experience both in terms of consumption
but also creation perfect for today's
social network savvy customer the new D
Series by LG is designed to ignite
creativity and passion it's designed for
everyone from the influencer who's
already making and sharing but also to
inspire those everyday people so they
can find how they can create content for
themselves through the G Series LG has
been acknowledged for its excellent
quality and the user experience of our
premium smartphones the v10 is a signal
towards a new engaging experience we are
headed in a direction where innovation
isn't being driven by just technical
advances but also because of social and
cultural change as we see people shift
from photos to videos we want to support
support them in their needs and also
increase their capabilities just think
how much video you are using now to
share you used to just upload
photographs and now you're streaming
you're uploading 610 15-second videos
it's the new form for that reason LG
paid special attention to video
functions for the first smartphone in
our v series amongst other things the LG
v10 offers users the ultimate video
capture editing sharing capabilities but
before we go into that any further I
want us to look at what is made up of
the LG v10 in terms of its construction
we talked about innovation we don't just
mean what's on the inside we also put a
lot of energy and time against making
sure that the innovations include things
that like not worrying about dropping
your phone I mean we drop our phones and
it not good it's never a good feeling
for that reason the LG v10 is covered
with protective materials from both
sides with both duraguard and also
stainless steel in fact the v10 is
tested and met the requirements of the
military standard transit drop test what
that means is that the LG v10 survived
drop tests made up of 26 different
angles from four feet and onto surfaces
made of plywood and concrete analogy we
make choices ones that sometimes may
require a little more effort on our part
just to make sure we're delivering a
product that you can be excited about
and that you could see the practical
benefits it's important to know that we
make these choices some of which come at
a cost to us buts because these are
things that you've desired and you
shared them with us and you've told us
about these
for example the material costs of
stainless steel is almost double that of
aluminum however we use stainless steel
with the v10 because we know that gives
it the durability that we're all looking
for a practical benefit and a worthwhile
investment on our part keeping that in
mind the v10 also features the popular
microSD card slot now of course that's
extended to 2 terabytes but more
importantly it's compatible with the
recently announced 200 gigabyte SanDisk
SD card so now v10 owners can enjoy all
the media they want without having to be
worried about the capacity and so they
can store high-volume files also the LG
v10 comes again with its popular
removable battery 3,000 milliamps so
having the ability to swap out the
battery remains to be an important
commitment by LG even in the fact that
we could make it thinner but not the
cost of getting rid of that battery now
coming back to video let's talk about
steady record which uses an electronic
image stabilization optimized to
neutralize shake and to help capture a
video even when you're on the move also
the innovative manual camera mode that
we all saw in the LG g4 has now been
enhanced to
manual video mode people now can edit
and adjust while recording video so now
you can easily create high quality
content with more advanced recording
options such as ISO shutter speed the
white balance and even focus as you film
there is a quick video editor which
allows users to easily cut or change the
speed of frames and add after effects
such as colors and even background music
its built in right into the phone and
it's actually more dynamic than more the
options in an app we also have snap
video mode which enables you to capture
and combine a series of video clips that
you can easily share with others we take
away the intimidation of currying and
narrative with video so you can create a
one-minute video by assembling a dozen
three-second Clips there's also a 15
second Auto edit which makes a 15-second
highlight video of any video you've
created it does this by using an
algorithm that measures movement and
look at sections where there's no no
activity or blurriness so all this is
happening so that it's easy for you to
quickly edit and share and once you have
captured and edited your video you do
need to share it and so for that purpose
we now have quick share one of the most
noteworthy features of the v10 so as
soon as you're done with your clip you
can click on the icon and you'll be able
to select from your social media
networks and post your videos directly
and although videos are awesome some of
us still love the selfie so for those
people we have two front-facing cameras
the LG v10 features five megapixel dual
front cameras with two separate lenses
so one at eighty degrees for your
standard shot and another and 120
degrees for that wide-angle shot so you
can say goodbye to that awkward selfie
stick we also introduced an amazing new
multi View mode which basically takes
advantage of all the cameras so you get
three perspectives sequentially
when you're taking photographs but when
you're taking videos all the footage is
captured at the same time so you get all
the action and reactions from all the
angles so in addition to the main 5.7
inch quad HD IPS quantum display we have
a new feature called the second screen
it's the first of its kind and it's an
inset display so it works independently
of the second screen the second screen
works independently and can be set up as
an always-on display to enhance the v10s
productiveness but another practical
benefit is that you have quick access to
all your notifications and information
without having to turn on the main
display so you're extending the life of
the battery by using second display
what's more the second screen turns off
when you slide it into your pocket or
bag that way you're again saving battery
so along with video recording options
you can directly monitor the audio
inputs as you're recording such as the
audio level for example and in any
setting you know busy street or live
concert this audio monitoring feature
enables you to adjust the sensitivity of
three independent mics built into the LG
v10 we've also have a wind noise filter
for those situations when you're outside
the LG v10 includes the best in sound as
well it's powered by a 32 bit high five
DAC digital analog converter from ESS
technology the LG v10 not only makes
your music sound amazing
it even up samples many formats
including live streams and your of
course your mp3s to HiFi it also
features a new finger print sensor to
unlock the device and allow access to
your mobile payments the popular LG
knock code is still there and so you
have the choice of those two options the
LG v10 is about to launch in Korea on
October 8 and will thereafter be
available across global markets in China
here in the US Latin America or the
Middle East
Asia here in the US were proud to
announce that we'll be carrying the
product with our partners at AT&amp;amp;T
Verizon and t-mobile available in space
black luxe white and Opel blue so the
fact of the matter remains is that we
actually have put the v10 into use and
is being used to develop content as you
know LG announced that it partnered with
actor writer and director Joseph
gordon-levitt and his Emmy award-winning
production company hit record
to create creative content the
innovative collaboration builds upon our
commitment to celebrate and support
artists and everyday people over the
span of this coming year for us Joe is
not the celebrity spokesperson
he's an established artist and together
we're tapping into the hit record
community the creative individuals to
deliver on our promise that through
purposeful innovation we can help tell
better stories and LG were committed to
helping people from artists and everyday
people democratizing the ability for the
world to share and make content this is
how Joe and hit record community work
and so it was a natural partnership with
LG so Joe and hit record have called
upon the community and their filmmakers
artists writers musicians to develop the
first project I love our partnership
it's a collaboration called the
in-between moments so let's turn our
attention back to the screen because Joe
has some words to share with us you
recording hey everybody I hope you're
having a great morning I wish I could
have been there with you but I did have
a chance recently to sit down with LG's
very own mr. Frank Lee and we had a
great conversation about hit record and
algae this partnerships been really
really great for us and really fruitful
and check it out thanks again
what's up Frank so this is in Karla when
you think about it there are so many
different facets of who we are that come
to life throughout the day and hitRECord
embraces that creates a space for others
to find ways to express and discover for
themselves yeah their voice or their
stories that they want to tell that's
just it you know this community sort of
sprouted up around this website that my
brother and I started and hitRECord kind
of offers an avenue to be creative for
the fun of it I think what's exciting
about what you do with hitRECord is that
it's very organic and it's it's really
sharing I find storytelling you know it
is impact of sharing storytelling is
something that's that's a universal and
in all humans I think it's part of what
makes us human and technology has always
been a part of it now in our generation
it's a super exciting time to be alive
you know the internet is changing
storytelling forever it's our time to
really figure out okay what can we do
now that's different than what we used
to do we have this new tool we have this
new capability but we're still using it
the way we did mostly just imitating the
old way of doing it
smartphones currently that's where the
Internet has been free no longer
tethered to a physical space not your
home at the office library how has that
changed the way people tell stories well
you know the old saying goes the best
camera is the one you have on you when I
was fifteen I had a camera that was Jim
film and he was beautiful it took
beautiful shots and I'm still a lover of
celluloid but it's a big thing kind of
complicated to use
it was prohibitive it meant that you
weren't gonna probably have the camera
on you when you saw that spontaneous
beautiful thing you're like oh my God
look at that I wish I had a camera well
so now we actually probably can get out
our phone and take a picture of it
before it goes away
what's led you to pursue this project
with LG I love coming back to hitRECord
I love working with people that aren't
in Hollywood that don't have an agent
that you know don't live anywhere that
I've ever visited but they come with
that first perspective and it keeps sort
of refreshing me and invigorating me and
having a website that is a hub for
hundreds of thousands of people to
contribute their you know media of all
different kinds and stuff you know you
can't do that for free it costs money to
have this office and to you know have
the bandwidth of our website etc and so
it's really really cool to have a brand
like LG you know support us and not
support us by like twisting us into
doing something that we don't want to do
but he's able to come on and be like all
right there's that in-between moments
concept that's been you know circulating
around the community already and you
want to take that further cool we
believe in you and we believe in that
and we'll support it
it really makes what we do possible and
then you share it about these in-between
moments you centered on that can you
keep your library on that what that is
for you sure you know nowadays so many
of those in-between moments you know if
you're in between this and that
appointment on your calendar and
normally you reach for your phone to
sort of consume some little morsel of
distraction or entertainment or
something but I guess we're asking the
question what if you reach through your
phone and rather than just wanting to
consume you were gonna kind of look
around yourself appreciate what is going
on in this in-between moment and could
you capture that we provide the hardware
and in one regard so what has your
experience been with the the v10 what
sort of jumped out at you well the first
thing of course is I have to talk about
the frame rate difference between film
and video a big part of it is the frame
rate and I remember we you and I were
having this conversation you were saying
if you could wish for anything for the
camera on the LG v10 what might you wish
for and I said oh oh oh make it shooting
24p please
it'll look like a movie and then and you
guys shipped us the phone and we looked
at and you could actually shoot in 24
feet so we've been talking about the v10
and obviously you and the community have
been working on the project are we gonna
have an opportunity to get a preview oh
yeah man yeah well we've been shooting
with it and you should see there's a lot
of beautiful footage coming in
so as you can see from the in-between
moments at the end of that video and
also the product features we just shared
with you it's all shot on the LG v10
it's a powerful yet easy device to use
with the LG v10 and the new V Series by
LG we've delivered a new standard when
it comes to top two your smartphones so
we now want you to have that experience
so as you make your way to the
exposition zone in the gallery across
the hall we want you to see how the new
LG v10 is another reminder of how life's
good thank you and have a great day is
that it
that might be a wrap on the announcement
they're over in New York City so there
you go just like a sneak peek at the LG
v10 I mean the little ticker display
really cool and then we know even with
the LG g4 camera head pretty much the
the most options features in a camera on
a cell phone they've kind of really
trying to take that to heart and expand
that on the v10 as well but there you go
just showing off the specs right now
micro sd obviously it's the trend of a
lot of Android phones coming out have
sort of been going just for internal
storage only rather than expandable
sorry and a removable battery too I mean
pretty much most of the most of the
flagship phones now the Nexus the
Samsung s6 and adds they're they're
going away from those two features that
made Android phones kind of give them
some of their identity and differentiate
them so the v10 is still trying to stay
true to that aspect of the phone
but what we're gonna do here now is
pretty much wrap things up we know we'll
have a hands-on analysis of everything
over at cnet.com we just wanted to bring
you the keynote for you guys to watch
and enjoy next time monday 6:45 a.m.
Pacific time are you gonna be here I
don't know I'll be awake you know I'll
be I'll be watching regardless whether
I'm here on oh I'm sure you'll be
watching he'll be like
Steve and I will be here in the house
but that is what we hear actually
am i running the show by myself yeah I
guess so
alright ladies and gentlemen thanks for
hanging out with us at seeing it again
you can watch all our future coverage
coming here with them about the LG v10
and also the LG urbane watch second
generation that they also leaked out but
they didn't talk about it's an official
product out there now in the interwebs
so you guys can check all the coverage
out for that as well but until next time
we'll see you guys seen alive Monday
6:45 a.m. Pacific time Microsoft will be
here see ya</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
