now it doesn't come along so often that
will see a gaming laptop that attempts
to redesign or redefine what's going on
in the world of gaming laptops but razor
has attempted to do just that with a
laptop that you've probably heard about
the razor blade we talked about this for
about a year now it is coming out at a
price that's not cheap at all is twenty
eight hundred dollars what do you get
for that well this laptop is under an
inch thick it's all about 6.4 pounds and
has a big 17.3 inch screen and it is
oriented towards gamers the graphics or
maybe a tad less robust than you get on
some laptops like a Liam where's or you
know pumped up to the Gil origin laptops
this is nvidia GT 555 graphics inside
and it's got a core i7 processor 8
gigabytes of ram and a 256 gigabyte SSD
that is built in one configuration
that's available on razor site now
there's no optical drive on this laptop
is a solid-state no optical drive
machine and the idea is that you're
going to be connecting in the cloud with
your steam and your origin downloading
that way which a lot of gamers already
do the new hardware that this brings to
the table is the Switchblade UI and if
you remember back a couple of CES ago we
showed this concept device called the
switchblade the razor had made that was
almost a gaming netbook had a
touchscreen that also worked as the
touchpad with a whole bunch of
customizable buttons well that survived
here and it's off to the right-hand side
replacing where the number pad would be
theoretically what you can do with this
is you can show anything on that second
screen and use it as a touchpad plus
there are 10 buttons up here that have
customizable graphics that pop up on
them that can be used for anything from
launching applications to being used for
recording macros and all sorts of other
functions and not just those 10 but with
a three-finger swipe across the screen
you can bring up many sets of 10 so if
you're playing some sort of in-depth
game with a lot of different
transactions well you can nerd out your
heart's content with recordable macros
and all that stuff now certain games
maybe about 10 to 15 of them razor says
we're going to be specifically does
signed with a certain number of buttons
in mind and graphic assets that razor is
going to supply however you can
customize your own looks for buttons and
put in your own graphic assets so that's
nice that you can do that as far as the
screen goes well right now you can pull
up some apps that allow you to play
youtube videos or check facebook or use
gmail but other than sort of a glorified
web browser on a second screen there
really are any games yet to take
advantage of that which is a shame
because you could easily see how that
could be used especially for any sort of
micro transaction system or any game
that has a lot of strategy functions
it's going to be a bit of a disconnect
however if you're planning on using a
trackpad and you're used to where it is
I kept reaching for this phantom
trackpad over here and not finding it
it's over on this side it's
ergonomically fine to use it over here
once you get used to it but it just
threw me off a little bit plus when it
comes to ports there are a bunch of
ports on the left-hand side none on the
right side so if you want to plug in a
mouse or something like that you got to
funnel it over here on the left side to
deal with that twenty-eight hundred
dollars is not chump change and that's a
lot to invest in a concept type of
device which in a lot of ways this is
and is a real gaming laptop but you are
sort of having this sacrifice a little
bit for graphic robustness for in terms
of a a slimness of design 6.4 pounds
which is and the lighter end of gaming
laptops but it's still not light
compared to a regular laptop this
switchblade you I syncs up with synapse
which is razors cloud syncing service
for saving all of your customizable
macro settings now the idea is that you
could save your settings and then plug
in they have one of these you is in a
gaming keyboard or plug in one of their
other peripherals and be able to sync
across devices I'm Scott steinem that's
a first look at the razor blade gaming
