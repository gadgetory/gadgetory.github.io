and a splash of line of galaxy phones
and with the samsung galaxy s3 it nailed
it I'm Jessica doll court for cnet
taking you on a tour of the samsung
galaxy s3 winner of the cnet editors
choice awards this phone which comes in
this pretty public color ceramic white
and later in red for AT&amp;amp;T exclusively is
large smooth very thin and packed with
hardware and software goodies for the
most part the Android 4.0 Ice Cream
Sandwich phone hits all the marks of
smartphone excellence from the large
screen to the fast processor to the 8
megapixel camera not to mention the LTE
support and really reasonable price tag
the gs3 is big phone but the dimensions
make it feel comfortable to hold well
most of the time I dig Samsung's phones
for feeling overly plasticky in this
case I think it really works the
material feels like it's been painted on
with a thick glossy coating so that it's
really smooth to the touch but it isn't
slippery and that's good the phones got
these more rounded edges here and that
helped it fit comfortably into my hand
when I hold it the galaxy s3 screen is a
four point eight inch Super AMOLED
display with an HD resolution it's 1280
by 720 pixels it looks crisp and
colorful and bright and it makes an
excellent platform for viewing videos
photos and web text however even at
maximum brightness the screen still
looks a little darker and dimmer than
other phones at their maximum brightness
the US version of the galaxy s3 gets to
keep this hardware home button on the
bottom which I personally like but not
everybody does and that's in addition to
the two touch sensitive navigation
buttons on either side of the home
button so this is Samsung's second phone
to feature Android Ice Cream Sandwich
and I think it's a really great
experience the TouchWiz interface isn't
as intrusive as it is on other Samsung
phones and it does add the thick layer
of extra features that I think really
helped take Android to the next level
there's the quick access to system
shortcuts for example and a ton of new
sharing features like s beam s being by
the way is hands-down my favorite of the
same
add ons it takes Google's Android Beam
sharing feature one step further by
including the ability to share photos
videos and other documents in addition
to beaming URLs contact information and
maps that all came with Android Beam
Android Beam by the way works with all
android phones with NFC but the extra
file sharing on the galaxy s3 is only
going to work with other gs3 phones for
now now if you're jealous of all your
friends who have iphone 4 s's we're
talking to siri samsung has a solution
they call it s voice and s voice uses
some of the same background technology
as Siri to do things like find web
answers calendar appointments call
people and play music can also open apps
turn on and off basic settings like
Bluetooth and navigate you somewhere it
works really well in theory but in real
life I ran into multiple problems with
it understanding me and doing my bidding
hi galaxy set alarm for 7am tomorrow I'm
not sure what you mean by for 7am
tomorrow Samsung has a lot of fine
tuning to do with this one and s voice
is unfortunately the phone's biggest
failure in my opinion I don't know about
you but I wind up taking the majority of
my photos with my smartphone camera so
you'll be glad to know that the 8
megapixel camera with 1080p HD video
recording is more than up to the task
there really is zero shutter lag on this
phone the photos appear almost the
instant you press the shutter button the
photos themselves looked really good
when I took them on just the plain old
vanilla auto settings they were in focus
they were bright they were colorful both
when viewed on the phone screen and off
on another screen like a computer
video was also smooth and in focus and
the phone did really well outdoors as
well as indoors you can also record by
the way from the front-facing camera
samsung has added a face tagging feature
which will also remember an auto tag
faces for future photos then it goes a
step further if you choose either share
shot or buddy photo share modes both of
these will send photos that you shoot
two friends who are also gs3 owners and
that will save you having to email
photos or even share them one at a time
through s beam there's also a burst mode
feature that isn't new to android phones
but it is new to samsung handsets it'll
take a super quick succession of
pictures and if you enable best shot it
will even choose the photo it thinks is
best out of a series of eight shots the
gs3 supports 4G LTE and HSPA+ 21
networks I was able to do things like
quickly load graphically heavy webpages
and download HD photos nice and fast i
also got consistently high speeds on the
speedtest.net diagnostic app but of
course there were some pockets and
sometimes speeds weren't quite as high
internal speeds were also impressive on
the dual-core Qualcomm Snapdragon s4
processor games and videos looked smooth
and immersive and there wasn't any delay
navigating between apps now if you like
what you've seen so far then the galaxy
s3 could be your next phone luckily for
you it comes to five different US
carriers most carriers are going to
offer both the 16 gigabyte and 32
gigabyte versions with the 16 gigabyte
selling for just two hundred dollars but
you should check out my handy dandy
chart to see your options believe it or
not I've only scratched the surface of
all the features hidden within the
galaxy s3 so make sure that you read my
full review on cnet com for all the
details I'm Jessica doll court for cnet
with the samsung galaxy s3
