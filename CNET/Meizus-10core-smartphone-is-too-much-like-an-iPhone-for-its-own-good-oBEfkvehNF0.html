iPhone clone out of China it's a
smartphone with a 5.2 inch screen that
looks like the middle child of an iPhone
6s and 6s plus beyond the copycat design
you'll find a phone with some
respectable hardware especially for its
price tag of around $400 a decade core
mediatek processor gives the pro 6
considerable power the phone performs
comparably to even the higher-end
Samsung Galaxy a7 on some benchmarks
which is pretty impressive it has a
1080p screen a decent camera and some
premium touches like a fingerprint
scanner and a USB C port
it also has 3d press which is like
Apple's 3d touch but it only works on
apps native to fly me me Zeus very iOS
esque version of Android meze was chosen
to match Apple's hardware so closely
that it's also ditched the back and task
manager buttons typical of Android
phones instead you can swipe left on the
home slash fingerprint sensor to go
backwards while browsing there's no
international retail version so you'll
get a phone made for the Chinese market
and a lot of its built-in apps like T
mall and Weibo aren't particularly
useful outside of China and even with
the language is set to English its
native apps will still push
notifications in Chinese so you're going
to have to do some tinkering to get
their phones user experience in good
order the pro 6 especially is impressive
but in trying to be an iphone and loses
the functionality that sets Android
apart check out the full review on
