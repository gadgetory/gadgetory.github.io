no wires necessary that's a thing that's
happening in 2018
the Lenovo Mirage solo daydream VR
headset is coming later this year at a
price somewhere around $400 or less and
it has a snapdragon 835 processor inside
you don't have to put a phone in and in
that partnership with Google it allows
not just daydream VR which is available
on a number of other Android phones but
you can also do a little bit of movement
to thanks to to stereoscopic cameras in
the front that allow agree of freedom
tracking that's kind of like where you
get in your top-end VR headsets that are
connected to pcs the motion range is a
little more limited though you can duck
and move we were not really meant to
walk around the controller is the same
one that comes with other daydream
headsets currently we tried a few
experiences including a Blade Runner
experience that allowed me to click
around walk up to virtual noodle stands
and duck in and look at details I wasn't
able to walk but I was able to click
duck and lean and that's kind of the way
you're going to move with this headset
that's different than oculus go a
200-dollar headset coming this year that
also won't have a phone but will not
have that leaning motion element added
now it's unclear how many apps daydream
has that are going to work with that
extra movement and leaning function and
that's the thing to keep an eye on here
but as a standalone headset that doesn't
need a phone that definitely seems where
mobile VR is heading for those people
that may not want to pay up for a phone
that can do it
Lenovo is also making a separate story
Scapa camera the Lenovo Mirage camera in
partnership with Google that is meant to
shoot 180 degree 4k 30 frames per second
video that's also 3d and that stuff can
not only playback on a daydream VR
headset or upload to YouTube you could
also just send it to a phone and use it
to record moments it's not 360 and it
doesn't have a viewfinder but the camera
is meant to be very easily used and
record anything that you're pointing at
because that field of view will cover
anything that's in front of the camera
that's gonna cost around $300 that's
where VR is headed with Lenovo and with
Google and we're at CES in Las Vegas
