I'm standing in front of the infinite
voc lien made qq5 Plus compared to other
robot vacuums in the field the Infini
vote could be considered a budget vacuum
with a price point of 349 dollars on
those websites so you can find a cheaper
on Amazon I had high hopes for this
machine because a lot of the robot
vacuums are in a price point that's far
beyond what most consumers are looking
for when they're shopping for a vacuum
cleaner at over $500 many of them are
just out of that price range that is
reasonable for the average consumer the
info new vote at three hundred and forty
nine dollars seemed to be a really good
answer to that but unfortunately it
seems in this case that you get what you
pay for like many of the other robot
vacuums we tested the infini though
features a wall dock and a remote
control and it's fully programmable you
can program it to turn on at different
times on different days of the week the
one glitch about this as opposed to the
others is that you have to go fully
through the programming sequence for all
seven days before the robot will
recognize that it has been programmed so
it takes more time and is a little bit
more finicky than the other robots that
we attempted to program the remote is
small easily understood and nests in a
caddy in the top of the machine which is
a nice feature because you'll always
know where it is one of the things we
didn't like about this vacuum is
compared to other robot vacuums is that
many of the others ran on a sensor which
means that they will clean the room and
sense when they have been everywhere in
the case of the neato or when the debris
is gone which is the case with the
Roomba
this however runs on a timer and if you
the user do not program it differently
it will run automatically on an 80
minute timer which is a long time for a
robot that you can run in one room one
of the other things we didn't like about
this vacuum initially is that it is
programmed to not collide anything on
its default settings and that you have
to as the user interfere and reprogram
it with the use of the remote into
what's called soft collide mode where it
will run into things but if you don't do
that if you don't enter
the user it won't get within eight
inches of any of the things in your room
so if you're using it in the living room
for example it will stay in the open
areas but not really go up against your
furniture or your baseboards in all of
our tests the Infini veau underperformed
significantly all of the other robot
vacuums in the series we tested it
picking up rice pet hair and a stand and
sawdust mixture with the case of our pet
hair tests all of the pet hair that
looked as if it had been picked up by
the robot vacuum was in fact jammed
underneath the roller wheels and under
the front guide wheel of the machine
which took about ten minutes to clean
out every single time in our tests
involving rice the Infini bows scattered
it creating more work again as with the
pet hair I think it's important to note
that these machines are generally
intended to make your life easier within
your home and its maintenance and I can
honestly say that this created more work
than it's saved for me in all of our
tests across the board we also didn't
like the dust bin at all it's used
poorly designs as soon as you pull it
out of the machine most of the contents
are forced forward out of slits in the
front of the bin so it doesn't hang on
to anything that it picks up either
which again creates more work unlike
many of the other machines we looked at
the Infini bow bows the UV light which
in theory would kill dust mites and
bacteria in your carpet one of the
things we were interested in testing
with all of these robot vacuums was how
they behaved with their sensors towards
a Ledge for example if you're using it
on the top floor of your home and don't
want it to go down the stairs the infra
nuba fails the cliff test pretty
miserably but did as well as we would
have hoped any of the machines would
have performed on the stairs it sensed
the stairs and didn't go over the ledge
so the results were rather inconclusive
on how its sensors work I think it
depends on the landscape of your house
after running numerous tests on this
machine I can't in good conscience
recommend this to you when the neato for
$100 more outperformed it significantly
in all areas for cnet.com I'm Katy
