car that comes out about $150,000 less
than when it was last on the market
that's a pretty good haircut that's
what's going on right here do you recall
the my box from Mercedes they were out
from around 2003 to 2012 they were duds
they sold like hotcakes to someone who
has gluten intolerance now they've
brought it back as the mercedes maybach
a line extension of mercedes not a
separate brand and this one's called the
s 600 when I come back in another life I
want to be a Chinese billionaire that's
what this car is really aimed at the
burgeoning market particularly in China
where signs of wealth are not just
having a beautiful car but also a car
that you don't drive you ride in the
back of and this is a serious place to
ride in the back these not just picnic
tables jagz been doing those for years
these are like right out of first class
on an Airbus or a Boeing jetliner and of
course you've got a cooler behind me
here a refrigerator eight inches of
extra car length leads to a ton of
additional legroom and then that sound
like a lot but just measure it out in
front of your shins it changes
everything of course lots of real
materials we've got the quilted leather
going on all four seats in this vehicle
have hot stone massage so even your man
in the front gets a pretty good ride and
of course these seats are reclining and
articulating have these little bespoke
pillows and attached headrest you wish
you had furniture that's nice at home it
arrives in this country about April or
so of 2015 so it's a little too early on
pricing or some of the real nitty-gritty
details but you're not gonna miss them
when it pulls up next to you at a
stoplight
