hybrids in four categories mild full or
strong plug-in and performance first
what's a hybrid it's a car with two
power plants that could be any two kinds
of power plants but in modern parlance
it means a combustion engine and an
electric motor these two power plants
can either work in parallel both helping
move the car at the same time or in
series handing off back and forth to
each other
another key trait is regeneration not
growing a new leg but charging the
battery when you brake or coast
the electric motor then flips modes and
turns into a generator as the cars
momentum turns it and of course hybrids
have a large motive battery separate
from the auxilary battery that you see
in your current car or toss on the side
of the road let's look at the parts that
make up a hybrid powertrain now you
start with a combustion engine and a
fuel supply just like any other car and
by the way it's almost always a gas
engine there are diesel hybrids out
there they're exceedingly rare there's a
motor generator that's that motor that
sometimes works as a generator typically
wedged in between the gas engine and the
transmission working one way it's a
motor being worked by the car it becomes
a generator to put juice back in the
battery a motive battery usually nickel
metal hydride but increasingly
lithium-ion and these are big batteries
much bigger than the one you get
jump-started not unlike a very large
version what's in your laptop or your
smart phone an extra cooling system that
battery has got to be maintained at a
critical temperature and it can't share
the cooling system for the engine
because this runs way hotter than the
battery would be happy at a battery
wants things substantially cooler
then you get to the inverter and the
converter the inverter changes DC to AC
battery store DC the motor wants AC the
converter changes voltage stepping up or
down depending who is asking for what
within the hybrid system you've got an
ECU that's an electronic control unit
that makes all this stuff work together
and finally if you've got a plug-in
hybrid there's an onboard charger which
is not just the cable that goes to the
wall but it's circuitry inside the car
that pulses that juice to the battery
the way it wants it now I think you can
see why they charge a few grand more for
a hybrid now the four ways all this tech
hits the road mild hybrids a mild hybrid
basically uses an electric motor to help
the combustion engine but never take
over moving the car by itself it may be
mild but it's a useful architecture
because combustion engines are really
lousy at generating a lot more power
when you need it right now quite from a
stop or when you're passing electric
motors are really good at giving an
instantaneous push at exactly those
times so they jump in to help the
combustion engine mild hybrids usually
have more modest electric motors and
motive batteries so they tend to have
less of a hybrid premium cost examples
of mild hybrids include the GM assist
system which you'll find on the Chevy
Cruze eco for example so simple it works
basically like an alternator helping the
engine through a flexible belt and the
Honda Insight also made headlines as
being one of the first really affordable
dedicated hybrid models after the Prius
which brings us to full or strong
hybrids strong hybrids have the option
to run on electric only for meaningful
distances and speeds let's say up to a
handful of miles at city speeds these
kinds of hybrids have larger batteries
and motors and typically more
sophisticated power blending system
where the engine and the electric motor
power meet and when you talk about full
hybrids you're talking about the sweet
spot of the market that of course brings
you to the Prius now available in three
variants it's a family unto itself and
it pretty much out sells all other
hybrids combined but also cars like the
Ford Fusion and other
Stream models that now offer highly
efficient hybrid variants that are
getting some market traction so what's a
plug-in hybrid a plug-in as the name
suggests can be plugged in that allows
it to use a larger battery pack than
even a strong hybrid larger than
regeneration alone could ever sustain so
plugins are sort of stronger hybrids
offering up to tens of miles of electric
range and up to highway speeds you may
not use gas at all for your commute if
you just plug in daily now when it comes
to plug-in hybrids the best known and
the best-selling is the Chevy Volt which
by the way is also a range extender kind
of a corollary or an adjunct to hybrids
you want to learn about that go see all
about it in episode 4 seen on cars
another well-known but very new plug-in
hybrid is the Ford c-max Energi that is
the plug-in version of a car that's also
available as a non plug-in hybrid now
what about performance hybrids hybrids
aren't all for tree-hugging some are for
curve hugging unlike gas engines
electric motors deliver all of their
torque from one rpm instead of having to
rev up to peak power and torque is what
makes accelerating fun so by biasing a
hybrid power system toward that aim you
can get tremendous acceleration as well
as decent mpg
for example when the Lexus GS Hybrid
came out it actually had worse Highway
mpg than the conventional v6 yet it was
as fast as the v8
and when it comes to performance hybrids
this gets into a matter of some
interpretation but I definitely think of
the Lexus GS Hybrid as one that was
among the first to say electric is fast
not just efficient and also Porsches 918
this car is going to have nearly 900
horsepower but they won't all come from
its v8 almost 300 will come from its
electric motors now as you know almost
every hybrid model has its own MSRP
typically a few grand or more than a
comparable combustion model if you want
to run your own calculation on how long
it'll take to earn back the so called
hybrid penalty we've got some calculator
