formula again I'm Bridget Carey and this
is your cnet update facebook is updating
the new speed to make sure you don't
miss what your friends post even if the
status updates are old Facebook
engineers call it story bumping so if
you're scrolling through your feed but
you don't get all the way to the bottom
Facebook can tell and the updates and
stories you missed will be bumped up to
the top the next time you log in sitting
there along with fresh new posts
facebook found that with these changes
people spent more time on the site there
were more comments and shares and this
new formula increased stories read from
fifty-seven percent to seventy percent
of course more time on Facebook means
the more money they can get from
advertisers for your eyeballs story
bumping launched on the web and we'll be
rolling out soon to mobile devices and
if you bought an iphone ipod or ipad
charger that is not made by apple you
can trade it in for an authentic apple
one for ten dollars at an apple store or
authorized service provider normally
apples charges go for twenty bucks Apple
is launching this trade-in program to
replace non-apple chargers because of
electrocutions reportedly linked to
counterfeit power adapters so if you
bought a cheap charger from some shady
online site might be a good idea to
replace it General Motors is the latest
car maker to drop the price of its
electric plug-in vehicle to improve
sales the Chevy Volt sticker price
dropped by five thousand dollars so the
cheapest model of the Volt now starts at
35 grand and after federal tax
incentives the price ends up being
around 28 grand Nissan Honda and Ford
have recently also offered big discounts
on their electric cars another clue has
cropped up about Samsung's plans for a
SmartWatch the company filed the
trademark for Samsung Galaxy gear and
the description says it's for wearable
digital electronic devices in the form
of a wristwatch wrist band or bangle
that's capable of providing access to
the internet and sending and receiving
calls emails and messages the renderings
show that it could offer touch controls
and maybe a curved screen
and as everything goes mobile so does
job hunting LinkedIn's new applets
members submit job applications from
their smartphones without attaching a
formal resume the update on iOS and
Android features a new apply button and
members are guided through a short
process to review their profile before
submitting quick is nice when your job
hunting but you may still stand a better
shot at that job by taking the time to
attach a real resume from a desktop
computer that's your tech news update
and you can read up on more details at
cnet com / update and follow along on
Twitter from our studios in New York I'm
