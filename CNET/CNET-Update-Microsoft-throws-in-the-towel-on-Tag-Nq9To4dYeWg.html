know existed I'm Bridget Carey and this
is your cnet update remember the
microsoft tag that's okay not many
people do and that's why Microsoft
announced its going to stop supporting
the tag in two years the tag is
Microsoft's own version of a QR code and
when it launched many top companies like
Nike coca-cola and kraft foods were
using these colorful two dimension
barcodes on their packaging and in
advertisements instead of using the
common QR code the only way to scan the
tag was to use Microsoft's special app
and once scan the phone would open a
website with more information about a
product publications like USA Today also
used it in print as a shortcut to
quickly view a video about a story the
home improvement store Lowe's put these
codes on flowerpot tags to tell you how
to take care of the plant the advantage
with Microsoft System was that it was
easier to program and collect data to
see how many people were scanning the
codes the problem was that even after a
few years people still don't know what
the code is and it just didn't stick
next month a company called scan by will
take over management of the tag Lincoln
started its first day of school it just
created University pages so students and
alumni can get updates about campus news
and connect with fellow students and
it's a resource if you're hunting for
colleges get a glimpse of successful
alumni and what careers they have chosen
you don't need a nuke tablet to watch
videos from barnes &amp;amp; noble the
bookseller is coming out with a free
nook video app that works on iOS Android
and Roku devices users of the app can
buy or rent shows and movies from the
nuke library Barnes &amp;amp; Noble seems to be
leaning on digital content now that it's
no longer making color tablets and the
company also just dropped the price of
its top ereader the nook simple touch
with glowlight bringing the price to 100
dollars its twenty bucks cheaper than
the Amazon Kindle paperwhite if you like
your phones extra large then say hello

is coming to the US and will be sold by

this Friday for one hundred and fifty
dollars under contract and the megaphone

been available in Europe Russia and
South Korea but if you long for the days
when smartphones were just four inches

the HTC one mini also comes out in the
US this friday at AT&amp;amp;T and it will sell
for one hundred dollars after contract
