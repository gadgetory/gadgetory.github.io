than last year's model it is a beautiful
12 inch display a new kickstand and a
Pandi digital pen unfortunately it's
still just as difficult to disassemble
if not more so I'm bill Detweiler and
this is cracking open given its size
weight and hardware specs the surface
pro 3 is more of a convertible or ultra
portable laptop than our real tablet it
has a 12 inch display stereo speakers a
micro SD card slot a full size USB 3
port a mini DisplayPort and 2 5
megapixel cameras now it comes in a
variety of CPU RAM and storage
combinations and pricing starts at seven
hundred and ninety nine dollars u.s. at
just over 1 and 3/4 pounds it's heavier
than your average tablet but again about
the same as an ultra-thin or ultra
portable laptop like last year's pro the
pro 3 is well built and feels sturdy in
your hands and unfortunately it's just
as annoying to crack open the first step
in opening the case is removing the
front panel and display assembly so that
means breaking out the heat gun
hairdryer or other warming device and
very carefully heating the edges around
the actual display now be very careful
not to overheat the glass and warp the
plastic cover behind it as several
ribbon cables run along the lower edge
will start at the panel's upper left
corner and work our way around removing
the front panel is a slow tedious
process but if you rush you risk
damaging the front panel like I just did
now after disconnecting all its cables
you can set the front panel and LCD
assembly aside and begin removing the
pro threes other internal components now
although there are still lots of screws
inside the pro 3 Microsoft did use fewer
than the nearly 100 found inside the old
pro as before I recommend cataloging the
location of each screw as you remove
them after disconnecting the battery we
can begin removing components star
with the SSD card next comes a thin
board that runs along the top of the pro
three this contains the front-facing
camera
ambient light sensor microphone and a
few antennas after detaching all its
cables and removing a few more screws
the motherboard and cooling assembly
come out next and with the board out we
can remove the metal shielding and then
separate the cooling assembly from the
board alas to come out are the left and
right speakers charging port microSD
card slot and rear-facing camera at this
point our teardown is pretty much
complete the LCD in front glass panel
are basically fused together and
separating them isn't practical the
battery is held to the back cover with
copious amounts of adhesive and there's
nothing under it so I'm going to leave
it in place
likewise I'm leaving the keyboard
connector power button volume buttons
vibration motor and headphone jack alone
they're clearly visible while still in
place and I don't want to risk damaging
them unnecessarily when I disassembled
the surface pro last year I officially
dubbed it the worst device I've ever
cracked open and despite having fewer
screws on the inside the pro 3 is still
a real pain to service it's extremely
difficult to remove the front panel
there are still lots of different size
screws inside the case you can't really
remove the battery and the front panel
glass is extremely fragile as I found
out now given that a well equipped
surface pro 3 and keyboard like our core
i5 test model costs around $1,200 the
same price as a laptop it would make
sense that device be as repairable as a
laptop but it's not I mean even on a
MacBook Air which Microsoft compares the
pro 3 to in its marketing material you
can open the case without much fuss I'm
just disappointed the Microsoft couldn't
find a way to make the pro 3 both a
solid device and one that's easily
serviceable now for more information on
the pro 3 including real world tests and
pricing
