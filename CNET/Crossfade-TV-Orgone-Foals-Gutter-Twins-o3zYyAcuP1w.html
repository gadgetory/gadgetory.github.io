edition a crossfade TV I'm Mike Tao and
after a few weeks off i'm back with
another cat miss artist on our site this
week my money is on the funk band oregon
who dropped their latest album the
killian floor at last october now the
group consists of members of groups like
break a stretch connie price and key
stones the car hip-hop orchestra &amp;amp; the
dap-kings so i guess you can consider
our goal as an all-star lineup from
these groups whatever you want to call
it oregon's got a funky throwback
soulful sound mixed with a little bit of
disco on the cuts like the rework of
casing the sunshine bands i get lifted
and dialed up which you can find on our
site this album is no brainer for all
you Amy Winehouse and Sharon Jones fans
out there not only can you find Oregon's
music on our site but you can also check
out their podcast with yours truly on
Studio C cnet com hey what's up everyone
I'm Angie my pick for this week is one
of the most rapped about British acts
within the indie dance circles they go
by the name Falls and their debut album
antidotes promises to be a killer
release for 2008 check out the album's
first single balloon
an adult was recorded in Brooklyn and
produced by Dave Sitek of TV on the
radio however according band interview
some final mixes were scratched out in
favor of the band's own that said
despite of whatever disagreements they
may have had the album's end result is
undeniably catchy containing Scitex New
York noise and soul traits along with
enough bass and since to get the indie
kids dancing antidotes is out on Sub Pop
Records and you can get a fraction of
the antidote called balloons for free by
visiting music download com just search
for the foals hey it's kurt and this
week my pick is the gutter twins a new
collaboration between former grunge gods
mark lanegan and greg dulli it just
released a brand new album that's called
Saturnalia
shucks
dooley previously led the Afghan Whigs
and now fronts the twilight singers a
land again was in the Screaming Trees
but is now best known as a solo artist
if you're already a fan of either man's
work it's a fair bet you'll like the
gutter twins you'll know what they're
about is the songs are pretty dark heavy
and brooding see we did I mean on the
album's first single idle hands
you grab a free download of idle hands
by going to music download calm and
searching on the name gutter twins and
if you like what you hear we also have a
collection of duets that Lanigan
recorded with is both campbell from
Belle and Sebastian along with an elven
mahila done on this show a couple weeks
back Cody's dream from lanagin's former
bandmate mark pickerel
