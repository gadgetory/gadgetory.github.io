for selfie sticks I'm Bridget Carey this
is your scene at update Disney will no
longer allow selfie sticks at any of its
theme parks due to safety concerns
turns out the guests are unable to keep
their hands arms and selfie sticks
inside the vehicle at all times the
Orlando Sentinel reports that when the
new policy goes into effect on Tuesday
security will not let these sticks pass
the bag check the bag Trek has been
routine at Disney parks for years now
but if a selfie stick is found well the
park is gonna offer to hold it for you
to pick it up later guests will also be
reminded of this rule at hotels and at
the parking lot so they'll be encouraged
to leave them in the car now this has
been a growing safety problem as I guess
we're pulling out the sticks during
rides trying to take photos and video
with the extended angle now previously
Disney allowed them in the park but
banned them on attractions a couple of
weeks ago I took a vacation at Disney
World in Orlando Florida and saw this
snow selfie stick sign at the Big
Thunder Mountain Railroad roller coaster
but clearly these signs were not enough
to stop people the Orlando Sentinel
reports this week a roller coaster at
Disney's California Adventure Park had
to be stopped when someone pulled out a
stick
closing the ride for an hour Disney is
not the first to ban the sticks nor
shall it be the last
dozens of museums do not allow the
sticks and the same goes for many
sporting venues and music festivals
people need to watch where they're
swinging these things and other tales of
strange tech culture you can now watch a
continuous stream of gifts on your
computer with tumbler TV gifs gifs
however you pronounce them will be
looping randomly at tumblr comm slash TV
it's cycling through the ones posted to
tumblr and the idea is that you'll want
to find one to share with others a few
weeks ago tumblr added a tool to search
just for gifts but this TV thing is not
an original idea jiffy another hub for
looping clips also will melt your brain
with never ending sequences of these
fullscreen animated gems now let's end
with something that's better for your
brain like reading books Amazon is
adding a new feed
the books that you read on a Kindle or
with the Kindle Android app if you
highlight text you can share that book
quote with others through a text message
email or on a social network including
Facebook Messenger and whatsapp it also
lets you share to just one specific
person on Facebook and when you do it
gives that person free access to read a
sample of the book for example share
something from divergent and your
friends can read bits from the start of
a few chapters today it'll only work
with the Kindle app for Android but it's
coming to other Kindles in time that's
it for this tech news roundup but
there's always more at cnet.com and you
can catch every update by subscribing to
the podcast and I'll keep you updated on
Twitter from our studios in New York I'm
