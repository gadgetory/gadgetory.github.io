well guy isn't it it's it's it's simply
gorgeous times just gorgeous such a
gorgeous product this product is so
meticulously crafted what I talk about
the details of putting the TVD of my dad
at this this is unreal what this does
every single part of this product every
detail thought through every single
detail when you look at this product and
you put it in your hands you're going to
find no reference how any of these parts
have come together in the product you
won't find a screw you won't find
anything that leaves a party line across
the device you see perfect lines a
perfect flow of energy when you pull it
apart and open it seamlessly you see a
tone and tone balance in the colors and
product making we have a thing called
the first read we talked about in our
design labs all the time what's the
first read on the product how does it
feel it's meant to be silent to the eyes
that's critical when you look at it does
it feel good does it draw you in what
does it mean why how do we get people
into their flow how do we get them
moving it really is a product that draws
you in it's one of these products where
you have to feel it to understand it so
we'll do that um can I show you this
device I want to talk about the way we
made it with you if that's cool my
embarrassing you right now I probably
have um I mean you have lovely equipment
I don't want to hurt it I'm gonna you
know have to move stay right there stay
right there no totally cool you do have
to move though so scoot in a little all
right cool all right this is the surface
laptop and this is Burgundy you're
wearing Burgundy I think we didn't plan
this big way that's pretty cool I want
you to see it I want you to feel it I
want you to kind of get the essence of
this product when you think of what
we're trying to do with the laptop and
where we want to push things we want to
push things a little bit further we want
to move from things that are feeling
like machines and we want to move to
something that's more personal something
that's just more personal to you keep it
for the show show to whoever you want
but I think do you like it
if you take a look we've designed the
product we've designed the product in
four gorgeous colors burgundy graphite
gold platinum and cobalt blue all
beautifully all beautifully inspired
through different elements in nature to
bring it to life and the idea of making
something more personal and bringing it
to you is critical in this product now
when you hold this product it feels
amazingly thin in light which is really
important when it comes to a laptop like
this it's 2.76 pounds it's under 14 and
a half millimeters and with one finger
you can open the screen which is super
cool but it's very elegant in the sense
that I just open it smoothly just like
that and what you get is a thirteen and
a half inch diagonal with a three by two
aspect ratio this is the when you think
of that aspect ratio in this diagonal
that's the productivity of a 14-inch
laptop in your standard sixteen by nine
format so it's like a fourteen inch
laptop but it feels and acts like a
13-inch size when it's in your bag
here's great when you close it when you
close this product it feels so elegant
it's important it's important that it
sounds good when you close it because
when you're done with your thought and
you close something don't you want
closure of course you do now when you
look at the products when you look at
the products you're using right now and
there's a lot of them out there you're
going to find a rubber bumper around the
screen you're going to find a either a
piece of plastic around the screen the
reason that's there is because when you
close these devices you don't want to
break the glass I mean that's pretty
smart
but this elegant dance between these two
parts come together so seamlessly in
this product and when I say at the first
read you won't find any misplace parts
in every detailed matter there's no
rubber bumper there's no plastic chin
there's no hinge that you can see it's
all part of the device that flows and
fades to the background the screen
itself is 3.4 million pixels 3.4 million
pixels it's that exact screen that you
would expect from surface that high
contrast that color calibrated screen
you know what it is I do it every time
I'm not going to do it you know what it
is at the end of the day this is the
thinnest LCD touch module ever created
and put into a laptop and that's how you
get this form that's the line</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
