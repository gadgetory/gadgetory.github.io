that's made in France by a company
called vocal it's the company's first
in-ear headphone and it's one of the
better ones out there for a hundred and
seventy nine dollars here's what makes
it good for starters it's lightweight
very comfortable to wear and it stays in
your ears it also seems steadily built
and comes with a thick main cord that
terminates in an l-shape plug the mic on
the cable is located high up on the left
cord close to your mouth for making
calls while the single button remote is
conveniently located farther down on the
cable at the wide junction a decent
carrying case is included along with
various tips to help ensure you get a
good seal while the sphere is considered
a noise isolating headphone it does let
in a bit more ambient noise than your
typical noise isolating headphone even
so sound quality is excellent the bass
is ripe in full treble is pleasantly
crisp detailed and clear and mid-range
presence and body are exceptional
if the headphone has a fault it's that
it's a bit too revealing and can bring
out the harshness and compress music and
poorly recorded tracks but overall this
is a headphone you can wear for long
stretches at a time without experiencing
listening fatigue it's well worth
considering if you're looking for an
audiophile grade in your headphone for a
semi affordable price I'm David Carr
noise that's the focal sphere thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
