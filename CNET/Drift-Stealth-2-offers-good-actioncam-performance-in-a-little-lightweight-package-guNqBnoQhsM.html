one action cam delivering nice video and
features in a waterproof body it's also
pretty big the stealth two on the other
hand is not I'm Josh gobloon with cnet
and the stealth is considerably smaller
and lighter than its line mate but to
get there require some sacrifice for
example the battery is built in so
you're not swapping it out to keep
recording when it dies the positive here
is that it can get up to about three
hours of recording time at 1080p at 30
frames per second which is its max
resolution the screen on the side is
only for setting and mode changes in
camera status not preview and review
like the ghost you can use the cameras
Wi-Fi to do that though by connecting to
a smartphone or tablet which works just
fine you can also pick up a wireless
remote to change shooting modes and
start and stop recordings but it's not
included also the body is just weather
resistant and not waterproof like the
ghost as though you can get a waterproof
housing for it anyway you get the point
this tiny $200 stealth to isn't as
capable as the larger $300 ghost s it
looks the same has the same rotating
lens to make positioning easy and has a
built-in tripod mount as well to make
for fast mounting and operation is easy
video quality is good enough for web
sharing and viewing on mobile devices
but not great at large sizes you can
read the full review on cnet com but
basically you're left with a decision do
you want a larger camera with bells and
whistles and better video quality or do
you want something that's small that
gets the job done for less money at a
fraction of the size and weight I'm Josh
Goldman and that's a quick look at the
drift stealth
