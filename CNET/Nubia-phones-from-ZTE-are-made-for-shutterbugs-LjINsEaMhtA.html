here at CES 2014 in Las Vegas this is
going to be your first look at the ZTE
Sonata it is coming qao wireless you
don't know when or for how much vedeo is
a prepaid network so you're going to be
buying an off-contract for the full
retail amount the sonata is a very thick
heavy chunker of a device it comes in
white with silver accents along either
side and a little bit on the front so it
does have a little bit of style but it's
really not meant for up market this is
definitely an entry-level phone it's got
a 4-inch display that's pretty small by
today's standards luckily it is 720p HD
however which is a pretty high
resolution for this size screen it's
running Android 4.1 jelly bean so that's
a couple of versions behind but that's
something that you can expect for an
entry-level phones on top of that ZTE
has its my favor UI which is a custom
interface you can see evidence of that
in areas like the lock screen for
instance and other parts as you navigate
through the phone there is no
front-facing camera on the Sonata but
you will have a 5 megapixel camera on
the back with flash and 720p HD video
there are only four gigabytes of storage
on the sonata 4G but if you remove the
back cover and the battery you will find
a microSD card slot that will give you
up to 32 gigabytes more the processor is
a 1.2 gigahertz dual-core Qualcomm
Snapdragon 400 CPU we've got only four
gigabytes of storage here with no
expandable memory so this isn't a good
option for people who want to store a
lot of videos a lot of photos there was
one gigabyte of RAM on here as well this
is definitely a phone for people who are
maybe using their first smartphone or
who are going to be budget-conscious no
pricing yet that is probably going to be
pretty competitive i'm testing adult
court for cnet you can catch all the
rest of our CS news at CES cnet com
