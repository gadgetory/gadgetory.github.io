is a stand-up comic you may have seen
her on Conan may have seen her on Marin
may have seen her on Lady dynamite maybe
you listen to her podcast the dork
forest and Jackie and Lori we have
Jackie Kashian joining us thank you very
much thanks Andy well you guys nailed
all of those weirdo assorted credits you
do a lot of stuff oh yeah I'm working it
turns out and I thinks I'd like to knock
on particle board yeah don't know any
notice a minute I was very strange space
material on paper it's fine well son I
will fight you yes and so it is um yeah
so I do a bunch of that I do i do stand
up and then i do a pot a couple of
podcasts the podcast with Jackie and
lori is entirely about it son Nerdist
it's called the Jackie and Laurie show
and it is entirely about stand-up comedy
just a Laurie Kilmartin is a writer at
Conan yeah and a stand-up comic and a
mom and I am estate of comic and we
talked about and I do the road a lot so
I go on the road okay and so we talk
about just what it's like Laurie
Kilmartin more stories war stories and
six months woods elite there's only 20
episodes you didn't get in you can get
in on the ground floor of the show folks
but the the crazy thing is is that
there's Lord came to me and she said you
know that inner when you're a woman
comic every time you were interviewed
someone says to you what's it like being
a woman comic doing stand-up comedy as a
woman cross that 10 my question exactly
don't ask that well you can but the
answer is I wouldn't know any other you
know I've never got I am NOT transient
what's it like being a man calling o
assume it's somewhat like that but with
more people wanting to touch your boobs
that's a substudy the entirety of it
yeah and but the butt so Laurie said do
you want to have that conversation every
week and I said that's hilarious yes I
worry and it was less cuz she has to do
all this research for for Conan so she's
constantly coming up with people who
don't like women comics who think women
aren't funny
who I have spent 30 years doing stand-up
comedy avoiding all of those comments
and whenever anyone's asked me like I
guess Jerry Lewis doesn't like women
yeah that's a person I can think of
where I'm like okay that's somebody
who's very publicly said like out women
aren't funny sounds like a very
antiquated idea though I mean we have so
many great women comics right it's even
more beyond antiquated because we've had
so many great female comics even in the
56 60s 70s I mean we don't know one very
funny women so its source I mean he's
well but somebody asked me about it I
was like well how does it that doesn't
know I don't have an answer to that cuz
he doesn't affect me does he what does
he book he does a book anything is he
booking hyenas I just wanted to get in
at the Highness chain yeah so yeah so
you guys talk about your experience your
personal experiences doing stana but you
talk about stand-up sort of in the
abstract as well yeah we break down like
new bits that we're working on and stuff
like that and and it's and it is
fascinating I think it's fascinating and
people are on board they are they're
very interested in it and I I didn't
know I knew that there were comedy darts
I knew that there were people here I
wanted it this guy yeah right in here
this one mm-hmm who do you guys like who
are you some of your faves oh there's
too many we're in a golden age we are in
a true there's so many good wolf it's
also because of access I mean we have so
many ways to get comedy out there that
it's you can find no nobody in the
middle of nowhere and really love that
comedian and connect in a way that
you're like that person is exactly hear
me again they've shipped like 12
strongest fans in the world and there
can be comedy for everyone now yeah i
mean i've discovered people i mean i'm
be cannibal burris fan yeah I've
discovered people because of the
internet like I didn't see them live
first I saw them on the internet first
me oh well okay you know yeah Rondon
ships I love him so funny i love
horrible i love seeing Sarah Silverman
and your time she does stand-up over at
Largo yeah um I love the smaller venues
with her cuz she like there's a lot of
fun with the crowd and everything I did
a show with her over there's a comic
book store in Hollywood all dumb comment
and they have a little nerdmelt Nerdist
okay becus yeah and it's it's amazing
because I did a show it was with her and
Zach Galifianakis and
um I do i do I was sitting extra but I
was like why did they what they asked
what do they need us okay these guys
could each do 25 and it'd be good and it
but you get to try new stuff at nerdmelt
so it's everybody's working on my
favorite part about seeing show and nerd
mount his is everybody does like five
minutes on being in a comic book store
right the first time you do that room
you're like ah yes and I uh I usually
suggest that someone should pick
something up and then I'm my name just
because I tend to read a lot of comic
papers well you're good you got a grid
dork forest your other pod yeah the door
all the rest that kind of stuff right
right it could be traditional dork
gnomes weird it's videos it words video
games and and more games and board games
as board games oh my god tabletop yeah
that's uh yeah I am working on a board
game my husband's a game designer video
game designer he does yeah we are the
coolest aunt and uncle that you would
have comedy little little gaming are the
best yeah so he has like a rpt for money
he makes video games and then the last
summer he had a slow summaries contract
so he was like I i think i'm gonna make
my I'm finally gonna make my superhero
tabletop RPG game also the hero instant
this is Ed the hero instant you guys
yeah no I not more about it well turns
out you can go to the hero instant calm
which he didn't know spelled heroin but
I love him I need that game is so fun I
made fire bike Mike which is he has fire
powers any rides a motorcycle and and
he's also a detective you guys so he's
super smart so you could have any powers
any super cars but we're also he's
working on a couple of board games and
eighty did any help do this think all
the siblings trouble which was a
storytelling game that you can play with
little kids likes no one that little
like eight or nine yeah sure and the
everybody has to tell a story so
solution that's very fun stoke your
imagination yeah so I knew you said he
can be about traditional geek right so
yeah I could be board games and video
games and books and in science fiction
and and stuff like that but it could
also be like I just booked this woman
she's gonna come talk of a roller derby
oh wow I don't know anything about
roller derby I understand uh people are
on roller skates how do you ever been to
a derby game I'm not I
have the Derby dolls la derbies yeah so
an apparently it's like yeah people love
it you can go if they have a whole
season weird they have other teams it's
a sport it's a few baby I thought of a
kind of like professional wrestling
where I was kind of no no no we are
skating and they're really ski another
and they I don't know what the score is
I'm altegris find out yeah yeah it's
it's really fascinating I love roller
derby like I've just find the whole
concept of it really interesting and if
I actually had any coordination
whatsoever i might try it but I I don't
so I did I just avoid that no no no
violent it what it is might you might
have missed your window yeah I think I
missed my time I think it's past my I
think I past my expiration date on
rolling chair was a young woman's game I
really so would you ever think be really
tall even though they look told me
because they're on roller skates you are
told well I'm terrifying maybe in skates
cuz I 44 inches which i think is
intimidating and might it might help you
get some get some work that would be
good it's yeah so it could be like it
has been about bees and flowers and and
OH what did there was a comic out of uh
like but and then there's like famousy
people like I know I know a lot of
comics yeah so I have um I've had like
moon zappa was just on and she was
talking about linens I'm really like are
you super into yeah anything you're
super into I had her sister divas a pond
and she talked with knitting and then I
had like Greg Proops has one of the
greatest episodes but the history of
baseball and I don't know anything about
sports nothing nothing and it was
fascinating he did the history of
baseball from the Civil War up to
nineteen thirty-eight and it was
personality-driven huh yeah it was crazy
and I'm great yeah it's just it's it's
it's it's a safe space right you can
come to me with whatever you're into and
if I'm not into it like I don't know
anything about chess you can wonder that
yeah you learned a lot but I did learn a
lot and and and I ask the questions that
people who don't know anything because I
am more than willing you're the audience
you're the audience's I i am the
audience that I am when it's about music
there's a little drinking game that
Rangers of the dork forests like to play
which is how many of these band does
Jack you think that's a band does she
think it's a member of the band
yeah somebody was talking about the who
the other day I was like that is a bad
and she looked at me she was like yeah
that's a bad I said Vegas in the world
but they had us there was a stampede and
she was like and she said that's not
what they're known for and I was like
well they had a lot of albums dude she's
like stop talking we're done yeah you
could come and talk to me about the who
on the dork forest and then I would know
more somebody came and talked about pink
floyd I don't know anything about pink
floyd that's not a yeah now I know a
little bit more no no pretty good stuff
sure so uh you have a stand-up you spent
a special coming up no no my special it
dropped a little over a year and a half
ago I'm working on a new album and it's
the horcrux one right yeah the vorgitch
this will make an excellent Horcrux is
the name of my last album and also a DVD
special for all as harry potter fans
very father seduced my soul isn't it you
guys my soul's inside boilers for harry
potter i guess yeah yeah there are those
books uh watch the movies so said too
bad yeah you're good you know what it's
a little late it's 15 years week so he
rosebud is a sled oh my god we can
safely say Harry Potter I'm son oh she
wrote she started writing at mid 90s 90s
yeah so the borrow my done earlier than
that applies yeah has certainly done
time necessarily flown uh so what about
um let's talk a little bit about I'm
really curious about uh you mentioned
lady dynamite yeah and I know that you
do like not with but you've you I've
worked through yeah yeah I've known
Maria Maria Bamford is the star of Lady
dynamite on netflix great show oh my
guys if I'm crazy fun it's the arrested
development and the South Park lady
there that it's it's the guy who
produced arrested development and the
woman who produced South Park have come
together with Maria Bamford son Holy
yeah unholy union of Maria Bamford's
mental illnesses and at a cacophony of
of just pills somehow it works it
totally works because module arrested
development works and much like Sutton
South Park works I think that's how much
lady I know it works cuz it's so crazy
and awesome and it's so layered yeah and
but I've done Maria nice but I started
stand-up before Maria but she started
like in 92 in Minneapolis we're both
Minneapolis comics and so I've known her
since 1992 and now that she's a kind of
a big deal I was like can I ride your
coattail as far as you will let me you
can drop me off anywhere in the middle
and so I get to open for her on the road
sometimes so that's really fun because
her audiences are usually just the
nicest people because of the mental
illness I'm trying to be supportive of
people with mental illness yeah they're
super understanding but they're also
hilarious they're there to have a good
time willing to hear what weirdo joke
you're working on yeah like yes go there
because they're Maria's fans and then I
oddly enough the other because I I also
i also work just regular clubs just head
lighting and stuff like that sure but I
get too fancy open for Maria Bamford and
I get too fancy open sometimes for Brian
Regan oh very different oh yeah but cuz
he is the cap he doesn't probably want
to be described as this but I think imma
does the captain america stand-up comedy
across America constantly cuz he kills
across America yes let's tell them that
this is such a good guy he's cuz is
instead of his super silly but very
smart he's one of my favorites too he's
so great there's there it's it's a
master class in stand-up comedy just
getting to open for either of them cuz I
get to watch their stand-up comedy and
to watch for four hour long sets of
either of them is insane so if anyone's
out there thinking I want to get into
stand-up comedy it because it's quite a
little different I was to say it's quite
a bit different now than it was even ten
years ago tring it's so so different
especially with digital media and being
able to publish your self publish and
all this stuff yeah um what is your
recommendation obviously you know here
in Los Angeles there are lots of places
to stand up you can find an open mic
night but what about for the people who
grow up in places where there are not
opportunities today I do open if you're
a new albany mississippi and you want to
start doing stand-up comedy you're in
you probably have to start your own open
mic I mean that's what I I've met a
bunch of guys and women who have done
that in Alabama there's a southern
network of just because there aren't
enough clubs down there there's there's
some one nighter stuff and some weekend
that that are just for walling but if
you live near an open mic obviously go
do it open mic and don't freak out about
it because they're only going to give
you four minutes you guys 34 minutes
tops so pick like 3-4 minutes for topics
just pick three or four topics to talk
about that you think are funny say them
out loud and then get off stage I can
all right I got a set from experience
that three to five minutes is a really
long time so feels like forever
especially all eyes are on you and yours
like oh god it's not helping that's the
point you'll get through it and you'll
feel better about it and then you'll be
more you get through I will say this
about that though you were correctly the
fact that you will know immediately
after doing your first open mic whether
you want to continue to do open my trip
or you want to do stand-up at all right
because the first time I did it I'm sure
I ate it I'm sure it was terrible but I
remember going I think I got like one or
two laughs that was super fun and then
it was like the heroin instant it was
like her I was in I was on boy
superpowers and then I I have the super
powers of getting to you know talk about
what I wanted to talk about and try to
make people laugh and it's it's
genuinely the most fun in my life well
it's so awesome to have you here thank
you so much thanks for having me um
shameless self promotion for me and
Jackie will be on the same episode of
tabletop season 4 that's gonna be coming
up we can't tell you anything about it
other than we were there and we're a
really good time and we kept playing the
game after they stopped shooting yeah
