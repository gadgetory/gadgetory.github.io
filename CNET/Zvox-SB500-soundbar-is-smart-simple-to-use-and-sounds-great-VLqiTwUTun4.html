new SB 500 is the company's best
sounding speaker yet and it seems Zee
Vox is now ready to take the fight to
both yamaha and bose at $599 the SB 500
is a 43 inch wide sound bar which
features three mid-range drivers and two
bass drivers the speaker's quite tall at
almost 6 inches high and is best mounted
on the wall it even comes with keyhole
brackets the speaker is ported to the
left-hand side for deeper bass and on
the right-hand side you'll see the large
and friendly controls the speaker comes
with a serviceable remote and features a
large orange display on the right side
of the unit one disappointment we had
was that the unit only allows two
connections at a time one digital and
one analog also there's no HDMI happily
will also get bluetooth for streaming
music from your phone
unlike some competitors you're unable to
add a subwoofer to the Z box however
there is a bass control if you want to
tailor it to your taste sound quality is
the Z box's biggest draw and the speaker
makes a surprising amount of bass for
its compact size this is an action-movie
madman it has clear dialogue combined
with deep punchy bass if you're a music
lover though you probably won't buy a
sound bar anyway but the Z box does a
decent job of most styles be aware that
if you love deep bass the unit can
switch to mono mode to avoid exploding
into thousands of bits or something as
an all-rounder at the Z box SB 500 does
a better job the most you might even
find that only a dedicated speaker
system and receiver could do a better
job for the money</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
