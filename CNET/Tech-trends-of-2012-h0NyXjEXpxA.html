and reel off five products that are
great for some reason or another but
this week we're going to step back and
look at the big picture products come
and go but if you really want to know is
going on in the tech world it's all
about spotting the trends so here's a
look back at what I personally think
were the big tech trends that define
2012 starting off at number five Virtual
Assistants Syria made his debut on the
iPhone in October of 2011 the 2012 was
the year when all the competitors struck
back Google now Samsung S boys vlingo
Robin we're actually having
conversations with our gadgets now and
it's kind of freaking me out that this
isn't freaking me out anymore at number
4 convertible laptops and hybrid tablets
with the rollout of Windows 8 we're
seeing a whole new crop of laptops that
flip around into tablets and tablets
that have snap on keyboards I can't tell
this is the evolution of the laptop or
just an awkward identity crisis but the
idea of a laptop without a touch screen
now is starting to feel a little
old-school coming in at number 3 4g now
4G has been with us for a while but 2012
was a year where it really went
mainstream you almost couldn't buy a
smartphone in 2012 that wasn't 4G
compatible especially after the iphone
got onboard 4g is finally becoming the
norm we've got a nice little window here
before everyone starts talking about 5g
at number two phablets more than a phone
less than a tablet and the best
indicator of an inferiority complex is
the invention of truck nuts Samsung
introduced the 5.3 inch Galaxy Note in
February and then a 5.5 inch Galaxy Note
2 in October we laughed at first but
this is a thing now your smartphone can
be as big as your face and people will
just think you're cutting edge now
before we get to number 1 i'd like to
point out a trend that everyone
predicted with dominate 2012 but didn't
the cloud everything was supposed to be
sucked up into the cloud like some kind
of tech rapture but nothing much changed
to be fair an invisible cloud of data is
kind of a hard thing to notice so maybe
we're in the cloud right now
kind of feels like a cloud and finally
the number one tech trend of 2012 was
7-inch tablets now this one was pretty
easy to spot from 2011 when Amazon had
their Kindle Fire and it became an
instant holiday hit and then Google hit
back with the Nexus 7 and then amazon
came back with four other kindle fires
and then Barnes &amp;amp; Noble stuffed up with
the nook and then of course the ipad
mini not only did the 7-inch tablet
blossom in 2012 but there's a good
reason to believe that this might be the
dominant tablet size from here on out so
there you go the five tech trends that I
personally think that the most of shape
2012 but that's just scratching the
surface for an exhaustive list of the
year's most important developments in
tech take a look at the cnet 100 it's a
