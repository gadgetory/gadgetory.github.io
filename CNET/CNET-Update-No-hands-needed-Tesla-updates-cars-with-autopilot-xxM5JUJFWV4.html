wheel to drive a Tesla
I'm Bridget Carey this is your CNET
update Tesla cars on the road today have
picked up a new skill autopilot a
software update is rolling out to both
the Model S and Model X that gives the
cars the power to steer itself in
traffic and even change lanes without
your hands on the wheel
CNET's Tim Stevens took it for a test
drive on the busy streets of New York
City with his hands off the wheel
the Tesla monitored the speed of the
vehicle ahead of him so when it slowed
down so did his car and it can detect
lines on the road to stay in the lane
click your turn signal to change lanes
and it'll change on its own when it
senses a safe opening it can also auto
park into a parallel spot this auto
steer feature isn't something that lets
you take a nap behind the wheel you need
to be alert and keep your hands near the
wheel because this can't completely
drive on its own it doesn't see signs or
traffic lights and it's early technology
Tesla isn't the first with self steering
the BMW 7-series
also has this feature but if your hands
are off the wheel of the BMW for 15
seconds it'll start to beep the tests
list can be set to not beep so you don't
have to keep your hands touching the
wheel the whole time the update rolls
out over the next week to all Model X
SUV s and any Model S sedan made since
October of last year
now here's another way to travel in
style JetBlue is the first airline to
announce it's making high-speed inflight
Wi-Fi free on all of its planes and it
has the technology installed in about
two-thirds of its fleet so far it's been
testing the free Wi-Fi on some of its
planes for over a year now a service
JetBlue calls fly 5 and the plan is to
make high-speed service for you on every
plane by this time next year now every
passenger will be able to connect two
speeds 12 to 20 megabits per second
enough that you may be able to stream
Netflix but the airline has a
partnership with Amazon so the network
will be optimized for Prime members to
stream Amazon video and music and
speaking of traveling with Amazon you
will not be able to book a vacation
anymore on Amazon but you didn't even
realize you could book a vacation on
Amazon did you
well Amazon shut down its destination
site this week it was a place where you
could book a hotel for a weekend
it competed with similar services from
TripAdvisor Expedia and Groupon it was
launched in April and only available in
a few areas
Amazon destinations didn't last long but
here's something that has yahoo mail
it's been around for 18 years now and
yahoo has a new email app that doesn't
require a password and you can use it to
access your personal outlook hotmail and
AOL mail accounts when you log in it
sends you a push notification to your
phone to verify it's really you trying
to log in the new Yahoo Mail app also
pulls the notifications from social
media accounts but it does not sync with
Gmail or your Enterprise Outlook
accounts that's it for this tech news
update and there's more cnet.com from
our studios in New York I'm Bridget
