triumph and kind of a nightmare let's
set the bar really hot after you did
that and kind of change the auto
industry what do you do next
they think it's this this is called the
Mirai Japanese for future they tell me
it is a production hydrogen fuel cell
vehicle at a time when most people think
hydrogen fuel cell is either yesterday's
failed experiment or distant tomorrow's
technological wish the mariah is
fascinating because it's a big bet being
made by the company with the most to
lose in terms of its cred as a
powertrain visionary let's tour the guts
of a Mirai now in the back you've got
not one but two hydrogen tanks one kind
of here around the axle line and one
under the rear seat those are filled at
10,000 psi with hydrogen gas that gets
down to a liquefied level but it's only
about five kilograms total weight of
hydrogen you'll put a lot in here notice
it's got a battery this is a hybrid but
it's an electric electric hybrid
sometimes the Carle take this hydrogen
and run it through this fuel cell stack
right here but use that directly to
power the electric motor but other times
or at the same time it will also create
energy in the fuel cell stack and send
some into the battery for storage while
also driving the vehicle that's why it's
a hybrid of two kinds of electricity the
idea is to be able to have a nice buffer
and not create at all on demand and then
of course you've got an electric motor
with a power control unit that is
relatively like other electric vehicles
the really interesting stuff is from
midships on back the simple version of a
fuel cell is that it takes in hydrogen
crosses plates and as that happens the
hydrogen's electrons are coaxed off in
different directions which is where the
electronic flow is generated that
creates current at the final stage
hydrogen combines with available oxygen
to form h2o in the form of water vapor
enough water vapors produce that the
mariah has an h2o dump button
that empties out it'd splatter if you
will so you can leave all that outside
instead of it puddling on your garage
for notice you can also use this vehicle
to power other things like your home in
an emergency it's a weird little side
angle to this vehicle but there's a
great big high current port in the trunk
so if you were to have a power outage at
your home they will have accessories
that will let you break that out into
household current 120 AC 300 miles of
range on a fill three to five minutes to
fill up the tanks and no plugging in
whatsoever now in the market the key to
the mariah is actually not so much the
Mirai as it is Toyota's ability to sell
a vision and that turns on making
hydrogen available but they say less
available than you might think if every
vehicle in the state of California ran
on hydrogen we could meet refueling
logistics with only 15% of the nearly
10,000 gas stations that are currently
operating in the state based on an
assumption that owners would want to
reach a refueling station within six
minutes of their home or work okay
what's a like driving this advanced
technology well as Twitter is actually
kind of proud to point out it's sort of
unremarkable if you've driven an
electric car before it doesn't feel that
much different that's really different
at all high torque very quiet occasional
whine of motor and reduction gears but
it feels like any other electric which
is what they were going for it don't
want this to be jarring or something you
have to get used to other than the
different way you fuel it
I'll say this though it does feel torque
e'er and generally more powerful than a
lot of other sort of mid class electrics
or plug-in hybrids that rivet there's no
lack of power or power assist things
like seat eaters and heated wheel and
things you'd normally be nervous about
the battery cargas you want to preserve
that precious charge in this car they
point out the behavior should be
different because you'll be able to
charge readily if you can fill it up at
all in your area and then you won't
worry so much about being so
parsimonious with the bolts size of the
vehicle on the outside is kind of closer
to Camry than it is to Prius and notice
in the trunk you do not have folding
rear seats you do have a little bit of a
limited trunk space they're not bad but
there's some intrusion from where they
have mounted the twin hydrogen tanks now
if you're just in this to save money sit
down sufficient hydrogen to cover say
300 miles will cost you around 50 bucks
in a Mariah you can do that same
distance for about $33 in a four
cylinder gas Camry that cost a lot less
upfront and for just ten dollars in a
Nissan Leaf
but with all the charging stops it by
taking days to get there and it's
anybody's guess where hydrogen prices
would go should there be widespread
adoption because we're nowhere near that
now saying Toyota wants this to be the
next bigger Prius is an apt statement
but the Prius required no changes in
infrastructure the world was already set
up for it if you will
the Mehran arrives on a very different
stage okay the Mirai hits the US fall
2015 price will be around 57 5 that's
steep of course new technology look for
about $13,000 in federal and California
credits the only state where it's going
to be sold initially later they'll
expand out to some northeast markets
they have to follow the infrastructure
of course but this is a major stake by
Toyota a vision not just of a vehicle
but of where they think infrastructure
can reasonably go and if they're right
this short circuits a lot of the
headaches that surround battery electric
