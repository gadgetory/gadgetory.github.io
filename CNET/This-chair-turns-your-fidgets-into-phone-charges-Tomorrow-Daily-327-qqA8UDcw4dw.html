welcome to tomorrow daily the best geek
talk show in the known universe i'm jeff
cannata and I'm ashley Esqueda let's get
right into those rapid-fire headlines
the first of which involves a student
who has designed something that will
actually allow the disabled to create
music with their eyes on dreis refs
cards last project for the Copenhagen
Institute of interactive design is
called I conductor it uses an
inexpensive I tracking device and a
simple webcam in conjunction with an
interface to allow a user to choose
which instrument to use create a beat
and make songs it's also adjustable
based on how broad or narrow the users
facial movements can be refs guard says
quote I believe that the ability to
express oneself artistically should be
available to all regardless of physical
disabilities or challenges unquote best
part about this thing is it costs less
than a hundred dollars so it really
opens up the ability to as he said
express yourself to anybody that can
move their eyes that's pretty incredible
I thought was really cool that he took
it to centers where and had disabled
people try to me he said there were real
connections made the music which is so
rad I love when people are able to do
something like that for pennies on the
dollar that that's the most important
thing that off-the-shelf components can
work yeah yeah it's really cool uh if
you are a fidgety person like myself uh
this chair might be the chair for you if
you want to get the most out of your
fidgeting movements you might like move
it's a prototype designed to harness the
power of shifting around in your seat
move is a chair from furniture designer
Natalie tubules and it has 288
piezoelectric crystals inside the frame
that generate current would expose to
pressure a USB port in the armrest lets
you jack right into the chairs
electricity and charge your phone as you
fidget tinkle said she was inspired by
her own personal experiences with ADHD
while making this chair there's no
official mass production scheduled for
move but if i were ikea i would have
this in every college caffeine addled
college dorm room in
medium this is restless leg syndrome the
battery yeah exactly you can really turn
that five hour energy and do energy for
your actual phone here's what I want I
want an entire airplane just with these
