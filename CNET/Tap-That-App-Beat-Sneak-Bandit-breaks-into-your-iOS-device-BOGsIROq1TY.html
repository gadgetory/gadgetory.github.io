episode of tap that app the show will be
check out the hottest apps in the mobile
space my name is Eddie Cho and today
we're going to show you beat sneak
bandit a game that blends rhythm
stealthy action and some clever puzzles
as you all know time is money so it's no
surprise that when the world's clocks
get stolen all havoc breaks loose it's
up to you as the Bandit to break into
the Dukes mansion and reclaim time for
all the people like Robin Hood but with
Fox the controls are pretty simple and
straightforward players must sneak and
tiptoe around the mansion to the rhythm
of the music therefore playing what
speakers or headphones is absolutely
recommended move the band across each
stage by tapping to the beat if you hit
off rhythm you'll cause a bandit the
stumble halting a min is tracks and
pretty much throwing off your groove in
the process though the mechanics might
sound a bit mundane and repetitive beat
sneak bandit makes up for its limited
controls with intricate level designs in
a really hip soundtrack because
everything in game is tied to music
there's a lot of detailed environmental
elements that react to the rhythm
everything from trap doors and security
cameras to patrolling guards and even
floating vacuums are all connected to
the background track so there's a lot to
focus on if you want to make it to the
end to get past all the traps and
obstacles you'll have to figure out the
best moments to sneak across and also
when to slow down and take a chill pill
players complete each level after they
capture the biggest clock well there are
also bonus clocks scattered around every
level these bonus items create incentive
to revisit levels and try out new
strategies after collecting a certain
number of clocks you can unlock even
more challenging stages to really test
your espionage groove the hand-drawn
graphics are clean the animation is
fluid and the music is fresh you can
grab beat sneak bandit now from the
