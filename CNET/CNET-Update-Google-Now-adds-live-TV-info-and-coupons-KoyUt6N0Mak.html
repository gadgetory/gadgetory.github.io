cnet update google is adding TV show
information and discount offers to its
google now notification cards on android
so here's how it works if you have an
internet connected TV the google
announced service should be able to
detect what show you're watching and it
will display info about the actors in
the program and as for discounts it ties
into google offers so you can get pop up
reminders on your phone about saved
offers when you're near the store and
you can also get these google now
notifications through the chrome web
browser on your desktop and in other
Google News it's clear skies on google
maps satellite view because Google just
removed all the clouds google has mined
hundreds of terabytes of data to post
high-resolution images and it offers
more accurate views of the planets
texture and that means no more clouds
your next phone might never run on 3g
verizon said that by the end of 2014 it
plans to sell smartphones that only tap
into the faster 4g LTE network the
reason is that a 4G only device could be
cheaper and lighter since there wouldn't
need multiple cellular radios and if
calls are done over the 4g network
verizon customers can finally talk and
browse the web at the same time right
now it's 3g for calls and 4g for data
and for those of you with windows 8
tablets you'll be getting a facebook app

never I guess and when the time comes
