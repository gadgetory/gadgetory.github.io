doesn't always translate into great
video footage so to up your video game
we've got a few basic tricks that'll
work on just about any smartphone in
fact to show you how great your video
could look we film this entire video on
an iPhone one of the first things to
consider when shooting video is how to
hold your phone when you take photos
shooting between landscape or portrait
is no big deal
but with video it's a different story as
a rule of thumb you should always shoot
in landscape to avoid these black bars
on your screen unless you're posting the
video on social media where vertical
video is actually better the iPhone has
a sweet built-in stabilizer which can
take some of the shake out of your
videos but even with the iPhones
built-in magic you're going to want to
keep your iPhone still this can be
especially handy for when someone is
speaking directly to camera close-up
shots
and time lapse or slow-motion shots the
most basic technique to steady your
phone is to tuck in your elbows while
shooting also be on the lookout for
sturdy flat surfaces where you can place
your phone in good light the iPhone
shoots great video but when you're in
the shade or indoors beware of your
light source if there's a bright light
behind your subject you might get a
nasty silhouette to prevent this turn
your subject toward the light so it's
not behind them once you have your
subject in a good spot you can fine-tune
the brightness by adjusting the exposure
tap on the spot where you want to focus
and then slide the brightness icon up or
down until your subject looks fabulous
if all else fails the iPhone has a
built-in flash that can be used to add
light but this trick doesn't always work
and it's not the most flattering
centering your image is easy enough but
not everything has to be in the middle
of the frame in fact lining up parts of
your subject on thirds and make your
compositions more interesting this is
called the rule of thirds imagine
drawing a tic-tac-toe grid on your phone
screen and aligning your image on the
intersection of those lines
these are small changes that'll make a
big difference when it comes to shooting
video and with a little practice who
knows your video might be the next viral
sensation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
