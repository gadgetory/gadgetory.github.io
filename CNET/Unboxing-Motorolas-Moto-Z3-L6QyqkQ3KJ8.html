fresh in the box looks like they've
already opened it up for me a little bit
but I have not unpeeled it to see the
phone inside so here we go alright first
off is the sleeve we've got this box
it's this bright red color with some
black on the side pretty snazzy but
honestly looks like a box there is a 64
gigabytes of storage and the black color
is called ceramic black it's an
interesting detail that they didn't
share during the presentation here is
our Verizon SIM card because this phone
is a Verizon exclusive in the US I'm
still not clear if the z3 is going to
sell outside of the US ever or if it
will sell unlocked later on down the
line but the partnership with Verizon is
important and we'll get to that in a
minute
hello meadow hello to you too and here
is the phone in the box and I'm holding
it upside down good move and here's the
phone in the box it has this plastic
sheet on the front that kind of gives
you a hint of where everything is so
even if you've never seen this phone
before you can kind of take a look and
see where the fingerprint sensor is PS
it's moved to the right spine so that
for right-handed people that your thumb
will just access it and unlock it but I
digress alright that can just go there
so now I'm looking at the phone it's
totally blank I'm gonna turn it on
hopefully there's some battery in here I
won't say hello moto anyway you are
looking at a six inch Super AMOLED
screen the puzzles are pretty thin this
is a very modern design it's got an 18
by 9 screen ratio it did say hello moto
to me so and that's kind of a classic
Motorola move there the phone in the
hand feels very slim and that is because
this is a phone that works with
Motorola's Madhi ecosystem so those are
modular devices that snap on
magnetically to these pogo pins the mod
that Motorola and Verizon really
care about is not going to be available
until 2019 and that's going to be a
module that will turn this phone into
one of the first phones that can ever
access horizons 5g speeds now 5g is the
next-generation data technology that is
going to make uploads and downloads
insanely fast like an order of magnitude
faster than the fastest 4G LTE speeds
that we have today so let me put this
aside because I've completely forgotten
about everything else that's in the box
I just got so carried away with the
phone so we've got a little slip of
paper here some literature that will
probably tell us a little bit more about
the phone meet your new phone product
safety and warranty information and
consumer safety information these are
they come with every phone what else do
we have we have a 15 watt turbo charger
in the box and we've got the USB a 2 USB
C charging cable here so those will go
together
there is no headphone jack however what
we have we've got a little tether to
keep the cords together so there's no
headphone jack but we do have an adapter
dongle that comes in the box
and that will be a 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack dongle that will adapt to
your USB C port
I like seeing these in the box it's
still something extra that you can lose
I really wish that every one of these
phones still have their headphone jack
but at least Motorola is helping you out
so this is one less thing you're gonna
have to buy on your own and that's it
the rest of the box is pretty much empty
ok so that was my unboxing of the Moto Z
3 now you know what comes with it if you
want to know more about the phone like
specs first impressions I've got a first
look video we've got editors react and
I'll have a full review coming soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
