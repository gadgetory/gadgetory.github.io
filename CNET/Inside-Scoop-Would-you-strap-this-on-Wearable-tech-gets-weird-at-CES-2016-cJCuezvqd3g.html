live coverage of the consumer
electronics show CES 2016 it's the
biggest tech show of the year and we're
coming to you live from the cnet stage
at the South Hall of the Las Vegas
Convention Center I'm Bridget Carey
joined by Jeff Bakalar and we kick
things off every day this week with our
show inside scoop this is the second day
of the CES show floor that it's open and
we spent the past few days covering the
future tech coming in 2016 including
smart home appliances concept car tech
televisions of course TVs it's not CES
without a giant TV that no one really
needs and a few robots and drones
naturally there's even a robot that you
can ride and we'll get to a live demo of
that in just a few minutes but first I
want to talk about one of the bigger
trends that we're seeing at the show
wearable tech now for a few years now
we've seen companies want to strap all
sorts of things to our bodies that's a
show but the health side of wearable
tech just continues to grow and take new
forms and some of it makes sense and
other things can be a little strange
just just a little strange yeah well so
you and I were talking about this
backstage before we came out here and
one of the first kind of companies that
I was making a lot of headlines
yesterday was Fitbit in their new
initiative to sort of take over maybe a
more higher-end SmartWatch right kind of
getting closer to that Apple watch side
of things are that pebble watch side of
things right we're seeing video now
where the new model the blaze has a
color screen on it now this isn't doing
everything that a smart smart watch can
do but you are getting some
notifications from your phone with X and
a calendar alerts and you can switch it
out with different bands so a little
more style you know fip it's popular but
you don't usually have a lot of options
other than a rubber and I mean if you go
back and look at what that brand has
done a lot of other products have really
focused on subtlety where is the blaze
sort of comes out and says hey this is a
piece of fashion you know it's a
fashionable accessory this is this is
jewelry this is something you want to
show off so definitely a change of pace
for that brand but then we got we got to
talk about the elephant in the room with
with Fitbit they're at the mercy of a
class-action lawsuit
dealing with reporting inaccurate
heartbeats reading right the same day
that they came out with this new blaze
watch tracker is the same day that they
got a class action lawsuit over the fact
that they're the claims are it's not
accurately tracking your heartbeat in
fact some in the claim we're saying like
half of the heart beats per minute we're
being counted which is shocking i mean i
don't think anybody ever accused ace you
know a fitness tracking you know sort of
biometric scanner device to replace a
doctor or any kind of realistic medical
advice right but at the same time it
could be used as this complementary
product you need to be close definitely
I mean not if you wear like five of them
on your wrist at once you're gonna get
like slightly different things because
none of it's perfect it's it's like how
you're going up and down as a step sure
but yeah I mean it's definitely you know
I think if if anything I think it will
shed a lot more light on the category as
a whole and sort of say hey let's take a
step back and maybe look at just how
accurate or inaccurate these devices are
reporting these pretty vital metrics and
kind of go from there you know so with
Fitbit being one of the stars because
everyone you know knows Fitbit there are
some other ways of tracking that aren't
so when you put on your wrist right um
like the hexose skin smart it's a new
biometric tracking shirt as the second
generation so this thing has been out
but now it's got bluetooth smart so the
battery life is better and here's some
of the stats you can work out in this
shirt not only is the tracking your
heart rate your breathing rate your
breathing volume so if you're like a
heavy breather like so it can tell you
it's like how much you know a cubic
volume of air you're sort of breathing
in insights on on your recovery which I
do not want to know like I rather just
know how well I did not know pathetic I
am after the run and there's also sleep
quality but I hope you don't like track
your sleep after you're on because
that's just nasty it just sounds like
I'm wearing the shirt for a very long
time I hope there's some sort of laundry
in between them okay so speaking of that
you can work out an hour a day for five
days a week
and not have to charge this shirt so for
nearly seven weeks so the charging on
the durban age please please wash beyond
the charge at least as much as as other
you know I hope they're sort of doing
some sort of antimicrobial you know
cotton right you would hope and then
also speaking of things you can wear
there is the LUMO run shorts ok now the
shorts themselves the fabric isn't smart
it's what you put in your short story
smarty pants this is but Tex this is but
tech website but it's Patek yeah that's
what day it is a like basically a a
device that you put in a pocket and this
thing is tracking not just how long
you're running and how far you're
running how but also other kind of
analysis like your pelvic twisting Russ
so it's doing this all in real time and
saying that data to a phone what you're
seeing on the screen here this is the
real time you know what your run is and
how long you're running but okay that's
a little different you know how your how
you're moving your pelvis it's a step in
an interesting direction I think we're
bombarded by all these pedometers and
and you know products that kind of all
do the same thing it's nice to see
something may be thinking a little bit
outside the box but this next product
I'm very psyched about I'm sure you are
as well because finally there may be a
light at the end of the tunnel when it
comes to not looking like a damn fool
when wearing some sort of smart glass
technology yes and this is thanks to
carl zeiss the glassmaker lens maker
they've sort of been working on this
prototype this tech that will introduce
the ability to sort of see things in
glass in your glasses without like we
said looking goofy you know this giant
thing hanging off the right or left side
of your face like I do with Google glass
this is this is the idea that the frames
look normal and they've worked on the
lens so that when you do put computer
technology inside it'll just select the
screens floating in front of you now if
someone looks at you it looks like you
got like some on yours something's on
your glass sure they'll be like hey wash
that off yeah all right but but at least
you don't have like you know a giant
camera like definitely and I think and
yes they're not inventing the
the actual computing tech the short of
just saying hey here's this vessel we
could we figure out a way for it to be
displayed without a overbearing sort of
contraption right so when so in the the
glasses do become something that you
know is a little more common there there
there to rescue us on the fashion you
want you too hot on google glass right
yeah i mean you're like fun for the
moment but you're not really wearing
this thing all the time right ah so
here's something else that may make you
look a little crazy yeah speaking of
looking dorky the other direction this
is from Samsung um all right we talked a
lot about the fitness tracking stuff
that you wear on your wrist right on one
end they kind of went smart here this is
called tip talk and it's a traditional
strap that you add to or it's a wat it's
a strap you add to a traditional watch I
meant the same and they'll do your
fitness tracking but it takes phone
calls this is I had to take phone calls
I can't tell if this is cool or not to
take phone calls yeah you stick your
finger in your ear right and then and go
hello yeah kind of like some sort of get
smart situation here Sheamus actually
you could see a picture of him trying it
out he said in his review that he was in
a really loud conference center and it
was a little muffled but he could make
out and that's the cool thing like they
figure out a weight is it bone convince
not bone conduction but it is going
through your organ it's just Langer the
vibrations are just traveling through
your blood so your finger yeah that's
terrifying your finger is actually the
earpiece right which is crazy I think
that's just on you know by itself that
text kind of cool I mean it is something
out of out of a TV show of the past but
it was something ridiculous but you know
maybe gotta take a quick phone call I
said oh hello hello I mean I'm evil
people will still think you're crazy in
the supermarket well you see all those
like Secret Service guys always going
like you know I want to do that yeah
make you look important yeah be like
come again well you know and and they
say the target price is eighty dollars
so it's not so far out that you might
want to try it and not feel so bad on
over the top I think it's something we
may want to look out for right
Samsung has a few other things they've
been working on they've a whole division
of some strange wearable tech yeah and
and that got people's heads turning the
other day so how about a belt yeah how
about a smart belt it's not just a belt
it's called a welt so don't I don't
think you call your belt oh well all
right okay as long as you agree to go
with of your name you know so why is
this a smart belt though what does it do
well um it's tracking how many steps
like everything does because I need to
know how many steps I take all the time
right and how long you been sitting okay
and this is the part I don't really feel
comfortable with sitting is the new
smoking oh yeah well so they say yeah
and then they also tracks you're eating
and your waistline sighs sure so if you
ate a lot one day this belts gonna guilt
you and say if you keep eating like this
I won't fit you anymore pretty much
weight like you will gain two pounds in
a month yeah I don't need my belt
judging me ah there's enough judgment in
my life from other devices exactly
that's we're just entering an error of
judgment tech that's always but yeah I
guess it's something that someone out
there might find interesting this is
more of like a prototype situation we'll
have to see if there really is a demand
but there's one product I wanted to talk
about before we have to hit the brake
they have a samsung also has a smart
business suit okay with NFC technology
that's better selves in Korea for five
hundred dollars I but they want to like
expand it so you'll be able to share
your contact information by kind of
literally rubbing up against somebody
like I've seen the sleeve right and so
so it would be like hello Joe oh that's
your baby we just met like you're
obviously just meeting someone of your
exchanging information let's rub wrists
let's see how like just like that hey
see I feel violated but that's fine
there you have you'll never forget that
person's oh no yeah that's a
rememberable business also there's Patek
for women too if there's a purse okay
you know is it doesn't have that creepy
factor with you know rubbing purses or
something but it does have solar panels
on the sides called the soul bag purse
it doesn't years what i don't like about
it though like
kinda missed the perfect point aside
from looking like a honeycomb on the
front it doesn't store the power you
only get the power in real time it
charges your phone when your phones
inside of the purse so you're getting a
charge if you're laying out in the park
and you have direct sunlight oh that you
know you're getting like itty-bitty
charges that time that's a very specific
situation yeah I didn't have to look a
little a little cuter I don't ya ain't
no like I don't and function over
fashion I guess we going to the beach
but but you know I have a feeling that
the thought could be true cheap you know
early for hours right four hours of
charging yeah it can get four hours of
charging on a phone but once again you
got to be outside so you know also put
on that sun block while you're charging
for four hours interesting alright I
would like to check that out I don't
really they would maybe get me to go on
the Sun that's not really our expertise
