starts here
that's probably code for we never should
have killed off the Integra let's take a
look at Acuras new entry-level sporty
compacts today in the ILX and check the
tech okay let's get it out of the way
yes it's a glorified Civic that's
basically the platform underneath the
ILX
things are pretty familiar up front you
got the latest version of Acuras Mighty
Morphin Power Rangers breastplate on the
grill there and it's nice and handsome
through here then we get to this radical
new restyling this is a whole different
look for Acura in the rear quarter
reminds me an awful lot of that is
behind us to be honest now once you get
in the ILX you find a very familiar
acura cabin except for one thing you
can't get the crown jewel of car tech
these days a navigation system if you
get this 2.4 liter which has the
six-speed manual they think you're
buying some kind of a four-door track
car so you can't get the thing that you
do want now I like but don't love Honda
Acura as an average so I'm not shedding
too many tears I'm just gonna duct tape
my phone up there but you end up with
this roughly 5-inch Honda Civic display
that we like but it's a little bit of a
letdown what you do get in that display
though once you get over the fact that
you're gonna have to juggle your phone
is pretty good stuff all the audio
options that matter you got am/fm very
clear simple display as you can see XM
satellite radio is well done it does a
good job of locating channels quickly
and using the metadata well obviously an
optical disc slot right here and under
the aux button multiple presses are
going to bring you to bluetooth
streaming audio which you can see will
have meta tag information if you've got
it on your tracks
you've got Pandora support through an
iPhone only cable down here too it is
also a USB dongle and if you have any
kind of iPhone or iPod plugged in here
you'll get standard playback of its
music as well or Pandora now the phone
connection there's another interesting
wrinkle aside from Bluetooth hands-free
and bluetooth streaming like I showed
you you also get access to the text
messaging function of your phone
it's paired now these 6-speed 2.4 liter
cars have a premium package on them and
that means you're going to also get the
premium audio system which is six
speakers as well as a sub 360 watts
instead of 160 bass on this guy and a
rather elaborate backup camera which
gives you a whole bunch of different
views to the stern if you backed this
thing into something used a crappy
driver or a drunk you this is crunchy
when the moon roof is closed glance up
and get a nice shot of all these greasy
mechanicals not pretty makes it kind of
unique only one model has the 2.4 liter
inline 4 and it only comes with a
six-speed manual there are three 2-liter
fours and a couple of hybrids but this
one is kind of the unique track car if
you will which makes no damn sense at
all its four-door sedan for crying out
loud with front-wheel drive here the
numbers 201 horsepower 170 foot-pounds
of torque
0 to 60 is in the high sixes let's call
it 6-8 for a car that weighs twenty-nine
hundred to three thousand pounds mpg is
22:31 average it out at twenty-five now
driving this 2.4 liter ILX reminds you
why you don't want a 2-liter iox at
least that's my hunch I haven't driven
that model but this one has just the
right amount of power it's not
overwhelming but it's never got less and
the power comes on effortlessly I really
like that that's that responsive thing I
always look for now since you only have
a manual gearbox 6-speed available in
this car it better be a good one and the
clutch and the gearbox feel are quite
good the only downside is that typical
Honda habit of having rpm foot when you
put the clutch in I don't know if that's
an mpg preserving strategy or what part
of their programming that is but for the
way I Drive I hate it
in typical Honda fashion these motors
never run out of breath and this one
revs all the way to the let's see 70 100
rpm redline with
any pauses built like an ingot no
squeaks rattles or clunks which is more
than I can say for some more expensive
cars we've tested lately and the
handling is good although you're never
forgetting that's a front-wheel drive
car it's got the occasional dart and
pull of torque steer but when you've got
significant torque on the front end
that's going to happen
visibility is also quite good the way
they've got these pillars arranged and
the car is fairly quiet though with the
17-inch wheels we get on this trim level
which are an inch bigger than stock you
get a lower profile tire and more
drumming on California's crappy pavement
ride quality is also nice I mean the car
handles well but it's also not going to
be punishing you on your daily commute
okay let's price this guy out the 2.4
liter 6-speed is about 30 grand right on
the nose delivered and there's nothing
to add really if you want to go CNET
style you got to step down to a 2-liter
four then you can option up the thing
the gills but then you're going gutless
style also and the hybrid that's an
acquired taste so good luck with this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
