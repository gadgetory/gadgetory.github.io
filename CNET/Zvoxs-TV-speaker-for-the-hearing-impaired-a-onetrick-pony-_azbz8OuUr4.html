year it's for tiny TV sound bars the Z
Vox aqui voice AV 200 is a 250 dollar
speaker which is just 18 inches long but
it promises to make TV dialogue more
intelligible than ever before there's a
lot to like about this speaker the first
is the build quality it's solid aluminum
with a steel grill it's got a bright
orange display and buttons on the side
if you replace the remote it's got two
main inputs a 3.5 millimeter analog as
well as an optical port unfortunately
there's no Bluetooth it does have a
headphone out that also doubles as a
subwoofer output it's got a credit card
remote that you can use to set the Z box
up and then toss for your TV remote
judged as a sound bar it's actually not
that great though it's a little
expensive for what it does for example
it's pretty terrible playing music which
is what many people buying a sound bar
will want it to do it applies some
pretty heavy-handed compression to
everything which can make music sound
just weird
dialogue is what this TV speaker does
though I'm all some may find the a key
voice mode a little too piercing people
with advanced hearing loss may actually
prefer in the end 250 dollars is a lot
for a speaker of this type and there are
other options at the same price which
are for more balanced sound and better
features
