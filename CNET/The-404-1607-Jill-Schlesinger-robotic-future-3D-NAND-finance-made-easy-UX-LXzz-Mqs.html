welcome to the 404 show on this Friday
March 27th it's a special day in the 404
studio because believe it or not it's
the first time Jill Schlesinger
has been in studio on the audio only
version of the show welcome happy my
number one I can wear my glasses I'm
still clapping Thank You number two no
lipstick I did do my hair and put some
makeup on because I wasn't sure but I
don't have to put lipstick on you know
what that tells me Jill what's that
tells me you've been watching us for the
last you know we've both been I feel
like Jeff and I have crossed each
other's paths like but we've been around
one another right in the night kind of
like you were going into the building
but first so you come to the building
now where I am located yeah you're there
all the time mostly yeah and and and
he's on like at nine o'clock when you on
in the morning usually usually around
9:20 9:30 and I'm usually sort of
leaving the you know CBS this morning
yeah and you're coming in I see you
right before I leave my house on TV so
we are spending a lot of time together
and if you want to can consider that I
do I think that's its quality I love
seeing your face you and it's so great I
now I'm feeling bad because you know you
know what disinvite me over the building
and I will do that why don't we have him
come on you should have them come over
and give you the royal tour then I can
go I've seen your faces I miss your
faces too
you know I learned something about your
erstwhile co-host here now what's that
he's a recovering attorney yeah it's
kind of like oh that's why I like a
steady joke Bazaar on our show
I think it's amazing it just doesn't
come up because it doesn't make any
sense to talk about alrighty and I just
I could not disagree and I totally agree
with you Jeff you when did it come up in
the course for example like when I'm
telling you that I had to do this
segment tomorrow for CBS this morning
Mike yeah I wonder who's a lawyer and
you would say oh that's funny
I'm a lawyer you're like I come an
expired lawyer no no no you're a recover
I can thank you did you pass the bar yes
I did so that's it done that's a good
enough for me
and I practice a yeah in my book that
makes you a lawyer and me too when I say
retired I mean actually filed a form so
I no longer had to pay you're saying
that a lawyer being technical yeah
you're surprised by this yeah well I'm
just saying alright so you don't get
your badge in the mail every month or
whatever come on
got to get that card kept up to date or
whatever you don't need that card you
know I'm liking this studio it's a
little austere I mean black white grey
oh it's a lot nicer than it used to be
these are brand new you like these
little shotgun sound panels yeah they're
they're good for baffling all right
that's what they are they're Baffler I'm
baffled I am baptized of them I need
this in my second bedroom at home
because they told me at CBS radio that
I'm echoey a little bit I'm like hmm
that's gonna be a problem because this
is actually my apartment we could set
you up with a guy he or you could always
just do your hits with a blanket over
your head that's what I should probably
do it sounds crazy but it works and I've
done insanity and by the way I have done
that like I've been in a hotel room with
a microphone and feeding audio and it's
hysterical and and you know you do the
dope you say I was once in an air like
at an airline Club like the British
Airways club lounge I'm in the closet
with my coat over me and doing reading a
script it was hysterical it someone
walks in they're like oh excuse me yeah
speaking of breastfeeding oh god how did
I know we're gonna transition into that
just weeks away Oh nah I can't believe
you're a little baby Jill okay I know
I'm sorry
yeah well you know if you know it's so
weird because I feel like you know I'm
your aunt yes Stacy's water could break
any second oh it's so exciting
forgive me
so like lousy in this room yeah anything
happens well no it's exciting for you
I'm you know I'm in a weird place now
yeah and you're sympathetic where are
you right now I got a couple of weeks
before we really can't do on the tax day
okay and Jill loves that so great it's
like this beautiful cosmic coincidence
yeah I am I'm past the point of denial
which I which I was in for the most of
the third trimester just like the most
visible you're in denial
yeah I'd be like yeah I'm in straight-up
denial I don't even like that's net it's
never gonna happen
Stacey's just gonna look like she
swallowed a beach ball for the rest of
her life
okay and that's that I remember that
stage and now I'd say ever since March
first came around I've had like a
violent transition a march madness of
sorts yeah it was a it was a turbulent
sort of transition and now I'm I'm out
of the woods I'm on the other side of it
and I'm just simply in dad mode now I
don't know what it's like to be a father
but and I don't know if this is that
biological sort of knee-jerk instinctual
nesting phase that they talk so much
about in those fancy books but I'm
definitely feeling ready to be this
thing's care no parent what's a dad mode
to you maybe it's maybe it's a little
more emotional maybe it's you crying at
commercials with models you oh my god
hormones are wild how did she cry it
that was I was so trivial I mean forget
that Super Bowl was a rough Super Bowl
for everyone let alone if you had all
this estrogen and floating around I mean
this that Super Bowl killed people it
was so sad and depressing she can't
listen to that serial podcast because it
was too low I loved it it was great it
was fantastic I couldn't deal with it
right
definitely my my my sympathy my and all
my empathy is with her because she is
just ready to go yeah she can't even
like she can't even like sleep in our
bed anymore she's got to like go on our
couch recliner cuz it emulates like a
hospital bed yeah she's very young
where are you having this baby it like
you're not gonna do like a home birth
are you no I don't want to say where
where we are in a very very good
Hospital that's what I like yeah all
right all right you know what Stacy's
view on the drugs versus the tried
that's a great question that I'm not
sure if she wants me to talk about but I
will anyway no no it's not a big deal
she obviously here's my here's my take
on it I'll tell you what she thinks I'm
commuting she obviously wants to go in
naturally why obviously that is no not
obvious to mom I think it sounds like it
sounds horrible and I love the idea of
donde esta my me epidural right and I
get that but like when you learn about
the nitty-gritty graphic sort of details
you know Stacy's like oh I heard if you
don't get an epidural you get to like
walk around after and if you do get the
epidural you're kind of like you know
out of it you're kind of out of it for a
while how long is a while I don't know
to me it's like 10 hours of being wasted
it's like overnight and stuff it doesn't
so bad and look I can almost guarantee
you yes that if and when the time comes
where it's too much to bear
yes hopefully she hasn't gone past the
point where you can't do it yeah because
there is a point where that happened my
son that was a like she didn't want you
want to be natural entirely and she's
like I want the damn epidural no no we
can do that yeah that's the problem
that's why you got to go in and go you
know what go in the mindset that you
open to it Oh be open just tell her so
she's riding the fence I mean it's it's
God like I you know I I understand what
I'm going through right and that's
nothing compared to what she must be
that anticipation of it happening and
how dramatically violent and grass
the whole thing the whole ordeal must be
hmm it's just I don't know I have such
an endless amount of respect for the
female gender it is beyond race had a
child so I really don't shouldn't garner
your respect and that was in that way I
think I had a period for a long time by
the way embrace it
fYI for those of you counting at home
anyone wants to know by the way that's
good yeah this is the first time you had
a menstruation on your show that's what
I do I don't never but I don't know we
know of like that's what blows my mind
about women hell cosmically unfair the
whole game is if men actually had to
have a period every month first of all
they'd be like Oh nobody grabs and
they'd be like all like figuring out how
to help themselves and there would be
all sorts of directed dollars at finding
ways to manage your period better
instead it's women it's like a screw it
she'll have to deal with this see and
that you know call it whatever you want
evolution or just you know the just the
way things have sort of evolved right
where women seem to be much more
stronger when it comes to emotional and
biological pain and yes in general for
sure and I think just sort of the idea
of going through childbirth and I've had
I will say that again I never haven't
gone through it but you know watching my
sister go through it and have many
friends I I am in all of these women who
say I'm just gonna do natural because I
don't tell you something my sister
walked in there she's like drugs drugs
don't let's go yeah um and my in her
first child she had to have an emergency
c-section yeah not that I want to tell
you this story it's a little scary but
um it was wild because yeah you're going
into surgery yeah my brother-in-law does
not like blood Oh God
so he's in there and the bells and
ringing and bugging the bing ba-bing
they're like we gotta do a C sex
she pass out he came close he said he
barely held it together he he's like oh
my god I have to have to hold this
together for Kim because like this is my
wife and he said he got so lightheaded
he he they were like do you need
smelling salts he needs to sit down he's
like what do you mean he must have
gotten like why does a ghost always
intense thinking about that's making me
lightheaded yeah just because look the
odds are that she won't need it no she's
held all everything's good it doesn't
matter though there are so many things
and there's a lot of controversy like oh
you know there's no doubt that doctors
you know the number support that they do
seem to be doing them more awful yeah
and then legal ramification and and in
in my sister's case it was the it was a
screw-up I mean she was at a fancy house
well there was a screw-up but it was
funny because I will say one thing you
get one of those beautiful babies that
comes out from a c-section there's no
trauma
my niece Emily came out she looks like
it was an advertisement or I was so
gorgeous other to what to come out and I
was like the conical head I do love this
thing for some reason you know it's a
good thing gooey and gloppy just stuff
anyway jealous I also when am I gonna be
on the distribution list I just need to
be sure I just need to put me on the
list and so you registered or something
like yeah we're registered it's not
funny
get to do that all over again I did it
are done we did that yeah she had her
shower a couple weeks ago oh yeah juoh
the shower very rare I know a Jew with a
shower well so that's something that
doesn't happen yes I baby showers we
Jews usually don't have baby showers cuz
it's bad luck right which makes sense no
no it's like because it's not here yet
cuz he's putting the tears before the
horse I could see that in fact I
remember when my sister's first kid they
were oh my God my here is my sister
calling me right now so
no I keep it on speaker so we're just
talking about different words so so
anyway when we were she was had my
mother was so superstitious that they
ordered all the stuff for the baby but
they wouldn't let it in the house until
the baby was okay so where was this
always like they get delivery like when
the day she had like my mother would go
to Bloomingdale's and picked everything
up and but it was like that was how far
it went like oh I don't wanna have the
furniture in the house because it's like
in ihara like oh my god like we couldn't
we wouldn't want to like spook anybody
yeah the kid oh you've heard of that
expression ken ahora no it's basically
like you're going to jinx it okay
there's like a technicality in this too
if you buy the thing and you just
haven't picked it yes the calories on
jinxes you could be a technicality and
it's so much in Judaism like they're the
Orthodox people and they're like well if
we just put up these things over here it
don't wait then we can actually walk
around during the Sabbath and do
whatever we can use a laser can use
electric razors anything I'm not a very
well versed sort of theologists or
anything like that but do you think
Judaism has the most sort of wackadoo
superstition you know what's weird about
it is like so many of these things that
go back to the Old Testament and we're
gonna get some hate mail on this let's
just be Shirley right now it's funny
because I know we have like a couple
actual rabbis right remember last time
we did this and we were talking about
like the rabbi's yeah you've got a lot
of hate on that but what's funny is like
you read the like well why are you
keeping kosher because it was really was
a health thing right it was it was
basically before the inception of so
bright so you know our aunt and I are
like nutrition or anything and like
siphons and stuff I don't usually say
things like cloven hooves right like
those are not things that usually come
out of our anyway
I love the people who are like I'm
kosher in my house only but I go out and
have Chinese out pork outside the house
all about double bacon cheeseburger I
will indeed with a glass of milk thanks
very much uh I think it's great if you
want to do it go do it you know whatever
it's fine it's just leave me alone
exactly
I feel like going out with my friends
who are vegan yeah oh sure you know as
for your vegetarian or vegan go crazy
but like don't be telling me where I can
and can't go to dinner like it's so I
was out to dinner recently and someone's
like one of my friends vegetarian she
she's so good she never cares like what
don't worry I'll find something to eat
then with other people saying well you
know she doesn't need to do this so we
got to go to this kind of restaurant I'm
not gonna macrobiotic boring restaurant
where everything food off-white what
else is on your mind today you saying
good bye loving your headphones
oh thanks what is about that what what
do I got here what we saw Ultimate Ears
yeah 10 V eyes you know that I have all
sorts of headphone Envy because I've
gone through so many and I don't even
ask Justin anymore to get me headphones
was a because I feel like he let my cat
Nuge because I can don't want to just
say oh I need to know yet another set of
headphones I think he'd he'd be happy to
do that really I didn't try that printer
my printers printing look at this so so
you know when the printer just has like
you know candy cane red stripe
horizontally think I know what is that
it's saying don't it's saying don't wise
using a black and white in red exactly
and what is happening it's like turning
against you clearly like what you should
just get and you imagine you you print
out stuff enough you should just get the
laser well I really should what am I
gonna do with a lot of ink I'm gonna be
porked with all that ink god damn ever
need to get another cartridge you know
what my my nephew works at by marriage
my nephew by marriage works a canon so I
figure he can hook me up with something
good right lots of things we can all of
your possessions are just the series of
fancy connections that you've made are
my printer is because of Justin's like
just buy it it's $100 I might put the
inks expensive he's like the ink is
always expensive so that's how it works
what else is on your mind today um well
yeah that was that was quite the intro
there and I was traumatic I had to
collect myself do you want to breathe
later
speaking of that I did baby CPR last
night totally creepy
I took its yeah so right into that
that's weird
well no because they encouraged all all
yeah types of people to take the class I
mean the shoulder-blades it's almost
like it seems like it's a giant prank
you have to do that yeah I don't have
done this on your son no no I mean the
training okay he's like four and a half
I'm looks like I just run yourself in oh
yeah just cough it up Junior my kid what
are you doing um so yeah all the baby
stuff and all that other junk aside it
just you know it's a it's a it's a time
of great you know I don't know pressure
and training sanity and transitory joy
Mitzvah I'm wet I'm ready for the joy to
kick in that's yet to show toys that's I
feel like I'm someone told me.there day
you're gonna be pleasantly joyed like I
think so I was like all right I'll sort
of put that in my back pocket I think
joy is good you got your car all decked
out with the seat in the back already
oh yeah it's all done by the bike car
seats now yeah I'm so painfully easy to
install guys that's the one thing I've
really come to love every little piece
of baby all that shit is so idiot-proof
it's like timeout we're allowed to say
shit on the air here yeah you could say
shit you'll notice you'll really get to
notice the serial numbers that are
prominently labeled everywhere because
every time as you recall and you see it
on the news in the morning like did we
buy that crack out there right up in
front and center now yeah so much easier
for cribs and everything else makes
sense so you're gonna run in and you'll
find out yeah yeah a crib in Seoul says
it's done we're done I mean tell me
about how your parents are doing I have
because I love them so much and I just
want it like I feel like my heart is
swelling with just like happiness for
them they must be so excited yeah I mean
this is the first grandchild on both
side no oh no Stacy we I have we have
two nieces right so it's their first
grandson mm-hmm
yeah it's my parents first Krank
the prince you know it's interesting cuz
I see like my mom you know my dad's
definitely say but I see my mom is just
she just can't handle the the joy why no
it's good it's all good
what is it behavior like what does that
mean can't handle the joy is she's like
so happy that she's breaking shit no
she's like she just can't stop smiling
every time I see what are they gonna be
called grandma grandpa and Stacy's
parents they do the Bobby ins anything
you know about that Bobby and Sadie that
bubby woman that says a t-pod like
grandpa no yes I I don't I never I
didn't have them what did you have I had
I'd grandma and grandpa both sides times
- aha I did have like nicknames that
were like part like proprietary
nicknames for the family not like is
bubbie and Zayde ii we had like grandpa
bozo okay and grandma sweetheart
grandmas sweetheart so it was the other
grandma no love loss knowing about a
nickname means something no it's just I
don't know what mom gotta be your
parents mother's parents was my brother
and I saw that side maybe more often and
we just might we thought my grandfather
was a clown so we called them bozo I
love this and then the my grandma would
always say sweetheart a lot so we just
started calling so wait a minute your
your mother is gonna be grandma sue or
Susan I don't know how that works
you're gonna she's gonna have to pick
yeah
Gramp grandma sue grandma's big sense of
granite and Grandpa Lou let me just say
this that my mother was your mother's
also very young as a grandmother but yes
she's yeah my mother was 52 holy moly
yeah 52 once where my sister had a baby
okay
and we called our grandparents Nana and
poppy which is like very old-fashioned
yeah and as a result my mother's like
I'm not a Nana yeah I don't think so
so my brother-in-law's mother's like
my grandma Linda that's perfect some
what does my mother say they can just
call me sue
so my nieces and nephew call her sue
Susan and they don't call her grandma
like it's like grandma Linda and so I
think that's cool
and my father's like I'll be pop yeah
pop pop pops nice mm-hmm
I maybe I'll try and do pop for my dad
Pop's kind of cool yeah I never got the
good apostle you got to have the idea of
what can the kid pronounce because you
say this is the way it is it pops pretty
easy right or Papa one of those things
that's pretty good yeah like what about
I always find it interesting when the
you know Johnny has two moms and they're
like mom and mommy or when with a halt
so some of my lesbian friends who have
kids it's a very interesting I'm like
who's mom or they both they're probably
how would you call them in the house
that's the problem because you have to
have like a way to differentiate hmm is
that wild don't say you know Jackie's an
identical twin Yeah right
and her sisters kids because they were
really identical beast-core
aunt mommy mommy I mean like this is so
huge I feel like all I want to do is
talk to you about this but I know we
have that we have like a whole story I
want to get your story so all right and
and this definitely emanates from can
everyone tell us cocktail hour and we're
getting wasted right now oh wait just
kidding we're not we've heard you've
done that here all bets are off so
thinking about my son and you know
what's gonna be happening when he's 18
like really even go to college will
there be college first of all of course
he's going to college you don't know
that yes I do
yeah I don't know if you can see I'm on
your side Jeff are you saying that he
will he Michael he might do online
learning or or or some sort of you know
it's like an on high bridge like robot
teacher sort of online thing I'm telling
yeah I saw that I watched this video
over the weekend you can trust anything
online you know no but this is not this
was not pulled out of someone's you know
boys later attacked advice exactly
online this was this was legit this was
a well researched and evidenced sort of
video called humans need not apply
have you ever ever heard of that no but
I'm intrigued okay so there it talks it
makes it very easy to understand analogy
about where humans and jobs and where
we're going in the next you know 30 40
50 years it's by this this person called
CGP grey and why they're three initials
I don't know that is annoying already
don't worry about that okay he has a
series of videos in informational
instructional sort of almost in like a
NatGeo documentary style online at it
and this documentary is specifically
about how a lot of jobs that currently
exist in the world are going away are
just not even they are 100% going away
and there's really nothing we can do
about it a lot of these jobs include
transportation like you know 20 years
from now I'm not gonna be a guy behind
the bus that's gonna be driving itself
maybe that would be better frankly after
why they're doing it like and I'm not
even sure little Jeff jr. is ever gonna
get a driver's license because he
doesn't need it because it's driverless
because this car is gonna drive is that
weird to you to think about that well no
but when you eliminate human drivers you
eliminate 4 million jobs in the country
hmm okay interesting
so you command this is excuse me has
your father feel about that we don't
want to look he's gonna retire soon all
right
so he'll retire I'm worried about him me
too but he'll retire before all this is
okay
okay Google is all they already have a
perfectly self-driving car right it's
already here right there's not like oh
is the good new work we do right oh it's
here it works fine it doesn't go a
hundred miles down the an hour down the
highway just yet right well what is the
speed that it can go right now the
fastest is thirty miles an hour and I
just
I need to hop around town I mean if
lemon is 20 in Manhattan or 25 wait
you're getting around just fine it seems
like that stuff won't go away because
you're gonna need an override like just
like we learned CPR right certain things
like okay you're gonna have to be able
of gorgeous of course I'm like so I
think he's gonna get a license no matter
what maybe but I'll give you but do you
need a license for like this annual
override button button fine you're right
there's always one guy at CVS who
oversees all of the robotic cashier
there's gotta be a bus driver too in
case somebody's too rowdy on the bus to
throw you out and we're not even fine
put that aside for a second not even
talking about the driverless aspect and
how we won't drive cars anymore talk
about the fact that we don't need truck
drivers and bus drivers and all these
millions and millions of people right
who make a living doing that think about
the custodial sort of well that also
mean that people will not may be in
better moods because they will not be
stuck in traffic jams
you know potentially that if you could
really create a flow of traffic right
although if there's just too many
driverless cars on the road there's
gonna be traffic je5 interest I mean
these are all interesting sort of
prospect and byproducts of what will and
can happen when this starts to actually
take place but what I'm really concerned
about and concentrating on is the
percentage of people whose jobs that's
just called creative destruction right
no but because why because there will be
new jobs that will be created and there
will be gaps that will need to be filled
in you think you think the four million
jobs isn't that many all right but
that's not just it during the Great
Depression yes the unemployment rate was
25% okay if you factor in what this
robotic revolution will do to the
workforce unemployment could be 45%
there's no way all right
I'm telling you now right I'm telling
you no way right because they said that
about the technology revolution okay
they said that that you know what
there's gonna be all these jobs and
they're gonna be gone and now are we're
sending all these jobs overseas and you
know what the unemployment rate right
now 25 years into the technology
revolution is
five and a half percent but there's
still people behind all but there's
people behind a lot of things it's just
that there are certain parts of the
economy where you knew you're going to
need people and then when the things
that are eliminated you don't need
people you know nature abhors a void so
does the workforce and there are things
that there are things that are created
there are jobs today that didn't exist
25 years think about that
I mean robots are in like car
manufacturing plants that was originally
idea right there's every humans gonna be
out of a job
no one's gonna be someone's got to build
those are exactly to maintain them there
is one person overseeing a lot more
robots but again like everything so the
and look I'm not saying this guy is 100
percent correct a little bit of a dark
cloud over your kids future we know
we're all might need to be a bus driver
I'm know my picture like I'm not worried
about Jeff jr. I'm work because I will
be alive when he enters the workforce
hopefully and you you for me it's like
what like you said big-picture stuff
the analogy he used was like oh if two
horses in 1895 we're talking to each
other right and then like you know
they're like man life's pretty good we
got a great job right it's awesome right
and then like 20 years go by and they're
like Oh what do you think of this like
motorized one of us you know that was
the that was you know you have to watch
the video all right should be so happy
to not have to be like enslaved and be
like you know we can do other stuff with
what money and what like but you know
that's as simple as saying you know the
the railroad industry is to be so huge
right and they said well you know the
what what happened and things change or
you know I was a buggy whip manufacturer
I was the best one and you know what
like there's still something called
transportation and their needs and I I
am very look you know me I can be very
cynical about these things but I am
always encouraging and when I look at
market cycles and I look at predictions
and what I'm always amazed at is how
wrong we are because if I said to you
five years ago in the middle of the
recession you know what a few things
have to happen just to like get us
beyond that and they're impossible in a
real dark place yeah and I was just like
you know like there's got to be like
some miracles some rabbits have to
come out of a hatch and guess what they
did they did you would show up to the
studio looking like you came from a
funeral like wearing a black man I was
wearing like the little black ribbon
sitting Shiva for the economy constantly
I was always scared you know what
because no tomorrow early on I'll tell
you what happened I knew it was gonna be
way worse than other people were saying
and then as we came into the recovery
I'm not saying everything's better we're
not done yet it's just because the
bubble was so massive and seemingly
insurmountable it was pretty scary to
lose so many jobs in one you know
18-month period but that said you know a
lot of things have happened like if you
told me 18 months ago that oil was gonna
be 50 bucks a barrel I'd say on what
planet how's that but isn't that
misleading just because there's so much
of a surplus like well what do you mean
what's misleading well I'm just saying
surplus made the price go down right but
I don't know like it's not misleading
it's real so you see him in it's just
I'm not someone who who's like a
conspiracy theory oh great okay here we
go but like it felt like and obviously
this is just coincidental
but just as like Tesla and all these
awesome electric car companies and
technologies are advancing to the point
where it's like it's very clear that in
10 years most cars will be electric
right and then all of a sudden like gas
is free basically well I think it's I
think what's interesting about it is not
so much that part of the course but I'll
tell you what you you noticed that right
yeah but what I actually noticed more
was wow the Saudis are not changing
their production what's going on so my
conspiracy theory is the Saudis are
putting it to the Russians like they are
pissed something happened there between
them they don't like where money's going
something's going on because normally if
you have oversupply what would happen
the Saudis would be like you know what
we're cutting back I'm gonna make us
we're not gonna make Saudis like screw
it we're pumping we're keeping this
going and what was so fascinating is
that it really did you know cripple
a lot of the not you know I'm not happy
about it for like you know some
countries that like Nigeria needs their
energy industry right but I'm but they
were sort of like this sort of smile on
everyone's face like Putin not so not so
hot now are you yeah and and so I think
it's been interesting but I will say
that in your analysis of concern about
the future there I'm old enough sunny to
tell you that there have been times
where people will say to me like oh the
manufacturing industry is dead and this
is going to be the devise and these and
and and new things happen I do think
that the critical issue that we face in
this country from an economic standpoint
is that the middle class is stuck it's
stuck when it's it's actually that's an
issue that no one really wants to deal
with and you know politicians talk the
talk but they don't want to do anything
and we need to really take a good long
hard look at education and we need to
look at how come our kids are coming out
and saying you know well I don't really
know I don't want to go into that part
of the economy that's growing what do
you do with that kid and is that kid
gonna live as well as his parents or her
parents maybe not well I think a lot see
and this goes back to what I'm talking
about
there's been some sort of like you know
trend with with people and workforce
like some jobs are just no one wants to
do them anymore they've become D glamour
and and by the way when you want the
people who do them you know where
they're who populates many of those jobs
that are not so high-paying
unfortunately women so the wage gap
between men and women which happens by
the way in every single industry yeah
including nurses where men are only 8%
of the were nursing workforce and men
are still getting paid more who are
there but many of the lower wage jobs
often have flexibility and they have
consistency and women who want to
actually have a life with
kids and try to co-parent and do take on
more responsibility we'll say the
trade-offs fine with me you know and so
part of the wage gap and we've had a lot
of information out about wage gap
between men and women part of it is that
women are opting for other professions
women are opting for flexibility and
when someone says to me well how do we
fix that I mean what am I going to say
look we need a really a much better
maternity policy in this country we need
a much better childcare system like we
can't even pay for the health care
system like health costs aren't going
down so it's not like if you compare
other developed economies with the
United States we've got like the worst
policies amazing we're the largest
economy in the world and you know you
look at like northern Europe they have
the most unbelievable policies peope
you're like a year off it's it's awesome
you know and music you put a blue could
be I don't have kids what am I gonna get
it's aunt aunt holiday but but you but
if anything that just speaks to how
crucial of an issue it is it's just it's
so I don't know it's so that I can get
depressed about but I don't want you to
get too depressed I feel like that I
feel like it's I know what it must sound
like like the one line cake away is like
Jeff's freaking out about a robot future
you know I don't think I think that what
you you can I think that to
counterbalance that is to remember what
didn't exist 20 years ago of course
that's the man that makes me think that
this is almost a certainty well look at
all that let's look at all the people
that are employed by say the five top
technology companies alright but I mean
the way I look at it is like basically
the stock market is just a bunch of
robots trading money back and forth
right you calling me a robot feelings
don't most day trading robot doesn't all
that yeah us being like oh the prices
that I have to but what we learned in
the crisis is that the algorithms are
run by human beings and the blank hits
the fan why Jeff why do you still do a
50s robot voice like from like oh I
gotta do this it's a it well how do you
still hear that engrained no
jettisons yeah I don't know doing that a
lot of you just happen I was watching a
lot of Twilight Zone while I was sick
last week yeah I'm like every robot
sounds like that well I watch a lot of
toilets you watch just total
non-sequitur have you seen this show
black mirror
have we seen I've seen it watch the
whole thing you guys set me up you said
wow that thing like two episodes were
awesome okay the only one I like the
rewarding one yeah I thought that would
we you and I felt like that was so real
yeah yeah so you're wrong it's excellent
it's like I'm saying it was overhyped
the thing is if you go and go it's okay
it's really I didn't okay so this is
them are amazing all right
but there's only seven of them yeah but
if to widest I know I'd say four out of
seven RMS so here's a funny so I
happened upon it which is just shows you
how disconnected because whatever I read
something like you know Emily Nussbaum
who's my absolute favorite TV critic
she's a true creator of The New Yorker
mentioned it yeah and in like a sort of
a side thing like this is a cool thing
check it out you old farts yeah kind of
right right you want to want to stay hip
with the young people she's fabulous and
I watched an episode like you know Jack
he was away driving in London or
something and I started watching and I
got so in just yeah yeah I like that
did you see it a Christmas special with
Jon Hamm yeah okay well then by the way
next month Sons of Anarchy last season
is on Netflix I took a break after watch
me i binge watch the first six and I
waited I'm with you on that basically I
think I'm like one or two episodes into
the seventh season I'm waiting for it to
show up in a couple of weeks so and it's
on Netflix in a few weeks I mean so yeah
I know you're not that into it now I
didn't turn on it I just didn't mind it
going away what about justified I've
heard nothing but great oh yeah yeah I
watched the first season yeah I loved
Timothy Olyphant obviously Walton
Goggins he's a great actor teeth yeah
totally
we gotta do some questions beacon of
Kurt Sutter though real quick
yes he
you wrote mrs. katey sagal yes he wrote
the new Jake Gyllenhaal movie called
southpaw oh where the trailer just came
out today for and Jake Gyllenhaal's like
the most jacked he's ever been he's a
box that you know I don't know I'm like
shockingly uninterested in the storyline
but it looks like it's gonna be good
boxing a turn-off for me
I think boxing is so colossally stupid
if you watch Rocky yeah you're stupid I
hate boxing I don't know raging bulls
different cuz it's not just a boxing
movie the way south ball does seem to be
more than just a boxing because it's
really not about boxing it's about what
happens to this boxer hmm but that
instantly turns me off the boxing's
rough my friend is a dentist and he's an
MD DDS yeah he is a ring doctor oh and
he said come with me and I said oh my
god I so don't want to come with you
like a condom and work for a dentist is
that unbelievable yeah and you know he
has to call fights like guys have like
he's like he literally is like you know
people are like concussed and they're
like I'm fine I'm fine I'm fine he's
like uh no no you're not you're done
because you're not saying I'm fine
you're saying you laugh but that's scary
as shit there was a do to my hockey team
who got hit and was concussed and he
thought he was fine and we asked we're
asking him questions and he's just not
we're like what day is it he's like tuna
fish and were like so let me ask you one
last question before we do some tax
stuff okay
and there was one other that more tech
stuff but it's amazing and all right do
it
question uh I just wanted to know it's a
television question you know it's fine
um did Stacy make you watch Downton
Abbey no sure we don't watch okay
religion because that might be something
you may want to take up when you're like
in the middle of the night and the kids
nursing and crying like you can
have to find something gentle yeah yeah
that's maybe too gentle do you know what
I mean like soothing a shock you because
you like jumping is that problem is
funny because I do plan on watching
Fargo the FX yeah yeah yeah so that's
probably not gentle but I am I am
soothed by violence by the what do you
want this kid to see I'm winning
everything when he's two weeks old you
know what I've been watching I have to
do my own soothing like I like there too
many times like where I couldn't watch
the shield late at night because I would
get really uptight about it I couldn't
get to sleep
now I come on all these British series
that are basically like BBC series that
re-aired they're like the most gent
I fall asleep and I've got this one now
the foils war it's you know it takes
place during World War two so British
and I thought it's like an hour and a
half fall asleep 20 minutes in pick it
up with next night whatever and it's
just nice and it soothes as lullaby to
you it kind of is it's sort of like
baseball tonight they're all like in bed
I don't know I'm a Downton fan but you
know I'm an old are what's your
technology so this this is really cool
and I came across it today and we
covered it in the update and I'm blown
away because I love gigantic leaps in
technology and this is something that's
happening now and will change the way is
it something that's gonna replace the
8-track tape oh you have no idea replace
many I could replace many so the way
flash memory okay so that's like what
I'm holding here is a USB stick what's
in your phone SD cards mini SD
solid-state drives a lot of that
technologies flash technology all of it
is rather than flash technology and the
way that technology was built up until
fit right now is is called NAND NAMD
architecture and that's basically how
memory cells are printed on on a chip is
like the best way to explain it
okay so right now the most we can do
I think there's four terabyte SSDs that
just started showing up I think I don't
like that are like $2,500 you can
actually get a one terabyte SSD you know
what a terabyte is right yeah like
you're I'm like you're with me right I'm
with you um you can get one of those
maybe for like 500 bucks now mmm paying
like 50 cents a gigabyte okay what 3d
NAND technology does is it stacks the
memory cells on the chip like floors in
a skyscraper okay so what that lets you
do is keep the same form factor but
quadruple quintuple and beyond the
amount of memory you could fit so
they're talking about being able to
build a 3.5 terabyte drive the size of a
stick of gum Wow which is amazing well
one big as the stick of gum this is like
a trident which is really awesome or is
it like a juicy fruit that's huge
no it's not just growing and it's like a
millimeter thick it's amazing so imagine
imagine terabytes three-and-a-half so
imagine your phone in your phone three
terabyte like so in that respect this
phone this iPhone six that I'm holding
would it be thinner or lighter I think
no change I think it'd be thicker
because what you would do is that
circuit board that's in there has
everything including the the C gonna be
thicker
it could be figured by millimeter okay
will never do but it would hold three
terabytes and what does it hold now I
don't know which one you have max 128
128 gigabytes all right a what factor of
that's amazing you're talking about 3500
gigabytes to 128 only how many songs can
I have on here how many photos every
song ever made in the history of music
how much how much Islander porn can I
pull out here it's just unbelievable so
we're we're basically on the precipice
precipice of a gigantic leap forward in
solid-state drive technology it's
excited to the point where they're
talking about like 10 terabyte drives so
sweet that like I see you excited by
this is you know like she's very cool
you take millions and millions of photos
like here's the thing right don't share
those please like here's the thing which
is amazing because this is
a recent right so I bought an ass which
is a network attached storage it's a
it's a little cube that has a bunch of
hard drives inside of it why'd you do
that he'll like I was not bad so I have
this backup so I could put all my photos
it's my personal cloud that's a good way
to think about it I have all my movies
ripped to it I have everything I want
rip to it can you do that for me okay
continue it's another project but we can
get to it call me in six months when
you're up at night every couple hours
you need something to do yeah right so
we'll figure it out perfect so now that
I'm thinking about oh I'll have a hard
drive that has twice the amount of
storage that my Nass has where there's
physical moving parts and it's powered
and it's ugly and it's loud hi now I
just replace this with like a stick of
gum
that's pretty awesome that's good you're
gonna want like that cubes to still be
there with lots of sticks ago it's like
the neverending quest so it's a
zettabyte is after a terabyte I don't
know don't like it I would do something
except my internet connection is not
working in a thousand it's a petabyte
okay oh and then exabyte is a thousand
terabytes petabytes sounds like
pedophile I don't like that well no it's
got the next GE ta not PDA PETA we
should just adopt the British
pronunciation a pedophile anyway if
you're I'm excited that I'm so excited
to be here really it's just I really
have to say that because it's like been
a very long time because when was the
last time I was here in January or in
December in December when you had your
anniversary December December because we
went audio-only in general is your first
audio show so it's so great to be here
no I know we we wanted to make this
happen for a while but you know we're
only doing it once a week now
you know what happens when you become a
big shot right that's exactly let's bang
out some tax questions all right
terabyte obviously miss they used to
calm that was my rap name really terror
but ever bite oh my god that's awesome
old 4:04 joke they're mad about joke
it's even funnier yeah that's the
problem very good okay cuz Shoom
we are we've been mispronouncing all
these handles it's kind of fun okay oh
this from our subreddit thanks for
submitting everybody first please tell
Jill she's awesome
Jill seems to often give the advice of
using a target date fund in a 401k when
starting to invest at what dollar amount
does she generally recommend moving to
index phone it's a great question so a
target date fund has some really
terrific qualities which is you know you
can just put small dollars in you can
accumulate money and it's supposed to be
targeting the date of your retirement
like on a glide path right you got your
starts to go down it really sort of
retirement you take less risk and what's
interesting about these funds is that
actually they can be a bit riskier than
people realize they can so you should
check and in your plan you should be
looking at they say the 2050 fund okay
you might look at it and say wow is 95
percent stocks that's a little bit scary
to me even though I'm supposed to retire
in 2050 I think I'll use the 2030 fund
because it's more in line with kind of
Who I am now that said they can be
expensive they can be more expensive
than using index funds but I would say
that until you have probably about 25
grand I would just stick to it because
put it in there get some money
accumulated then take your 25 grand and
buy some index funds a couple not a ton
you can add more funds as the dollar
amount goes up but I thought you can't
touch the money you can reallocate it we
have a I'm sure it's in your account
no not so 401k can transfer to anything
yeah you can put whatever you want
inside what your plan choices right so
whatever is a
available to you all right good question
the PVD is interested in high-level
differences for 401k versus Roth 401k
versus Roth brilliant
so Roth versus traditional just think
about that for a second Roth means
you're gonna take an after-tax dollar
and you're gonna save it for retirement
so I make a dollar I pay the tax on it I
got 75 cents I put the 75 cents in a
retirement account and it grows and it
grows and it grows and it grows right
I'm fifty nine and a half I'm ready to
take my money out there's no tax due
when I take the money out of the account
so it's tax up front
tax up front but no tax later when you
take it out traditional IRA you put the
money in today you get a tax deduction
it grows without any tax you're 59 and a
half or 65 or 70 you take the money out
it's taxed at whatever your tax bracket
is at that time taxed you on the way out
so in many cases for younger people we
love to suggest a Roth because chances
are you're going to make more money as
you get older your lower tax bracket
today pay the tax today put that money
to work it grows it grows it grows it
grows when you take it out no tax - it's
kind of awesome
and I think just the trajectory of tax
law and changes that could occur really
would suggest that tax rates will likely
go up in the future not go down just for
everybody okay the difference between a
roth 401 k and a regular 401 K is some
employers give you the option of
deferring money and putting it into a
Roth so you pay tax and they just put it
into the Roth 401 K versus a traditional
401k the only reason to do the
traditional instead of the Roth if
especially if you're say under 35 is
that maybe the employer only matches on
the actual traditional 401 K so always
get your match right always get your
match wherever you can get that I like
the Roth a lot I mean you can even
convert an old plan into a Roth it's
just that you have to pay the taxes to
do that okay but I think they're great
they really are I have a friend who's
like a big-time geeky accountant who
thinks that the more money you can put
into a Roth better you're gonna be
because you'd know what you're
tax liability is today you don't know
what it's going to be in the future
right in that unknown is fun getting the
Chatham or chat ham ham ham
it was a chat ham chat ham from from the
Cape Chatham why is it recommended that
a person max out the Steel's we were
just talking about max out their 401k
before investing in other options and
then does the tax deferred growth and
lower taxable income really outweigh the
higher expenses that typically accompany
401k plans well first of all if you have
a shitty excuse me know if you have a
crappy 401k plan at work you should like
get together and complain and by the way
there's like lawsuits now yeah that are
coming up that people are saying you
know what this plan is so awful put some
index funds in it that said a 401 the
reason why 401 k's works so well is that
they're automatic it is so much easier
to say the weight comes out of your
checking you out of your account now you
should if you are super disciplined and
you don't have a match at work and you
have a very expensive plan and you can
only put away $5,000 a year than shirred
or Roth but the biggest advantage of a
regular 401 K so you can put more money
away right so you can a lot of people
are kind of missing this whole idea like
you could put 18 grand into a 401 K
pre-tax you can only put 5,500 into a
Roth so if you've got big money to save
that's why people are using their 401 K
s-- by the way if you're self-employed
and you want you to put in your own 401
k plan for yourself fifty two thousand
dollars you can defer hello good deal
yeah they said basically I'm just
annoyed having to pay higher fees for
fewer options you know what if the
options stink then just find the
cheapest option in the plan and use it
to the extent that you can or grab the
match and then you can do a Roth of
Vanguard or fidelity or Schwab or you
can be a merry trade where you can get
some cheap index I mean it's just
there's and whenever I meet someone a
little older perhaps talking about
retirement and stuff like that
the first thing they always say is like
man do I regret I know I'm doing a 401 K
when I was your age so check this out
I'm doing I
pitched a piece for evening news and I
hope it gets on air Monday night and
there's some great data on the savings
habits of Millennials hmm oh you are
what it's negative right
no no changed very dramatically because
I remember you you did a piece recently
on CTM right and so what's happened is
then what has now happened is that of
that age group Millennials so which are
1980s issue which yes one from 1880 to
2000 or something okay so that
generation has become really good savers
hmm
better than baby boomers Wow and I think
it's because of their experience of kind
of like growing up and seeing some bad
times you know baby boomers really had
it good in terms of the economy right in
for much of their lives
and they got a little fat dumb and happy
so the savings rates are off the wall
great for Millennials their investing is
terrible because they're all freaked out
about the market they don't trust
anything so it's it's so it's like a
very relationship it's just an
interesting paradox and they'll get over
it but it takes a while that's why we
talk about children of the depression if
I look at like my in-laws they bought
CDs and savings bonds that was it they
didn't trust anything because you lived
through something that horrible all you
want is safety right it's just above
putting it under the mattress
exactly maybe luckily for them they call
it a nice bond market rally but I mean
it's amazing that's crazy
and it generationally it does start to
change quite dramatically depending on
when the economy what the economy was
doing upon your graduation so we think
we'll be okay you're gonna be great you
got me yeah that's true SOS says number
one aunt Jill is so awesome all the time
oh yeah we're gonna do it more often
number two for some reason the payment
on my fixed mortgage is going up Oh bro
weirdness oh because your property taxes
probably went up I went through these Oh
same thing anyway is it so good time to
refine yeah it's awesome
yes yeah no we got you you've got like
the cheapest mortgage ever yeah but I
feel like ever I feel like there's the
cheaper stuff
what's your you have a 30-year fixed and
one green a quarter no what is four four
one mm it's for now
yeah it's maybe you could check 3/8 for
you know you can ship you're gonna move
anyway I guess so
don't do it what about Ann I see the one
thing I wonder maybe this is like an
affair very specific to me yeah but what
can you tell me about arm stuff arms are
great but you cannot use an arm if you
are gonna stay in a place for a long
time so if you're gonna buy a house
neighborhood on the scum of the
neighborhood's your box
yeah that's your stop that's my stuff oh
you're on 72nd don't say it so the arm
so for that question is it's I'm
guessing your property taxes went up
right but the thing that sucks
so your taxes go up yes and then there's
like an escrow shortage because of that
right and then you gotta so they double
charge you to make up the show what you
should try to do is to see if you can
pay your property taxes directly and not
have the mess correct yeah but even if
you the money it's not a less amount of
money no but it gives you more control
over that process like it's a separate
bill yeah right ever and that some
people don't like it but I just don't
want I never trust that the mortgage
company is really gonna do it
I don't know yeah so anyway so that's
probably what happened my three you have
gone oh poor you you make too much money
no it's not no it's the property tax not
nice well then you got to move anyway
and you're gonna move to a high tax
place anyway cuz you want to be as bad
as Hoboken well can someone you look in
Short Hills of course it will no way am
I going there just make it easy anyway
when you like your house we're gonna
talk to will talk about it all right
your pain SOS it sucks there's nothing
you can do unfortunately it's just you
can get a reassessment time that's true
but I wouldn't do it right now frankly
because I have like 30 days to do well
no but you also have to figure out what
your assessment was because that
assessment could be up or down alright
so they usually send you like a postcard
in the mail which I got them like
there's no way my house is worth that
and then we've lo and behold it was yeah
okay this is a great name
tasty lentil tacos tasty lentil tacos
yeah awesome to see Jill back on the
show my question is saving for
retirement or paying down student debt
great I graduated five years ago and I
make 55 K a year that's going up around
two to five percent a year I work at a
small company and the only benefit
offered is free health care there's no
401 K I'd like to start saving however I
still have around 25 grand of student
loan debt and I have to pay that down so
what do I do the debt or retirement on
so if you had a 401 K and there was a
match what I would say to you is put
money away up to cut some of the match
but they got none of it but they don't
have that so now what I'm gonna tell you
is it depends on the rate of the
interest the interest rate on the
student loan let's presume that you've
got some nice student loans that are
government subsidy federally subsidized
why don't we do this why don't we see I
mean you're making fifty five grand
you're making your payment's it's great
to pay down your note why don't you try
to put a hundred bucks a month into a
Roth IRA and do and continue but that's
it just a hundred bucks a month so you
get like start building that habit up so
you're not saying they should go ahead
and pay more of the principal down on
the student debt well I think that he's
once it sounds to me like he or she
wants to establish a pattern of saving
which I do think is important I mean
it's like a good behavior to kind of
ingrain and if your interest is more
than say five or six percent then you
really should just try to crank on that
and pay as much as possible mmm that's
that to me is an important fact so you
know the big three I always say is you
paid
your debt consumer debt student loan
debt is not as bad
you have your emergency reserve 6 or 12
months and you start putting money into
retirement those are the three things
that we want people to really see always
tell Charlie Rose right that Charlie
needs that also I'm sure I'm sure he's
in serious yeah you have time are you
good what do you have what do you have
like 2 min ago okay car car purchase or
lease from fan ban low and car purchase
or lease well look are you the kind of
person who really wants a sweet new ride
every three years and you got at least
it's like your phone you want the new on
tears like otherwise right you know I'm
all about shopping for a car loan rather
than a car because if you are really
excited about going out and getting
something car loans are gonna start
getting very cheap for Japanese and
European cars because the dollars going
up in value and money over in Europe and
Japan is cheap so imports are they're
gonna be better deals on on buying cars
with borrowed money from Japanese and
European companies than from US
companies that's going to start
interesting I don't love leases but I
get them I get like I hate to say to
somebody no no no buy a used car for
cash and they're just not gonna do it
so you have to know yourself if you're
just gonna blow out of a car lend at the
end of five years can you sit there and
drive a car to death then buy it and own
it yeah and if you just have like
complete Bilkis and you can't stop
yourself and you got ants in your pants
and you're always gonna buy a new car
every three years then Lisa I don't know
if this plays into the whole equation
but for me it was my first brand-new car
and I was like you know what this is the
car gonna hold on to for as long as I
possibly can I bought it good you know
yeah so get your Subaru you're gay I
bring my gay Subaru I'm not to say
you're a lesbian lesbian buy you a
higher Jill I know I can't just be like
no you're the lesbian
speaking of offensive stuff eggroll 88
says what should i do with the tax
refund that I'm about to get and the
bonus from work well first of all if
your refund is more than like thousand
or two thousand bucks go adjust your
withholding go back to your giving a
free loan oh look at you you're go to
town bang Uncle Sam go out for
you-know-who
exactly exactly
the bottomless basket of something
whatever they serve you there so adjust
your withholding and that will allow you
to put more money away into your
retirement plan or your college fund
lost opportunity money right there yeah
that's all right don't worry about it's
not a no it's not a make or break but
yeah the other thing is so what if you
have a big chunk of money then you know
presuming you got your big three down
right you have no debt
you got your six to twelve months you're
maxing out your retirement putting
eighteen grand to your 401k I'm hoping
that that's the case now you say like
well what else do I want to do do I need
a downpayment fund for a house do I want
to start funding my kids college
education so there are a series of
questions about what I would ask like
well what do you want to do and then
I'll tell you what to do to get there um
worst case scenario and it's not a worst
case is you open up an account at a
discount brokerage firm at a vanguard of
fidelity tiro price Straub TD Ameritrade
and go you know take your $50,000 bonus
and go buy yourself some index funds
maybe is a she's a a trader on maybe
she's a robot robot I was gonna say why
don't you invest in a future robot
company I'm sure that we have plenty of
some robotics what's that Boston
robotics but they've been bought by
Google I thought that's not a bad thing
okay you know what Google's just gonna
own everything so it's pretty awesome
that'll be great
can I can I just give money to Google
and be like get me like a 20% return on
this so last but not least we done with
our question go one more your questions
the curt the kamba wants to know aunt
Jill when is it a good time to buy a
house and not rent should I be
a great question yeah yeah well you know
first of all it's about like a real life
thing right you're buying something
means you're locked in and if you want
to have portability right you want to be
able to go move you want to say hey you
know what I'll take a job in San
Francisco if I got a job offer but I'm
living in New York like don't buy
something you know that freedom is worth
a lot you got to have a down payment so
you've got to have this to get the best
mortgage rates you've got to get 20%
down it's a lot of cash a lot of cash so
can you get that you could do it cheaper
you could get an FHA loan and you don't
have to have as big it down but then you
gotta get like mortgage insurance yes
exactly so I might Mike my answer to
that is if buying a house is your goal
you work it in backwards and we figure
out like well what would I want to buy
hmm and what would that mean in a down
payment and well how does that compare
to what my rent is I mean there are
places not so much in New York or in San
Francisco there are places in this
country we have tons of people listening
we're renting is a great deal still yeah
and there are some places where buying
is a great deal you know the New York
Times just type in New York Times rent
versus buy calculator it's a great
calculator that they developed they and
it walks you through kind of what you're
paying and what to expect to pay also as
Jeff will tell you once you're a
homeowner there's a lot of stuff
oh that comes along with that which is
kind of a pain in the neck and did you
rent I rent now I used to house the
owner because I think that there's some
the great thing about renting is that
there's freedom you know like wow
something's broken like hello come fix
it right I'm you know I'm sick care of
the maintenance stuff so if you have
like a lawn you have to take care of the
lawn mower itself and then you have to
do that or you paying somebody else to
do it it's there's so much can I be
honest yeah I don't know if I made the
right decision
well you know you probably did because
you're gonna have equity in this place
and just right so you so you will have
and maybe you're not supposed to know
right away
look when we sell the place hopefully
we'll really rainy the writing on the
wall but but I think that a lot of
people in the housing crisis really
underestimated the idea that like you
don't just like there was this time it's
like going back in time and saying like
well if I bought Google at the IPL then
it was great all right but at Facebook
at the IP light sucked for a year and
then it was great so you can go back in
time and pick anything and cherry-pick
it and find the best thing what we know
is housing basically increases it about
the same rate as inflation over time
there you will have some parent who says
you know what I bought my house it was
twenty five thousand dollars I'm selling
it for six hundred thousand well okay
there's like an implicit inflation rate
also um that said I think that housing
should be much more of a lifestyle
decision people don't realize that it is
a pain in the neck and in some places
renting is a big crapshoot because rents
can go up really dramatically it's there
and your mortgage is fixed like you know
so there's a there's a give-and-take
yeah um that's that's what we have from
our listening oh I love that so listen
on my website Jill on money yeah which
is not looking so bad by the way someone
in the business says to me you know like
there's no ads on this like I said that
feels good though right
yeah I guess and maybe I should like
sell my soul no maybe I get a stamp on
my forehead from like you know fidelity
bit of a jump I mean you could just put
a banner ad before you put yeah I've got
some stuff on the website about taxes
under the blog section you could look at
all my TV spots and tell me how you
think my hair is looking I like it a
little bit longer myself I think the
length it's at now which we can't really
describe how would you describe my
favorite I think that in honor of my
mother Susan Schlessinger let me just
say that she has been telling me for a
long time grow your hair you did it I
liked it longer you went and did it I
did it tomorrow morning on CBS this
morning I'm going to be talking about
bankrupt RadioShack by the way my
producer is like calling me I'm Nicolas
Lee crazy no it's just so funny but when
you get on the funny be like do you know
what I've been doing I've been working
I've been working I've been I'm just so
what I'm I'm interested in what
everyone's taken
on this story because it's if you watch
it tomorrow morning if it makes it to
air we'll say the story is about how you
know obviously radio show track is broke
right and in their bankruptcy they're
considering selling one of the assets
listed you know so what's this or
liquidate they're liquidating right so
what do they have they've got their
inventory right they've got is worth
about seventy eight twenty two and
they've got some you know they don't own
their locations but if they owned their
real estate that would be an asset one
of the assets they're listing is
thirteen million email addresses
sixty-five million customer names and
physical addresses which sounds so slimy
it is an asset but like there are
companies that sell that anyway right
now that it being in public
true-true there there are data mining
places there or catalog companies sell
your names on your habits all the time
right but the caveat here is what caveat
is that in their privacy policy
RadioShack originally but when they were
still in business told their customers
that it wouldn't sell or rent they're
personally identified information to
third parties well good thing we have a
lawyer in the room because sound like
they can't do though I mean it depends
and when that thing was written right
right and how it was written another
question is the data that they're giving
away
can they anonymize it to the point where
it's not personal anymore but they're
getting some kind of valuable data back
so whoever's making this information to
figure out like okay your your average
client is 18 to 34 and their male
removing that remove the personal aspect
and delete all the names I mean but the
thing is a lot of stuff can be
extrapolated right that's one of the
biggest scariest things about big data
is that they can put together you can
put together enough information laser
vision accurate we can figure who's
where yeah so meanwhile the current
bankruptcy judge is going to have to
approve this because the bankruptcy
judges have tons of power and it's being
contested by an oddball trio AT&amp;amp;T Texas
and Tennessee okay that the t-score
they AT&amp;amp;T is like you sold our crap and
those are our names
yeah okay that's easy Texas and
Tennessee say that they are that they
will actually have a state law that
prohibits companies from selling data in
ways that violate the company's own
policies and they're saying hey that's
what's the story here but it's going to
be it's going to depend on how that's
interpreted absolutely whether or not
it's private information depends on like
you said if it's anonymized or it's
somehow detached from specific
identification in this particular
article that I'm reading here cuz I'm
where did you get this article who wrote
this Washington Post she printed it out
but I did print it on my bad printer
good thing I printed it out since I
can't get an internet connection doubles
is a double spaced and single sheeted
thank you print and large you know it's
so funny though I don't know why this
makes me laugh but like they sort of say
like well what would happen if Facebook
went belly-up like a so where they sell
all their names I mean first of all you
sign your freaking life away yeah on any
of these better than to write that
exactly it's such a joke so anyone who
thinks that you've got any semblance of
privacy being on Facebook or using
Google like no yeah also by the way the
NSA knows everything anyway so we're all
sorry though I think Google knows more
than the NSA maybe but remembered you
know they look at a better catalog they
know how to use it versus Dennis is that
this just a shitload of it no like ah
yeah you talk about it like growing up
like with a kid like that you would
always threaten a kid like be careful or
on your permanent right here someone's
gonna catch you don't scare that get
scare the kid with Google be like dude
that's the real yeah you know I am this
guy it's it is amazing although I will
say that like I I one time maybe five or
six years ago when you guys were telling
me about Facebook early on and you were
like oh we say hey you know we're
talking about my nephew and you're like
he can't put any crap up there because
eventually is gonna like apply for
college and like that's gonna follow him
and I remember going home and be good
dougie you can't do this like my forget
about it employers are looking employers
like I can't even believe the crap that
people put on there even on their
LinkedIn page they're like it's so dope
I'm wondering if that just kind of evens
out because enough people lived with no
there's still so many people who get
affected immediately because there's
pictures yeah but that's like having a
typo in your resume well that's my bad
well that's my thing always your whole
resumes your Facebook social everything
I always think of like the elections in
like 2030 or 2040 where it's like people
who grew up with Facebook it's like who
has the least damning photo that's gonna
be like that one kid who's like I didn't
smoke pot and you're like really really
here's a photo of you and from 2018
taken upon myself clearly tagged because
Facebook Auto tags now if anyone has any
other questions and you want to come on
