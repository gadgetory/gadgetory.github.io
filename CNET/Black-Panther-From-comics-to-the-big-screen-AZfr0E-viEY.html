black panther and sitting next to me
Ryan miner Dean head of visual
development for Marvel Studios Ryan
thank you so much for joining us and
spending time here
oh of course thanks for having me so you
know we're here to talk about Black
Panther and I just you know not that I'm
kissing your butt but I am but just
thank you for this just amazing world
building and character building that you
and your team have done how was just
that experience for you guys you know
working at Marvel Studios is great
because every every film's a little bit
different and this one was was really an
interesting experience because creating
the whole world of Wakanda felt like a
new and interesting challenge we had
previously worked on Asgard but this one
because it's on earth because it's a
sort of sophisticated earth culture and
because it's inspired by African tribal
design motifs it really created a lot of
opportunities for cool design there's
kind of been a term that has been used
like afrofuturism and Black Panther
almost kind of really speaks to that and
makes it a real thing consistently
throughout the movie that people haven't
seen when you guys heard that you're
doing Black Panther the movie where
they're kind of maybe some specific
themes or tentpoles that you said these
are the things that we want to make sure
like this world feels like black panther
at its core is really it's it's meant to
be tribal but it's also meant to be
sci-fi so that the the combining of
those two things are really the two
things we were trying to go for and then
trying to look within the tribal African
cultures and try to find something that
that that spoke to feeling African but
also could translate into a science
fiction world there's a lot of really
amazing visuals from from African
cultures that haven't been explored too
much in film specifically and I think
using that that palette to like just tap
into was what was really amazing I think
you know one of things you touched on
was making the world feel real I think
that's that's one of the first things
we're trying to do just because there's
a lot of sci-fi notions in this movie
that if they're not grounded enough it's
gonna not gonna feel real enough for
people to take it seriously another
thing that was really exciting for us I
think is try to make the culture of that
world feel as real as possible through
the the Regal nosov T'Challa and and the
and it's sort of the black panther
throne I think all those things mixed
together makes for like a really
interesting design starting point and
hopefully me we fulfilled what people
are looking for now you talked about
T'Challa obviously the main character we
saw him in civil war and we've seen this
new kind of streamlined costume for
Black Panther with new abilities what
does that process like you know just
designing Black Panther and what did you
want to bring new to the table for this
movie you know one of the cool things
about characters once they've already
appeared an MCU movie we have places to
move from right so I did the design work
for for Black Panther and Civil War and
I was really trying to bring in a lot of
woven African design themes to make it
feel like not only are there African
tribal markings and sort of inscriptions
and Wakanda language worked into the
costume but the whole suit was meant to
feel like it was woven together it
created a sort of layered silhouette and
a little bit sort of bulkier when Ryan
Coogler started on the film he really
wanted to to streamline that that wasn't
one of the things he was really
interested in is making it sort of this
unified singular skin it almost felt
like I think the second skin for it to
jalwa and part of that was because it
was gonna be nanotech it was gonna be so
high-tech that if it felt layered and
like you could see a construction method
it wouldn't really make sense so in
essence what Ryan really brought to it
was the idea of upping the technology of
the suit so it was it was a higher tech
sort of suit than we really have seen
on-screen in the MCU so far as well as
he had some very specific ideas about
the helmet and the mask the first was to
make it not a helmet to actually
integrate the mask with the suit so it
felt like one unified thing and he also
he liked the idea in the more recent run
of the comics they were designed by
brand still freeze there are a few
themes from that mask that he really
wanted to bring to it he wanted the the
ears sort of swept back so it felt like
more like an aggressive stance like a
growling panther he wanted exposed to
tell his eyes at certain points in the
movie so the nanotech could retract and
then you could see the actual expression
on Chadwicks face and in the Brian steel
freeze design of the face there's this
interesting mix of a panther and a man's
face where it's sometimes depending on
how the light catches it they can either
look more like a panther
like a man I think exposing the eyes and
then also bringing more of an actual
Panther face to the mask creates a more
African inspired tribal look to the mask
it feels more like it's meaning to
represent a panther whereas I think the
Civil War design was really trying to
lean into the Jack Kirby sort of comic
look it's more saying that's reference
the comic character and the new design
feels like it's creating it like more of
a Panther Idol in some way what were
some of the big inspirations I know you
talked about Kirby and steal fries were
there any other kind of runs in the
comics that you kind of looked at for
whether it was Wakanda or Black Panther
or the character even other characters
in the movies for Panther the summer I
was really the still freeze are
specifically with the kinetic technology
of absorbing energy to be able to
deliver a blow with it and that purple
glow really added a cool design theme to
them that works so well and then the
film
I think those are sort of the two
touchdowns was Kirby it and still freeze
when we got into doing Kim longer we
were looking a lot of the comic
references sort of just touch tones and
then trying to find ways of doing the
same sorts of things but bringing him
into more of a in his first appearances
in the movie to more of a tactical world
where he feels like his sort of Special
Forces background is evident and then he
picks up that tribal mask which feels a
lot like the mascots in the comics
Ryan was really interested in pushing
ideas that would look back at those
those cool comic book roots and try and
find ways of of transitioning them into
more real things even like the
dreadlocks and the kamagra has in the
comics like I think they got turned into
like a really cool interesting hairstyle
for Michael B Jordan which is just
really fun to see Ryan Coogler obviously
you know he's a comic book reader he's a
comic book geek and he clearly he
collaborated a lot with you was was
there a lot of kind of back and forth
between you guys I know this is really a
collaborative effort and you guys create
these key frames these great you know
superhero designs and whatnot um how was
it working with him overall Ryan's
amazing he's a really generous like
great filmmaker to work for brings a lot
of fantastic ideas he's really willing
to listen and like if you have a pitch
he'll he'll want to hear it and they'll
consider it and he'll either go with it
or he won't but you know just just being
having somebody that's there that
listens to what you're saying is awesome
and so many of the really great ideas
leads to you know for our part of the
process and the visuals came straight
from him is there any character that you
personally enjoyed working on the most
design-wise that you know maybe people
might not expect because I you're the
head of Marvel you know development here
was there what about for you one of
things I'm happy that I got in there was
this idea of having scarification on his
body and we found a way to sort of
integrate that into the kill monger
Panther shoot so that it has these
bundles of fabric that are meant to
represent the scarification on him any
of the characters are so amazing to see
I mean in terms of my favorites that how
they transitioned I I love the they look
for Panther I love the new look I love
the look of the for kill monger but a
coy way is probably my favorite action
she's amazing Anthony Francisco actually
did the design work on a quarry and
Nakia and clay just so great I mean
she's kind of a badass like yep pretty
much
were there any other just standout parts
of this whole process that you enjoyed
doing the most
the production design on the movie is so
amazing there's so many cool and
interesting takes on stuff the waterfall
scene the Jabari tribe sort of like
thrown there's so many cool things to
bounce off of and to see all the great
ideas they were coming up with like
that's probably one of my favorite parts
of this was seeing Hanna working with
Ryan to come up with a sort of lookbook
of different African inspired reference
and and seeing what that was how that
was sort of playing out in the
production design in the sets and then I
was trying to keep up with it and terms
of doing the hero costumes and how Ruth
was able to to create an entire culture
you know out of out of thin air really I
mean she was finding different looks for
the different tribes that feel really
like interesting and different so that's
what Conda maybe more than any culture
within the MCU feels so real and feels
very multifaceted and interesting
alright Ryan well thanks so much we want
to just highlight this because of all
the great work you guys are doing people
that are watching today art of Black
Panther I know I honestly pre-ordered
this for Amazon right now so I don't
have it but I'm holding in my hand here
but there's just a lot of great stuff in
here showing the concept design that you
guys have worked on and just how you
evolved this to what we got to see so
thanks so much Ryan this appreciate it
oh cool thanks
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
