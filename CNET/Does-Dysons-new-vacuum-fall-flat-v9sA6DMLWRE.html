standing beside the dyson DC 65 this is
an upright vacuum that replaces the DC
41 that I reviewed last year now this
cost 599 dollars it's a top-of-the-line
expensive vacuum cleaner and for that
kind of money you want to know that
you're getting really good performance
and with Dyson you do you get a vacuum
that's going to do a good job of
cleaning up just about anything you want
to clean with it however if you remember
my review of the DC 41 last year you
know that I have some problems with the
Dyson vacuum design and those problems
persist in the DC 65 it still falls down
a lot when you try and put it up the
hose is still difficult to use and
doesn't have a handle it still has
little plastic parts that feel a bit
delicate and brittle and I just don't
like those elements of the design to me
those are near deal-breakers that said
Dyson did amp the power up from the DC
41 to the DC 65
this one has a 25% stronger motor
according to Dyson so that means this
brushroll is going to spin a lot faster
and we saw that worked well in the
carpet test especially this one picks up
about four to eight percent more than
the DC 41 but for a really clear
illustration of the difference between
the DC 65 and the DC 41 I want to
instead take a look at the hardwood test
that we did take a look at this footage
we tested both the DC 41 and the DC 65
with the brush roll on and the brush
roll off now the DC 41 couldn't pick up
enough Cheerios to register on our
scales when we have the brush roll off
when we turn the brush roll on it picked
up about 90% of them but scatter the
other 10% now let's take a look at the
DC 65 when the brush roll is off it's
picking up about 80% of the Cheerios and
the DC 41 didn't pick up any of them
that's a pretty good result that means
it's got a lot more suction and when the
brush rolls on it still picks up about
80% but then scatters that remaining 20%
quite a bit even more so than the DC 41
that's because those brushes are
spinning even faster and that's a lot of
data but to sum it up the DC 65 animal
has a little bit better suction than the
previous generation it also has that
faster spinning brush roll that leads to
better carpet performance but not
necessarily better performance on
hardwood floors it also has those same
design flaws that to me are a
deal-breaker so I'd probably stick with
the model
the ORAC touch bagless or the Electrolux
precision brush roll clean both of those
did a great job on our test that cost a
little less and they have designs it to
me are a little more thoughtful for CNET
