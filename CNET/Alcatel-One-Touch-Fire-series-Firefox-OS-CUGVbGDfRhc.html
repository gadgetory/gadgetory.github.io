from mobile world congress 2014 here in
Barcelona and we're looking at the
Alcatel OneTouch fire range these are
the firefox operating system phones and
this year alcatel is stepping up its
partnership with Mozilla to try to
elevate these phones from being low end
entry-level ideas to something that
might start to challenge in the mid tier
of phones the fire see is the closest to
last year's entry level fire device
there's a couple of small upgrades a 1.2
gigahertz dual-core processor but it's
still a half vga screen it's still hspa+
this year and it's basically very
similar to last year's phone in design
as well design-wise the fire e and s run
close to the alcatel one touch idol
series of devices basically being
variants on that range the e has a qHD
display five point touch dual-core 1.2
gigahertz processor 512 megs of ram
Bluetooth 4.0 a 5 megapixel camera and a
VGA front camera there's also four gigs
of internal storage with microSD support
we haven't been able to see working
models of the fire s or the fire 7
tablet just yet but the fire S is
probably a really exciting option that
will be a genuine mid-tier device with
LTE NFC a quad core processor 8
megapixel camera this is definitely
going to be something very interesting
for fans of Firefox OS to see just how
far they can start to push things now
this is a mock-up version of the fire 7
tablet and this is going to be a quarter
HD display device so a very low-end
tablet which will actually be selling
for just 79 euros so this tablet has a
dual-core 1.2 gigahertz processor and a
2-megapixel rear display it's low spec
but then with a 79 euro price tag it's
definitely not shooting for the moon
either overall alcatel says they don't
see Firefox OS as a competitor to
Android anytime soon but they do want to
keep exploring it to see what the street
so this particular platform might be
over the long run so for any html5 fans
out there I think the fire s is
definitely gonna be one of those devices
worth checking out in order to actually
give this a test and really see what it
might be capable of down the track the
Alcatel OneTouch fire see will be
available in early q2 the fire II will
be available lately q2 and the S will be
available in the back half of the year
the pricing will be the C comes in at 59
euro or about 80 US dollars the e will
be 139 euro or around 190 US dollars the
S will be 169 you or around two hundred
thirty dollars and the seven the fire 7
tablet will be 79 euro which is around
110 US dollars so this has been the
alcatel one touch fire series of devices
