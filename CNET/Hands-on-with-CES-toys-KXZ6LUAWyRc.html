with a quick look at some really cool
family-friendly tech that I've seen so
far at CES let's start with this guy
this is the inflatable cube and it's
perfect for families with small children
you simply attach your iPad and then
this cube is indestructible your kids
can play with it or even profit so they
can watch a movie of it pretty cool and
it sells for thirty-five dollars since
it's the start of the new year so many
of us have new year's resolutions to
lose weight and stay in shape well these
devices from BodyMedia fit can help you
do that this is the core armband and the
idea is that you wear it 23-7 that's
almost a full day and it syncs all of
your personal data we're talking steps
walks calories burned body temperature
all to your computer or your smart phone
wirelessly pretty amazing this guy which
is releasing later this year is a patch
that you would have fixed your arm and
then keep on for up to seven days and it
to and monitor up to 5,000 different
bodymetrix amazing now and the whole
theme of wanting to lose weight and stay
in shape the same people who brought us
the first wireless adult scale why
things has now delivered a baby scale
check this guy out place the baby on the
scale and it'll give you an accurate
read out within a few grams or ounces
and it also syncs all of the data
wirelessly to either your smartphone or
a website you can also link it with your
Facebook or Twitter account pretty
amazing and finally I got to show you
this device this is so great for people
who are maybe a little forgetful or
misplace things you simply attach the
case to your smartphone and attach these
little beacons also in the name of the
company to your purse your keys your dog
your child you name it say I wanted to
locate my purse tap of a few buttons and
within seconds the little beacon will
locate exactly where I misplaced my
purse very cool stuff and again just a
small sampling of all the amazing cool
techy innovations here at CES this year
