you're like me you're freaking out
because there haven't been any good
games to play in a few weeks well don't
worry because februari has a few titles
you should definitely have on your radar
let's get started okay so officially
this isn't a februari release but I'm
doing whenever I want today dying light
is the latest open-world zombie game
from tech land those are the people who
made Dead Island and then if you recall
the god-awful follow-up dead island
riptide but dying light is fun at times
it's also kind of clunky and doesn't
really introduce anything new to that
already played out genre so kind of on
the fence about that one episode 2 of
Telltale's Game of Thrones Season one
hits februari fourth that game is
starting to heat up so make sure you
check that out if you are left 4 dead
fan you're going to want a circle
februari 10th on your calendar that's
when a valve will hit next generation
consoles and the PC players can play on
or offline and team up to take down
gigantic monsters that grow larger as
the rounds progress 3ds owners should
also take note of februari 13th that
sees the release of two major titles for
the handheld platform there's Zelda
Majora's Mask 3d which is a reboot of
the classic title and then Monster
Hunter 4 ultimate are finally giving
players a reason to dust off their
portables mine is covered in cobwebs on
februari 20th developer ready at dawn
will deliver a ps4 exclusive this is
much needed for the ps4 the order 1886
is a steampunk style victorian
third-person shooter it looks gorgeous
and has an unbelievable atmosphere I've
actually already played an hour of the
game and I cannot wait to finish the
rest of it finally on februari 24th
resident evil revelations 2 will kick
off its episodic game delivery with
episode one of its survival horror
season now of course these aren't all
the games that are hitting in February
so be sure to comment with your most
anticipated game of the month and reach
out to me on Twitter to keep the
conversation going that's it for me
right now I've got games to play we'll
see you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
