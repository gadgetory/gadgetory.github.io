there's a photo album here of a family
but what you'll notice at the bottom is
this new tab called memories let's take
a look so we can see here there are a
number of memories that have been
offered up into this memories feed and
at the top there's a vacation that the
system is spotted where the family took
a trip to Tahoe City let's dive in and
take a look at a memory so now I can tap
show all and actually see a grid of
every photo that was taken but you can
see how the summary intelligently draws
out the most special photos into these
highlights that are really great to
browse now if we go further down we see
that it's actually pulled out the set of
people that are in the photo the family
Grandma and Grandpa and uncle and a map
of the location where all of those
photos were taken and down here at the
bottom we have related other memories I
might want to see related to this one
and it's really smart so you see that
the Santa Cruz and fourth of July of
memories well Grandma and Grandpa were
both on the trip in Tahoe City and in
these so those are offered up as related
and this Tahoe City trip was an outdoor
vacation so it offered up another one
like Alaska and you can see there's
another time the family was also at
Tahoe City but this time in the winter
I'm going to jump in to that related
memory and you see once again we have
photos and videos at the bottom but I
want to highlight the movie up here at
the top you know we all take so many
pictures and movies and we never go back
to actually assemble them into something
we'd want to watch but now our iPhone
can do that for us automatically let's
see what the iPhone is created for this
memory
now when you have a memory like this you
often want to share it and sometimes you
might want to make it a little shorter
say for sharing so I can just use this
slider at the bottom and say I'd like it
to be shorter and maybe I want to change
the mood a little bit you notice there's
a mood slider just up above there and
that was a pretty great snowball fight
so I'll pick epic and based on these
changes it's going to completely re-edit
the movie to new music let's take a look
that's pretty epic</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
