of NBA superstar LeBron James welcome to
what the future
on today's show LeBron James like you've
never seen him before
a robot performed surgery on human eyes
and an exosuit that lets you run farther
on less energy all right check this out
a computer-generated this 3d image of
King James in motion using standard 2d
video scientists at MIT call this most
sculpt they essentially developed an
algorithm that detects two-dimensional
key points on the subject like the hip
or the knee then it takes poses from
those points and generates these most
scopes they can even be 3d printed check
out this proofing
of a runner so imagine you want to serve
like Roger Federer you could compare
your own most sculpt to this one and see
exactly what you're doing differently
right now the algorithm only reads with
a single person but the team wants to
expand that to studying multiple
subjects at the same time
all right would you let a robot operate
on your eye well six very brave people
did and I'll let my good friend dr. Nix
tell you how it went this marked the
first time a robot had performed surgery
on a human eye the robot was designed by
Dutch company precise play on words get
it now in a trial twelve patients had
surgery to remove a membrane from the
back of the eye now in half the cases
the surgeon used the robot the other
half were done manually all the
surgeries were successful but in some of
the robot assisted cases the surgeon
performed better than usual
researchers say next they want to know
what the robots can be used to deliver
gene therapy directly to the retina all
right check out the newest soft exosuit
from the engineers at harvard it's not
the first we've seen from them but this
one has a new feature it reads how a
person's body is responding to the suit
and automatically adjusts the amount of
assistance it gives for maximum
efficiency now to test it out
u.s. army soldiers walked a 12 mile
course they used about 15 percent less
energy than they would have without the
suit now exoskeletons like this have a
ton of potential beyond helping soldiers
in the field fire fighters and other
rescuers could use them to navigate
rough terrain Ford has already started
using them in auto plants and seen its
Lexus abhi Dee's got to try out suit X
and the results well they speak for
themselves what makes you say WTF let us
know in the comments that's gonna do it
for this show I'm Andy Altmann thanks
