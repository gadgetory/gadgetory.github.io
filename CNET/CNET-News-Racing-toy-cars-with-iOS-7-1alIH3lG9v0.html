news and I'm here in San Francisco
outside Moscow Nene West where the world
wide developer conference happened this
morning and one of the things we saw
this morning was a demonstration of a
technology called Anki but what aki
showed on stage today was an example of
something really worth talking about
that brings it down to a consumer level
what we've basically got is a car racing
game that happens in the physical world
where each of these little cars which is
built with a combination of optical
sensors wireless chips a microcontroller
and motors is able to interact with each
other completely independent of anything
else that's going on around them unki
impressed the crowd and really showed
what the future of consumer robotics and
artificial intelligence is for now anki
isn't telling us what they're going to
be working on in the future but it's
pretty easy to imagine a wide range of
things that one could do with consumer
level robotics and artificial
intelligence whether it's games or toys
so while we don't know what Anki will be
doing in the future Apple clearly seems
to believe in them by giving them a very
rare and exclusive space at the
worldwide developers conference keynote
address for CNN news this is daniel
Terdiman in San Francisco</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
