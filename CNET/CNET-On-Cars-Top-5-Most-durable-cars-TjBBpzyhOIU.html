now at a record 11 point four years and
by the way climbing to nearly 12 years
old by 2019 we clearly don't have a
problem with old cars these days
I'm Brian Cooley with the top five cars
you're likely to be in 12 years from now
cars that run seemingly forever
according to data from RL Polk which is
basically the Bible of this kind of
research these are cars by the way I'm
taking out trucks and big SUVs which
tend to last forever anyway and that's
another video number five the Nissan
Maxima the max can trace its roots back
to the mid 70s when its father the
Datsun 810 rather godly roamed our
streets by the time it got the oddly
Roman maxima name in 1980 it was one of
the first Nissan's to use any American
parts namely from General Motors number
four is the Honda Odyssey this is quite
an achievement because the Odyssey only
dates back to 1994 but that honda
reliability has made up for lost time in
the market this is where fold-flat rear
seats were invented by the way most
recently Odysseys innovations have
veered off toward a built in shop vac
which I find oddly wonderful number
three the Toyota Avalon I have a secret
hunch that if you also ranked cars by
average owner age the Avalon might be
number one
it had old-school oddities for a Toyota
like a front bench seat and a column
shifter whose that aimed at however your
grandparents may have to now shop for a
used Crown Vic because the Avalon got
all sexed up last year
Dovie even tuned one number two is the
Subaru Legacy soubise parent company has
roots in buses train cars and garbage
trucks
I don't believe they know how to make
something that breaks combine that with
the fact that sube buyers for whom
driving something old and worn just fits
the look and you have a tag team almost
surprised it doesn't add up to number
one except that would mean bumping the
honda accord are number one when the
Accord launched it was a sensation the
question for a year or two wasn't would
you be buying an Accord simply how much
you were willing to bribe the dealer to
allocate you won the Civic had already
established that you'd be getting one
ride only now with room and great looks
borrowed from the classic Scirocco
generation one damn making myself want
one by the way the Camry the
best-selling car ahead of the Accord and
from the company that most folks equate
with durability wouldn't quite make our
list it would come in at number six more
top 5 lists to wait the car lover go to
see net on cars calm but on top 5</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
