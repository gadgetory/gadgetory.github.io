with a simple pinch across months and
again across years let's go back to 2005
back to when I took that road trip
across Canada again using a very simple
pinch gesture I can go all the way back
in back to a time when I still had hair
let's look out of this photo a simple
swipe to the right brings up my
collections a timeline of my most
memorable moments this not only includes
the album's I've made but also montage
movies and stories that I've saved a
home for all your memories big and small
so here I'm just going to tap the blue
search button and you'll see all my
photos organized by the people places
and things that matter the most in my
life I remember being caught in a really
bad snowstorm about ten years ago back
home normally it would take me forever
to find these photos instead I just tap
the search box I'll type snowstorm in
Toronto and instantly I'm able to find
these photos that I'm looking for now
that i found this memory let's talk
about how google photos helps bring
these memories to life I can easily tap
the pencil which will let me make
adjustments tuned to the photos color
lighting and subject or by selecting and
tapping the plus button google photos
lets me create collages animations
movies with soundtracks and more a swipe
to the left brings up my photos
assistant here i will get suggestions
for new creations made from my photos
and videos that i can preview and either
choose to save edit or throw away the
choice is mine next I'm going to tap the
share button we firmly believe you
should be able to share photos and
videos any way you want now earlier you
saw me share a Twitter
we also want to do our part in making
sharing predictable and reliable so in
this case I'm simply going to tap get a
link and in less than a second I have a
link to all 25 items now the beauty of
this is I don't have to worry about
whether the recipient of the link has a
particular app or has a login I can
share it any way that I want</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
