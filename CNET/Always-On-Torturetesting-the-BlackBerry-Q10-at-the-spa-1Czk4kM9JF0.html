blackberry q10 today I booked myself a
spa appointment because I was thinking
the thing about the BlackBerry is it's
CrackBerry you can't put it down no
matter where you are let's see what
happens I'm Molly wood I'm checking in
for my treatments massage time I'm just
gonna go ahead though and leave my phone
right here because you never know when I
might get an important email kind of a
big deal okay so this is the line easier
cool oh my gosh that smells amazing oh
no oh no I got it all over the phone by
accident that can't be good
sorry about that um oh thank you here
welcome to he's key seem very greasy but
I'm just gonna real quick see if I can
type anything reminder do not drop oil
on phone keyboards are nice it's okay
they really leave you to soak for a long
time in these tubs but luckily my phone
still okay from the oil so I can do a
little bit slippery though oh oh you
know I noticed already actually that the
row of buttons
these ones are darker at the top which I
think maybe from the oil now the whole
screens gone kind of dark and is Oh
freaking out I can't say it's doing all
right actually it's freaking out
I'm so relaxed right now I hope my phone
is okay though it's still a little
slippery in it it's not very silent or
relaxing that came up just a lot of oil
in it I make a lot of oil
this green seems okay though just one
more like you know could happen
the corner is really the key to this I'm
learning oh oh but you know what no
damage at all all right can take like a
minor drop but let's be honest the oil
in the bathwater
pregnant kill it we will dry it out and
check back later time to check in on the
blackberry q10 and see how it handled
it's a day at the spa I came away very
relaxed in case you were wondering it's
been in a little dry bag here all right
but we took it apart now this is
sometimes the thing that saves these
things put the battery back in here I'm
gonna plug it in
we have red light this could be good
news for the BlackBerry c-come on little
guy
yeah well not ready to call it yet let
me just charge it for like a minute one
minute okay it's been charging for a
minute or two and the light just sort of
keeps coming on and then going off I'm
gonna give it one last try but I don't
have a good feeling
in the end all that's left is the iconic
blackberry red light and nothing
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
