iPad well i usually like writing on it
if i don't have to do too many other
tasks other than pure typing and then
when it comes to finding a keyboard for
my ipad it's a bit of a trial and error
because some keyboard cases are really
pretty bulky and i don't always like
typing on my ipad screen directly lo and
behold the new logitech ultrathin
keyboard cover for the ipad it looks
like it's a laptop right no it's an ipad
with this new keyboard cover attached to
it it connects the same way that a smart
cover attaches via magnets and this
little thin case doubles as a keyboard
that you can lay and set up with your
ipad right through this little docking
connector and it even has magnets on the
bottom pretty snazzy this thin little
case when it's assembled gives you
access to a pretty full size keyboard
that connects via bluetooth and gives
you some really nice feeling keys in the
middle some crap keys on the sides but
an experience that nearly matches what
you're going to get in a bluetooth
keyboard that will be sold separately
but here you're getting something a lot
thinner and something unattach is in a
really sexy way with your ipad now there
are some caveats one it's not a case
maybe that's why they call it ultrathin
keyboard cover in fact it's not really
that great a cover for the front it's
nothing like a smart cover in the sense
that it's kind of thick and awkward to
close but it does have rubber bumpers
that protect the ipad from contacting
the keyboard you're still going to need
something to cover the back of the ipad
however so you might want to get a smart
cover or you might want to keep it in a
folio case when you're not using this
unfortunately if you try to put a smart
back cover on the third generation ipad
it won't dock with the groove on this
keyboard but if you have an ipad 2
you're in luck i tried the belkin snap
shield cover and at least in that
instance it worked just fine now you can
also dock this ipad in portrait mode
although it's not kind of supported with
the magnets it does work it does feel a
little bit tenuous here I'm not sure I
trusted at a cafe with a lot of jostling
people but you can do it though this
keyboard is really meant to be used in
landscape mode and only in this one
orientation where the magnets are to
dock and when it does it's strong enough
that it can hold the key
on the bottom it's 99 bucks which is not
cheap but compared to a lot of ipad
keyboard cover accessories it's kind of
right in that ballpark and logitech says
that this will last six months on a
charge although that would be with two
hours of use a day still that's a lot of
hours of use and it charges via micro
USB cable that comes in the package all
told it's not going to reinvent the
world of keyboards but it really may
change your habits in terms of how you
carry a keyboard with you you can't get
much sexier than this Ultrabook keyboard
cover and the way connects back with
your ipad as simply as this i'm scott
steiner that's a look at the ultrathin
keyboard cover for the ipad 2 and 3rd
gen ipad</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
