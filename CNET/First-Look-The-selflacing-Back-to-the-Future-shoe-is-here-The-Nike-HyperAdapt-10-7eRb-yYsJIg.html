innovation for everybody event in New
York and what we saw here for the tech
audience two really cool things the
number one thing the hyperadapt 1.0 the
first self-lacing shoe for the consumer
i got to try it on and one of the cool
things about this thing right yeah you
step on it itself laces it will be
available by the end of the year
it requires inductive charging and you
have to charge about once every two
weeks but that is a product forget the
Back to the Future air mags this is
coming this year for everybody it's kind
of interesting we're moving in an
interesting era where technology is
advancing they're getting so much more
data but consumers are getting lost with
all this data I mean there's tons of
dashboards there's tons of gadgets they
don't know what to do with it all it's
really about defining the purpose how
are you gonna use it what insights can I
get from it and how is that going to
make me be able to utilize that data to
perform and be better the other thing
that Mike you really wanted to push is a
new digital platform it's their new Nike
Plus app think of this is a real
personalized way for you to access all
of Nike services whether it's shopping
it's based on location so it can tell
you where it stores at if you want to do
some of Nikes training sessions it
indicates when that's happening but also
really for all your sneaker lovers the
ability to get early access to shoes
there's this thing called golden ticket
access for Golden Jordans I know I want
that but they're trying to make this the
center of your digital lifestyle through
an app and everything Nike I think the
way to think about the new Nike Plus app
is really that central access point so
that'll house your entire relationship
with Nike it's the most personal and
it's the easiest way to access all that
we have to offer so those are really the
two hot things for the tech world that
we saw here at Nikes innovation for
everybody for cnet.com i'm brian tom</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
