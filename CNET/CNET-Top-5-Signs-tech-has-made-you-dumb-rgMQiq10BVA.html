of human intellectual achievement we
have in our pockets a constantly updated
web of information containing the
complete history of human progress in
scientific thought yet in spite of our
smartphones and tablets and our smart
TVs and internet connected everything we
are turning into morons i'm donald bell
and if you need convincing here are the
top five signs that today's smart tech
is turning you into an idiot starting
off at number five you GPS everything
remember when Apple ditch Google Maps
and everyone freaked out it's because we
can't navigate anymore to save our lives
I recently had someone pull up to me in
my hometown and ask for directions and I
just lied then I pretended like I was
visiting addresses street names
landmarks it used to all be up here my
brain but now I just trust that my phone
will magically get me there same goes
for number four phone numbers now I
won't lie to you I've never that great
of remembering phone numbers but they
used to stick in fact that part of my
brain still remember some of my best
friend's phone numbers from grade school
but my wife's cell phone number that
she's had for seven years
I still have to look that one up every
time so if I ever lose my cell phone I
need help I'm really hoping that
Scotty's parents from grade school are
still around and they know a good
bailbondsman at number three the Google
brain crutch you ever catch yourself
asking Google questions that should be
common knowledge to anyone with a GED
sometimes I'm so lazy I'll even ask
Google or Siri for help with basic
arithmetic you'd think that having this
information at our fingertips would make
us smarter my kid could ask me who the
17th President of the United States is
and in seconds I could hit him back with
Andrew Johnson but if he asked me again
tomorrow I should remember it but I
don't
there's something about Google of
information that passes through my brain
like prune juice I figured since it's
always there if I actually take the time
to learn anything coming in at number
two
your handwriting my handwriting peaked
at around third-grade old Scottie and I
was spend their afternoons mastering our
penmanship in our cursive writing
workbooks and then my school got a
computer lab and my handwriting has been
on a steady decline ever since not only
that but I will seriously write
something down no I misspelled it and
then wait for an autocorrect that never
arrives my best penmanship now looks
like a ransom note written by dyslexic
preschooler
but the number-one sign that smart tech
is making you dumb your attention span
can you remember the last time you read
something longer than a blog post what
about a movie that wasn't punctuated by
explosions every 15 minutes is your fear
of the zombie apocalypse really just a
dread that Facebook and Twitter won't be
around to fill your downtime didn't you
even make it to the end of this list
you know what forget it next time we're
doing a top ten on classics of English
literature and you'll just have to deal
with it it's very good so there you go
five signs that the dumb pocalypse is
already here so keep those smart phones
charged do you ever feel that
uncomfortable twinge of boredom head
