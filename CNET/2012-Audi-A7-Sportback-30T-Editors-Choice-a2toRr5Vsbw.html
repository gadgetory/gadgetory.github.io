form sedan coupe station wagon sports
car high-tech powerful curious styled
let's drive the 2012 Audi a7 Sportback
and check the tech along with all the
rest
the a7 is Audi's entry into this new
mini rage of luxury four-door sporty and
sometimes utilitarian coupes it's a
tortured concept to be honest you could
stretch it to include anything from the
Accord Crosstour to Mercedes cls550
the Panamera and the Aston Martin Rapide
for me though this is the one that gets
it the most right and of course the big
story on the a7 it's a completely new
car in the Audi lineup they call it a
sport bag but it's a four-door coupe
with a hatchback access in the rear
everyone hates the h-word on cars that
are you know above 25 grand
that's what it is when it opens up
you've got a very large though sometimes
shallow toward the back here cargo space
but it's a big boy most folks are kind
of surprised when I do this when this
whole hatch is down it's a very strong
long sloping style statement you've got
this lift up spoiler here taken right
from the pages of what a Porsche Boxter
I do like that the doors are frameless
makes easy ingress and egress though in
the rear here the glass doesn't go all
the way down now a lot of stuff in this
car I've shown you before things like
the Audi shifter in the way the gate
works here electric parking brake here's
the current MMI with nav tail radio and
media and the four buttons that
correspond to regional menus in the
corners of the screen we've seen all
that before including this touchpad here
this is the latest thing on Howdy's MMI
you can actually press these buttons
when they're illuminated those are
station presets or when you're in the
mode of entering something texts like an
address you can actually write it here
with your finger and you'll recognise
the Audi instrument panel the great
clear gauges slightly canted in towards
you and all that irregular region
between them is a really nice beautiful
detailed contextually changing display
here's what's new on this car this flip
up navigation screen right here in the
dash notice as I go around the orbit
here I have car settings my phone and
communication
stuff info we're going to get to you're
going to love that navigation media and
radio teased out separately and tone
control teased out separately let's go
back to info notice when I get there
I've got this choice in the upper right
that corresponds to this button and that
goes online I go through that screen
there and look at this would you like to
do a data connection and their charges
involved in all that not through my
phone I'll prove it here's my phone I'm
taking the battery out and I'll hit yes
and we're connecting anyway Google logo
in the bottom 3G logo next to it that's
because this car doesn't need you to
have any kind of phone to get online the
tethering isn't the model it's right
down here the magic is in the SIM slot
that little SIM slot is a separate
wireless account in this case it's
t-mobile
I've got 3G data as you saw the car gets
online by itself once I get in there I
can do a lot of stuff I've seen before
here's weather again pulled down live I
can say immediate vicinity for example
here's where it gets interesting travel
information so check it out Wikimedia
powered loading stuff now I said
immediate vicinity it's finding local
landmarks and giving me either a
snapshot or a map clip whenever it can
from Wikimedia if I click on one of
these it keeps loading and it pulls up
more information tells me the distance
to it gives me a larger example of
whatever its representative thumbnail
was and here's my description of what it
is then if I want to go there after I've
read it and said hey that's kind of cool
set his destination this is a
breakthrough in the way we navigate and
I've been harping on this for years
saying navigation without search is
broken this is the best example yet in a
car of what navigation should be I can
do a google search and you saw the
Google logo before four things in my
immediate vicinity I just start typing
the letters say and here's CBS
Interactive because that's really
immediate we're right next door to our
building now the search can be a little
janky in this case some of these are not
related to CBS in any way to make any
sense to me so I'm not quite sure what
that logic is all about they could do a
little honing on this okay now the third
part of this tech trifecta you're going
to get Google Earth powered navigation
again a first being drawn in in
real-time that's Google Earth that's not
just a static satellite thing that's
going to load and buffer
within a 25-mile range as I Drive and I
can also go plan view looking down at
Google Earth or I can do this 3d flyover
thing and you see how it overlays my
route in light blue that's where I'm
going to go you've got other colors over
here for traffic
you've even got traffic on nan freeways
non major arterials the detail res is
actually quite good
anything from global view to zip write
down and see the color of a building now
the last part of this related to all
this is while you've got that SIM card
and they're doing all this wireless
internet why not share that with your
mobile devices and you can do that also
now we did find on an iPhone 4 and an
iPad one is we couldn't get this thing
to connect I think it's a security layer
thing we tried all security layers
none of them would work but my Android
device my Droid 2 hooked right up no
problem so before you get in love with
this cheque without e2 make sure it's
compatible with your Apple device the
current level of iOS or whatever device
you're carrying now the gear shift gets
us into the world of a lot of backup and
nudge in technologies you see we've got
trajectory 3 zone boxes they do them in
shades of blue you've also got front and
rear park sensors that are giving these
zone bars around this overview pictogram
of the car you can go to the just
graphics screen if that works better for
you you've got lots of settings here
about the volume of the beeps and how
much it beeps how fast this car has an
almost amazing stop it absurd level of
customization
whatever you think of these cars
prettiest damn engines on the road
nice castings beautiful kind of a
sandblast finish on everything some red
accents and everything's been finished
three litre v6 that has the power of a
v8 they do that by having one of those
guys that's the blower the supercharger
never mind the T in the name it's not a
turbo it's a supercharged motor this
delivers 310 horsepower 325 foot-pounds
of torque whenever you've got the turbo
of the blower torque tends to be a
little higher than horses zero to sixty
for a 4,200 pound car kind of a chunky
guy in 5.4 seconds very nice while still
delivering 18 28 mpg that's not going to
break the bank it always goes out to all
four wheels which is also going to bring
down the mpg a little so those numbers
are even more impressive Quattro
all-wheel drive and the only gearbox
available is an 8-speed Tiptronic
automatic as I mentioned this car does
not have an overwhelming engine but man
does it deliver the power is absolutely
effortless like I'm merging onto a
freeway now at a 90 degree turn with a
bunch of traffic and I have no concern
and that's why how out of the hole boom
but without any kind of raw uneven
punchiness from the engine this car has
just got it around town totally
tractable nothing about it feels like
it's all hand in because the engines not
over-the-top the powertrain is enough
with enough in reserve I love cars like
that where I can use 60 or 70% of the
car on a regular basis as opposed to
like 20% in a car that's just over
brawny those are not fun to me
as I mentioned totally silky all the
inputs are great the pedals the wheel
gearshift
even the knobs and the switch gear
everything has just the right feel to
him I'm really big fan of living with
this car day to day
okay let's price an a7 Sportback now
it's in the a6 class so the price isn't
bad right out of the gate for the
premium base trim
it's about $60,000 delivered but to go
CNET style you got to spend 3600 more to
get up to Premium Plus that brings you a
ton of stuff you've got navigation you
got the Google you got the wiki stuff
you've got the wireless internet through
the car itself
you've got the Wi-Fi hotspot in the
vehicle the full front and rear package
of sensors and camera the voice command
it's one of the better price packages
out there that is based on navigation I
would do it absolutely what I wouldn't
do is spend $6,000 for a Bang and
Olufsen sound system that has never
sounded like $6,000 to my ears and there
are also some other pricey options I'm
going to cost you several thousand more
to get things like adaptive cruise to
get the pre collision warning stuff and
that's based on adaptive cruise and that
would also get you the night vision
assist that shows pedestrians in
different colors as they get closer to
your trajectory</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
