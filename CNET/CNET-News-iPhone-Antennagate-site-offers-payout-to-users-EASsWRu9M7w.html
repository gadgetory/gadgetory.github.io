of 2010 it was an instant hit this is
really hot selling nearly 2 million
units in the first three days but the
phone's new design instantly sparked
lawsuits claiming the phone was
defective because of reception issues I
think when you're grabbing it like with
your whole hand you're covering up some
part of the antenna and that's part
that's messing you up people started
calling this phenomenon the antenna gate
which is kind of like Watergate than any
other sort of scandal primarily because
Apple didn't really talk about it for a
couple weeks to appease angry customers
Apple began offering free cases to solve
the problem but still the lawsuits
persisted and just last month a
settlement was reached and Apple agreed
to pay out $15 to qualified users in
terms of size this covers of an
estimated 25 million people in the class
so times 15 dollars per bumper that's
about 375 million dollars they should
have tried to take care of it before it
ever happened you know and before they
release it but at least they're doing
something the newly launched web page
iPhone for settlement comm explains the
rules of eligibility claims need to be
filed by August 28th in San Francisco
