light 500 kit from Netgear now 1200
because it promises to offer up to 1,200
megabit per second of conditioned speed
but before I got to all excited that's a
lie I take a look here this adaptor come
with a gigabit network port and that
means doesn't matter what type our line
connection is to put on the inside be
1200 or 2,000 or 20,000 the most it can
do is 1000 at megabit per second which
is the speed of the network port and
even that is not true because in my
testing it has to sustain real one speed
of some 400 megabits per second or half
of a real gigabit connection so the bad
news is the speed is completely over
advertised which is quite common among
networking devices the good news is this
is the fastest I've seen for a powerline
adapter so 1200 megabit per second not
so much the fastest it is now as you can
see here the power to 100 come with two
identical adapter and that's because you
need at least two adapter to create the
very first power connection you plug the
first one to your existing router and
then the second one to a Ethernet rarely
divide such as a TV a computer or a
printer and then plug both of them into
the wound socket and you're done
they've been turn the electrical wiring
between the two of them into the network
cable so basically this is a convenient
and very clean way to extend your white
network as opposed to running the actual
network cable so after the first
connection you can add more devices to
the existing powerline network by using
an additional adapter for an extra
device now you know you can add up to 16
devices for one up our network and that
bring up to the question of cost and the
good news is this kit here is not very
expensive costing to some $80 for two
adapters now these adapters are
compatible with all the power adapter
from other vendors but if you want to
get
the best performance you do not want to
mix them with other for more this one
here and also about power networking
check out my full review as cnet.com
basically if you want to get the fastest
probably adapt to our market get them
now because if you wait for a little bit
there might be others coming out soon
that are even faster and that's no lie
because I'm don't know this has been the
first look at the power light 1200
adapter kit from that year</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
