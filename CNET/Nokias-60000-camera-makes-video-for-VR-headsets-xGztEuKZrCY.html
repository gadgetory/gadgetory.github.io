not for you but you could benefit from
what it can do anyway it's not years ozo
camera let's take a look now let's start
by saying that you're not going to buy
this camera and the reason is that it
costs sixty thousand dollars but it's
not really for consumers is for
professional video makers and the reason
it's of interest is because it's covered
in cameras so it can shoot 360 video of
the kind that work with VR headsets look
at all these people so 360 video in
virtual reality a tip to be a huge new
thing in the next few years of
technology but they're going to face a
similar problem that's faced by things
like 3d and 4k that is if there's
nothing to watch then it's not going to
be possible for the technology to really
get much uptake that's where this camera
comes in covered in sensors Miguel to
record sound from all over it's perfect
for capturing the kind of mind-bending
virtual reality 360 stuff that's really
really immersive and really really fun
to play around with those early days yet
but we donned a headset and how to play
with some footage that's been shot using
this ozo camera and I have to say it was
looking pretty cool this is a really
interesting idea and I think it's really
encouraging for the future of these VR
headsets that we are starting to see
cameras that can make footage for them
start to emerge I'm really hoping that
in the next few years maybe we see
smaller more affordable versions that we
can actually take on holiday and he's
out and about everyday situations that
kind of thing anyway for much more text
