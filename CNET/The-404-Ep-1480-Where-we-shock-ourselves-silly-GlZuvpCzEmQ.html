and from our CBS studios in New York
City welcome to the 404 what's up
everyone thank you for tuning in to the
404 show I'm Jeff Bakalar I'm Justin you
I hope you guys are having a great day
today we sure are we got a lot of
stories to get to and some emails some
interactions yeah and what we got going
on today man I like to show yesterday I
did 21 because I didn't have to deal
with it but two is just a really funny
episode photo was too right I realized
he's gonna kind of break your balls that
much the first time Marc Maron was on
the show he seemed kind of nice he was
really low key and I feel like the
second time around the fact that he was
a little bit meaner is a good thing I
thought that probably means he was
trying to run you through the wringer
yeah he likes you and you can clearly
take it well that's what I would I mean
that's how my gorgeous dick well he's
definitely like that's illegal pretty
prickly right he's a little rough but
like I'll be totally honest yesterday
was one of the my favorite interviews
I've ever done really definitely I had
so much fun doing that yeah so a lot of
people emailed and they were like it was
good an awkward but like awkward but
some people were saying was kind of
awkward I think because if you don't
know who mark mayor razon you're like
why is this guy burn so much about
what's behind the T sure sure sure sure
he kind of blew us up who's funny though
it was really funny and he found my
contact solution which I've actually
been looking for I nice that's good at
least someone got something positive out
of that damn I um no I really did enjoy
it i thought it was awesome I like I
said I I don't think I've had more fun
interviewing somebody and I i don't know
maybe people like didn't get it where it
was sort of this like joshing around
thing yeah but you're totally right like
I only really bust balls people who I
who are like and that's all I do like
for my friends all I do is make fun of
them I don't even like care like I don't
ask them how they're doing it's just non
stop making fun that's how his podcast
is too sure basically sitting down for
an interview
with marc maron is like getting into a
fight with your girlfriend or boyfriend
or your essay whatever I'd much rather
interview mark Mayer and then fight with
my secular it always starts off really
angry and you say things you don't mean
and then eventually towards the end of
the 45-minute interview you just start
feeling like the okay what are we both
going to work on he outlook I mean I
know it was all good spirited cuz he
wrote me after any sites like that was
fun he's like I'm a ballbuster you could
take a that's great it's cool yeah so I
I had a blast I really can't be any
happier now that way so yeah go back to
yesterday show and listen to it and I I
got emails from people who said like
look I've never listened to your show on
gathering I'm as I've never listened to
show but that was great oh cool yeah
thought so if we can get one new
listener from yesterday yeah that's all
I care about if I had been sitting up
here if it was me or REO I feel like we
would have pulled the jack black in high
fidelity and just taking one of his
microphone thing like I newegg site i
nothing went off course yesterday yeah
nothing happened yesterday where I was
like oh I didn't but I was a curveball I
was perfect you can't let too much time
pass after his insult before your time
back I thought I was on even up with him
right yeah I think I didn't I think that
was the best part of that it was fine
you can probably hear my laughter in the
background yeah that episode which is
either good but I heard of while we were
shooting yeah I like it or not I'm there
but seriously such a blast I had such a
good time within go back and listen to
yesterday's show all right back to
reality what do we have cooking today
alright so today we have a bunch of
episode of bunch of stories i'm really
excited to talk about we talk about
zapping your brain with spark plugs to
improve your video gaming skills okay
totally normal that sounds fine um then
we're gonna talk about how jack black is
playing to single-handedly bring
everybody back to vinyl I'm really
excited to talk about the jack white
word I said Jack Black that's a second
jack black referee yet I dartium Jack
White although jack black is very
talented me is he's a great musician um
then we're going to talk about a
start-up that's straining the
relationship between the rich and the
poor even more in San Francisco that's
already a really strange relationship
but they're basically auctioning off
public spaces will tell you how they're
doing that
why people are pissed off about it then
we'll talk about some video game news
Nintendo continues to post devastating
losses bed is really really bad so in
advance of e3 which is coming up we're
going to talk about maybe what we can
expect from the company and then we're
gonna finish up a story about Ed Boon
who's the creator of mortal kombat he's
been tweeting out some sort of
mysterious numbers right we've been
talking about like cryptography lately
and and numbers and things so he's doing
his own an extra mystery for you guys
the end of this the episode today great
and then some emails will get to if we
can let's dive right in yeah alright so
electroshock therapy you haven't really
heard about it in a while she was look
around upon usually frowned upon but
still being used to treat depression and
schizophrenia is it realize you sure
yeah in this country in this country
yeah but I mean obviously it's done with
a lot of anesthesia and clinicians
looking around two to make sure you're
okay okay it's not a DIY I think you
don't just shock yourself yeah they
don't like make it chomp down on a
wooden spoon no wait I did yeah I keep
seeing the vision of like American
Horror Story yeah in my head when I when
I hear shock the wait I haven't watched
that the second season they did that a
lot they just hook people up to like
yeah it was like it's crazy insane
asylum and they thought they could like
shock the madness out of people right I
think it works I don't know if it's a
placebo thing or just forcing people to
concentrate but right either way hobby
is the right they're always trying to
take a DIY approach to things and in
this case a small group of interested
parties they're learning how to zap
their own brains using this sounds crazy
but a battery with alligator clips
connected to a circuit and two kitchen
sponges those sponges are attached to a
simple sweatband you know that you could
buy it any sports store they rig that up
put it on their head and then using that
battery they'll actually send electrical
pulses into their own brain doc you
don't want to do that and it's this is
funny in this picture it's great
Achilles he's just like I love being
shocked yeah and that's the thing is
when you imagine people doing this I
don't know for me I'm always imagining
like some like meth head or coke ad in a
basement somewhere in the middle of
America but this is actually
professionals select sort of middle-aged
professionals um that's that's being
profiled here in this homebrew so I mean
I think it's fair that we separate like
you know electroshock therapy yeah from
DIY like brain stimulation hmm like one
thing like if you've ever gone through
physical therapy there's what do they
call a machine oh the chiropractic
machine with a strap the thing that like
stimulates your mother's right but
actually we're kind of talking about
here sort of yeah we're not talking
about actual like yeah yeah that's an
extremely the Looney Tunes version and
there's now that you don't like you know
take off machine come right from your
skull yeah exactly right so there's a
big difference here yeah so this is
we're talking about 2 milliamps of
electricity which is less than a 9-volt
battery right and anyone who's ever
licked a 9-volt battery before perfectly
healthy just saying my childhood was
weird yeah it's not that bad so you're
basically sending 2 milli amps of
electricity through the part of your
brain that controls reaction time which
is a prefrontal cortex among other
things besides the reaction and we're
talking about here is hopefully with
doing this and this is what a lot of the
proponents of it say that it can help
with memory loss or things like rapid
learning if you have a you know a big
test coming up in your student you can
shock yourself into studying better and
some are taking it to alleviate chronic
pain depression even things like stroke
recoveries you're losing movement or
things like that they're hoping that
shock therapy can help with alongside
physical therapy and it's working you
know a lot of academic papers and that's
what this wired article is talking about
scientists and doctors are starting to
consider it again as a significant way
to research alternative health methods
but they're sort of taking a summer
taking it upon themselves to build a
community out of it and even try to make
money on it yeah that's always what's
going to happen you know they're going
to be like oh this will cure your XYZ
yeah yeah so click on this other link
that I put in the run
down when I talk about others
capitalizing on it I found this one
product in my research for this and it's
called the c1 where was that did the
transcranial direct current stimulation
for gamers yeah so it's called the folk
us and you can go to FOC dot us the
focus o folk us one of us yeah of and so
they're basically capitalizing on what
they call tDCS that transcranial direct
current stimulation okay and you can see
it in this picture here the company is
marketing an electroshock headset for
gamers it's basically a headband that
you know attached to those frontal lobes
to increase the plasticity of your brain
of your brain and make synapses fire
faster by overclocking it hopefully
reducing your reaction times and
increasing your skill level and playing
video games okay let's be honest how
many of these if they sold a lot Noah
yes what is wrong with you yeah it's
crazy what are you doing buying a shock
machine for video games well so they had
a first round of funding right and they
were offering pre-orders they sold out
the first batch of 300,000 then there
was a second batch of 300,000 they also
manufactured after that those all sold
out immediately to and now you can pre
Doria third the hell's our logo doing
there yeah we've written about it too uh
scary part what pisses me off is that
they're there they're passing it off as
overclocking your brain yeah yeah it's
basically like we've talked about
transhumanism in the past is making
yourself sort of a machine cyborg right
this is the first step in that the cool
thing about this is the way they market
it so not only do they say that while
you wear the headband and you're playing
it will increase your skill level when
you take it off your brain sort of
remains in this neuro plasticity mode
which means even after you remove it
your brain is still hardwired to learn
faster according to what their marketing
says okay so sounds kind of cool you
know if you can increase your
intelligence even after you take it out
more reaction time right reaction time
yeah technically that I think the thing
that's uh worth noting here is that
there
able to skirt FDA policies but you know
advertising it as a video game Oh
accessory and so a lot of DIY tDCS
proficient are using this but not for
video games are using it to increase
their memory or for the stroke stuff
everything we talked about earlier it's
not expensive it's 250 now it's
expensive that expensive i mean it's
less than the over if your brains less
than the oculus there's nothing that if
it works and I mean I don't know talk
about just video game accessories in
general I just don't like the the way
they're advertising yeah they're saying
use the Force let the force of
electricity excite your neurons into
firing faster okay when i read that i
read Oh shock your brain that's not
something I want to do yeah if with an
iphone app that's connected to it by
bluetooth 30 day money back guarantee so
if you're not completely a vegetable by
the end of the month yeah you can get
your money back the technology isn't
necessarily what worries me it's how
small the manual is and the fact that
people can control this themselves yeah
like there's so much room for error here
at the first death is going to be coming
really soon for really whoa I don't know
if we should say that no I mean like
what if you get wet or something in your
using this with that fry your brain or
it could all just be BS right like maybe
the electro shocks aren't enough to do
anything I think all the tools no I
definitely think that's the case yeah
right this is like the equivalent of
like you know those bracelets people
wear right well over it like help their
balance yeah they think there's like
some magnet like the the polar magnets
of the planet are gonna make them like
right walk better yeah you've seen that
people in malls like kiosks they have
those on that did you like a series of
tests like oh look check it I can't put
your arm down there wearing this band
right exists because they've already
pushed around at once you know the force
I mean we're in agreement this is like
the same category right maybe I mean I
would there no no like if I'm gonna buy
with this BS that they're shoveling yeah
I'm gonna need testimonies from like MIT
people yeah right we're the like yet
freakin makes you uh the susceptible to
learn better yeah
have faster reaction time you could say
that any bozo being like you know if
you're like pulling an all-nighter and
it's four in the morning then a couple
electroshocks to keep your focus yeah
it's probably gonna do you good even if
it doesn't do anything to your brain
just to keep you paying attention and
not falling asleep I put this in the
same category as the magnetic bracelets
which are complete and the
stuff were like people you know I am I
once had a friend who want to quit
smoking oh yeah and he tried he couldn't
do it mmm so he went and got shocked
okay I'm like a guy ruins yeah just
something like some guy in a garage with
Queens and explain to my friend that the
nicotine receptors are located
conveniently behind your ear lobe and he
got shot yeah right got shocked reco I
need to stop smoking it's not clearly
that's but it's not the fact
that your receptors in your ear it's the
fact that you are doing something
traumatic and you are like introducing
this very radical and unconventional
process into your life that I think acts
as what you said a placebo effect and
says okay I'm gonna quit smoking yeah
I'm gonna do whatever or my brain is
gonna fire quicker or it develops this
response to where you know like if he
every time you think about smoking you
remember this pain that you felt and
maybe that would was not even pain like
he said it didn't hurt at all it was it
was like that massaging thing for the
physical therapy yes Cole want it's some
sort of like stimulus I know what you
mean I have no ideas to sell it as a
workout thing yeah yeah they really work
your build up his abs out you have
patches in like you can sit on the couch
e popcorn and be working yeah does that
work no it doesn't work that worked
everybody would be blending I guess
there is some sort of benefit in
physical therapy yeah definitely for
people that have tight muscles or things
like that from sitting in a right office
chair all day that might be BS 2 i'm
about chiropractic it really feel like
the entire practice of chiropractic work
is BS you're not gonna really hear a big
argument for me on that I mean both of
us have seen a lot of chiropractors for
different reasons no I've never been you
haven't seen one
might as we've talked about this days
went to one I below minutes into the
appointment I like leaned over like
stays disguise yeah and she's like I
know but it's free so I'm just gonna
hang out it'd be better if they did all
have that like soft Asian music playing
with like the waterfall great on my
dream catchers everywhere yeah like they
take the holistic approach with and just
went full on clinical went clinical with
there's none of dudes wearing white lab
coat yeah that would make it a little
bit more confidence you're gonna lie to
me give me the whole package yeah sell
it to me yeah don't wear kimono when you
come out exactly and don't like say like
before you enter my room gotta take off
my shoes and like wash my hands in this
special water yeah yeah yeah but the
machine I feel like they just hook you
up to that so they don't have to be in
the room to see you react to the
 yeah it's it's not good either
way we're talking up this stuff's yeah
category it's not going to kill you but
it isn't doing anything you want a big
stimulus you want a big kick in the ass
drink a double espresso that is
guaranteed to make you more responsive
and write a little more hyper right like
that's like when I need to pick me up
before a hockey game I take a shot of
espresso and yeah it works I can explode
my heart but either way every once in a
while and that desired result yeah a
little bit of Ritalin never hurt anybody
either that I can't endorse okay
caffeine I can um so that's
transhumanism let's move on to a subject
a little less serious Jack White so Jack
Wyatt has a label called third man
records right and anybody who's read
stuff about the white stripes or Jack
White's record label third man he's all
about vinyl I mean he's really
single-handedly pushing pushing it back
into the mainstream so what's really
cool about this record label third man
is that apparently they don't put out
CDs at all you can't buy CDs of any of
their albums just records or digital
releases only all right I feel like
that's what it should be yeah and is I
putting out 45 still he's putting out
singles it's really cool stuff um but
we're talking about his next album that
he just announced called Lazzaretto mmm
it's coming out on May tenth so pretty
soon and uh last month they'd previously
announced a special package version
called the vault the vault version that
included special
artwork and a 40-page hardbound book
some really cool extras but now they've
announced an even crazier ultra LP
version that's what they're calling it
it's cool the ultra LP version that's
seriously for the biggest vinyl geek in
your life sorry I think you might be
stoked about this as much as i am so
there's a video that goes along with
this announcement it takes Jack White
nine minutes and 10 seconds for him to
describe all of the specific details and
features you'll get with it but I'm
gonna break it down with you because
nobody wants to watch 10 minute video
about that especially if Jack White yeah
here the coolest thing is about it first
the weird thing about this vinyl is that
side a actually has backward grooves so
you start the record off by playing it
closest to the label okay right normally
you start on the edge side a starts
towards the label still have to play it
in reverse and then it comes back out
okay which is cool i mean the song is
itself aren't in reverse so how it
appears on the record okay to me that's
pointless well okay like nothing cool
about that really well it's like it you
changes nothing here's why it's cool
okay because um you know how on the
leeward school you know how like on the
last song when you put it closest to the
closest to the label once the record
finishes on one side it kind of just
continues to loop back and forth it's
called a locked groove right right and
the locked grooves normally there so
that the needle just jump out into the
little room in the needle yeah yeah so
it just kind of continues back and forth
on this locked groove well he put the
locked groove on side a on the outermost
edge and then he put a little sound bite
on that so once you get to the edge of
side-a which is the on the outermost
it'll kind of just play this infinite
loop of a little sound bite that's cool
it's really cool you could do that in
the middle to you can do that in the
middle too but just the fact that it
kind of plays from the inside I was just
yeah yeah sure you got did you have to
have the the record go in the opposite
direction great yeah yeah the record I
think the record goes in the opposite no
no I don't think it does wouldn't know
it sounds like it's just the way was cut
yeah that it also the group will follow
yeah it still goes off so yeah same
direction right inside to the odd okay
um kind of confusing to explain but
that's pretty cool it'll play that
little tone forever here's the other
thing so on side two when you flip it
over the first song on side two actually
has two different intros that lead into
the same part in the middle that's cool
the first part is acoustic the second
part is electric so depending on where
you drop the needle on the outermost
groove or the one directly next to it
you'll either hear the intro played
electrically with amps or acoustically
with an acoustic guitar it's really cool
so no matter what you do no matter which
you choose they'll eventually converge
into the middle of the sauce awesome but
normally yeah really awesome that's red
and then finally this is I think the
coolest thing there's actually two
hidden tracks underneath the center
label on both sides of the record Wow so
if you drop the needle directly onto the
paper itself it'll play these hidden
songs through the paper it'll play
through the pain yeah crazy right but
here's even nuttier thing is one side of
the hidden track is 78 rpms right okay
normally a records played at 33 rpms
this one plays at 78 RPM this but when
you flip it over the other hidden track
on side B is 45 rpms so this record all
together technically has three speeds
you can play it it's got three speeds
yeah 3 that's amazing so nuts right it's
very cool I mean he's clearly unlike
this vinyl kick yeah but I just I mean
I'm into it I don't you know I don't
know a lot of people who sell record
players yeah I mean for those who do
have a good place it's I feel awful to
heal is that it's the novelty is in
paying more attention to it having all
the details you get with the labels and
the artwork and the inserts this just
adds way more fun to it and it's only 20
bucks yeah so you can pre-order for
twenty bucks that's you know less than
the cost for what you would pay it a lot
of use vinyl stores only Jack why can
get away with this yeah all right so
cool um it's funny to bring that up
because i was looking today at one of my
favorite bands mastodon and they have a
their new record they're doing like this
massive pre-release for and it's like a
seventy dollar thing
and it's two LPS yeah that's cool and
I'm just like everyone's into that into
that movement now yeah and it's cool
because a lot of those albums will come
with a ticket to the show in ready so
you'll get both and then when you go to
this show itself a lot of the merch
tables will include special press vinyl
like colored vinyl sold only at that
show that's pretty cool too it is cool I
mean it's I don't know I'm just a fan of
anything limited edition when you say
something is limited edition I will buy
I don't care it's one of two million
i'll still get into it as long it's
labeled so I just uh I don't know if I'm
like you know ready to like change the
whole way I listen to music around yeah
it does feel good to start paying for
keys finally oh I'm like I'm not even
know we are generation I will say to
keep abroad got away with you know not
paying for music for 20 years 25 years
so if you could put a little bit of my
back is that what it is we're just like
this whole big guilt thing basically I
feel like I'm taking it off my shoulders
one record this doesn't absolve you of
all your frickin transgressions not me o
our so yeah I mean a lot of these bands
are doing that and I'm not gonna like I
was super intrigued when I saw the
macedon thing look at this it's like to
180 gram LP vinyls for exclusive
lithographs derived from album artwork
yeah and then you get the CD as well the
digital version yeah that's pretty rad
man that's a crazy-looking cover right
oh my God look at the artwork is bonkers
oh Christ all the drugs in the world can
explain where this came from wait go up
as let's say that you're getting it
you're gonna get an advance copy of the
next release they put out no so mean so
you'll get uh you get the two shooting
two records right that's what the to 180
gram LP means right yeah that was that
bottom uh notes say the download of
another album oh you'll get another so
they'll give you a digital version of
one of the songs before its release ah
so the next single own this way right
okay God 70 bucks though that's a lot of
money all right
yeah two records doesn't have nine
minutes worth of features like Jack
White this is very cool man I'm into it
Brad yeah all right there you have it so
what's next you want to talk about San
Francisco I do I think this is really
awesome man not only is that place
literally sinking into the ground it's
also sinking economically right now it's
not a good place to be in San Francisco
unless you have a ton of money yeah it's
super expensive there there make it's
starting to make New York look
affordable yeah the rent is actually
cheaper in New York than it is in san
fran I never thought I'd see the day
where in other cities having cheaper
rent yeah yeah neither so listen to this
an Italian company is testing a new
service in SF called monkey parking and
monkey parking lets drivers auction off
their parking spot before they leave
through an app so if you're about to
leave a busy mall or something before
you you know back out of the parking
spot you fire up this app you can charge
anywhere between five and twenty dollars
there's buttons for each denomination
you just hit twenty bucks then everyone
else gets to see the open parking spots
for sale in your area if you're sick of
looking for one just hit that 20 and
then it will link up between your phones
and you're ready to pull in after that
the pyramid scheme yeah basically and it
may be illegal it's I don't know if it's
illegal it doesn't to me this doesn't
matter if it's illegal yeah cuz it's
kind of silly difficult to find what if
the pyramid scheme because if this were
like pervasive everywhere you would just
get the money back from selling your
spot after oh the last guy would get
jacked when the demand for pardon goes
down breasts there's no one willing to
pay for his or spot or I could just see
it becoming a thing where people just go
and hoard parking spots before like a
big game or something like I say a
playoffs game like for the Giants sure
like yeah they would just go and take 20
spots an auction off make to you know
it's it's pretty bad it is pretty
disgusting yeah what they're trying to
do like I get it it's it's like taking
the whole I call like the web
three-point oh with like uber and fresh
direct and all that stuff like yes sir
you're taking that and you're like
exploiting that to the to the end of its
you know yeah it's a commodifying every
party
life is like Airbnb you know everything
for every brigham about April upon him
some oxygen would you like to buy the
essay all right coming today pages son
of a bitch right we're gonna come to
Beijing here we have one cubic foot of
free clean air get out of here what
about so like what if I'm coming out of
the mall and whatever happened to the
whole like I'm gonna follow this guy to
his car razmik no I already sold it to
that Buick behind you yeah yeah or what
if you pull up to a spot and it's a
compact and you have a truck and you've
already paid twenty bucks for it oh
you're really really foolish hairs here
you know like they won't forget swooped
yeah that always happens i've done that
to people before big dick oh you're the
worst kind of driver come on I've never
done that yes you have oh don't drive
first step is admitting it I think for
the city they're worried that it's gonna
take money away from potential spots
with parking meters yeah and the parking
meter money is used to go back into the
infrastructure for the city to billboard
lanes and things like that well that's
where parking monkey the worst name our
game doesn't matter it's the worst name
ever is the worst name ever you've ever
come up with yeah italian company it's
terrible they should give a cut back to
the city yeah cisco if they don't want
to look like total assholes people are
already so pissed off about corporate
buses from google and things like this
yeah an attack parking in where the muni
bus is pull up to pick people up there
already pissed about that and then
silicon valley in general boosting the
prices of rent and stuff like that so
what we're saying is moved to san fran
yeah yeah that's what we're saying
you're gonna get in a fight coming back
from the airport that's the takeaway
it's getting insane over there it's not
now when i was in singapore by the way
side note on parking they have parking
down to a science there it's very
organized so every structure you have or
parking lot whether it's public or
private they all have a digital sign
Lamar key in the front that shell that
shows you exactly how many spots are
left brilliant and then when you pull in
there are arrows that are directing you
to the closest spot to you more
brilliant yeah and then that number
ticks down but each spot also has lights
above them that turn red or green
depending on if they're full or empty so
you can see immediately even if you
don't have a sign in front of you
as we look like it looks like this right
looks like this a little bit little
green spot over the brilliant what this
is why we can't have nice things it's so
f is this not here in this country why
is this not in New York the hardest
place on earth to park a car and they're
everywhere too I don't know it's great
you don't have to worry about pulling in
somewhere in finding a lunch circling
and circling maybe that's why it's
called parking monkey because you feel
like a monkey after you've circled a lot
so many times still the worst name ever
man it just is not really good to be
Nintendo these days yeah I you know it's
getting worse and worse and worse and
they just put out their earnings last 12
months Nintendo has lost four hundred
and fifty seven million dollars the Wii
U has only sold two point seven two
million units in the last 12 months at
this rate they could potentially run out
of cash it used to be like oh they have
so much cash in the bank it doesn't
matter they can do this for 50 years now
that it's exponentially rising in terms
of losses they can really see like a
wall at the end of this tunnel that is
insane so last quarter nintendo sold how
much 310,000 yeah we use we use which is
not a LAN trast that to the PlayStation
4 which sold seven million since last
November yeah that is crazy it's insane
the 3ds is doing pretty well but um you
know they're only for cat forecasting
3.6 million wii u sales in this current
fiscal year i wonder if it's an issue
with marketing and not just television
commercials ever see a lot of those
butts across the board yeah so i want i
went into a gamestop the other week to
my friend to buy Mortal Kombat and I
noticed that all of the advertisements
for like work for like titanfall or were
for playstation 4 xbox one and then they
had like a very very small Wii U section
well there's a bad games yeah and there
were no games for it at all in addition
just not being demoed either you know
like there were consoles for both of
those but there was no wii u demo mhmmm
I don't know I'm sure maybe that's like
a very small part of it but you think
it's a marketing deal I think it's
everything I think the games are not
worth paying 50 bucks for I think the
software on the system sucks in terms of
like the firmware it's a big clunky
controller that note that has terrible
battery life and is completely
alienating to anyone who picks it up um
it's the it was debuted in an awful way
it was debut too early in my opinion
people didn't know the you know the way
they described it to the press people
didn't realize you know if it was a wee
attachment or a brand new console
altogether more the mainstream media
outlets didn't get it it's bad it's
really really bad and I don't think
there's a way to save wii u if I'm
Nintendo I mean they've got a few highly
anticipated games coming down the pike
they have zelda coming out and maybe one
or two other gems like another mario
game it's my brother's smash brothers
coming out later this year they're in a
lot of trouble I say pull the plug on
with you yeah yeah I say could focus on
on the 3ds the one thing that does
appear to continue to make money and
just cut your losses because at this
point it's it's worse because they're
still like in denial about it especially
when we meet with them and they're like
here's why we use future's bright no man
it's not it really isn't yeah I don't
know like my chai if I told like 12 year
old 10 year old Jeff this was going to
happen in 2014 yeah he got he'd cry for
a few days it's got to be an issue with
simplicity right I feel like everybody
likes Nintendo because it's easy to play
you know you could just pick up a game
like a mario game and know how to play
it but with this there's such a big
learning curve there haven't they're
they're going through like an identity
crisis right now they're not competing
with Nintendo it with the Sony and
Microsoft they're just not in their
league anymore yeah uh they they bail
out at e3 press conferences two years in
a row now and you know people are sort
of wondering like what they're saving
grace but their move is and I don't
think they know either speaking of
finances i read an article about how
sony is actually really close to just
getting
bankrupt all of sony um with me you know
the Sony gaming division the only one
that's turning a profit records are my
like electronics and but yeah their
televisions for example their music has
gone down I read one report that there's
about 75% close to going bankrupt in the
next few years that's correct which
could lead to a sale of the Sony gaming
division off to someone else off to
someone else maybe Nintendo should buy
microsoft will look that that was always
like this amazing theory like Oh
Nintendo just merged with like Google or
you know or Apple or Apple or whatever
it is and then you that that's the thing
and they're like I've we've said in the
past there a very prideful company they
you know they Dale never really admit
defeat I think they really need to merge
or make a phone like make an android
phone yeah a Nintendo android phone I
would buy that oh yeah with a game
controller buildings were built in and
access to the entire vault of Nintendo
software do a netflix tile rental thing
where I can do for five dollars a month
I can buy and I can play any Nintendo
game like there are so many ideas and
they just haven't innovated man they
haven't done anything to keep up nachos
with Microsoft and Sony but with
everyone that is just every single day
cutting away at their market share it's
sad because everybody wants them to win
to have an excellent public perceptible
love ninten I loved in 10-11 play video
games I like seeing the characters it's
crazy and they just can't get it
together they can't get it together it's
very strange uh their marketing is just
not where it should be but where some
marketing is where it should be this is
a really interesting campaign being run
by Ed Boon one of the creators of mortal
kombat yeah you know i'm not gonna get
into like specifics of what he the
product he's actually promoting but he's
doing something really cool he's sending
out these sort of cryptic tweets that
all have numbers in them yeah he started
out with saying how many days are in a
leap year in February right and then he
that was 29 and he started counting out
28 and then he said man I love the
Simpsons and linked to a Simpsons video
with the number 27 in it he's counting
down to son
thing and the countdown he set to expire
a few days before e3 2014 so just what
is he leading up to we don't know is it
a new game involving you know his
company nether realm they make mortal
kombat they made injustice gods among us
which is a DC Comics fighting game
really good stuff is he ready to
announce another fighting game I would
think so hmm but I just thought the way
he's going at it pretty sick the hype is
thick yeah apparently Kiefer Sutherland
has confirmed that he's working on a
mortal kombat project could that be what
mr. ed boon is counting down to its
possible another monica another more do
that reboot that mortal kombat reboot
reboot best fighting game i played a
decade been playing planet sick right
amazing so good so I'd love to see you
know what's happening and we'll all find
out in just 27 short days cool all right
let's get to a few emails ah we got a
lot of contact we're still freaking
people out across the planet about the
UVB hidden messages number stations all
that stuff this I thought I wanted to
read because it was kind of like a
no-brainer and I just thought it was
funny that someone was telling us this
Kevin writes in and says hey I'd never
heard of that UVB 76 signal before but
after listening to that show I
immediately thought of the movie contact
yeah with Jodie Foster yeah we've heard
of that we've got that he said the idea
of that movie must have come from UVB 76
and it's ignora yeah so kind of kind of
had that in the back of her head yeah a
little bit Paul writes in about that
emer effort would have called to be
called you a mother effing i don't know
i think he is just really excited about
the concept we were talking about
putting headphones into the jacks of
every arm rescue right she goes in 30
seconds you guys effortlessly hit all of
my movie points my wife loves going in
the movies I don't for all the reasons
Justin had mentioned loud kids and
adults sitting next to a stranger for
three hours the texting idiots etc
and sticky floors off and you added that
what it sticky floors a problem for you
yeah I hate sticky floors I mean know
and enjoy sticky floors but i'm not i'm
not avoiding movie theaters because they
have sticky floor it's just soda it's
it's you know that guy soda it's know
what's a lot of thinking that's not what
I was thinking imagine how much of that
I was totally no I swear that's not what
I was thinking you know I was thinking
it was is like uh like dried butter that
like the liquid butter have you seen
that station they have at the Battery
Park movie theater there was yeah but I
mean that like so we saw this pump
station right next to the like we're all
the condiments are and they have this
like butter reservoir yeah of the pump
itself is so long that you can push it
down for like a solid 45 seconds and
just have streams of this liquid butter
coming out it is so there was this girl
that was literally just like holding a
bucket underneath pressing down and like
moving a bucket or like it was salsa
yeah for like a solid minute you just
watched its cracked in I'm sorry man you
know the guy to my left is talking about
how gross a butter you know fountain is
but I look at what you eat man it's not
much different she probably cleaned off
that you should clean that thing out
over the course of an hour and a half
and if you have measured that in a cup
I'm sure it would be I don't know so
holy earlier down oh my god okay bacon
sandwich Larry I'm sure there's no
butter in that process hava jizz all
right either way we totally identify he
says um he agrees the battery park city
AMC is legit that's the only place i go
it's tolerable but yeah we're hitting
first world problems here forever oh so
Ken sent us an email about the same
thing and he was telling us about how in
Korea they've opened up beats by dre
collaborative movie theaters I didn't
see that when i was there but he says
that all the seats have their studio
headphones built in just like we talked
about and then they all have one time
sanitary ear pads that you can wear on
and soon after really about your wax
problem solved yeah it's a collaboration
between cinema chain and korea called
cgv and beats electronics overall
bootleg beats by action
that's how that for ya is that I think
Chinese China has all the bootlegs Korea
might be okay Korea's legit but that
sounds pretty cool if we can get that
going with non beats by dre headphones
maybe a sound cancelling yeah I just and
you know it is though the second that
happens then the phones will start to
like really annoy you and stand out more
oh yeah there's just no way of getting
around it users have to wait two weeks
for the movie to come out on blu-ray
yeah that's how long its second and then
finally Kylie writes in and says I've
got two cents to add to the numbers
stations conversation my friend posits
that these number stations were
originally created and still used to
brainwash Russian prisoners I know
background like he has no further detail
that's it thinks that I think they might
be messages to Russian covert missions
or even signals into space as a we're
out here message sorry we out here not
we're out we're out here yeah still
sounds creepy as no yeah it's it's
creepy for sure I need some citations on
those claims I mean that they're not bad
but and claim anything yeah maybe a
little more about we don't need horses
you don't need a background check or a
reference or source to claim anything
nice yes 10 points if you know what
that's from finally some programming
notes that we need to tell you fine
