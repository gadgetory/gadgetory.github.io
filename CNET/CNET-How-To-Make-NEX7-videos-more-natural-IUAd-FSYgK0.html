become obsessed with this camera the
Sony nex-7 it's been out since 2012 but
I came across it when I was looking for
something that was compact but could
still shoot DSLR quality video now I've
been able to get some great video out of
the nex-7 but not without a few tweaks
it's a still camera first and foremost
and some of those camera settings can
work against you when you're trying to
shoot video for example an adjustable
shutter speed can be a great thing when
you're trying to shoot a really fast
action shot but when you're shooting
video it can create a weird strobing
effect now to show an example of what
I'm talking about
I'm gonna take a video of this bike tire
spinning now the camera right now is set
up at 24 frames per second which is the
default fill mode for the camera and a
shutter speed at about 400 which is what
you might get if you're just shooting in
like an automatic mode all right so I'm
gonna hit record spin the bite tire so
as you can see here at one four
hundredth of a second the shutter speed
is creating some strobing effect it
almost looks like the spokes are warping
a little bit it looks kind of cool but
not exactly a natural cinematic look now
to compensate for that we're gonna take
the shutter speed down to one fiftieth
of a second and you'll see now when I
spin the tire you're gonna see a much
more natural blurring of the spokes
that's a lot like what you'd see with
your naked eye now if you're shooting in
the 60 frames per second mode try
putting the shutter speed at one one
twentieth of a second now to even have
the option of changing the shutter speed
on this camera you have to be shooting
in either manual mode or shutter
priority mode to change that go into the
menu go into shoot mode and then spin
the dial until you find either manual
mode or shutter priority mode they're
right next to each other use the first
of the two dials here at the top of the
camera to adjust your shutter speed once
you've adjusted your shutter speed
you've probably noticed that your image
got a little brighter or a little dimmer
to fix that you'll need to adjust the
ISO and exposure settings to make up the
difference cranking down the ISO over
here using the scroll wheel will usually
be enough to do the trick
alright so that's how to shoot
natural-looking video on they Sony nex-7
by dialing in the shutter speed thanks
to the folks at camera dojo for first
publishing this tip for more how to's
head over to how to dot cnn.com i'm
donald bell go out and shoot some great
videos</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
