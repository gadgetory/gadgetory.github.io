let's talk about Windows 10 Microsoft
brand new operating system has been in
the wild for some time now as a preview
the launch of Windows 10 actually has
people buzzing because it looks like
Microsoft got the message after Windows
8 so let's count down the top 5 reasons
to upgrade to Windows 10 and number 5
it's free
how could Microsoft get you to upgrade
from the operating system you already
have to a new one how about not charging
for it
Microsoft Windows 10 is free for the
first year of availability for users of
Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 are you too
cheap to pay Microsoft nothing for a
brand new snazzy operating system
complete with a free redesign web
browser replacing Internet Explorer are
you number 4
Xbox streaming any Xbox one game can be
streamed to your Windows 10 desktop PC
laptop or tablet want to stream that
game without Windows 10
nope you're not doing that the full Xbox
experience lands on your Windows machine
as long as you're running Windows 10 on
the same network if you want a game
outside on your porch on your tablet
boom you can do that maybe somebody
doesn't want to hog in the TV but you
want a game boom Windows 10 takes care
of that too at number three is Cortana
part of Windows 10 is a personal
assistant called Cortana that you may
have seen on Windows Phone you'll be
able to ask Cortana to take care of
tasks look up things get reminders or
check the weather unlike previous
Microsoft assistants clipping Cortana is
generally well-liked
there are other personal assistants out
there like Siri and Google now but they
don't have the same integration with
your laptop like Cortana does number two
windowed modern apps if you've used
Windows 8 at all you're well aware of
the new style of apps that run in a
full-screen mode or can be snapped in
different ways on your screen however
those modern apps and those older
desktop apps didn't really live in the
same space Microsoft figured out
something with Windows 10 what about
putting apps in Windows Windows 10 uses
windows to manage applications all the
applications modern app you can run that
in the window older app you can run down
to a window too
it's brilliant but seriously windowed
modern apps are really useful before we
hit the number one reason to upgrade to
Windows 10 let's take a look at a few
reasons not to upgrade if you love that
charms bar on the side of the Windows 8
interface don't upgrade it's gone in
Windows 10 Windows Media Center
also got the accent windows 10 the app
used to be a part of Windows 7 and an
add-on for Windows 8 and then Windows 10
media centers officially dead
anyway on to number one the number one
reason to upgrade to Windows 10 is the
new Start menu when you click that Start
button on your keyboard you'll see an
old friend with a slightly new look I'm
talking about the Start menu that brings
along some live tiles with it by default
clicking the start button will not take
you to that otherworldly Start screen
that flung you out of a desktop or app
to a world of tiles by the way you can
opt in to having that Start button take
you to the Windows 8 style Start screen
in a setting but who's going to do that
Microsoft listen to tons of feedback and
brought back a Start menu that people
knew how to use in general
Windows 10 fixes everything wrong with
Windows 8 and takes the best parts of
Windows 7 and 8 to build a solid
operating system agree disagree let me
know for better or worse I do read the
comments on our YouTube page if you want
me to catch your feedback even faster
hit me up on Twitter I'm at Aya's for
