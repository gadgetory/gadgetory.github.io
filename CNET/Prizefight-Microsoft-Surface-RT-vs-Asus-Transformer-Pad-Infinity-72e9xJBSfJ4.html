tongue and tablets are still all the
craze so we're facing off to kings of
the ring it's a prize five-foot out
between the microsoft surface with
windows RT and the zeus Transformer Pad
Infinity with jellybeans all right guys
you can now stop drooling our judges for
this fight are senior editor Eric the
tank man Franklin senior editor Donald
Saved by the Bell and myself
can't go wrong Tom now we'll take all
three judges blind scores and average
them out to the nearest tenth of a point
the final prize fight score will be an
average of all rounds using the same
system let's throw some both round one
is design Microsoft Surface is the new
kid on the block with its large 10.6
inch screen and a very modern futuristic
design with its angular edges and what
Microsoft calls a vapor mag body but we
call it magnesium its unique form factor
also includes a thin and sturdy built-in
stand that flips out like a boss now the
asou strands former patent infinity is
still arguably the best-looking Android
tablet to date with its 10.1 inch screen
that boasts a higher 1920 by 1200
resolution display made of Gorilla Glass
2 and an all-metal body that stays as
classy as San Diego the drawback here is
that there hasn't been a major design
change to this line as sometimes the
judges get a little bored now I'm
digging both designs but the surface
gets a 4 and the Infinity pad gets a 3.7
next round is user interface and control
the surface runs on Windows RT and
visually it's a fresh experience with
its tiles interface that looks really
clean now the biggest challenge here is
the learning curve that initially feels
steeper than Android because it's an all
new OS so hold on tight because I'll
show you what I mean
now you can swipe through your tiles
pinch to see an overhead view of them
you can hold the tile and pull it up
slowly until it breaks free and then
move it around you can also pull up from
the bottom bezel to see all your apps
now you'll have your standard home
button here you'll swipe from the left
bezel to the center to move through open
apps or if you swipe in
then back out you'll see your recently
used apps now to close an app swipe from
the top bezel to the center until it
shrinks and then it closes it swipe in
from the right bezel brings up your
charms menu where you'll find settings
and search but it's not a universal
search that incorporates the web just
what's on the surface right now now on
your Start screen there's a desktop app
that takes you back into a standard
Windows desktop using office 2013 apps
throw you into this desktop interface if
you want to change something like more
advanced battery settings you'll get
thrown into here but you can't install
any apps here you'll just have to wait
for the full Windows 8 on the surface
pro to come out later now like I said
it's not the best pick-up-and-play OS
and staying in the tile interface is the
best experience right now but messing
with the desktop to use office or change
other system settings shows a disconnect
now the Zeus infinity brings the latest
available flavor of jelly bean and it
reaps the benefits with an improved
smoother and snappier experience you'll
still have all the Androids
customization with resizable widgets the
ability to create folders of apps
stacked on top of each other and Google
now is also part of the experience plus
you'll still get some of us oozes
customize settings to optimize how much
battery juice is being consumed jelly
bean is familiar and powerful and
arguably easier to use while Windows 8
shows a lot of promise if you're willing
to learn a whole new OS this one's tough
but we're calling this one a tie at
three point seven points a piece so
after averaging two rounds Microsoft
Surface has the lead next round is
features both tablets have keyboard
options that really enhance the user
experience the surface has its add-on
touch cover or type cover for an
additional 1:19 the type cover has more
prominent physical keys and it snaps
right in with a crunch and also becomes
the cover to protect the surface you
also can't do this with any other tablet
now combined with its built-in stand the
surface really positions itself as a
tablet that could actually replace your
laptop it also brings a micro SD card
slot that's a little awkwardly placed
behind the stand a micro HDMI port and a
full USB 2.0 port now the coolest
software feature is the split screen
mode where you can pull an
adapt into the right side of the screen
and voila you can also resize which app
has more importance to you now they're
smart glass app is a new initiative
they'll be pushing for with the Xbox but
it's just starting up probably its
biggest drawback it's the lack of a
robust library of apps and games it has
the key ones that most of you will be
just fine with like Netflix and Hulu but
we know apps can make a tablet more than
it is and right now the surface is
significantly behind both iOS and
Android but that will eventually change
now the Isuzu infinity pad screens
features with a quad-core NVIDIA Tegra 3
processor a micro HDMI and a micro SD
card slot on its body you can also add
its own keyboard dock that's really a
true keyboard if you're willing to pay
$149 for it now it's more naturally used
with its ergonomic angle and the keys
respondent feel like a laptop keyboard
and it closes together just like a
laptop on top of that the dock adds even
more battery life when it's connected a
full size USB port and a full SD card
slot you'll also have the benefits of
Google now with jellybean that gives you
relevant information like local traffic
weather and local businesses nearby plus
it's improved Google Voice Search is
still the most accurate for speech to
text and directions the assuit infinity
pad gets a 4.3 and the Microsoft Surface
gets a 3.7 next round is multimedia and
web browsing
the surface brings a sixteen by nine
screen that's slightly larger even if
its resolution is lower at 1366 by 768
pixels Microsoft's Internet Explorer 10
on the surface keeps the address bar at
the bottom and you can access other open
tabs by swiping from the top bezel it's
also flash compatible but here's the
catch only sites that are greenlit by
Microsoft for flash with IE 10 can use
them now pages loaded well it wasn't
slow but it wasn't as fast as what we've
seen in other mobile browsers its rear
and front facing cameras are 720p HD
cameras so video looks good but still
pictures aren't that great
now the Asuza infinity pad brings our
favorite mobile browser with chrome
that's speedy and clean and it includes
little bells and whistles like incognito
mode or find in page where you can even
jump to the specific instances of a word
in that page plus that brings a higher
resolution screen and an 8 megapixel
rear camera with a flash and 1080p video
capture that the surface just can't
compete with the Infinity tad takes
another round with the 4.3 and the
surface gets a 3.7 so after averaging 4
rounds a soos fought back to take the
lead but anything could happen the final
round that decides it all is performance
both of these tablets perform very well
but we had moments where the surface
might have hiccup launching apps where
some games just didn't play as smoothly
it was nothing major but still worth
mentioning and we expect it to get
better the surface held its own in our
video playback drain test that squeeze
out ten and a half hours of battery
juice and that's good now the Infinity
pad gets a performance boost thanks to
jellybean which really makes this a
snappier performing tablet in our
battery drain test we were able to
squeeze out 8.5 hours of video playback
when we had it set on balance power mode
which is respectable but if you add in
the extra boost from the keyboard duck
we were able to get thirteen point nine
hours of life in the final round via
soos infinity pad gets a four and the
surface gets a three point three so
let's average out all five rounds and in
a battle where the Microsoft Surface
jumped on top early the assist
Transformer Pad Infinity fought back in
the last three rounds taking this battle
for 23.7 and is your prize fight winner
the tablet wars are far from over and
the surface is a solid first entry that
will only improve over time but the
isuzu infinity pad reigns supreme
as one of the best 10-inch tablets i'm
brian tom thanks for watching we'll
catch you guys next time for another
prizefight
