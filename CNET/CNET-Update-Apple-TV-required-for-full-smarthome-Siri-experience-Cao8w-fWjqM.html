but it's a bit complicated I'm Bridget
Carey this is your CNET update your
iPhone can be your smart home control
center you can give Siri commands to
turn the lights on and off when you're
away from home but to do that you need
an Apple TV set-top box that's right
your iPhone or iPad will not do it alone
Apple's TV box is required to control
smart home gadgets with Siri voice
commands when you're away from home I
know that's a lot of ifs and winds if
you do not have an Apple TV the only way
to control home gadgets with your voice
is if your phone is connected to your
home's Wi-Fi network but only talking to
Siri from home just isn't as magical
wouldn't you say smart home technology
can be a headache to understand set up
and sync generally speaking each of your
smart home gadgets such as smart
switches lights or thermostats all can
be controlled with an app but Apple
wanted to tie all these different
gadgets under one standard it calls home
kit if a gadget is home kit compatible
it responds to voice commands with Siri
but you may find the experience messy in
these early days as an example let's
look to the first product that works
with Siri controls and home kit the
cassettes a starter kit costs 230
dollars and it's programmed especially
for working with Siri in our test we
found it easy to give voice commands to
change the lights that is it was easy on
the Wi-Fi home network doing this off
the home network with Apple TV was a
whole other story Sina editor Megan
Willerton found that the Apple TV
connection was acting wonky and kept
quitting on her during her review and
she's troubleshooting it with Apple as
of this report when you're installing
any smart home device you might as well
prepare yourself to be on the phone with
tech support that goes for any product
it comes with the territory of being an
early adopter and keep in mind if all
else fails you can just control Lutron
with its own app everything I'm talking
about here comes down to the power of
controlling it with Siri voice commands
and for controlling things on the Apple
watch it's hard to understand why Apple
would require its
Apple TV set-top to make things work
when you're away from home but maybe the
company will address more of this at
it's big conference on Monday and as for
the Apple watch the company announced
that in two weeks you'll be able to
purchase one in stores before you had to
order online to get it the watch is also
expanding sales to seven more countries
that's all for this tech news update but
if you're still curious about the blue
Tron home kit system we have a full
review up on cnet.com and mark your
calendar to follow our live coverage of
Apple's event on Monday it starts at
10:00 a.m. Pacific 1:00 p.m. Eastern and
we should learn more about new software
for iPhones and Mac computers coming to
you from our studios in New York I'm
