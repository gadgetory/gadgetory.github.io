thanks for sticking around it's been a
very hectic day at CNET Studios here in
New York on vvg and your host today for
the 3:59 podcast episode 322 it's been
bugs Rubin and Roger Chang I knew who
knew happy Cyber Monday we're always
like so low energy compared to his
awesome intros I know it's it's it's
hard to follow up with the DVDs people
way to go way to go that's because I'm
just strung out at this point because we
did the buyer's guide this morning and
then had another live show and this is
my third live show and then I have a lot
of equipment to install this evening so
I'm just burnt right now don't apologize
no I Lexie I'm busy I'm just saying
you're you're loopy from being sick I'm
loopy from yeah this company you'll have
to forgive me I'm a little yeah still
recovering from a wild weekend of food
poisoning just epic coughing for me so
we're gonna be talking about cyber
monday we won't big surprise and we
won't be talking about the best deals
obviously you if you were interesting
that you caught an earlier live show but
we will talk a little bit about how
people are actually shopping on Cyber
Monday right some of the changes that
are happening we're also gonna be
talking about the Kindle unfortunately
Ben is our Amazon and e-commerce expert
he could be answering all my questions I
have plenty of questions on all these so
we're talking about the Kindle because
this is the 10th anniversary that just
happened last week last Sunday yep so
yeah always give any questions leave in
the comments section Brian pick out the
best and Ben will likely answer them and
three minutes of 59 seconds from 3:00 to
welcome to the 359 I'm Roger Jiang I'm
Ben Fox ribbon so cyber monday is here
upon us we've already talked about the
best deals an earlier live show but Ben
and I wanted to discuss or the way we're
shopping the differences in how we're
shopping on Cyber Monday then give me to
sort of outline how is Black Friday and
Cyber Monday stacking up against you
know the previous years it's the online
continues to do really really well a
we're seeing double-digit
as far as revenue increases the thing
that I find most interesting is and
we've been talking a lot about this or
I've been writing a lot about this is
mobile so mobile has been this thing
that everybody's been excited about and
waiting to happen that like there's a
lot of mobile traffic
everybody's like looking around and like
grazing on their smart phones well it
actually looks like there's some
positive numbers to show that people are
actually also buying stuff on their
phones as well yeah I mean I just bought
a TV last night on your phone on my
phone like didn't you want to do that on
desktop I was in the car I made the TV
now I was driving I was not driving but
I did end up buying TV in the car yeah
so like I've been I've been writing
about this from like the retailer
perspective from the payments
perspective that a lot of payment
providers like PayPal and Visa a lot of
retailers like Walmart and eBay have
been trying to make it a lot easier for
you to just get through the pipeline
yeah from start to finish and it seems
to actually be working like how was it
buying your television it was pretty
painless I mean I just softened certain
like I had to enter in my well did you
use no I bought from Target okay
actually they actually cancelled an
order that I made on my phone on Amazon
and I previously purchased on my phone I
cancelled that over and then I
immediately ordered one on target
because the same product was available
to me earlier and at the same price and
you were like a new target customer so
you had to like put in all your new
information yeah it was actually really
annoying to do it like I tried to enter
information and it didn't remember my
account right you remember my password
so I just I just went in as a new
customer and was like yeah and there's
that's a lot of reason why a lot of
people didn't want to shop on their
phones for a long time yeah I guess you
really wanted that TV I was on my way to
it was it was like a pickup so like on
my way to the store I was just gonna
order it I knew there's only like one
left so on just make sure I had it stuff
so as a comparison also online shopping
has been doing really well mobile has
been increasing so that's been
interesting in store so far at least the
foot traffic has been flat so we've been
talking a lot about or we've been seeing
a lot of like stores closing a lot of
stores going into bankruptcy
I don't know are people still shopping
in stores yes thing are people going to
see the stuff or are they pretty content
with looking on their screens it's
that's what I'm curious about
so as the e-commerce reporter I actually
went to Best Buy and bought all the
stuff that I wanted to buy on Black
Friday oh I guess I'm a terrible
ecommerce was it was it busy was it a
good experience though it was busy yeah
it was definitely busy and they had a
ton of inventory all over the place that
made the best buy it like rather
maze-like but you know when I go into a
store these days I just you know know
exactly when I want to buy I already did
all my research ahead of time so you go
bing-bang-boom and buy what you that's
how you do it man well you're when
you're preparing for the stuff you gotta
make a list ahead of time you gotta know
what you want next up one top of the
kindle which marked its 10th anniversary
last sunday but before then you talked
to a couple of amazon executives about
the influence that the Kindles had on
just how we read we waited what did you
sort of get from these guys
I would probably say so we're close to
out of time so I I wanted to mention
this one really funny tidbit that I
heard from one of the executives so they
did right before the original Kindle
launch more than 10 years ago a bunch of
the Kindle executives or a bunch of the
Kindle workers went to Jeff Bezos his
parents house for a two-day off-site
with Jeff because I guess Jeff now is
the world's richest person but back then
he was merely a billionaire oh yeah and
what if to save some money Mike had an
off-site at mom and dad's place while
mom and dad were in Italy so that was so
what do you you have a Kindle that's how
they prepared it for for the market all
right we couldn't get to the actual
story but please check it out seeing
that I'm Roger Chang I'm Ben Fox ribbon
thanks for listening
regular guy that was that was the story
to share the that was so funny to me
that he went to like mom and dad's house
what a world we live in
regular guy's a billionaire and Rogers
buying TVs from cars he was like he's
literally the world's I didn't buy a car
on my TV that wasn't interesting I
looked at up to it's not like he was a
millionaire back well he was a
billionaire on paper though right I mean
he's not like yeah somebody can cash out
let's talk right away or anything no no
he would absolutely liquid he would cave
well that was it the story line I think
from Friday I don't remember
apparently Jeff Bezos is now worth a
hundred billion dollars yes I think it
was Black Friday I think it pushes yeah
because his Black Friday and it pushes a
market cap up to the point where he was
worth a hundred bill it is pretty pretty
amazing and he did mention I will say
earlier this year that he was looking
into philanthropy we know he has some
money that he could potentially spend
hasn't he he hasn't committed to giving
away his money like Warren Buffett not
that I know I mean correct me somebody
if I'm wrong but I don't believe that
he's done that give us some extra
insights into like the Kindle and like
the the last ten years like we didn't
really get a chance to talk about this
on the podcast but like what you know
beyond spawning a clone of other readers
like what has the Kindle really done to
kind of change our reading experience I
think the biggest thing that I got out
from the hardware perspective the thing
that was difficult for them to do that
nobody had done before was the free
wireless connection that they added them
to the original whisper sync was it
called what's called whisper so they
bought wireless wholesale from Sprint
yep and apparently Sprint continues to
provide that connection to original
Kindles oh yes so if you still have one
from 10 years ago
I think they switched to 18t because of
the international applications it
depends which Kindle you're using and
which country but it was something that
Bezos encouraged the team this was still
like a very early team like a very small
group of people from lab 126 this was
lab 126 which is a Mazon skunkworks know
what a skunkworks were that's like their
hardware development lab alright but
this was only like eight people that
started it off now there are thousands
of people that work at kind of I mean
like that's where the echo came out of
that yeah I know like stuck works like
makes it seem like it's his unofficial
thing in lab 126 is like a very official
thing now yeah like either way
Bezos was very involved in the creation
of the Kindle
yeah and encourage them that you know
look this is this is what readers want
this is what people won they don't want
to connect it to a computer to download
new content they want to be able to do
it and they want to be able to do it
anywhere and it proved to be quite
successful yeah sure
all right what what do we got watch ins
what do you want questions that's why
I'm here talking about no no no no no we
do have some good questions of
commentary all right you said you bought
the TV from the car anything else
anybody got good deals on this weekend
for one I did a lot of shopping done I
got a lot done this weekend just because
it was convenient I was already on
holiday break yeah sit on my couch
personally I don't like doing the
shopping on mobile I like having a
bigger picture in front of my eyes
totally and that's that simply all
really comes down to it I understand
there's a lot of security in mobile now
and they've really got the system down
but I got a like I got to really get
into the grid event just to be clear
most of revenue still comes from desktop
sure sure like usually you would want to
buy a TV on desktop but you know Roger
is a special I mean I also like I kind
of knew what I already knew I knew what
I wanted it was really just about I mean
the only barrier would have been like
the annoyance of having to deal with the
mobile purchase and it wasn't that bad
it was just sort of like a really easy
but that's it you knew exactly what
you're going in to get you know I was
looking around for ideas for other folks
so I needed to you know spelunk I think
it's the correct terminology in this
case and I was not in the market for TV
so honestly I didn't hit a lot of very
special deals I found some cool stuff
but nothing on those like mega
doorbuster deals and I would say so
thank you for - Pamela from the chat for
the question what else did you get I
mean there was a big no the point I want
to make was like I think there was a I
think retailers have made it easier if
you like don't want to log in to like go
and just come in as a guest and purchase
I feel like that processes a lot of
harder back in the day like they always
want to get up you know it's just the
process was like yet - created your own
idea or whatever like if you want to
just check out as a guest just as your
information fine and like I've made it a
lot more hassle-free this time yeah all
right so I'll tell Pamela what I got so
at the Best Buy this is why I went into
the store it was I
wanted to like see this first was proud
of I actually switch to Android yeah
guys yeah well I'm not a nice cheap he's
not a cheap anymore yeah I mean like I
just didn't have like $1000 plus to
spend on an iPhone 10 so I suppose I
hide my phone and so I switched from an
iPhone 6 to Samsung Galaxy s8 I got it
at Best Buy I also got a Google home
Mini which was twenty nine dollars plus
a $10 gift certificate and I also got in
Amazon echo the new one for $80 for my
brother and his wife nice so did you
spoil that they asked for it I asked for
it also their problem what I do I
actually I got a second echo dot okay a
thirty bucks I feel like that's as low
as it's probably gonna get yeah usually
yeah like maybe I don't think it's gone
in any lower that's gone 25 a fella gets
hit 20 laughing Sally no I don't
understand that no it's supposed to be
the lowest ever today which is $29.99
they were able to say that because it
was $30 on Black Friday oh my god
dropped it by a penny oh it's never been
25 it has been 35 actually got from Best
Buy okay so that's pie's been having
some pretty good deals and no I don't
work for Best Buy
no Best Buy does continue to put most of
their Forte I mean they lean right into
that Black Friday that yeah their day
yeah for now
look they're a traditional retailer
their brick-and-mortar and you know you
got to bring your A game these days if
you're gonna be a traditional retailer
and I think that they did a pretty good
job at least for me in bringing people
out Walmart also had a really really
good deal on the Google home anywhere
they all had the same deal right there's
always a little bend dollar
if cardizem Walmart was even nicer where
it was 20 it was it was $29 they were
all $29 and for your if you connected it
to Google Express if you connected your
Google how many to Google Express with
your Walmart account so it was a couple
of Hoops to jump through the next
purchase you made with Walmart through
Google Express you got $25 off Oh which
in effect
- made the google how many if you wanted
to think about it this way $4 so I was
actually gonna buy it through Walmart
but they were already sold out online by
the time I woke up on that Friday job
people probably did the math before you
did Josh Boyd is pointing that out in
the chat right now how you could get
mega credit at Walmart for Google home
minis yes yeah and I said no you can't
get them I think they were available
still in store like if you want to go
into score but now I kind of feel like
it's a little bit of a bait and switch
where they're just trying to get you
inside the store and buy more stuff yeah
that's what that's the whole idea of
door Busters right yeah yeah but like
come on just let them buy it online Kim
Kim Kim Ann so as Cyber Monday ticks
along Angel Rodriguez is curious what's
better the Amazon fire stick or the Roku
stick now Gregg I wish we had David
Cassidy's always a guy to ask about this
but if I remember correctly he leans
pretty heavy on those Roku's yep he says
that's the best value for your money
oh the one that's I guess the cleanest
cuz Amazon definitely pushes its content
a little bit more to the forefront it's
easier to access Amazon Prime video it's
a little bit clunky er when you want to
get other stuff I believe there are a
couple of services that are not on
Amazon there are on Roku yeah Roku is
generally known for being more platform
agnostic it doesn't care if you're
watching Amazon or Netflix or HBO
whatever and for that reason I think
CNET in general and David cats buyer
especially this TV that I bought was a
like a small TV that there's a that
broke who built in as a platform there's
a TCL TV that's smart that's just a
smart TV
[Laughter]
I like that Pele must have been watching
the a palette the perhaps was a lot
watching the buyer's guide early because
they say that they're getting the the
Knicks play iris cloud photo photo frame
digital which is a pricey number but
it's a perfect gift for grandmother as
they point out there and so props to
that I still remember when those were
like a thing like remember well
those digital photo frames yeah it's
kind of funny to think ocular killing it
right now but when it's cloud synced
like that they do add some new features
it's different it's for sure like that
that was like the original ones were
very limit right you could've like
loaded it like a USB thing maybe put
some Drive in there whenever like the
cloud stick adds a little altitude but
it's just it's is a pricey uh it's a
little pricey gift does that mean that
you could you know send grandma fresh
pics yeah it's the whole deal yes yes
that's what I it's kind of cute been
doing like for my extended families I've
been taking their old photo albums and
digitizing them and putting them in
google albums so that they have you know
access to them and definitely forever
and ever because they watching the
terior rate as we speak yeah so I'm just
trying to save them do you I don't want
to put you on the spot but do you
remember what the prices for that
digital frame thing it's around 200 it's
in the neighborhood of 200 yeah I don't
remember seeing anything about a
subscription definitely check out CNET
coms last it cheapskates cuz I think
Rick raita had a good deal on it and
punchin codes so check that out for more
shopping needs self-serving self-serving
are you uh buy stuff you know I feel
like you're gonna give us a gift
no it's too expensive no way pretty
pricy tonight I gotta splurge II with
like eighty dollars for my brother you
know come on Wow religiously easy right
up buy this thing for five cents that's
how you're getting out of me yeah right
your brother's lucky dude the C&amp;amp;C nuts
answer coupons
[Laughter]
let's check in with our buddy Michael
Brown he says yeah this just popped into
my head cuz he says I think people spend
more time on Black Friday than they do
on Cyber Monday in store on Black Friday
than they do online for Cyber Monday and
it's funny when I was out Friday night
cuz I had to go shoot a concert I I mean
I've already foot traffic that day I
don't like the crowds so I did my online
shopping and then I had to go out to
work and then on my way through I'm I'm
you know jumping through the obstacle
course that was my street as people are
throwing bodies out of stores and I'm
exaggerating it was like whatever hood
you live Lois's you look at into the
storefronts and I I swear to you that
they had you could see signs inside the
brick-and-mortar store advertising cyber
monday continuation cycle going what
just there spending your money like
don't forget on Monday you could spend
even more money yeah I'm like not
basically the same deals to yeah I mean
like that's a lot of whoa that's what
I've kind of noticed with a lot of the
deals it kind of recycled so also it's
useful to tell people that usually this
is this is around now is when most
categories bottom out so toys are
expected this is from Adobe Analytics by
the way toy toys are expected to bottom
out today oh really furniture is
expected to bottom out tomorrow
I gotta get gift shopping right but it's
it's all gonna like slowly go higher as
we get deeper answers 2x4 yeah cuz
because you're gonna move from this is a
gun taking from Adobe you're gonna move
from like price choppers where like
people want to get the best possible
price to convenience shoppers yeah as
you get deeper into the holiday season
it's not like the prices are gonna spike
they're not gonna like skyrocket though
start to gradually go up yeah exactly so
but this would like a lot of people who
are asking when's the right time to shop
when is the best time to shop it usually
is in this window around Black Friday
Cyber Monday and it's generally a
two-week window it's like the Monday
before Black Friday all the way through
to the Friday after Cyber Monday like
that's that's like usually when they
save like their best deals
so just non-affiliated plug you're
talking about covering nieces and
nephews check Groupon and Costco because
I got bulk deals on they're not
listening to the show because they're
toddlers build-a-bear deals oh really
certificates that cover a broad breadth
okay
just putting that out there coupon
non-affiliated plug that was some of the
better ventures that I found in my Black
Friday shopping I don't know if they're
still going on through Cyber Monday
Costco build-a-bear probably
what kid wouldn't like a build-a-bear
okay yeah my kids ah yeah so we're
almost out of time let's recap you what
were the best tablets through Black
Friday Cyber Monday tablets yeah who
were the winners who either had the best
deal or maybe landed the most sales free
no Ablett's
tablets I mean like usually it's Amazon
you know like the big phones if you know
not tablets tablets the I would say
usually it's Amazon usually you're gonna
because of their fire it's because it's
because they have like the cheapest
stuff you know expect for spec you're
gonna get the best bang for your buck
getting in there I don't think so
because the problem is is that most of
the time Apple stuff just doesn't go on
Apple I think a couple of them say like
there was at least the kind of the base
the regular just the iPad I think that
one got a pretty steep discount not
through Apple Best Buy or Target it was
through Best Buy I think you're right
yeah but it was I don't know he would
buy those things anymore tablets yeah
somebody asked about them so sure look
if you're gonna buy them for a kid you'd
recommend oh yes on one yeah yeah
definitely get like the $50 one and and
I think they might be cheaper now I'm
sorry I don't know off the top of my
head just checks Unicom okay but but
yeah like infrequently you are gonna
find some Apple deals I'm a little
frustrated too because like everybody's
buying the air pods anyway but there are
a hundred and sixty dollars yeah and
they're they're like a huge seller this
holiday season for whatever reason air
pods at $160 argh
I still get gift maybe you're gifting it
for yourself because like I'm not buying
anybody anything for Honor's maybe for
your wife no of course I would buy my
wife $160 air buds course I would yeah I
mean I still can't feel like I'd freak
out over losing those things everybody
in Manhattan now wears though I know I
see them everywhere I feel like I'm
gonna get like you know caught in an
alleyway and the Apple people are gonna
punch me be like you're not wearing your
air pods that
I feel bad for Scott Stein I think he
might be a little depressed because for
a while there he was only the lonely
running around with those on and he was
like iconic for it and now you see like
he will walk down the street and six
people pass by and somewhere in the
background you just hear mad world
playing softly expect the calm of
January expect to see way more air pods
because they're selling a lot of them
this holiday you don't say great mm-hmm
was that not surprising no just saying I
go that's something does not look
forward to it yes okay sissy of air pods
wherever you wherever you walk maybe one
or two pixel buds sprinkled in there I
don't know thank know because you need a
pixel for them it's a little too limited
although man that voice translation
killer mm should read our review I don't
want to I don't want to ruin it for you
but uh it's I mean like it's not great
yeah the only the last impression I got
was from Sean's like hands on yes then
yeah yeah yeah where you spoke review
it's basically like it works like a
shortcut anyway I think Brian's trying
to give us the hook well not exactly I
wanted to give a quick shout out to one
of our longest loyalists Michael Brown
congratulations on buying your house hey
wow that's huge man super cool and thank
you you're like a grown-up sure sir
can we come over yeah can we have a
party there - uh - take us out Josh boy
to be honest has anyone ever bought
something online while you're standing
in the store oh of course
oh yeah - he looks at you funny but
you're like you that's like I feel
really great about it like yeah it's
right I just beat the system I give you
guys money huh I can't name any specific
instance but I'm pretty sure everybody's
guilty of that one oh yeah yeah and
