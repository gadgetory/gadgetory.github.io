we thought that music is a great medium
to try that and music is something that
is very timely and you will need to do
things on the right millisecond it's
also very special you need to go to the
right places so what better medium then

different feeling because it learns how
your body moves and it can augment it so
if you want to move like you saw toy the

because it's recognized the gestures and
you feel that your own body is
responding to you in a way the idea that

are becoming a part of the human</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
