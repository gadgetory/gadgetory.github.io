Joanie Saltzman
so Jeff Bezos is public life took an
interesting turn
Amazon's founder and CEO has maintained
a mostly positive image as a press shy
geek but on Thursday night his personal
life spilled out onto view after he
revealed an apparent blackmail plot by
the National Enquirer supermarket
tabloid which was threatening to publish
his racy pics including if I remember
correctly a below-the-belt selfie as
they described it that he sent to his
mistress um what's going on here like I
guess to connect this to the fact that
like we work for CNN and you know not a
fellow tabloid what are your thoughts
about this like as far as like how does
it impact BAE's Oh sad as an impact
Amazon like what do you think about that
well it definitely puts Bezos on the
forefront of a lot of different kinds of
discussions national security
discussions because you know the Trump
administration is all wrapped up in the
whole national fire thing Muller
investigation is all wrapped up in the
National Enquirer thing like so it takes
Bezos as a gigantic figure as the
world's which is man and also the leader
of one of the most powerful companies
the world takes him all out of being
that like larger-than-life figure on a
tech stage and make some
larger-than-life figure on a world stage
right politics and and other other
issues and he was connected to that
that's a great point he was connected to
that initially through the Washington
Post but the Washington Post and and
Trump was kind of at loggerheads with
Bezos already to begin with about
Washington Post's coverage and calling
it the Amazon Washington Post and all
this other stuff but this really does
seem to insert him into these long term
other controversies that Trump has been
having to deal with yeah so so that is
definitely a weird thing the other
interesting aspect is is like what does
this do to his public persona at this
point and I wrote about this on Friday
he seems to be enjoying a really nice PR
coup yeah everybody could have been
talking about his racy photos but about
his judgment what's he doing you had
this long-term marriage now
all of a sudden sending photos you know
basically dick pigs to his mistress like
what's going on here and it seems like
he's really presenting himself as a hero
at this point yeah and I think a lot of
people it's been funny and I'm sure that
you noticed this being Amazon's reporter
that at the same time there was a lot of
sort of like who knew that I would be on
Jeff Bezos aside for like totally
flipping the script on this attempt to
blackmail the richest man in the world
which I don't know how wise that was to
begin with but it's happening at the
same time that people are sort of
there's annoyance at Amazon in New York
City still over these queue - there's
annoyance at Amazon over this tipping
only going into base pay for drivers
issue so there's a lot of reasons why
people there's there's a kind of public
relations thread that's negative towards
Bezos on a lot of other friends but this
you know because it's such a juicy lurid
stuff right the main thing people are
talking about are all right let's change
gears completely Joan you had a chance
to test out the magic leave a
hourglasses at Sundance you watch
something called be a jesters tail using
the Skagit can you tell us a bit about
the jesters tail what was a lightning it
was really weird
I did three experiences with magically
bolos at Sundance two of them were made
by magic leap itself and the third was
this jesters tale experience that wasn't
made by a guy who does other has done
other a are experiences in the past but
he doesn't work from a if he was just
using their technology and it was really
weird it had like this YouTube pop star
in it named poppy who liked her her her
brand is just being aggressively weird
so if you know anything about poppy you
get a sense of just how strange this
experience was there was like a live
actor in it a little boy who was trapped
behind the trapped behind a wall and I
had to choose whether to kill him or
kill myself
there was a live act or a hologram no
well he was a hologram and then he was
also a live actor I know well they so
there were there was a floating ball the
part that magically helped with was
there's like a floating ball of dots
that was an artificial intelligence that
was doing a reverse Turing test on me it
was trying to determine train determined
it was testing me on whether or not I
was a human and asking me questions
about stuff that these what are called
volumetric assets there are basically
Holograms of people
this little boy and his mother and papi
would stand in this room and I'd walk
around them it was and no none of this
really gives you a sense of what the
story was supposed to be like it sounds
totally just so it was super trippy so
it's hard to it's kind of hard to
describe
so the cost of this headset is two
thousand two hundred ninety five dollars
so considering that very big price do
you think magically is going to be able
to really inject a lot more enthusiasm
into the AR world right
I mean they've even termed that this
first edition of their device is a
creator edition it's designed for people
like Assad who made this experience to
get their hands on it make weird or
crazy or interesting or tear-jerking
experiences and then they can have magic
leap - or magical III be something
that's a little more accessible that's
the idea anyway
yeah anyway if you want to read more
about these stories check this out on
CNN I'm Ben Fox Ruben I'm Joni Zaza
thanks for listening
alright thanks as always for joining us
for the recording of the audio podcast
you can subscribe using the links below
in the description now it's a time for
you to go ahead and send in your
questions and comments many of you
already have coming right out hot and
heavy here is Michael Brown I don't
think this affects amaz okay the puns
are gonna be through the roof today oh
yeah clearly Michael Brown says I don't
think this affects Amazon this is more
personal news than tech news Mike rhymer
says this is a rich white person problem
Oscar says this is all just organized
distraction yeah I kind of feel the same
way I like organized distraction I think
is definitely I feel more interesting
hovering this so going back going back
to what John was talking about there are
obviously a lot of criticisms about
Amazon on a number of fronts so the
theory that this is this was intentional
or this was an organized distraction to
try to avoid those problems I think is a
really interesting one it's a fun one to
talk about but I don't really think it
holds a lot of it could be distracting
from some from some of the criticisms
those criticisms about Amazon because
those criticisms are going to exist
regardless
maybe Bezos gets people to not think
about this stuff for a couple of days or
maybe he gets like a little bit of a
public-relations windfall for a few days
but I think it would be short-lived a
lot of the criticisms about Amazon and
its business those are fundamental
issues and then she like resurfaced over
the years yeah and if anything they've
gotten louder yeah you know so an Amazon
hq2 in New York for sure going to what
you said Brian as far as like this kind
of feels icky to talk about I would say
that like when I had to write about
Bezos his divorce I was kind of like
this is a personal issue I understand
that he tweeted about it and therefore
we do have to cover it because he's the
CEO of Amazon but now we're really
getting into a point where this is very
newsworthy yeah like the possibility the
CEO of a major tech corporation could
have his dick pics leaked to the
National Enquirer and they're lording it
over him this is significant and it is a
personal situation but it is something
that does impact a major tech company
how the CEO operates that major tech
company I think that there are I mean
like the stock itself is it really
moving so that is a bit
an indicator but I would say that to
suggest that this isn't a distraction
with an Amazon how is that even possible
like I'm sure a lot of people are paying
attention to this yeah moving on let's
tackle some more questions great ones
filing in Timothy do says the timing of
this is just amazing right after the
divorce announcement talks with TJ says
why does the media use personal life to
interfere with business do we really
think that's the case here I think that
I mean like look I was writing about
this stuff and my hands were tied like
how are you not gonna write about this
like as much as you know as many of the
lurid details and what-have-you but it's
it's Bezos came out and had a very
lengthy medium post about this is what's
going on in my personal life and this is
a guy that every single time he says
anything we tend to write about it and
he tends to keep it pretty quiet so this
was this was an unavoidable situation
and in terms of the timing I think that
the basis is announcement of the their
divorce was specifically because they
the Enquirer had already reached out and
like Newt was trying it was gonna or was
it knew about his mess it seemed very
likely III mean without knowing 100% the
timing is really pretty pretty stark he
announces his divorce on Twitter with it
with his wife and then a couple hours
later the National Enquirer comes out
and says hey he has a mistress so you do
the math on that one so who doesn't
these days I mean really I don't have a
mistress
I'd be Bezos mistress for that kind of
money yeah I have a number of mistresses
you know that's because I'm so damn
good-looking but do they deliver in
under 24 hours what two days in two days
shipping from Mike Shaw if I was Jeff
I'd say publish what you got I mean
below the belt selfie who cares
he's not untouchable at this point but
kind of an interesting point from my you
know Dan Savage made that argument in
the New York Times he said that like the
damage is already done and let's get rid
of the taboo about these types of
pictures by just coming out with them
yeah I think that's I don't want really
dumb move do you find the idea that like
no one should feel I mean like
personally embarrassed for people to see
like it's embarrassing for people to see
you in a bathing suit it's embarrassing
to see people naked but the idea that
it's like somehow a moral failings or
it's I have poor judgment yeah just some
pictures like that to someone who's your
loved like who's your partner like
whatever you want to say about
extramarital or whatever like this was a
consensual relationship there are two
people that really like each other
having a good time and everybody does
this now I don't I don't but say it is
very typical it is typical and I totally
appreciate what you're saying as far as
like treating it as judgment you know I
think Dan Savage definitely has a point
as far as that's concerned he does take
it a little far by making it a bit more
philosophical than actually realistic
yeah cuz nobody really wants to see Jeff
Bezos his dick pic why why he already
had his the benefit of everybody like
came to his side even though he's the
world's richest person revealing these
pictures I think from a public relations
standpoint is utterly nonsensical so the
idea is that he would do it himself he
would yeah - just get to defang the
situation completely
exactly but also and I think going to
Dan's point to also be kind of a
figurehead to get rid of the taboo off
like nudie pics or whatever and like Dan
Savage he's like a sex advice columnist
so of course he would say something like
that anyway it's a good point that was
Mike Shaw right yeah it was yeah I don't
know if you read the dan Savage piece
but you're definitely dead on with what
Dan was talking about with that comment
TJ says you can't be upset about media
responding to your situation if you make
it public you affect not only a personal
life but your brand and business so I
guess to a sense yeah Bezos brought this
on himself to more than a sense he
absolutely brought this on himself eg
that he did it like everything that he's
done has been in reaction we assume
everything that he's done has been in
reaction to somebody else saying we're
gonna report on this no one's actually
on your wife bro what and no one said
cheat on as well like all right also I
want to just say I'm a lot of people
calling this a mistress because we don't
really
like if they were separated and he's
it's hurt it's his girlfriend like that
spicy buzzword I think yeah you're right
I said I said mistress during the
podcast I think I was reading too much
of The Daily Beast before we went on
I did not say mister I'd like I don't
write mistress in my stories I just said
like dating or something because you're
right mistress definitely puts more of
like a lurid spin on it than it's really
necessary especially if they're
separated and apparently Lauren Sanchez
is also separated right again this is
super weird to talk about as a tech
reporter so and and I totally get why
some of the commenters are flagging that
issue but that's the this is yeah this
is what happened you know and we like
from from my perspective as a person
that writes about Amazon I now have to
pick and choose as far as how much of
this I really care to write about
anymore like the Thursday stuff when he
came out with this huge medium post
obviously we're gonna write about that
we're gonna write about the fallout
afterward but every everybody wants like
the divorce proceedings like I don't
know like the scene I care about that
I'm not really sure well we'll find out
on a scale of one to ten Ben how mad are
you that we are just a gossip mill right
now very true this is I I like going
back to what I said before this is this
is definitely interesting to me because
it has so many potential impacts on
Amazon and Bezos being like a credible
leader of his company I think so far
those things are fine but at the same
time this is this is like material stuff
to report on as opposed to the divorce
which is like people get divorced it
happens yeah you know it's it's people
get separated and date other people
how much do I really care about that man
you know okay National Enquirer a
blackmail plot and we've got your dick
pigs yeah gonna be I've just been
writing about to head I mean there's
like a whole Trump thread and all this
the Saudi threat yeah there's there's a
lot going on well there
it'll be a lot that that out that you
know truthful out so wolf will
eventually maybe know where all this
stuff came from right which we didn't
mention so The Daily Beast which has
been writing a lot about this claims
that they have an exclusive from the
National Enquirer multiple National
Enquirer sources that are unnamed that
it was Michael Sanchez which is the
brother of the woman Jeff Bezos is
dating has that's girlfriend whatever so
Michael Sanchez has like Republican
connections apparently knows Roger stone
and it's it's yeah it seems very likely
that it was Michael Sanchez at this
point yeah so juicy very very very
brother free like intrigue that is not
cool bro but whatever I mean the most
humiliating thing about this is that
people still take naked selfies like are
you twelve bro like are you in high
school what you're doing here I feel
like everybody does that doesn't
everybody do this reminds doesn't make
it any less humiliating this reminds me
it's very childish
so you remember there was a major Google
executive it was Eric he used to be the
chairman
he was like Eric Schmidt Eric Schmidt
was asked about like what when things
come out on the internet and they're
embarrassing whatever he said something
that like a lot of people felt was like
very very puritanical which realize if
if you don't want embarrassing things
about you to come out on the internet
don't do them in the first place
right which is like so judgy so going
back to the point if like should you or
shouldn't you do like dick pics or naked
pics in the first place it's kind of
like live your life alright maybe I
shouldn't be espousing such things but
yeah let's not espouse tolerance and
understanding for other people when they
make errors in judgment
judgment it's not a big deal this is the
ultimate thing it's so not a big deal
it's not only normalize it either why
it's it's not a big deal is it a very
interesting conversation it's not
expecting to start my Monday this way
Mike this is i opening i say if you
point a camera at your wee-wee you're
just asking for trouble there you might
as well just all right Eric Schmidt you
and Eric can hang out whatever all right
anyways let's try to move on Mike Shaw
says if the National Enquirer is
blackmailing Bezos can't he just see
them out of business
Michael Brown says what are some of the
criticisms of Amazon and their business
practices and storm king wants to expand
on that saying how much of his personal
affairs are really going to impact the
stocks it hasn't impacted the stock much
at all so so there's that answer CEO
like Elon Musk is a great example where
he's shown real errors in judgment like
smoking pot on camera which we're like
illegal and lots of places working but
it's still just and then like all this
stuff what a total emotional very public
emotional breakdown yeah so like that's
an example where a CEOs personal
behavior has had an impact on the stock
this however has been pretty fairly
limited yeah in Amazon's case the other
interest the the other issue to pay
attention to as a release to Amazon is
is that Amazon is a company of 650,000
people he has multiple executives that
have been with the company for a long
time that he can lean on if he's having
times of trouble or difficulty in his
personal life there are two co-ceos that
run major parts of the business that had
they those been their own standalone
businesses would probably be fortune 500
companies so Jeff is probably gonna be
fine
dealing at least with his divorce the
the issue is is what goes on with this
National Enquirer stuff is that going to
drag on
is that going to turn into like a whole
criminal proceeding because that is
going to get distracting and not and if
it's criminal its criminal and deal with
it but it's it's hard to operate your
business when when you have all these
different distractions going on and then
this what are some of the things that
are recurrent
a lot if it really has to do with
treatment of workers that's that's
really been the most recurrent issue and
oh that that seems to me to be directly
related to the fact that Amazon seems to
be against unionization or they're
openly against unionization of their
workforce and unions don't really like
that especially the warehouses so there
they are they butt heads a lot with the
unions and there have been a lot of
expose is about how the where warehouse
workers are treated how the delivery
drivers are treated that's something
that's been ongoing for years yeah all
right let's hear hereby hope that it
really doesn't impact the company that
much because those workers have had a
rough enough already but the most
important question on the table how long
until the porn parody oh I think it's
already happened probably it's a great
question because it's almost certainly a
guard all right moving on let's talk
Sundance it's to me it's kind of weird
that Sundance has become such a platform
for tech related topics not to be not
that it's not easy to kind of tie those
connections later being that it's you
know the entertainment aspect of it but
Michael Brown is asking magic leap has
been around for a while do we expect it
to ever really start to reach the masses
soon and that's the question on
everybody's mind who's interested in VRA
are yeah so magic Leafs been around for
a while in the sense that as a company
it's existed for like four yeah about
four years but its first product that
people could actually like oh like see
and touch and be like it's all actually
real it's not just fake that only came
out like five months ago and that was
magic leap one it's the one that's like
two thousand three hundred dollars and
the idea like I said is that it would be
something that creators and developers
are the ones that mostly are the people
that's kind of the target for this
edition of magic leap and then
subsequent versions of it would be
cheaper and more accessible for people
and also better like right now it has
some downfalls as with a lot of a our
headsets the field of view is limited so
like if you had a giant
standing in front of you you'd be like I
can see the head and neck and now I can
see the body and now I can see the tail
you can't see the whole thing at once
cuz the field of view is so small you
back up sorry then you got to back up or
you know you could back up if you're in
a giant warehouse or if you're in your
living room as this is intended to be
used you can because you have walls that
go bump into so does that take you out
of the experience a lot magic leave has
a better field of view than hololens
which is the only other really
functional out there a or headset so
it's better than what ha what hololens
which hasn't been updated in a while
it's better than that but yeah there's a
lot it's a really brand new technology
literally in the case of magic leap this
is the first public version available
and so there's a lot of things that need
to be improved upon for it to be
something that people really get excited
about a the prices come down needs to be
more content for it reasons for you to
try it and technology itself has some
kinks to work there speaking of excited
I'm just kind of curious what was your
personal highlight of the different
selections you actually saw at Sundance
what was one that you really thought was
kind of fun of the magical ones
yeah yeah listen state of that of the
magic leap ones I liked the jesters tale
most just because it was so bizarre it
was so weird the other ones definitely
felt very the ones that magical eats
himself magically magically itself
presented they were very kind of
polished safe yeah like they were safe
they'd already been presented at their
their convention their developer
conference in October so I got so they
brought mica which is there humanoid
artificial intelligence kind of like a
digital assistant but it's not designed
to like answer your questions and set
your timer and then they also had this
performance of a Shakespearean monologue
by this Royal Shakespeare Company actors
who's a little hologram stand in front
of me and they're really good they were
really well done and the animation was
great and it was really real and clever
but it was definitely not taking risks
and so a jesters tale took a lot of
risks it was really out there so that
one made more of an impression and they
were saying that jesters tail was coming
to home can I call a home video it's
king yeah
they come into VHS it's got it'll be
available to the public later this year
right yeah so the idea I don't know
exactly how they'll do it because Assad
said that they are going to release a
mobile version of it a mobile that's it
mobile yeah like a mobile AR version of
it sometime sometime in the second
quarter which basically means the next
four months
oh that's sooner than I thought I was
thinking like nd year no I mean it could
anything can change but and I don't
exactly know how a mobile AR version
would work because so much of the
version that I saw it was set in a
bedroom where it was kind of like the
set itself was very elaborate with a bed
and there was a desk and there was a key
in the desk I had to pull out and there
were pictures and bookshelves and
bric-a-brac all over the place and the
volumetric assets like of the little boy
the Holograms of the little boy and the
mother and a poppy and of these other
computer-generated characters you know
it's all very specific in this room the
boy sits on the bed the mother joins him
on that sits him on the bed with him and
you know like comforts him and yeah and
you I don't really know exactly how it
work but I don't know assad's really
he's like a wunderkind he's annoyingly
smart and he's like 22 years old so I'm
sure hopefully it's pretty impressive
that he managed to or like when you talk
about like risk-taking it makes sense
that you know the finished product was
kind of more of a risk-taking effort
because it doesn't seem like there are
that many third-party developers that
are actually making magically content at
all because it's so new there are some
but like we don't know about them yet
because they're like I said it magically
was only been out for about five or six
months and that's only given creators
that weren't already like kind of
welcomed into the fold previously like
Royal Shakespeare Company had been
working with magically before the
announcement of before the release of
magical point so there have been the NBA
also has been working with magic leave
on some other stuff but we but nobody
really has had a chance to get their
hands as a consumer as a user and try it
except for people like Scott Stein and
me and people that happen to go to this
conference the magic leap conference
normal people just don't have access to
the technology to view it so yeah even
like people like Scott and I have only
had a chance to try a few things
from magically so I don't know it'll be
interesting to see what sounds like I
will take a couple years for it to
trickle down yeah Timothy asks if ARV
are really starts picking up you think
within ten years we'll have ready player
one status tech world sure my Mike Shaw
asks how soon can I go to the Super Bowl
in VR or more importantly a Def Leppard
concert Mike I'll be there with you for
that one
I mean there's already lots of examples
of going to sporting events or concerts
in virtual reality not necessarily Def
Leppard and not the Super Bowl but the
NBA has been very aggressive and doing
like courtside VR experiences or in the
store you get to pick your placement
where you can be like in the hallway
where the players run out so you can be
there when they like come out for their
you know lets get ready to rhumble or
whatever moment you can be on the
sidelines you can be in the stands you
can choose where in the stands and then
there have been a lot of concerts that
people have recorded for VR or broadcast
live in 360 for VR for awhile and so
that's a place people are exploring I
mean they're trying to figure out
whatever they can figure out to make it
something that people want to do yeah
and we'll see I think that with oculus
quest coming out this year that's the
one where it's like you get what's
called six degrees of freedom where it
can like recognize where you are without
having to set up cameras all over the
place it just kind of knows where you
are from a camera in the in the headset
you don't have to wear a backpack or
anything like that I think that's gonna
be really interesting because it's kind
of finally the one that sort of hits the
main things that you need VR to be able
to do yeah those aspects seems to be
really critical yes all right getting
people on board you know cuz obviously
some of the earlier rigs where you had
to pay for really expensive PC Tower and
then you have to like plug it in like
you're in the matrix yeah to it that's a
big deal for its it's a lot it's a lot
to deal with and it's not anywhere close
to being for like mainstream consumers
or for like every day like videoed like
gamers like PC gamers some of them will
be into it and some of them won't be and
then on the other hand like the low end
with like gear VR
9s on headset that ray stick phone in or
like the pixel yard remember the ones
where you like stick the phone in that
okay dream thank you right
those are great in the sense that they
make things accessible but the
experiences that you have on that
because you don't have that six degrees
of freedom thing they it's really just
like a 360 viewer so you can sit on a
chair like this and spin around and see
things but you can't play a game you
can't like reach out to somebody in
social VR and wave to them and actually
have your avatar wave or anything like
that although it's with Google you had a
controller so you could kind of do that
anyways I think it'll be really
interesting when quest comes out to see
what happens
people are already over it and just
don't want to care about VR anymore if
it could be something that actually
takes a lot it takes off with the very
limited amount of time we got left us
talk resolution and ranking mike shaw is
very curious how magically magically
deals with resolution he thinks that
perhaps to his understanding you need to
have 4k in each eye Oscar's wondering
where psvr falls on the spectrum Michael
Brown says we should hit them together
with magic leave hololens Google glass
who really has the best visual
presentation who looks best to the naked
eye well we're talking a are it's been a
long time since I tried Holland I
haven't tried Holland's
and over maybe even two years like I
said it's been a while since hololens
has been updated and my only experience
with hololens has been in a demo
environment
Scott Stein would it be great because he
like gets out and gets to try those
things all the time not all the time but
more than more than I do
I don't know about resolution types up
but I can't say just from like offhand
experiences magic leap the visuals
automatically pet said are much better
and look more real and feel less you
don't get pulled out of the reality of
what you're seeing as often as you do
with hololens I think mostly because of
the field of view being better on magic
leap but and those are all better than
Google glass because glass is like not
it was a failure well not only that but
like it was it was a version of AR that
was very simple yeah just basically put
a very
very tiny computer screen if I remember
correct right in front of one of your
eyes which is like the true version so
there's all these different definitions
the true definition of augmented reality
is literally just like Google glass
where it's just like digital information
on top of the world and hololens and
magically like to talk about mixed
reality the idea that like that like one
of the Holograms could walk around the
table and it you psyche as they walk
around the table you lose the visual of
the bottom half of their body you know
like that it interacts with the things
that are actually in the room around you
and not just like overlay on top and so
if ever interested if you ever want to
be annoying at a party super annoying a
party and tell people like that's not
really augmented reality that's a mixed
reality that's the difference between
the two so that's another reason why
it's kind of like an unfair comparison
between magically and hollands and that
genre and then like the Google glass was
there another question I didn't address
somebody else asked a question I can't
remember he's talking about resolution I
don't know much yes gods a better guy to
ask that question he's we don't have we
can't beam him in quite yet
soon we'll work on that on beaming in
Scott using a our mixed reality my
mistake because he's got to sit behind
the desk bring us Scott Scott hologram
man wait how come we how do we know you
guys aren't just augmented mixed reality
Halle Berry Turing test man I took a
reverse Turing test and I'm human cuz I
didn't kill a boy that's how we know I
am a hologram so there's that he was a
hologram I could punch him right in the
face
and it would just go right through right
through me all right go for it hey Star
Wars
Oh Google glass the virtual boy of
augmented reality I in the mean time we
will work on getting Scott in here so
bring those questions back but we are
out of time
