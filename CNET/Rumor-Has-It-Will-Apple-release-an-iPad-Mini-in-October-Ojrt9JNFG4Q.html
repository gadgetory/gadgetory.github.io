levy welcome to rumor has it the show
where we round up the week's hottest
tech rumor and then we vote on which
sounds legit and what seems like total
bum but the best part is that you guys
can vote too so don't go anywhere our
first rumor is from Pacific Crest
analyst andy hargreaves who predicts
that apple will introduce a seven point
eight five inch iPad Mini in October he
suggests that Apple would kill the three
hundred ninety nine dollar ipad 2 and
could introduce a 16 gig ipad mini for a
similar price this is the rumor that
will just not die even after Steve Jobs
said I'm an earnings call that in order
for them to make a 7-inch tablet they
would have to ship it with sand paper so
that people could disgustingly file down
their fingertips so they could use the
little nibs to touch the screen place
are tiny even then people keep saying
that Apple's gonna do this it's like a
zombie room work kill it already boy
what about the iphone that's like four
inches and people don't need to use
their pinkies to use that maybe Steve
Jobs forgot that they invented the
iphone i guess though either way though
i'm actually with Steve Jobs on this one
despite the success of the kindle fire
and the new release of google's nexus 7
I don't think Apple can be forced to do
something that they don't want to do and
I don't think that lower cost is their
style also it's antithetical to their
one size fits all ethos here's why I say
yay first of all remember that there's
all different kinds of iPods out there
there's the shuffle there's the Nano
there's the touch there's the SH much
there's whatever the other thing is one
word competition Apple loves to watch
other people make stuff and then blows
them out of the water with its supposed
superior product here's the perfect
opportunity to do that what do you guys
think ipad mini in the fall if you're
watching on seen it cast your vote now
with the thumbs up thumbs down right
over there next to emily's head in the
interactive player you've got 30 seconds
to vote right now we're going to go to
the street to see if the people of San
Francisco can shed some light on this
rumor but then in a few minutes come
back and see if your vote matches up
with the cnet Council of experts
seven inches yeah like my seven inches
Paul I don't think so no that's not
really yes I do no i don't i'm not sure
but i think it would be kind of stupid
it's kind of an awkward size I'd be
excited if it was I think about getting
it um I would say it's true probably
yeah I think that they're probably not
going to focus on that is the next thing
I think they're working on something
really cool around TVs right now so
that's what I'm looking for so it looks
like the opinions on the street are
pretty mixed let's go back inside and
hear some more rumors our second rumor
might be the feathering capitalism's cap
our beloved and hated addiction Facebook
may be thinking of rolling out a want
button according to developer Tom
waddington who posted on his personal
blog that he found a want button buried
in Facebook's JavaScript SDK the data
collected using this want button would
be huge for advertisers and super
annoying for us people would basically
be making universal wish lists and
companies could better target their ads
which would be so creepy I don't need
facebook ads to be any creepier than
they already are if Facebook does this
then all the pretence that the site is
about connecting with your friends will
be gone and it will finally be revealed
for what it actually is a money-making
scheme I want to see pictures of my
friends hanging out with their family I
don't want to see their shopping list
absolutely get out of my face facebook
where's the dislike button our third and
final rumor is from wmpoweruser which
found a photo of a new windows 8
keyboard design which they claim is from
a leaked microsoft research presentation
the keyboard actually looks really
awesome and it's designed for one thumb
typing which is really cool if we also
assume from the looks of it that will
have predictive text right this type of
keyboard is similar to what was used on
the blackberry pearl which was a cluster
of qwerty keys and i super love the
blackberry pearl remember the blackberry
pearl absolutely not of course not it
was amazing so basically this is for
somebody who wants to text with one hand
and keep this hand for you for some
other activity like cooking or brushing
your teeth or changing the channel on
the TV yeah
that okay so let's get back to our first
rumour the cnet Council is composed of
five Cena experts who cast their votes
anonymously opinions org estimates
expressed by the cnet Council are not an
endorsement by cnet or CBS interactive
obviously because these are rumors folks
so we asked the cnet council is the ipad
mini coming out in October and the cnet
verdict is unanimous no particular oh
seriously all five of our anonymous
experts say that there is absolutely no
chance of an ipad mini coming out
pessimists I mean I'm actually super
happy that they agreed with me oh but
I'm really surprised that none of them
think ones coming out a lot of consumers
really want this but I guess our experts
are used to Apple telling us what to
want and not listening to what we
actually want probably our comment of
the week comes from our friend Andrew
Hoover who tweeted I'm digging the new
rumor show but I miss distracting Kareem
Levy and Emily Dreyfuss during the show
well Andrew we're actually going to
throw you a bone and all the fans are
our podcast and do a throwback
old-school wager so if the next time the
iPads are updated there's no smaller
mini then I get to humiliate Kareem and
if there is a mini than I get to
humiliate Emily which will be really
easy okay everybody that is our show
please share your rumors with us at
rumor has it at cnet com or call us at 1
800 750 scenic and tune in next week for
more tech rumors
