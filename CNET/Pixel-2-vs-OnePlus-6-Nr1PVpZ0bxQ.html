are plenty of top to your options to
choose from
the pixel 2 is Google's marquee phones
which starts at six hundred and forty
nine dollars then there's the five
hundred and $29 one plus six a phone
made by a dark horse of a company whose
inexpensive yet powerful phones garner a
loyal fan base if you're torn between
the two we've stacked them against one
another to see which one is the better
buy though both phones look rather bland
the pixel twos biggest advantage is that
it's waterproof oneplus claims that the
one plus six is more water resistant
than past iterations but because it's
not IP certified for water protection
you can't dunk it safely under water but
in every other design aspect this phone
is a winner here it has a bigger six
point twenty eight inch screen ultra
thin bezels and a headphone jack the
pixel two has one of the best cameras
out there even with just it's single
rear camera compared to one plus six is
dual images were sharper on the pixel to
its hdr+ enhanced feature render scenes
with tricky lighting better and it
handles low-light excellently lastly
while both phones have optical image
stabilization only the pixel two uses it
for video on top of that it integrates
gyro based AIS technology in the end
footage recorded on the pixel 2 was way
smoother and steadier don't get me wrong
the oneplus 6 takes sharp vibrant and
well focused pictures but when it comes
to which phone takes the better photo I
have to hand it to the pixel to
both phones run near vanilla versions of
Android Oreo and both can run the beta
version of Android p1 plus has useful
add-ons - like a shelf page on the
homescreen an individual app lock on the
pixel - you can access the digital
assistant Google assistant by squeezing
on the sides of the phone
it also has google lens which calls up
info from a visual image like a landmark
book cover or piece of art what truly
gives a pixel to the edge however is
that it's Google's phone because it'll
receive fresh updates the moment they
roll out from the company it wins this
round with its snapdragon 845 chipset
the oneplus 6 flies by the pixel - in
our benchmark test it's higher capacity
battery also lasts longer in our lab
tests for continuous video playback on
airplane mode the 1 + 6 + is 15 and a
half hours while the pixel - lasted 13
and a half that doesn't mean the pixel -
is a slouch and it's still a zippy and
reliable today as when I first took it
out of its box but numbers don't lie and
the 1 + 6 rises to the top with their
superb hardware and performances the
pixel 2 + 1 plastics are unsurprisingly
tied to 4 - at this point then the phone
that's best for you depends on how
heavily you weigh these categories and
what they mean to you if you use your
phone to take tons of photos or need
that extra water protection that 120
dollars extra you pay will be worth it
for the pixel - of course if you rather
have a longer battery life a larger
screen or more money in your pockets all
of which are completely reasonable
things to want definitely buy the
oneplus 6 whatever phone you end up
going with you'll be satisfied with
either ones that being said if you're
undecided and don't need a new phone
ASAP consider waiting to see what Google
has in store in October that's when the
pixel 3 is expected to be lunch and
you'll have yet another choice to choose
from</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
