video about their modular smartphone
experiment project ara the power glove
is back and it's actually it works this
time that's cool and lab-grown muscles
respond just like the real thing we got
to get implants tomorrow daily
greetings citizens of the internet I
feel like I should be punching this guy
this is weird sue you that's true you
have a patent it's a trademark welcome
to our daily I'm your host Ashley a
scaler joining me as always the man the
myth the legend
Ashley Ciara Kailyn I don't know I don't
know how to do we switch sides because
of my hair it's like this is really sad
I'm sorry to say but it was Kayla's idea
wasn't mine I just want to put that ego
rumor to rest immediately yeah you can't
you can't do all the things that I do or
again I will sue you okay I've got good
lawyers you'd better call Saul all right
guys it's time for the headlines okay so
an exciting thing about 2015 is we've
been waiting for Google's Project ara we
saw phonebloks last year we've seen a
lot of modular smartphone ideas where
you have your smartphone and you switch
out pieces which is pretty cool it's
like it's like building your own
computer you have huge on this so it's
exciting okay so Google unveiled spiral
2 so this is the newest prototype of
their project ara smartphones they did
it at the project ara Developers
Conference over in Puerto Rico so here
look they put a speaker in there they
put two two power blocks so like let's
say you want double the battery life
there's two different battery modules
this one is night vision camera they
showed a whole bunch of different
modules in this video which is pretty
awesome
whoa so the parts that snap in place by
using magnets so these magnets you slide
these pieces into place I really like
that part of the video where they said
crack screen and then they just slide a
new screen compasses look at that
compass heart rate monitors there all
kinds of stuff in there and then they
show this big array of like different
pieces that could potentially be in the
in the blocks on the back of the phone
there's like nest Google Toshiba like
there's all these different people in
there and companies which is pretty
awesome so look it looked cool like it
looks really cool and actually what I
was a skeptic when I first heard about
this like when phone walks him home like
I don't know you guys like I mean it
makes sense because we started buying
computers pre-built and then a bunch of
hobbyists got into making them you know
themselves and building themselves and
now you and I build our own computers
this DIY
so this is sort of an evolutionary step
in smartphones I think for me yeah I
want that I can think of a million
things to put on there is that our is
that our TD of the day what kind of
things would you want to put on your
phone it's not but you guys could
totally tell us and we could talk about
it anyway
like if we want to tweet at us yeah I
like it because I said the what was it
the night vision thing yeah it was cool
yeah and it's like in stock people
aren't for my phone and the neat thing
is is you can pick the things like so
the idea is that you could pick the
things that are the most important to
you so I'm all about camera on a phone I
don't necessarily need a front-facing
camera I don't know like maybe I don't
need it so far selfie or well not that
often no and so but maybe I really want
a high-end camera so maybe for example
Canon makes a modular piece that is like
a super high-end lens it's like that
right it's like it's for every different
person so if you're someone who likes to
like travel or hike a lot you've got the
compass you've got many like information
anything a heart rate monitor nation you
have you're a doctor maybe you have like
a pulse thing or I don't think we're
real technically yeah super uber doctors
really but I love it so like I like I'm
I'm like a gamer so maybe there's like
things you can add on that are like
little joystick knobs yeah this is great
I like I like the possibilities I'm
worried about it being junkie you know
like maybe prototypes are probably a
little thick but over time the neat
thing is hard enough to buy a new phone
I know it of course the new base model
you got to buy the new baseball but the
cool thing is is that you're able to
switch out even they're saying like
processors and stuff so when you upgrade
your phone you're out just throwing away
a phone you're just you just pop a new
processor and then it's faster not that
I am interested to hear what everybody
else comes up with yeah please please
send us your ideas because I have a
feeling they're gonna be really good um
but yeah I really like there's three
different size blocks on this smartphone
and then they're saying that they're
gonna go into pilot testing this year
and have about twenty to thirty modules
available so Wow we won't see it in like
you know obviously beta or like Google
glass where you can do the explorers
program that just got discontinued today
but yeah I feel like some developers
will actually be able to get their hands
on this this year which is pretty
exciting very cool so tell me about the
power plug because this story is
everywhere right guys you get SuperDuper
cool in the wizard
no no but all right the power glove is
so bad so bad it's good this going
everywhere because it's totally amazing
it involves the power glove and actually
serving a purpose okay so this guy Dylan
Mackey
he works on Robot Chicken currently and
he also works for Pez one of my favorite
YouTube channels he decided that he
wanted to use the power glove to help
him with stop-motion animation
really so how this works is he DIY this
he replaced the circuit board inside of
the power glove so that he could use it
to scroll through frames play the frames
and capture I mean like it was just DIY
it so you can see before he was carrying
around like a like a you know a little
little controller it was more hold it in
his hands so he wanted it to just be
like you know so you'd have to hold
anything except and he's saying that
it's it's way easier to do and he's very
excited about it this is cool yeah it's
based it uses a Bluetooth that connects
to his camera and the best part above
all about this is he built it so that if
you fist bump it makes a sound that says
everything awesome Oh effing awesome
well it says no actual but I'm seeing it
so I cannot say that you can think about
it in your head we only get one a year
and you we've already met that quota
sorry
crapola nuts but there you go you can
check out the full video it's on it's on
Vimeo yeah it's so cool oh yeah I forgot
to mention he has a little a few analog
things on there like tweezers in which
he can pick up things like it like faces
and stuff like that and he also has a
magnet that he can attach a bunch of
different things on - yeah like parts so
he has an eyebrow kit you saw there so
he can pick up the pieces of eyebrows
for the characters and like change their
eyebrows with the little tweezers it's
just super awesome but that's really
cool I love when they repurpose things
to like make it useful because obviously
the power glove you know that you can
see so that's our hashtag of the day
what so our hashtag the day is TD power
and oh the question is if you could
MacGyver any old product into something
useful today right what would you do
okay you go first I think I would use a
viewmaster remember the view masters
where you put the thing and I
use it as a VR headset I wanna be able
to slide my phone in I'm like the
viewmaster yeah okay
I would definitely no I would definitely
I would definitely do the power glove
power glove I like the power glove
cheating you already seen like this egg
this guy using it you gonna pick you but
I don't make stop motion like there's a
million other things that I could do
like maybe I could you wipe okay or
maybe like I could repeat zja get a
robot they like pets my cat for me and I
don't have to leave the couch wow that
is super duper lazy that's right yeah I
mean there's a whole bunch of stuff oh
boy I turn into a pit boy there you go
from sobs sorry I'll turn it out but
there's got to be a lot of different
stuff I'm sure like Rob or like what's
some other old tech just anything I mean
you get bit yeah who is skip it what
could you do with this I don't even want
to know anyway so yeah TD power what
what would you repurpose what would you
repurpose into and what would you
reverse it I ain't talked down on me for
wanting to repurpose power good well yes
guys only scratch the surface alright so
and that's why everybody's excited is
know it's super cool by the way I do
have an issue with this and that is that
have you ever tried a power glove on
there has an adult there they're pretty
made for kids yeah and so let me see
Archer is Alana like this look at my
hands it's really sad it's footballs
yeah pama basketball whatever you know
slap people like in Everlong and the
music better Dave girl gets a big hand
that's me that was me I was a stunt guy
alright last thing we have for headlines
is lab-grown muscles i'll keep this
pretty brief this is awesome we've seen
lab-grown muscle fibers before but the
reason these are so particularly
interesting is because they actually not
only respond to electrical stimulation
which has always existed including
inside the human body but they also
respond to drugs so a muscle relaxers or
drugs designed to make muscles do
something in particular what about
steroids probably their drugs drugs
drugs so drugs are drugs so this is from
Duke University and the
Searchers showed this off on video and
like I said the important part of this
whole thing is they can respond to drugs
as opposed to just electrical
stimulation and they put these slightly
developed stem cells into a scaffolding
and then grew muscle fibers they like
coax them into growing as muscle fibers
and the cool thing about this is that
say for example you go to the doctor and
you're like you know I'm having this
muscle issue whether it's a disease or
maybe you're just having a general
problem they're like okay you problem
yeah me and they say okay well we're not
really sure if this like this trial drug
is gonna work for you and might respond
very badly to you so we're gonna grow
your muscle fibers in a lab and test
them so you're your own you would be
your own tests up there get muscles yeah
yeah kind of so I was like that's kind
of just a really neat thing it might
also help like human trials for muscular
drugs because the thing is is you're not
putting people at risk so it's just for
testing in your body
potentially for testing yeah this isn't
a thing where it's like hey we're gonna
grow you some muscles and then implant
them like it's it's not like that but
it's like gastón yeah exactly do I eat
four dozen eggs so that you're roughly
the size of a barge um yeah no this is
really cool and I just I saw and I
thought it was so fascinating that when
I'm doing stuff like this and that and
that it's actually these fibers that are
not connected to anything else are able
to respond to drug treatments which is
super weird but cool they did they say
how long it took to grow the muscles I
didn't see that in the couple articles I
looked at I would imagine it takes a
little while you know cuz it takes a
while to grow things like skin grafts
and other other stuff in a lab I mean
god they're growing organs in a lab now
which is bizarre does that accidentally
grow human one of these days it's just
gonna there's gonna be like a little
sentient liver that's like hey guys like
it's gonna be so bizarre
alright on that note we're gonna take a
quick break we'll be right back it's
time for another round of Intuit when we
come back which we have some good stuff
this week and and then we have your user
feedback and our phone time for the day
so don't click away tomorrow daily
welcome back to the show we're back
where we're still you always look like
you're looking at things and this I'm
looking for you you're supposed to be
over there anyway
the walls are literally right on the
other side of this so it's like this is
just the wall and like it always looks
like we're looking around as it was a
giant cavernous room it's the way I I'm
a YouTube guy so I'm looking at all the
related videos usually something over to
the related videos a lot of sense that
makes a lot of sense okay it's Thursday
we haven't done this in like three weeks
it's time for into it alright so kale
yeah you are we were into some very
specific things this week which I think
we all are yeah so go ahead well
television is back it's been you know
everybody took the holiday holiday break
but I'm more excited about that right
now the comedies are the ones that are
making the big like the early returns
there is Parks and Rec it's coming back
for its final season first two episodes
we're all right but it's just exciting
to like watch a show get it's like final
season but man I love I love comedies
because those are the ones that you're
like I'm cooking dinner okay broad city
I had a pretty great return its first
episode was like like yesterday or
something like that really fun if you
haven't checked out broad city it's
really fun it's about these two you they
just got renewed for a third season whoo
great show broad city Archer is more my
favorite show Archer is back there there
they work for the CSC is CSI they were
CIA now this show is always great some
of the best voice actor on television
Kriegers my one of my favorites Kruger
amusing so yeah and then yeah so it's
always sunny always I don't think we
have a match for that always saying is
is is back and yeah it was imagine that
they go excited yeah genera Belov yeah
all these comedies are back these are
really great for like selling home after
work and distressing and and unwind and
I always cook a steak I don't know what
I cook a lot of steaks and chicken
chicken and steak Couser Couser at
hashtag is steak so you break fabric
thank you break alright cool so what are
you into
I'm into this is really exciting I saw
say Elon Musk tweeted and I quote we'll
be building a Hyperloop test track for
companies and student teams to test out
their pods most likely in Texas
Hyperloop Hyperloop okay so in Hyperloop
is a technology that Elon Musk has
discussed but we haven't really seen an
action there's this great video over on
Weis puppet where they explain exactly
how it works he had mentioned originally
that he would have a Hyperloop that
would go it's a super high-speed rail I
know so uses this technology it goes the
speed of sound SuperDuper fast in gold
pods if I think they said six people and
so the concept idea for this is kind of
a thing that some people have said I
don't think this will ever happen some
people have said this is a great idea
it's almost like he knows like weird
vacuum capsules at the bank like old
timey like old school banks stuff where
you put on capsule in it sends it via
vacuum or the the tubes from Futurama
yeah sure yeah totally like that so this
is how it worked this video super green
I highly recommend anybody watched it if
you're not sure what Hyperloop is so and
then it would it would push things
really really fast so you'd be able to
go I forget what the time frame was but
it was it's like it's like 45 minutes to
go from here to San Francisco it's super
duper fast yeah and he was saying like
relatively safe because the thing is
this is not on Rails like a traditional
commuter train why would you say
relatively well because we it's it's
never been tested this is it doesn't
exist so so yeah he's saying now that
they are officially looking into
building a straight-up Hyperloop test
track which is really exciting for
anybody who loves superfast travel and
the future because this seems like a
very Jetsons II idea this is very the
future very exciting and very cool I'm
really looking forward to what's going
on that I'll be keeping a very close eye
I mean we'll probably be 76 by the time
it comes out but like I always feel like
the day after I die all these great
things are gonna happen like we're gonna
cure cancer we're gonna find immortality
the secret to immortality and uploading
our consciousness to like some sort of
virtual reality simulation we're gonna
have these flying car super high-speed
you know maglev like whatever super
high-tech travel teleportation like
we're just gonna fear all this stuff out
the day after I'm dead you want to be
immortal
I think in a computer simulation I would
yeah in a computer simulation like the
matrix like the matrix yeah yeah I think
I would yeah I think I would do it um
but yeah so so that's we're into which
now it's time to get into what you're
into which is your user feedback you're
into your user cuz they're they're into
their opinions I trust you you're much
better transitions I just no no
absolutely not so um yesterday we asked
you guys use the hashtag TD Nintendo and
Louis what you got or didn't get or
wanted to see from the next Nintendo
Direct did somebody say f-zero I mean I
don't want to no not yet
we only got one piece of feedback on
Twitter about this so maybe YouTube Kael
didn't look at YouTube so you can blame
kill for not listening to you guys but
Hector wrote to us on Twitter and said
the next direct needs to showcase an
amiibo specific game
I haven't been impressed with amiibo
basically giving you DLC which you know
kill obviously is he's super what do you
why do you look like that for I don't
want any more amiibo stuff he's over
amiibo that looks that shot is insane by
the way it looks hilarious I'm waiting
for I'm actually I actually fully agree
with him because I was he's saying I
want you to do something a they need to
have a purpose fair enough yeah totally
fair I think that's I was hoping when I
bought the amiibo and and obviously
nobody's excited about it because nobody
tweeted us but I want the amiibo to save
my Super Smash Brothers stats okay I
saved like oh how many of this and this
and then you can take it something like
level them up somehow like that because
you unlock moves and stuff if you're
deceived nobody cares alright alright
fair enough um and then we got another
we got an email from Ron and Ron wrote
to us he's a longtime fan and he says in
episode 110 kale seems to have given all
the credit for house of cards to
research done by Netflix technically not
true house of cards the new Netflix
version was based on the earlier version
of house of cards done on the BBC back
in the 1990's starring Ian Richardson
again available on Netflix and
apparently hysterically funny just
saying good show good stuff last week
from CES you to keep up the good works
however however okay however I did some
research on this you're both
right you're both right yeah take that
Ron we're both right on HuffPo I looked
up an article I did some research I
looked up an article about how house of
cards came to be and at the time there's
a gentleman working for one of the
development guys at Netflix he said
their wealth of data on user viewing
habits proved there was a large audience
for David Fincher Kevin Spacey and
political thrillers so that was
definitely a thing but they chose to
license house of cards from the BBC
because of that data and because they
wanted to make it a thriller with Kevin
Spacey but they wouldn't have bought
house of cards if they dad had they not
had that dad so you're both right you're
totally both right and also because I
did this research house of cards is
actually a novel so before even that
show it was it's based on I hope they do
a house of cards novel now this is just
yeah it's gonna come up but that just
means that Ron and I should be hosting I
wish it does together we complete the
information it's trail Ron call me call
us I'm ordering pizza
and then call me so I really like that
you guys were both right so there there
you go but I think the research I was
like okay I'm gonna look this up I
actually like the rebuttal stuff you had
people usually people like doing
comments of like your dumb railroads
aren't purple or something really just
like yeah angry and very polite it was
like he did say I was wrong constructive
crime yeah he kind of like gave us an M
for me he gave you a little massage and
then told you you're wrong yeah so that
you felt kind of good some youtubers are
on point others that just want to punch
people in the face I just want to watch
the world thank you Ron and yeah but I'm
a big researcher so I was like okay I'm
gonna look this up and then finally it's
time for our phone time for the day
our delightful fan Corbin wrote to us
today are you crossing your fingers that
it's your new favorite holy crap okay is
that Disneyworld
yes yes he says hi my name is Corbin my
mom took this picture in Disneyworld on
the monorail with a Nexus 5 and then did
some editing in the gallery app so
obviously it's the colors have been
enhanced the contrast has been you know
boost it a little but super gorgeous
still and the fact that it came from
next back we've been seeing a lot of
Nexus 5 pictures I guess a lot of people
have Nexus fives which is pretty cool
I'm kind of interested in what he did
but like as far as like touching it up
yeah I have some beautiful resorts but
the fact that she was able to get this
one and get the entire resort is really
impressive super great I mean really
really good yeah Corbin's mom I guess
we're gonna pen down yeah Corbin trying
to hear about right there reviewer your
mom is though your mom is our favorites
the show very impressive though thank
you super good and if you guys want to
submit your phone tog Rafi to be
considered for the show please email us
tomorrow at cnet.com and of course you
can send your user feedback tell us
about what you wanted project ara what
kind of modules yeah so tell us tell us
what you want to see again te power what
old-school device would you re
Commission and turn into something new
what would you do it a lot of homework
yeah you guys got some homework I listen
I did house of cards research the least
you can do is drop us a line and if you
hate email that's cool because we have
social media you can find us at tomorrow
daily on twitter facebook instagram
tomorrow daily TV on google+ and
tomorrow daily over on tumblr and
Corben's mom or maybe Corbin don't
forget to subscribe on youtube at alike
thought i'm gonna comment down there I
don't know just just something happy do
you have something happy happen to your
day but just fine just kill off a little
bit of YouTube anger don't put it in
there just like just ignore that for a
while and iTunes listeners hello and
don't forget to rate it you know you
need something so radio you know the
radio voice yeah I don't forget to rate
and review yeah say something and if
you're doing the review I say something
nice about Corbin's mom yeah
something nice about something nice
anyway but not too nice cuz that might
be weird my
yeah don't go there girlfriend yeah
because maybe Corbin's mom has Corbin's
dad in the picture we're getting so
let's not get we're breaking into this
yeah we're breaking we're getting way
too deep into this so that is it for the
show you can find us on social media I
met Ashley asked us on Twitter that kill
not a mess on Twitter and we'll be back
on Monday with a brand new docket of
weird-ass future-tech all the things
that you didn't know you wanted to know
and until then vegan humans I will see
you next time good weekend
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
