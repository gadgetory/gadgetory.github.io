but it's not always so great as a laptop
stand in it depends on whether you have
the right keyboard and the options for
the newest 10.5 inch iPad pro are pretty
mixed apple smart keyboard is compact it
folds into a quick and easy keyboard
mode and it doubles as a cover but it's
expensive and the keys are a little soft
compared to a laptop plus there's no
backlighting and it doesn't protect the
iPads back either you're going to need
to buy a back cover separately logitech
slim combo is both a back cover and a
keyboard the keyboard is backlit and it
has great key travel it also has extra
key functions like a laptop the back
cover comes with a flexible angle
kickstand which is seriously helpful and
there's also a pencil loop built in the
keyboard detaches as well in case you
don't want to type and prefer to just be
a case the problem is the whole case is
bulky and the design is meant to stay on
a table not your lap the floppy feel and
the large lower half aren't necessarily
going to be great for travel with
limited desk space like say a narrow
airline table but it's affordable and it
winds up being a better keyboard if you
have a 12 point 9 inch iPad though Apple
Smart keyboard also exists but I prefer
a logitech slim combo here it's a lot
better choice the larger iPad isn't left
friendly to begin with so the cases
design feels better match for tables the
larger keyboard folds back to take up
less space and the top cover fits much
better on the iPad it's a great pick and
it works on the older twelve point nine
inch pro 2 still I preferred last year's
much more portable nine point seven inch
iPad pro case from Logitech that I could
lap type with</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
