to figure out the best way to store my
photos it all started with shoeboxes and
then I moved to hard drives and then it
all went to the cloud now we're lucky
enough to live in a time where there's
so many options when it comes to storing
our photos online but on the other hand
some of the options out there how do you
pick the right one I'm going to give you
some advice on choosing the right cloud
photo storage solution that works for
you first off you want to think long
term the reason so many companies offer
you free storage for your photos is
because they know how difficult it can
be to switch services down the line so
you want to think about a company that's
gonna be around for the next 10 20 50
years but if this is gonna be my main
backup for a lifetime of photos I don't
trust the young guys won't go under in
the next 10 years or be sold to another
company so that leaves us with the big
boys you got Google Apple Amazon
Microsoft Yahoo and to some extent
Dropbox though I have a hard time
believing they won't get snatched up
eventually let's boot out Apple and
Amazon right off the bat iCloud only
works with Apple devices and it doesn't
handle video so boo and then Amazon's
Cloud Drive is just too basic so let's
go through the rest Google's photo
service is called Google+ photos you get
15 gigs of free storage though you have
to share those gigabytes with your gmail
and your google drive it also works with
your browser or you can auto upload from
the Android or iOS app now if you need
more storage you can pay for it up to 16
terabytes downside is is tied to google
plus Google's answer to Facebook you can
set photos to private but ultimately
Google is dangling the service out there
to get people to use their social
network in share photos more people more
photos more stuff to sell ads around
which is really what Google is all about
for something a little more cut-and-dry
you can try Microsoft onedrive formerly
Microsoft SkyDrive it works with Android
and iOS and also windows and windows
phone comes with 15 gigs of free storage
plus you can buy more it's a clean
layout includes detailed information on
your photos include the exif data my
only worry here is as the recent name
change implies is that I don't feel
Microsoft is totally I
hang out I mean Microsoft as a company
is going to be around a long time but I
feel like maybe this time next year
Microsoft will call this thing super
xbox live photos or something else I
mean it's still a great solid option
especially if your Windows user you have
a Windows Phone but if you're not
there's some other options to explore
next up dropbox almost identical to one
drive it's an online file locker with a
very clean look and apps for every
platform including windows they have a
mobile app called carousel that does an
excellent job of letting you quickly
browse through your photo collection
with a timeline bar at the bottom of the
app the downside here is that you only
get five gigs of free storage but we
have to start paying unlike Microsoft or
Google online storage is drop boxes
entire business and they don't make up
the difference on online advertising
finally there's flickr by yahoo and full
disclosure I've used flickr for years so
I'm a little biased it works on every
platform you can windows phone there are
useful privacy controls is a huge
community of users and the best part is
there's one terabyte of free storage
you'll get some ads but a full terabyte
should be enough to back up your average
photo library also video support is
limited to one gigabyte per video so you
have to back up longer clips to youtube
or do the world a favor and shoot
shorter vacation videos so there you go
that's my best advice for where to go to
store your photos in the clouds</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
