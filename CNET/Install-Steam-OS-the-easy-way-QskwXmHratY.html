things one of the most interesting was
steam machine these compact gaming
computers operate on Valve's new CMOS
which the company hopes to compete with
Xbox one and PlayStation 4 steam machine
prices range from $500 all the way to
six thousand dollars but there's no need
spend that much money I'm dan Graziano
and I'm going to show you how to
transform your computer into a steam
machine before we get started
steam loss is still a beta there are
tons of bugs that have to be ironed out
and performance isn't very stable
installing the operating system will
also erase everything on your hard drive
including windows so it's imperative
that you backup or disconnect the
primary drive and use a spare drive
there are two methods to install steam
OS an easy method and a custom install
method today we'll focus on an easy one
your computer must be equipped with an
Intel or AMD 64-bit processor have at
least four gigabytes of RAM an Ethernet
connection and one terabyte of hard
drive space your motherboard must also
include UEFI boot support which most
motherboards from the past few years do
an Nvidia graphics card is recommended
but steam OS supports both AMD and Intel
GPUs although valve has said that's
optimized the platform for Nvidia
graphics the last thing you'll need is
this a USB flash drive with least four
gigabytes of space you'll start by
downloading the official steam OS image
zip from valves website as that's
downloading connect your USB flash drive
to your computer and format to fat32
this can be done on Windows with a
right-click and selecting format or an
OS X by going to the utilities folder
and selecting Disk Utility the drive
must be renamed to sis restore in all
caps once it's finished downloading
extract all the files to the root of
your flash drive power down the system
and boot it from the USB Drive this can
be done in your computer's bios settings
which can be accessed with the Delete
key or
one of the F keys depending on your
system click on the UEFI drive and
select restore entire disk from the boot
menu let the system do its thing when
you're prompted to do so hit the enter
button the computer will then shut down
at this point remove the USB drive and
power it on you should boot into CMOS
from here simply log in or create a new
steam account and begin exploring the
operating system if your system doesn't
boot directly into steam OS check to see
what the default boot disk is in your
BIOS menu for more information and a
link to the official steam OS download
