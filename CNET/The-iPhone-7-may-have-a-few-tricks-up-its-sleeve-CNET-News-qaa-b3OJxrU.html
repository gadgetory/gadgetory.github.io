some important changes coming to the
iPhone in September judging by the new
photos published on the French tech log
nowhere else the iPhone 7 will have no
headphone jack a larger camera and
sleeker antennas now this is not the
first time we've seen or heard about
these changes but the rumors are
becoming more and more likely as the
September launch event approaches
according to the site Apple has begun
production on the iPhone 7 citing
valuable contacts within the
subcontractor factories as the leakers
of this information though headphone
jack means it could have a slimmer body
and enough room for an extra speaker
making it the first iPhone with stereo
sound the wider lens points to changes
in the camera for the four point seven
inch model suggesting only the 5.5 inch
model could be sporting that dual camera
would be hearing about and the third
visible difference shows a change in the
position of the antennas that would
border the edges rather than cut across
the back this is gonna be enough to
tempt buyers whether or not it is
there's no question the iPhone 7 will
have to compete against an army of
high-end phones with similar features
this year and with talks of Google
manufacturing its own hardware the
competition is only getting stiffer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
