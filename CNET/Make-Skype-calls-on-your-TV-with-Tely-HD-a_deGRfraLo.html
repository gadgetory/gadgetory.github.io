here at the Consumer Electronics Show
2012 at the first look stage getting a
first look at the tele HD this is a
device that will turn your television
into a Skype video chatting service it's
just the device you stick on top and all
you need is the Skype service and an
internet connection a home Wi-Fi and
essentially you could just start
chatting right away from the ease of
your couch or if you're a small business
owner or business professional you can
certainly also use it for that too it
just came out is now selling on Amazon
for $250 now the very first version of
this product will let you have Skype
calls and you'll be able to do it in
different ways you'll be able to change
the picture and picture you can have two
people talking be able to look at photos
or even watch a television show at the
same time over-the-air updates will
allow it to have more Android apps on
there so essentially you can have gaming
on there the device itself on top has
four microphones so that way when you're
on the couch you can really make a cone
of sound to get be able to hear you from
far away and the camera here is 720p HD
and if you're paranoid about the camera
being on there well there's a little
slot so you can just shut it well you
don't want to use it and if you're not
home
the tele HD will save a video message
from whoever you miss the call from so
that's pretty handy now in the back of a
Tele HD you have an SD card slot which
lets you send whatever photos are on
that card slot to the person you're in
Skype conversation with and they get the
full original quality of that photo sent
to them so if you went on vacation and
you want to send some photos to a loved
once just sticking the SD card slot and
they can get those photos to them
there's also a USB port so you do the
same thing on a USB dongle there is an
Ethernet port here so even if you don't
have home Wi-Fi you could just hook it
up to the Internet through the cord and
there's also an HDMI connection so that
way you can get 720 p HD connection
we're seeing a few products come out and
CES that have a video camera for
television something makes it pretty
easy to do couch casting so you can see
that in that
makes it easy for a family to talk to
their family or a loved one but there
could be some creative uses in here for
people who want to do their own web
shows for only $250 the equipment's
pretty easy to set that up so they're
really making it easier and cheaper for
you to be able to connect on a webcam on
a larger screen we've seen that I'm
Bridget Carey with your first look at
the tele HD</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
