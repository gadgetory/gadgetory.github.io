and virtual reality is pretty trippy is
tingly in my mouth and this experience
is one of the many high-tech
enhancements coming to future cruise
vacations with Royal Caribbean the
cruise line invited us to Brooklyn New
York to show off what technology wonders
the company is cooking up for guests you
won't be having a four-course meal in VR
but a few minutes with some dessert
bites can be a fun way that play with
your senses using an HTC vive headset I
was able to see my hands animated in the
virtual world and when it was time to
pick up a new bite to eat and with every
bite the room transformed the company
also wants to play with your senses in
this stateroom in this concept cabin
screens bring windowless space to life
complete with a fake balcony wake up to
a sunrise and watch the room transform
around you find tranquility in a
rainforest where water dripping from the
palms above falls to the floor and who
wouldn't want to sleep under a starry
night sky complete with moonlight
reflecting off the ocean water below
it's only a concept for now but elements
of this technology may find their way in
the company's next ship one thing that
vacationers will see soon are
self-driving shuttles guests will step
aboard one of the driverless buses
packed with sensors the idea being it
would save you walking time when you're
near the port when you're leaving and
returning to the ship made by the French
company Navia Royal Caribbean plans to
spend the next year testing these out
first with its employees at its base in
Miami to the cruise but before you board
a cruise Royal Caribbean plans to let
guests check in with just a smile at the
camera provided you first took a selfie
at home with their special app the
facial recognition technology we tried
was instantaneous and if it works like
it promises it would make boarding a
breeze
your face is also connected to other
services I'm really like it's time for a
drink it's just one of the many tricks
available in the cruise lines upcoming
app servers can locate you based on your
proximity to Wi-Fi hubs on the ship and
they look for the person that matches
the profile picture to deliver the drink
Bridgette that is me thank you very much
not everyone may want to be connected
while cruising but at least this puts a
different twist on vacation time
Cheers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
