has it down pat I'm here at CES 2019 at
one of the biggest booths in central
whole this is LG and I don't know if you
remember last year that LG had that
walter canyon of or LED TVs
well they one-up themselves this year
because take a look this is the
waterfall it is an epic sites there are
268 OLED TVs all the way in an array
from the ceiling to the floor and
they're curbing and bending and the
light is undulating it's quite an
experience there are mirrors on either
side which makes it kind of look like
you're in a massive kaleidoscope
the twilight zone it's just epic just
take a look at some of this incredible
imagery you can see right now this is
the one it gets me every time
it's super it's super crazy
and of course it's all about the sound -
if you can hear it hopefully you can
hear it through my microphone it's
booming it's all about their scenes of
the desert and the full waterfalls of
course the waves and light okay let's go
on now the demo is over let's go back
into the LG group itself there's a lot
of stuff here so let's go through it
first up when you walk in what you're
going to see is LG's next showstopper
which is of course the rollable OLED TV
there is a wall of them it is like five
moving in a row on either side and
they're just rolling up and down and up
and down
all day long all night long these look
pretty epic when you can see them all
side-by-side and they're also going up
to different levels - so they're
staggered so the ones when they end or a
little lower and then they go up to a
higher look in the middle of course
because the TV actually lets you roll it
down to a little segment so it has kind
of three views you can either have it
fully closed fully up like you can see
here or rolls down into a little segment
so you can see details like the weather
and change between apps
it's really cool seeing them all rolls
in one unit like this
I didn't know how many times they're
gonna roll up and down in the entire
story but it's probably going to be in
thousands if not the tens of thousands
okay so now we've seen some TVs let's go
and check out some washer dryers and
some clothing solutions over here is
what's called the LG styler now this is
the actual unit itself but this is kind
of like a see-through to show you what's
happening inside so it can fit like
three different coats give them a nice
little clean and a steam you can also do
a decreasing system or crease it in the
correct way is not a dry cleaner so I
don't know anything about how to prep
quarters but this machine does and then
we also have a moving hanger which is I
have no idea why but I guess it's to get
the crazies out of the clothes it's
really cool to just watch it anyway
obviously a lot knows Russian dryers
here and the LG booth and then we're
gonna walk a little further down because
LG is all about the ur LEDs all about
the big TVs we've seen the rollable TVs
try not to walk into people as the old
records within the relevant TVs and of
course over here we have the rest of the
OLED range that 8k 88 inch right here
it's the next big one from LG and this
year LTS also decided to make it in a
smaller 65 inch size as well that was on
the show at the LG Display group and I
think if we walk around here
we'll see the 75 inch of the Nano cell
TV as well so this is another size 2
LG also does burns you would avoid LTV
40 is right here on the display
come over you have some robots to show
you because who doesn't love robots the
last year LG had a couple of service
robots that was showing off their a
little bit more fully fledged this year
Ryder Bao take a look
the Chloe robots
and they're just showing a couple of
demonstrations about everything they can
do from being a porter to take your bags
up to your room or even a car to take
them goods and services and also the
supplies to your room say if you're
staying in a hotel so much stuff here at
the LGV they change in cnns ds-2019 so
lots more of the latest technology</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
