the Apple buy for everything good and
bad inside the world of Apple it's a
short week for news but the big story
comes to us from kji securities ming chi
quo and bloomberg who both report that
Apple is working on 3d face scanning
technology to unlock your phone instead
of using touch ID now the new reports
say Apple is testing an improved
security system to log into your phone
authenticate payments and launch secure
apps by scanning your face Apple may
also be testing eye scanning to augment
this system as well now we've already
heard earlier rumors that the new iPhone
will likely have a new 3d depth sensing
camera Apple's facial recognition system
can unlock your face within 100
milliseconds according to the report and
allegedly also works when your device is
laying flat on a table so you won't need
to hold it up directly to your face now
the report also says it captures more
data points compared to a fingerprint
scan which technically makes it more
secure than touch ID we've seen
samsung's built-in iris scanning in the
galaxy s 8 but you can always count on
the internet to show us that you can
actually unlock it using a two
dimensional photograph Apple's 3d depth
sensor is believed to help eliminate
this now this new security feature is
still under testing and may not appear
with the new iPhone 8 but Apple's intent
is to eventually replace the touch ID
fingerprint scanner completely now all
the current leaked designs show the
absence of any physical fingerprint
reader so it's not clear if this system
will be used or if they actually figured
out touch ID under the glass which is
technically a lot more difficult to do
the new facial recognition system would
be easier to implement if it's accurate
it feels like a more realistic option
for Apple over touch ID under the glass
but it could also still be nixed so
guess what we'll find out the actual
truth with an iPhone keynote just a few
months away and for all of you who are
anticipating an iPhone with touch ID
embedded under the screen based on
rumors that were never confirmed prepare
yourselves you might be let down by a
feature that never really existed now
the Apple bite is here to emotionally
prepare you for this so come on come on
bring it in here's a hug for you okay
yeah see that's it you're gonna be
alright and if you haven't had a hug in
a while I bet that felt really nice
alright if you're on Apple music and I
too
but you're feeling left out with jay-z's
latest album drop of four or 44 on title
because come on the FOMO is real hold on
for a few more days according to
billboard 444 is coming and is expected
to see a release on Apple music and
iTunes around July the 8th unless you
already created your fourth title trial
account in you don't care and why is it
only an exclusive to title for just a
week well a report from January claims
Apple music provided over 13% of all
music streaming revenue while making up
7% of total music streams now title made
up just 0.33 of a percent of all
streaming revenue and point 1 percent of
total music streams Apple is known to
pay more to record labels in royalties
per stream compared to Spotify as well
ok apple also announced the opening of
the very first Apple Store in Taiwan's
capital Taipei on July the 1st the store
is called Taipei 101 and on the ground
floor of the Taipei 101 skyscraper now
there was a huge turnout but contrary to
popular belief I do not work at the
Taipei 101 store yeah That's not me
and we need to issue an apology we own
up to our mistakes here on the Apple
biden last week there you know what's a
boo-boo where we misspelled desktops as
dekstop so yes that's a bad apple and
for all of you who never made a mistake
in your entire life but wanted to make
sure we know can now feel better about
yourselves alright that's it for this
week's show you can always email us at
the Apple bite at cnet.com or tweet me
at Brian Tong thanks so much for
watching we'll catch y'all next time for
another bite of the Apple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
