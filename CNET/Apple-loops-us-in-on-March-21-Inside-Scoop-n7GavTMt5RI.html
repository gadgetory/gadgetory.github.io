an event on March 21 in cupertino
california sheraton can senior writer
for cnet is going to be there now let's
talk product first up the rumor mill is
talking about a smaller form factor
iPhone and possibly an iPad what else
can you tell us about that yeah those
are definitely the things we're
expecting we think they're going to come
out with a new phone that kind of looks
like the iPhone 5s but has updated
features in it that we've seen in the
iphone 6 and the success we're also
looking for a new 10 inch iPad Apple
came out with a new iPad pro last fall
but they haven't updated their regular
iPad line in a couple years now we're
really looking for updates to that that
could possibly make it a little bit more
like the iPad pro but it's just that
smaller screen and the invitation
actually says let us loop you in and now
is this hinting towards a watch update
possibly I don't think we're going to
see a new watch hardware this time we
could possibly see a new watch band that
could be what the loop you in feature is
probably see new watch software so you
know just trying to keep make that
better so people actually will use it
instead of buy it and put it in a drawer
we can see other software as well WWDC
their developer conference will be in
June most likely so we're probably not
going to hear too much in that regard
but that's something you know that they
could touch on as well and obviously at
the moment the FBI investigation is big
news for Apple do we expect them to
address anything about that at this
particular launch event yeah it's how do
you say that so they actually have their
hearing with the FBI the next day so
March 22nd down in Riverside California
so we were joking that you know the
Hyperloop or the the Luke you in could
be you know Hyperloop to transport us
all to Southern California I don't think
so but
you know that's a really big day for
Apple where they're going to have to
make their arguments before a judge on
why they should not have to create a new
version of iOS to unlock an iPhone so
you know they can possibly touch on
software or privacy security some of
these things at the event I don't think
it will necessarily be a huge focus
since this is kind of a product event
for them but we'll kind of have to wait
and see sharra thank you so much and if
you want to keep up with all of the
latest Apple news from the march twenty
