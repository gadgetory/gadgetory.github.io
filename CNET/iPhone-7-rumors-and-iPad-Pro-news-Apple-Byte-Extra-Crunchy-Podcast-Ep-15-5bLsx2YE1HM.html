of you listening those for those of you
that have been joining us we first of
all have got to say thank you a lot of
you filled out the survey that we asked

advertisers that make sense for you it
also keeps the lights on for us right
yes that is always important eyes yeah
it's important it's probably in big the

tell us your name where you from get
your question your comment and we go and
we do it and we put you in the show
right word okay so let's just jump into
the show we have a lot of things
floating around here we have ipad pro
news Apple TV news iphone 7 iphone do i
really want to say that yes oh that's a
thing we actually got a voicemail about
iphone 7 already is true we're already
getting there people but don't worry if
you
haven't purchased her iPhone 6s it's not
out of date just yet okay ipad pro news
rumors have been rumbling that it'll be
coming out next week around the 11th but
sam club sam's club why'd I say Sam club
is there is there an actual business
called Sam club knowing so Sam's Club
and that's not plural that's actually
Sam ' yes apostrophe s so it's Sam's
Club not a bunch of saying such as sam's
yeah a bunch of guys named Sam we should
make that clear hey yeah ok so the
popular warehouse chain has started
accepting pre-orders for apple's new
ipad pro on its website and listed the
release date of friday november the 13th
for the device now rumblies appointed to
the 11th which was wednesday from nine
to five Mac Sam's Club is saying the
13th which actually makes more sense to
me Friday has typically been a release
day for products typically I'm although
we do know that uh did the Apple TV come
out on a Monday possibly is that bad
luck though friday the 13th Lisa R oh no
that is that you you make a great point
there anyways they're accepting
pre-orders for the 32 gig entry-level
Wi-Fi model the 128 gig Wi-Fi model but
they're not selling the Wi-Fi cellular
model I'm still debating I've always
wanted an ipad with a cellular on it and
now that for LTE is so good I might do
it but I don't know I know I got the
Wi-Fi only ipad 2 and and there have
been times where I'm like damn I wish
this worked just even to have any option
right yeah you can you can just pay for
it and then take it off they're also
listing the prices a little cheaper 787
dollars for the 32 gig Apple hitta
listed at seven ninety nine and
nine-thirty seven instead of 949 for the
128 gig Wi-Fi one that is expensive dude
it's a computer I know how same as a
macbook pro basically what you add all
those things on but it's coming
according to Sam's Club according to
that date next week I've got to assume
that we're gonna see something no matter
what Apple is still not officially
commented on it the other thing though
it kinda to bring up and to talk about
if you guys had to guess what do you
think currently still to this day the
most used ipad model is
I mean you saw the headland nobody not
fair I know the answer but it makes
sense it totally makes sense I'm gonna
ask people we do we do like to we're not
catering this exactly to our scope errs
but we want to tell ask people a lot of
them are saying the correct answer which
is the ipad to the ipad 2 from 2011 Wow
is the number one used ipad to date this
is based on localytics analytics and
survey they kind of pulled what based on
traffic approximately twenty percent of
the population using it using an ipad is
an ipad to a first gen ipad mini would
be eighteen percent and then the ipad
air which is the one I currently own
seventeen percent it goes down from
there the ipad 4th gen thirteen percent
i am an ipad 3 3rd gen owner so I you
know your ten percent yeah I'm not
looking to upgrade anytime soon see and
then here's the other thing about this
right ipad 2 still popular still even
when they come out with the ipad pro the
ipad pro is a specific use case yes so
it's not like people are gonna stop
using the ipad 2 to get the ipad pro
that's true yes I when I look at these
numbers I'm going to guess if we look at
this survey let's say six months from
now if the ipad pro even shows up on
this they're going to most definitely in
my mind be under ten percent oh I'm
sorry pie because it's so specific yeah
I mean it's just it's geared towards
professionals and artists and stuff like
that or people who just like big screen
iPads like me yes you like to lick their
giant ice cream ipad screens haha you
got ice cream combined ice cream with
ice cream and ipad screen that's good so
just a little bit of ipad nuggets coming
out for you Apple TV we want to follow
up with this there's a lot of action
going around the apple TV a lot of
people been tweeting me and asking me
when are we gonna why didn't apple put
in a safari browser and to me my whole
thinking just because when you if you
try and think how Apple thinks Apple
likes to really control the experience
they don't want to take you out of there
you I that they're building for you
there user experience the look the feel
well
the Apple TV has been hacked to run a
makeshift Safari browser and it actually
looks really good in the execution of
how it's done this video has been posted
online you can actually see the way that
they use the apple touchpad remote is
once they're in the browser you actually
press on the touchpad like you click on
it and it changes between using it as a
mouse cursor versus scrolling with that
click which is really cool right that's
cool you can't do both things at once
but you can switch between the two he's
scrolling through up and down but then
can change it into that cursor the trick
about this right now is that it's
probably not going to be available
anytime soon it's based off of a private
api that this developer built and it
obviously apples not going to be using
it so that's what he's using to render
the web content but it is really cool
that's pretty cool i mean i'd love to
have a giant browser on my TV yeah for
all you devs out there it's an open
source project it can be downloaded
loaded by anyone it remains to be seen
if Apple ends up doing this my gut is
that Apple will not do this I think
Apple even would see this and like the
execution is done so well and they're
like yeah we don't want to do that yeah
I mean do you think you'll be able to
watch videos from other websites through
that or it's going to be locked down
well the the answer or the solution for
that is just using airplay that mirrors
your laptop that's kind of how to get
around the fact that some of these
services like Amazon TV or sling TV
aren't on the Apple TV but then the
performance of that is not the same as
it being native on the device yeah it
doesn't look great it's yeah it's just
not the same so it's like chromecast
we've been there y'all we have been
there also uh another developer hack
their apple TV OS to show iOS like app
folders this is from developer Steve
Tron Smith who has done kind of leaked
some of the code in past betas to show
people what might be coming he's
actually been able to kind of unlock and
show the fact that you could build
folders in TV OS and this is really
important because with the App Store
there I've already downloaded a crap
load of stuff on my Apple TV yeah and I
need folders you need to organize it all
I don't want to scroll five rows to get
the games when my nieces and nephews are
over they'll the only thing they want to
do is game on my on an Apple TV they're
like actually super excited to come over
this weekend my uncle bryan's doing some
hanging out with them and we're gonna
they like literally screamed for joy
when I said oh yeah you guys can play
jetpack joyride on a full screen TV
they're like Jack I'm not even
exaggerating right you can imagine if
you told your yeah it's like do you want
to play guys just headaches jetpack man
on a full TV screen it's kind of kind of
like a big deal for the kids on some of
the adults to like Crossy Road I'm not
gonna lie I really like that game huh I
saw you tweet about that the other day
that's funny remember we ripped on it
yeah you're looking on my dude it's just
a frog er rip off and then I'm playing
like dude it's a frog or ripoff that's
awesome it's a good one a good damn it's
a damn good one that's funny so a TV iOS
like app folders not there yet again
developers are having fun maybe it comes
maybe it doesn't um this one's another
story related to the apple TV series
people have also continued we have this
obviously this feedback loop on Twitter
where people kind of just say does this
have this why isn't it's not working I
had a guy say where's the support for
Ireland Siri doesn't understand my voice
series naughty we Steven say sorry sorry
my wife's born in Belfast Ireland by the
way it's like you're allowed to say
horrible things yeah and i am too i can
say any I can basically say anything not
anything but a lot of the relations
there was that video about this there's
like a Scottish guy talking to Syrian
and just wouldn't understand him at all
you couldn't do it right yeah so this
story is that despite series
availability in over 15 different
languages and over 30 countries on iOS
the apple TV is limited mostly because
they say apple says apple TV is
different and it requires training to
understand the variety of TV shows and
movies like basically pronouncing all
these different things correctly yeah
specific to and that makes sense that's
going to be difficult thing to overcome
sure so right now it's limited to
support for Australia Canada Great
Britain United States Germany France
Spain in Japan pretty much most of those
are predominantly you know the
pronunciation of these shows are
basically very close derivative of
English right yeah yeah like just a
little tweaks in there based on
pronunciation Apple did say they will be
bringing that from other countries and
they're trying to beef up the support
they haven't said when they will bring
that to the table but it is incoming
they understand the issues they know
it's happening but I'm sorry Ireland
sorry Irish I'm sorry Zimbabwe you can't
talk to your phones just yet it will be
coming soon they're working on it it's
coming apple says whenever and we know
that could that literally could be like
two years from now they're like hey guys
we just got support person Bob way
they're not gonna be happy about that
all right let's check this out Apple
podcasts also man we want people to
listen this show yes we love the fact
that you know we're just having fun
talking shop and the show has been
growing doing really awesome well apples
TV doesn't have a podcast at beach that
is crazy mind-boggling to me you know
what that could also be what a bad apple
oh I'm unprepared right now Apple TV
still doesn't have podcast support which
a lot of people have it synced to their
itunes account so right it's easy it
should just automatically just happen
it's not there there's a promos of the
apple TV on the retail side that have
shown in podcast icon it doesn't exist
right now so we'll see if that that has
that's a that's a no-brainer yes it's
more if they're like too long more bad
apples look I mean itunes is like one of
their biggest platforms in the world for
podcast so for everything right go it in
there please for content distribution
for everything but here's the thing and
we're gonna get off the whole apple TV
tip in a second I do feel like again I
do recommend the Apple TV for people in
the ecosystem but Apple kind of rushed
this product in a few ways and they're
all real small subtle ways I'm not even
saying they rushed it because of 4k but
the remote app for iOS that is on your
phone where people
used in the past it doesn't work with
the new Apple TV and I get part of that
because the touchpad remote on the apple
TV is different where you can physically
press it you'd almost need a 3d touch
phone to be able to translate exactly
the way you use the Apple TV remote for
this new Apple TV but either way iOS
remote app doesn't work um you can't the
podcast app which is pretty much a
no-brainer to get hooked up in there is
not available you used to be able to use
bluetooth keyboards to enter in your
credentials type in your username and
password blah blah instead of ticking
tacking it out on the remote which can
be a pain in the ass yes just pain in
the huge pain so those three things
right there are little minor things that
I think we will see eventually support
for them but Apple didn't do it out of
the gates right did you mention 4k
support I did I say yeah new iphone has
4k yo yeah that was that was a bad that
was that's about as a bad apple from the
start like yeah the fact that their
phones can shoot 4k video and you can't
toss them to an apple TV yeah now Apple
might be blaming like the a9 processor
because the Apple TV has an a8 but still
that's a big big miss for me yeah that
is a big problem because i want to see
fork I want to see my my videos in 4k on
my giant TV yeah are you gonna get a TV
that's basically 70 inches or larger
though that's really when a man likes 50
grand on a 4k no no not anytime soon
well you know they say in a couple years
4k TVs are gonna come down in price
basically basically be the price of when
OLED TVs or you know Vizio is already
going in that oh yeah right there
already like kind of near the price i
think i bought my my eight 1080p HD for
five hundred dollars like yeah be like
no that's not learning ten years ago i'm
a big fan of Vizio physios our price
point image quality overall price
overall everything you can't go wrong
like yeah you can be a snob and get the
right now I think the best image quality
we have from a TV set is a LG based OLED
TV that has the deepest blacks we've
seen since the days of the the TV right
behind you the Pioneer yes yes the
Pioneer series was ridiculous the plasma
pioneer up until then was rated the best
black levels on TVs now
it's a background for all of our podcast
it's a wallpaper wallpaper so uh yeah I
think that I do like the apple TV the
app store still has huge potential I
don't want to be a broken record about
this but I do feel like they rushed a
few things definitely okay let's talk um
one thing though I guess sometimes you
guys are really good at futuretelling I
you know if you guys don't know one of
my alter egos is nostra Tongass in the
apple byte show we haven't done any no
shirt on and stuff here yet we probably
will be for the end of the year beach
and we got to come up with a future
telling nickname and costume for you
seriously love that yeah we have to it's
like I'll be funny so um anyways one of
you guys made a call we're gonna play
them call and then we're gonna answer
your question all right hey fellas
listen to you guys a lot and I
appreciate your show just want to ask
real quick today's launch day for Apple
TV Monday the 26 and I just wanted to go
ahead and ask I haven't been able to
find online the answer to my question
it's been very vague at least what I
found but is a new Apple TV going to
allow us to use our own media that we be
there ripped or got them from other
sources as long as it's in the right
format obviously but I haven't heard too
much about that talk the whole my
computer icon now it's a laptop icon is
that still going to be the same I know
that a lot of developers received your
sets out there but I haven't heard
anything back or seen anything online
about it all right great enjoy your show
thanks a lot for your answer this is a
beautiful question perfect timing to
this just drop this week Plex now has an
app on the Apple TV now for those of you
that do not know what plexes or not
familiar with it it's basically a setup
where you have a plex media server and
what's great about it it's compatible
with windows with OS 10 even linux and
basically all your media files can be
stored there and then devices that you
use that have the plex app allah the
apple TV can then pull from that media
server and play them so if you for the
gentleman who called I'm gotta guess
because he was looking for solution he's
probably familiar with plex he might
even have a plex set up but the plex
media app is now available on the app
TV which is really cool that's super
cool because I store all my media just
on my laptop you know exactly just
filling space on my laptop so that'd be
great to just be able to dump it and be
able to stream it and I'm you know some
people are like oh well aren't you
telling people how to pirate stuff I'm
like no I will tell you but guess what I
was a college kid once in my life yeah
I'm gonna lie I have files that i
acquired like all different kinds of
crazy ways some of the stuff I ripped
from my own CDs some of the stuff like I
had like a DVD ripper of stuff I own
some I got other ways but guess what
that's just the reality Boop I don't
quite honestly I don't pirate anymore I
support every I have a job in the media
world I support the creative like field
so I that's why I buy all my stuff for
my tunes right yeah yeah yeah I mean
majority of all the stuff we own is
probably legally purchased now for mine
yeah yeah for sure for you and me yeah
yes I can't say that about some of my
friends and you know who you are yeah I
mean we were like you know we were
involved in the Internet age when
Napster first came out so scours on the
agent apster there was a lot of times it
was the Wild West back then yeah it was
you know now these days you have bit
torrents and things like that but um
anyways the plex media server get it if
you don't know what it's about for those
of you listening it's probably the
number one solution if you have your own
files of movies and move route movies
and movies TV shows music for you to be
able to play them on multiple screens
multiple devices it's it would be my
number one pick for that that's awesome
alright as we stroll right along we
alluded to it iphone 7 rumors oh
goodness ah we're really doing this
that's the best thing I could say it's
embarrassing I don't want to always talk
about it but guess what it's news people
are talking about so we might as well
all right Apple predicted to launch and
a 94 inch iphone in early 2016 this is
according to ming-chi kuo KGI securities
he's been an analyst that's plugged into
the supply chain his accuracy of
reporting in general has been actually
pretty good he called out
man which one he's called out like
things like the ipad mini before anyone
even was taught specific aspects like to
size screen phones he was one of the
very first to call that out so I'm gonna
give him a little props and go with this
he also i pad mini he's called a lot of
features or specific aspects like to
size screen phones he was one of the
very first to call that out so i'm gonna
give him a little props and go with this
he also says this one's kind of curious
to me the iphone 7 will have two
different configurations of ram he says
reportedly the 4.7 inch iphone 7 will
come with two gigs of ram which is the
standard right now and then the 5.5 inch
larger 7 plus will come with three gigs
Aram he also says that it'll be loaded
with an 810 processor the next
generation ship which is a no brainer
that's just normal they ought that the
processor gets upgraded every year for
the most part on the iphone line but
that a 4-inch phone will exist it will
not have 3d touch it'll basically be
like roughly 5 s looking ish it's kind
of like the iphone 5c which I was not a
fan of yes and I'm not hating on people
got the 5c but it was like exactly
opposite to everything Apple was at that
time yeah we haven't seen like another
they haven't done any upgrade to that
model at all right there's no I only six
eard but all the maybe the iphone 6c
will show up next year yeah yeah an
early year right so um there you go
that's some of the latest from iphone 7
I do have a funny story and I'm gonna
I'm gonna be a little jerk right now I
love the people at app or than just this
here here's the story according to apple
insider Apple is considering an earlier
than will insider I love all these
websites that work their butt off and
sometimes like look we're connected with
different sources but sometimes you have
to like give more than just this here
here's the story according Apple Insider
Apple is considering an earlier than
usual launch for the iphone 7 in 2016
now this is according to their source
but they say their source has no idea
when what month but that it could be
earlier so they're going to make the I
phone 6s obsolete earlier it's like if
you have one you need it if you're gonna
put out a story like that you need more
fact you can't just say earlier yeah
yeah that's basically what it is that's
all it is the iphone 7 might come out
earlier that's the story well they did
do that after all I the ipad 3rd
generation they did release the next
iPad like right away right i was like
within six months yeah something yeah so
I remember just being like what my iPad
sucks already but there's no indication
if it's gonna be in summer if it's gonna
be june or july and august not even a
month just earlier thanks guys i'm gonna
use the bathroom earlier than i did
yesterday that's news tweet that tweet
that alright here's some cool pens i
could lead patents that could lead to a
thinner mac this comes from the good
people who i do like and enjoy at apple
and said I'm just messing with people
because a lot of times we all have
scoops we have stories but if you can't
substantiate it enough you just can't
run the story and that's just one that's
kind of like half baked yeah all right
the patent US Patent and Trademark
Office on Tuesday just granted Apple a
patent for a low travel keyboard design
with force touch like sensors now what
does this mean right now we currently
are used to those physical keys that
have that popping action that poppy
motion that use this kind of these but
butterfly switches to keep them low
profile but still have that that push
tactile feel this would potentially mean
that Apple would be doing a force touch
keyboard that measures the pressure
place on a key based on how you press it
I that's kind of cool it's kind of cool
but I need I honestly beach like even if
these keys were raised a little bit what
did you want actually feel it sink in or
you don't care yeah I think I would want
to feel something you know that telling
it telling me I'm doing it right hey man
really really just use the name of a
scene that franchise yeah so the biggest
thing about this is we know how obsessed
Apple is about being thin it to win it
they're all about the thin it would make
laptops thinner if you get rid of this
physical mechanism right it's just a
force touch like layer yeah
but that's like typing on a table to me
and I don't want to do that that's weird
to me that seem weird right I don't know
I'm not its again Apple has been granted
it doesn't mean they're gonna do it
maybe they might implement it in another
product like an iPad possibly maybe I'm
really stoked about the ipad pro I'm
just saying yeah what are you gonna get
yours you're gonna get yours like next
week all the wool whatever day becomes
available i'm gonna buy it word but i'm
not i'm gonna buy the pencil to try but
you know because i have to review it but
i want to put it in the hands the
coolest thing i think about the ipad pro
quite honestly is i go to these comic
shows a lot like i was just at comikaze
in los angeles instead of getting

sketch for me oh yeah and then you just
save it digitally like oh time you have
this collection of like but then someone
like want to get a sketch on paper true
but you know it might be a little they
don't want to have all their tools out
they typically just come with a sharpie
I'm just a cool back you know some iPad

thousand and six hundred thousand
dollars Wow they get that that's gonna
look great in the new Apple headquarters
patina right in the middle of the UFO
yeah it's like historical art and
everything so up there you go that's
kind of a where we're at with this stuff
okay let's just check out we've got
phone calls again let me just remind you
where you all could call us the number
is 1 800 61 62 63 8 leave us your
voicemails we are so stoked with the
responses that we're getting if there's
anything inside the world of Apple
questions you have comments you'd like
to make like we'd like to hear your
opinions and thoughts the trick is that
we kind of want you to keep it around 20
seconds or so we can't have you go on
for a minute unless it's really good
yeah then we might let you go on like we
talk on our show for about half an hour
half of it is useless except everything
Stephen says okay you ready yeah let's
look at the first call here's number one
hi my name is Michael I had a question
about the Apple pencil if it will be
able to be used as a stylist for other
iPads or it's just going to be for the
ipad pro because of the 3d touch that
the ipad pro offers over its Apple using
that as like a marketing strategy just
like people have another incentives to
buy the ipad pro or is that what it is
alright thanks I don't I don't think
it's a selling point it's well it's a
selling point if you're a creative
artist yeah that's but it's yeah it's
definitely not marketed to mainstream
every gun they're gonna try to market it
to people you be like wait why did I buy
this again whatever i'm gonna keep it as
an apple product so to answer the
question officially the actual ipad
apple pencil will only work with the
ipad pro it will not be able to work as
a stylist on any other apple products
that has been confirmed by a I think
Mashable asked multiple outlets have
said it is not just one other thing as a
side note the actual iPad pro does not
have a 3d touch score
so it has a screen that can sense the
pencil but it doesn't have that physical
3d touch screen that you can push and
interact with like the iphone success
which I freaking love I'm like so high
on 3d touch really it's real subtle but
i think it's again as it evolves app
developers continue to use it and
implement it instagram is a great
example of how dope 3d touch can be for
looking at pictures and blah blah blah I
could I could go on for days but I think
3d touch is a big deal that's cool yeah
but not really got to play with it yet
well you can use my phone Oh long as you
don't send her no special pics k go
through your pictures no I don't want to
see any ink pisghetti you just see
picture of like my son's like running
around havoc oh that's so cute so yeah
only works for the ipad pro so that is
weird that they would make it so it only
works for the new iPad pro well you know
I looked at the contact point and
there's a lot of stylus styli hahaha
yeah how do you say stylist plural
styluses I don't even want to use google
right now I'm gonna let people make fun
of us dile I I'm gonna let people
correct us so somebody can send in a
call incorrect us anyways with these
multiple styli or styluses um they
typically have some sort of like rubber
point at the end of it the Apple pencil
does not and because you know it's
conductive when you touch the metal it
translates over to that rubber aspect
but the Apple pencil does not so it's
detected in a whole different way
someone will hack it someone will then
make a video using it on ipad on my ipad
3 or something that's true that's all
right next call okay here we go oh right
how you doing my name is a palin from
phone tech i work and i just want to say
a fan of the podcast i just want to let
you guys know that i did watch the Steve
Jobs movie I thought it was really good
and you guys have to watch it it's part
of the apple bike topic so uh he's like
assigning us to watch this movie it's
basically a backhand you know what slap
he's like hey guys it is one of the
thought it is one of the topics he's
talking about kind of a part of your
show so maybe you should go see it so
Steve and I talked about it we're gonna
really try
our next week during our lunch break to
watch the movie together we're gonna
walk down to the movie theater get some
popcorn yeah check it out spoilers Steve
job dies I said Steve job to on purpose
some people are probably like it's steve
jobs i like i said that on purpose ok
Steve job it's like a immigrant thing
you call them don't don't say the S
Steve job LeBron James okay all right
call number three hey guys I'm a huge
fan my name is Chris I'm from California
on County California anyways I had a
question about the ipad pro my question
is is it gonna be better than the
surface surface pro 4 um I'm really
tossed up between the two and i'm really
not sure which one to get i have an
iphone 6s now um so I don't know I like
Apple I like Android I like my ears off
but I can't decide talk to me doc temi I
love this kid cuz he likes him all he
likes he's a tech fan right let's just
you know I'd and guess what he's not
picking sides yeah although we do a show
called the apple byte extra crunchy both
of us own products that are not Apple
products yes I love tech in general so
that's why people I hate it when people
just complain that oh you should do the
apple byte because you said something
bad about Apple get out of here don't
let you literally go under your rock
don't even don't even don't even talk to
me no more so gentlemen was asking about
what's better an ipad pro or a surface
pro I'll tell you right now in my
opinion I think the surface pro is a
better product if you want a desktop
experience and a tablet experience at
once it's just a better product for that
that you can't even dispute that I think
it's amazing they have some really great
applications that you can use with it as
well the ipad the main advantage is
basically if you're in the apple
ecosystem and you want to use the apps
like you want to play the games on the
13 inch screen like some people here you
know we don't know what level the pencil
it's not a stylish pencil how it'll
really integrate in how detailed I don't
I don't see an upswell of this whole
community all of a sudden saying we're
gonna use the iPad pro and we're only
gonna do art on the iPad pro yet I mean
yeah I mean you gotta there's so many so
many different products out there to use
there's actual paper and bends up but I
think it will have interesting use cases
but if I was someone who was looking for
the true hybrid laptop tablet experience
I would say you got to go surface pro
yes it's a no-brainer and it's actually
really good yeah it is and I'm digging
Cortana to hell yeah she makes you a lot
of information Cortana is BAE katanas
bay yeah I got the windows 10 and it's
cool it looks neat it looks pretty and
it works great and haven't had any
problems knock on wood and Cortana I
asked her what I asked her something the
other day and she listed like 20 things
for me like she her answer was like
minute long almost I forget what my
question was sounds like someone that I
could build a real relationship yeah she
talked to you is very thorough yes yeah
I mean quite honestly you're the person
I talked to the longest in one single
sitting Steve we're building something
not even your BAE you don't talk to your
man i'm just messing around i love i
love BAE I love BAE she's gonna be like
oh really really oh you talk to really
Beach amor okay you go you go you go do
that with Beecham okay um yeah anyways
and on a side note and this is yes is
the apple byte extra crunchy not the
Microsoft bite because people get all
crazy about that too the service book
pro is tight it is I can't honestly I
don't it's not gonna be this first gen
but I could totally see myself buying
one of those in the next couple
generations I literally could as it
evolves yeah okay how many more costs we
have that's it that's all that's it yeah
oh cool off your raft It's A Wrap It's A
Wrap y'all ok guys and gals thanks again
if you guys want to call us the number 1
806 162 638 Steven I'm gonna let you say
bye to everyone will let you close the
show alright guys thank you very much

friday i'll be in los angeles maybe to
do a show gonna do a show we're gonna do
a skype show skype sky skype show so
thanks for watching guys and we will
you next time Bruce what's happening hey
why is that all there cuz I it's it's a
long story it's like oh it's built in
that that was the top of a show or
something like yeah I am the thing that
Mitch built made for me the Apple by an
intra wasn't working so I recut it oh
yeah and then what I recut didn't work
cuz some like encoding issue what if i
have the song so I I have it I have it
I'll fix it ok i thought i had fixed it
today and then when I tried it it didn't
work so anyways thank you everyone for
watching um on the periscope errs I'll
just hang around for like literally a
minute and we go he'll be like I'll hang
out for like a minute you guys have any
questions but thanks for watching again
for those of you on periscope we can't
feed the calls into you because we're
really recording this as a lie as a
podcast show that's really what this is
made for audio audio podcast that you
could download or you could just hang
out here and be with this we appreciate
that yeah people are still hanging out
so if you have any questions xbox one or
ps4 both both don't ever I would never
say one or the other they both kick but
for different reasons I think but here's
my call if you have the same game on
both consoles I'm gonna say go ps4 ooh
because typically supports a little
higher resolution in some cases in some
cases and star wars battlefront oh are
you to get that I'm gonna have to buy
the ps4 to get it I'm like saving up
some money man yeah I know my son and I
will just do that all day Halo or Call
of Duty that I'm not gonna answer that
comes out to you I would lean towards
that's a hard one they did say the call
of duty black ops 3 story is actually
legit this year and sometimes I don't
like because it feels like the same crap
so but then halo stories always like
really good I'm gonna let you decide I'm
not gonna make that decision for you
just get both
bhai mall cuz we all can just have two
consoles and I I don't have a wii u do
you have a wii u you have a guys yeah
you should see my my TV stand right now
it's a wii a wii u ps3 it's like
everything like each other it's like
home entertainment nirvana have some
which wich iPad pro you're getting the
thing about it is I think the ipad pro
with LT is something like 1,200 1,300
bucks this is way too much so if i had
to choose one right now my gut says i'll
just take the 128 Wi-Fi but i really i
really want LTE based one because if I'm
if I'm gonna use it truly to do some
work as a hybrid kind of want to have
that connection yeah so I don't mean I
can swing some like discount or
something but my hunch is that i'll
probably get the 120 Wi-Fi one which is
not what i want but it's too damn
expensive thanks apple how much is that
I a surface pro a surface pro it starts
off a little higher I think it let me
see the surface pro 4 let me see what it
starts off at I think it's higher than
799 though let me check here what do we
got Oh 69 no that's the surface pro 3
that's oh I thought okay hold up 899
starting price for the surface pro 4 but
there's like tons of different
configurations for it like with
processor ram swords there's like I
think there's like there's like let me
see I I literally there's like four or
five different configurations yeah
there's a one-two one-two-three there's
five there's technically six
configurations with different storage
different processor and different ram
but the entry level is a 128 gig uh
intel core m 3 processor but really for
me if you want performance you've got to
go at least to an i5 uh yes I mean but
120 128 gigs that's big yeah that's
that's good for gigs of RAM too so that
that's that's a good entry level oh yeah
okay uh Paris coppers thanks so much for
watching I got other stuff to do we got
some good stuff it's Friday we got to
get
here yeah fave fave fave feature for
Apple TV uh it's not there yet put the
app store hands down but the touchpad UI
is sick I put a review in the apple byte
show so you all want to watch that just
see that there but we are going to head
out thanks for watching everybody we'll
catch all later damn 2,700 viewers Wow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
