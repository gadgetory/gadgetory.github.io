mean for you you might just find out I
my exact heart in for Bridget Carey this
is your scene at update Verizon
announced its intention to buy AOL for
$50 per share in an all-cash deal that
totals up to 4.4 billion dollars if the
deal gets regulatory approval
AOL would become a wholly owned
subsidiary of Verizon with current AOL
chairman and CEO Tim Armstrong heading
up the a-all division now what does
Verizon want with AOL Verizon officially
says the move is a significant step in
building digital and video platforms to
drive future growth and the acquisition
further drives its LTE wireless video
and over-the-top video strategy after
that Verizon specifically mentioned that
AOL is a leader in the digital content
advertising platform space ok so what is
this deal all about and what does it
mean for you the deal seems to suggest
that Verizon is buying AOL for Verizon's
upcoming TV over the Internet service
that had bought from Intel back in
January 2014 a oels advertising
expertise could mean that Verizon would
make more money on advertising for that
service and not be as reliant on
subscription fees that could allow
Verizon to have a more profitable
over-the-top service and maybe even pass
along the savings to the consumer
emphasis on the maybe that's just redo
the tea leaves so far on top of that
there's also murmurs from recode that
say a oels content arm from properties
like Huffington Post and TechCrunch
could be spun out that would suggest you
won't be seeing a o L content with
Verizon branding everywhere ll see how
all of this turns out in other news it
appears that streaming music may not be
the death of record labels weren't a
music group announced that it made more
money streaming music than it did from
selling downloads in the last quarter
this shift is the first time any of the
major music labels has reported that
streaming revenue exceeded download
revenue the music industry has been at
odds with streaming services as to what
is a proper business model free but with
AD support or subscription only Warner
Music Group CEO Stephen Cooper warned
that taking away music from free
services could lead to an increase in
piracy stressing that piracy is zero
well any other thing music streaming or
downloads is better than zero now it's
time to visit Facebook land The Next Web
reports that Facebook is working on a
new way to make buying and selling items
easier between Facebook users Facebook
already allowed people to sell items and
groups but a new option being tested
would allow a person to see all for sale
posts or search all public groups for an
item the search would also include a
drop-down menu that would limit your
search to a particular category like
books cameras or event tickets The Next
Web says the search function doesn't
work that well yet but this new
e-commerce part of Facebook could go
live in the coming weeks that's your
tech news update and you can head on
