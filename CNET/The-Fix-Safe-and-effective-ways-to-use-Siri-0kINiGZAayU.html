send text messages especially if you're
walking down the street in a
high-traffic area you're trying to have
to bump into a bunch of people you got a
lot of stuff going on or you're carrying
a bunch of groceries you only have one
hand free or possibly you just get into
a back of a car I'm going to show you
some really useful tips
all right first thing you want to do is
turn Siri on you do that by holding down
the home button for about a second or go
to Settings General Siri and then turn
on raise to speak that means every time
I hold my phone to my ear Siri would
turn on once you hear that chimes Siri
is listening to you and it will take
your commands so to send a text you say
send a text or send a text followed by
the name of a person in your contact
list send a text to Jonathan
which Jonathan okay so in this case I
have a couple of Jonathan's in my
contact list Siri just wants me to be
more specific so I can make sure it
sends the text to the correct person
Jonathan Stein see after she asked a
question for confirmation you'll hear a
little chime that means she's ready to
listen to your commands make sure you
don't start talking till you hear that
time or else you may miss your message
so now you're ready to send your message
you want to make sure you don't pause
for too long while you're saying your
message or else Siri will interpret that
as the end of your message and you'll
get cut off send a message to Jonathan
Stein if you're going to the store I
need eggs milk popcorn so Siri
interpreted my pause as the end of my
message now there's two ways to handle
that one is to not pause so think about
what you're gonna say before you're
gonna say get your thoughts clear before
you actually send your message the other
way is to hold down the microphone
button for the duration of your message
this way Siri will keep listening as
long as you have that button held down
so let me show you what the difference
is like send the message to Jonathan
Stein okay so now I'm gonna hold down
the microphone button for the duration
of my message hey man if you go into the
store I need eggs milk sausage steak
avocados and some kale
ready to send it okay that looks right
so I'm gonna send it on now if you want
to use punctuation in your message you
will have to say the actual punctuation
you want to use let me show you hey man
period sorry I can't make it tonight
period thanks for the invite though
period later exclamation point okay that
looks good it looks correct now that
goes for all punctuation that's periods
commas question marks exclamation points
and even semicolons if you're the type
of person to use semicolons in a text
message
now one last tip if you want to send a
message one sentence at a time you can
totally do that you don't have to worry
about pausing or Siri cutting you off or
anything like that let me show you how
that's done
yo Send
I'm coming over now period don't eat all
the pizza exclamation point
send it's one of the biggest takeaways
with using Siri well the first thing is
to speak very slowly and clearly so that
Siri has a better chance of
understanding you next plan your text in
your head that way you don't get cut off
mid-sentence if you're not holding down
the microphone and finally it's best not
the text if you're driving however in
emergency situations Siri is a pretty
good hands-free option let's go back to
the office</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
