performance processors and discreet
graphics in a laptop would require a big
and heavy chassis and they typically
weren't attractive but now thankfully
we're here
I'm Josh Goldman was seen at and this is
the Acer Aspire V nitro Black Edition a
finish lightish 15.6 inch laptop with a
has well based Intel quad core Core i7
processor and nvidia geforce gtx 860m
graphics that's used to push pixels
around a UHD 3840 by 2160 resolution
matte LCD but before I dive into more
about the components let's take a design
tour since available configurations vary
by region the chassis is coated in a
nice grip herbal soft touch material
inside and out and all the ports are
lined up on one side save for an SD card
slot up front the keyboard is full size
with a number pad and backlit and red
which is really the only edgy part of
the design the click pad is good and big
but maybe not the most responsive and
since it doesn't have a touchscreen you
might find yourself packing a mouse if
you're doing a lot of work the screen is
a winner here though looking great at
its full 4k resolution or dialed down to
1080 and actually because of the
mid-range graphics demanding games are
only really playable at reduced
resolution though games where frame
rates are less a concern can be played
at 4k also with 16 gigs of memory a 256
gig SSD and one terabyte hard drive this
can handle multimedia work too however
you won't want to stray too far from an
outlet as we only got about two and a
half hours from the battery you could
read the full review on Sina comm but
outside of the battery life and if the
subdued looks appeal to you this is an
excellent laptop
I'm Josh Coleman and that's a look at
the Acer Aspire V nitro Black Edition
