longer and longer lenses and now we've
reached a point where something like
this is like having a telescope attached
to a point-and-shoot
it's the Nikon Coolpix P 600 I'm Josh
Goldman with CNET its lens starts at
twenty four millimeters and zooms into
fourteen hundred and forty millimeters
giving it one of the longest lenses on a
compact camera and it's less than four
hundred and fifty dollars it has other
good features - including a small but
serviceable electronic viewfinder a
high-res three-inch vari-angle LCD a 16
megapixel BSI CMOS sensor fully
automatic manual and semi manual
shooting modes and video capture at 1080
at 60 eye or 30 P it also has built-in
Wi-Fi that lets you use an iOS or
Android device to view your shots and
transfer them to the device or control
the camera remotely and you can add geo
tags to your photos some potential
downsides to the camera are that it
doesn't have a hot shoe for adding a
flash it captures JPEGs only so no raw
support and while you can certainly use
the full zoom range handheld unless you
have a lot of light and steady hands
you'll probably want it on a tripod to
get sharp shots overall shooting
performance is okay but zoomed in it can
be slow to focus especially with low
contrast subjects and the lens does not
zoom all that quickly there are special
scene modes for birding and moon photos
but really you're better off just
learning how to use the camera photo
quality is very good for its class if a
little soft so you'll probably want to
do a little post shoot sharpening you
could read the full review at cnet.com
but for zoom fanatics I doubt it'll
disappoint for the money
I'm Josh : and that's a look at the
nikon cool
