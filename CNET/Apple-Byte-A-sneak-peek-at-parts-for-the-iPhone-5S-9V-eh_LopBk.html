the premiere episode of the samsung bite
you guys asked for it and you got it so
believe it it's a show all about Samsung
onto the stories and Samsung admits they
are also getting into the lucrative
SmartWatch market this year come on guys
did you really believe that wait wait
don't tell me you got april fooled
buster alright let's get to the real
show hey you guys let's just roll the
intro what's good brian Tong here it's
the Apple buy for everything good and
bad inside the world of Apple let's get
to the stories and the big news this
week is that the iPhone 5 is officially
coming to t-mobile on April to 12 now
some of you might be saying big whoopee
but there are a few differences with the
actual phone and t-mobile's new no
contract plans now this will be the
first phone support t-mobile's HD voice
the quick impressions from our cnet crew
say the audio is noticeably fuller and
more natural sounding with cleaner audio
but you have to have to tmobile iPhones
running on t-mobile to take advantage of
the feature now LTE network performance
speed was also very good the phone
itself is a tweaked version of the a
1428 iphone 5 model produced for other
GSM networks like AT&amp;amp;T and it supports
advanced wireless services bands for
t-mobile's network currently existing
iphones cannot be updated to add AWS
support now the other part of this
announcement is t-mobile's contract free
iphone plan that will no doubt save you
money over a two-year period and beyond
if you keep your phone that long so
accessory makers AG did a break down to
show the savings getting the carrier's
as close as possible to similar plans
and fees so check this out for an
individual you'll get a nice chunk of
savings of five hundred and eighty
dollars over two years with t-mobile but
if you're on a plan with multiple people
for friends and family the savings isn't
really there so it might only make sense
to jump over to t-mobile if you have
solid coverage where you
of but it's a different way to try to
bring back customers to the carrier in
pink by slashing costs you done 0 / /
yeah see that's how you fit the new
Wolverine movie trailer into the apple
byte now in iphone 5 news nowhere else
dot f are reports that it has spotted
new parts for the next iPhone including
the home button for the iphone 5s that
has a longer and thinner flex cable
compared to the iphone 5 with a
different location for connection now
the rumored fingerprint sensing doesn't
look like it's incorporated into this
part if it is true and the other part is
claimed to be the vibrator for the next
iPhone attached to a flex cable that
also appears to support the volume
button and mute switch along the side
it's also more compact than the 5s
that's right it's gotten to the point
where we're talking about i phone
vibrators now multiple analysts are
still chiming in that the next major
product announcement will be in late
June for the new iphone there's also a
new claim from RBC Capital Markets that
the new low-cost iPhone will not include
a Retina display at all which
contradicts what we've been hearing up
to this point conclusion no one still
really knows also digit times has a new
claim from there unidentified supply
chain sources that Apple is working on a
4k Ultra HD television set that would
have a resolution of 3840 x 2160 they
also claim like we've heard before that
it will support voice and motion control
with a targeted launch late this year
but even more likely could be early next
year now 4k TVs are starting around
twenty thousand dollars right now so
this would be a great purchase for the
average income earning household and if
you the Apple biters are feeling like
the news has been kind of slow of late
you're not the only one but we'll keep
powering through this until things heat
up in this summer just like that all
right to the quick bite The Wall Street
Journal reports Apple is acquired indoor
location company Wi-Fi slam paying
around 20 million dollars for the firm
that's pocket change for them the
two-year-old startup has developed ways
for mobile apps to detect a user's
location in a building using Wi-Fi
signals and has
benefits for indoor mapping or new types
of retail and social networking apps so
this may be one of the ways Apple hopes
to beef up its location services and
maps the big a is also in court in
Shanghai China over lawsuit that alleges
they copied components of series speech
recognition shanghai-based GGN Network
technology claims that Apple infringe on
its patented siri-like software from
2004 called Zhao I Robot we'll see how
things get settled but let's take a look
and I see that spinning glow around the
mic logo and those weather results look
nothing like Siri yikes alright guys
that's going to do it for this week's
show keep sending me your tweets and
emails to the apple bite at cnet com
make sure to prank your friends on April
first i'm brian Tong thanks for watching
we'll catch you guys next time for
another bite of the Apple
