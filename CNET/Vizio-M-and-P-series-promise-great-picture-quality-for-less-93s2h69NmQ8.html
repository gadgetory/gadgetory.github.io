&amp;amp; P series haven't changed much from
last year and that's a good thing I'll
start with the M series which includes
sizes from 50 through 75 inches it's one
of the least expensive TVs you can get
with full array local dimming technology
that helped last year's version cheap
image quality to beat every other TV at
its price new for 2017 the M series also
has better color with high dynamic range
sources and it continued to support both
HDR 10 and Dolby vision another change
from 2016 is the lack of a tablet remote
instead you get a standard multi button
clicker complete with the ability to
change picture settings and other
parameters on-screen instead of having
these videos app the app remains an
option if you want however and Vizio has
improved its usability and functionality
the M series still lets you cast apps
directly from your phone but coming
later this year is a full-fledged on
screen Smart TV system - it works just
like other systems but I really like
having the option use a standard clicker
or a universal remote instead of a phone
one downside the system still doesn't
support Amazon video the P series is a
bit more expensive and available in 55
through 75 inches its improvements over
the M series are focused on picture
quality with more local dimming zones
and a brighter image physio says the
2017 P series television is actually
exactly the same as the 2016 version but
both will continue to receive software
upgrades to improve the picture quality
I plan to review the 2017 M and P series
TVs as soon as possible I'm David Katz
