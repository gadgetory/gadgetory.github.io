look at one of my favorite all-in-one
desktops this is the Dell XPS 27 it is a
new version of a system that we
previously called the XPS one 27 and of
course it's got a 27-inch screen and
it's a touchscreen in fact it's such a
big touchscreen I don't even need to
scroll over it too far to get all my
Windows 8 apps up on it they're all just
right here on the screen and like a
handful of other all-in-one desktops and
even a couple of laptops that we've seen
recently it's got a higher than 1080p
screen resolution in this case it's 2560
by 1440 that's the same as you're going
to get on the big 27-inch Apple iMac now
this particular review configuration is
two thousand and ninety nine dollars a
little bit expensive but you do get a
lot for it you get this big super high
risk screen you get a new intel core i7
processor and that's the latest fourth
generation Core AI series also known as
has well of course you don't get the
battery benefits of as well because
obviously this is a machine that plugs
into the wall doesn't have a battery in
it and you can't really take advantage
of the integrated better graphics and
has low systems because this is one of
those very rare on ones that has a
decent discrete graphics card in it in
this case it's the NVIDIA GeForce 750 m
and I absolutely love that that graphics
card is in here because it lets you play
pretty much any modern game on pretty
decent settings this is really one of
the only things that you'd call a gaming
all-in-one and when you have the super
high risk screen and it's so big and so
bright and so clear it's really a lot of
fun to let's say load up steam and play
some games on here it's one of the more
fun non-gaming
desktop gaming systems that i've tried
out recently the XPS 27 comes with a
perfectly fine but plant skiing kind of
throw away wireless keyboard and mouse
the adjustable stand doesn't go all the
way flat this is where it tops out and
it's kind of stiff hard to move with one
hand but you can certainly adjust it a
bit I love all the ports and connections
on here you've got plenty of USB 3 ports
you have not only an HDMI output but
also a separate HDMI input so you can
plug let's say a blu-ray player or
cable box or an Xbox or something up to
it and just use the monitor and speakers
which makes it pretty handy for having
in a dorm room or a den or in your
bedroom instead of having a whole
separate TV for that stuff obviously
it's not the least expensive own one on
the block you can actually tray down to
about $17.99 to a core i5 CPU and still
keep the Nvidia graphics which i think
is really great and that's why this is
one of my favorite all-in-one desktops
of the year I'm Dan Ackerman and that is
the Dell XPS 27</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
