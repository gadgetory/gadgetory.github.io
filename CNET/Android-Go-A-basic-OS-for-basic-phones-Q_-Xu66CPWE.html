we're using to describe three things
first an optimized version of the latest
Android release to run smoothly on
entry-level devices starting with
Android o second it's a set of rebuild
google apps that use less memory less
storage and less mobile data and third
it's a version of the Play Store that
contains the whole app catalog but also
highlights the apps from our developer
partners that are designed for the next
billion users so the YouTube team has
actually built a new app called YouTube
go for their users with limited data
connectivity which is a big challenge
for for some first-time smartphone users
in the world today for example there's a
new preview experience where you can
actually take a quick look inside a
video before you decide to use your
mobile data to start streaming it which
is super helpful next there's also a
setting where you can pick right before
you start streaming the video what the
quality of the video is that you'd like
to have streamed to your device and you
can see with that setting exactly how
much mobile data that's going to cost
you which is super important the other
thing about YouTube go that's really
great is you can save videos when you're
online so you can view them later when
you're offline may not have access to
data and the final thing I really love
about YouTube Go is if your friend wants
some of those videos that you've saved
you can actually use a built-in
peer-to-peer sharing feature in the app
to connect your two devices together
directly and actually share the files
well without using any of your mobile
data at all
on Android Oh devices with one gigabyte
of memory or less these will ship with
the go configuration and going forward
every Android release will have a go
configuration we'll be unveiling a lot
more later this year with the first
devices shipping in 2018</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
