dozen different ways that you can share
from a nap into Facebook and that's
because you know they're all these
different interfaces on iOS and Android
and Windows Phone and mobile web and
desktop now what all these different
versions mean is that whatever the best
version is is not what everyone is using
today and we've heard this feedback very
clearly from everyone in our community
in our developers do they want us to fix
this because people want to be able to
share in two messages all right people
want to be able to share in two groups
people never want to be surprised by
what their contents is going to look
like when they share it so today we're
going to fix this we're introducing an
elegant and consistent way to share from
all of the different apps that you're
building across the whole family of
different facebook services so the new
share sheet creates a consistent
experience for everyone using apps to
share with anyone they want including in
messenger in groups so if you want to
share that run that you made with just a
few people instead of all of your
friends on Facebook or Instagram now you
can do that in exactly the same way that
you would have previously shared into a
feed so this is just the first step
towards creating better sharing
experiences across this whole family of
apps</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
