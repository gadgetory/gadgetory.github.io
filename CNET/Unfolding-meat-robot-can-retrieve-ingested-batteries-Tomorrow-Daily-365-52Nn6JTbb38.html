to tomorrow daily the best talk show
universe I'm Ashley sceva i'm jeff
cannata we're about to catch you up on
the day's stories with headlines here
you want of our viewers in London if so
you can sign up to test drive this
self-driving shuttle the Gateway project
is now accepting registrations for the
very first public autonomous vehicle
trial the vehicle isn't a car but a cute
little shuttle that looks almost like a
very short monorail train with
windshields on both ends they are fully
electric and totally automated with the
ability to find its way around using
lasers and sensors mounted to the
carriage professor and technical lead of
the Gateway project nick reed said quote
testing these vehicles in a living
environment takes the concept from
fiction to reality unquote are you ready
to sign up to test the first automated
thing uh you know it does not go as fast
as the Hyperloop so I feel like the
chance of liquification of my body is a
lot lower so yes willing to do the
Hyperloop I guess you're willing to do
this this thing where to crash it feels
like it would just be like a yeah well
there's no other cars driving at the
Hyperloop it's sure that is true is a
fair point that's a fair point this
could be a slightly more dangerous but I
think this is adorable and if you live
in Greenwich you should sign up for that
if you're in the London neighborhood uh
if you've ever known someone or yourself
to have swallowed a button battery at
some point in your life it could be
dangerous but maybe not anymore with the
help of this tiny little origami robot
an international team of researchers is
showing off a tiny origami robot made
out of sausage casing designed to be
ingested in the event of accidental
battery consumption after you swallow
this little guy via an ice capsule it
would head to your stomach via an
external magnetic field helping guide it
and a combo of flexing along surfaces
and swimming in your gut would get it to
your stomach when it arrives at the
battery a tiny little magnet on board
picks it up and you are good to go the
experiment was conducted on a synthetic
stomach but potential future uses are
for an object retrieval like we
mentioned medicine delivery and even
tissue patching they're saying they
could take this little also unfolding
robot and patch some tissue they say
3500 people in the US alone every year
swallow batteries don't do that that's a
lot bro kids I mean it's like it's well
you're gonna have that problem you're
having a baby that baby's probably gonna
swallow battery well that's all I'm
gonna feed it so I suppose ya wanted to
have well better baby yeah robot baby
all I do is feed it batteries um yeah
but so that thought that was pretty
fascinating fascinating and also really
creepy how it unfolds itself does that
the story you want to talk about on
thursday i mean i kind of want to talk
about gateway but yeah I think I feel
like we should talk about medical
advancements in these like sort of
unfolding robots and things like that so
yeah i'm down for robots sounds good
stomach robots origami meet bot origami
meet but if you guys want to talk about
origami meet bot with us you can do so
on twitter just use our hashtag hey
Timmy yeah and if you use that hashtag
and tell us what you think about an
origami meet robot retrieving a battery
in your stomach we might use it on the
show I'm just saying it could be great
yeah uh but now that we're done with
headlines let's check out our front tire
for the day
today's photography of the day is
Abraham who took this delightful photo
on his iPhone 6 Abraham wrote and said
my name is Abraham and I took this
picture on my holiday to Bali last month
I used an iphone 6 I brought my
stormtrooper with me all the time and
took some pictures this one I took on
the beach of tunnel lot that's so rad I
love I love this it looks like he
actually got a full-size stormtrooper
outfit but no it's merely photography
trickery I know it's a trick of the eye
it's an optical illusion I do love these
I where you take toys and you make it
look like they're full size it's really
really fun and this is a great picture
obviously you're on vacation during
springtime so it fit our theme arm a
theme of spring does that always they
say the birds are singing the flowers
