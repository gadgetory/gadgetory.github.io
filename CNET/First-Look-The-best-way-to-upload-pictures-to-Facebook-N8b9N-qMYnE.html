many people guess the social network
wanted soon that retro photo
functionality for Facebook users
well now Facebook camera is here and
it's got plenty of features to be
excited about
I'm Jason Parker for CNET and this is a
first look at Facebook camera Instagram
rocketed in popularity because of its
filters that made everyday photos fancy
and a social platform that made sharing
easy the new Facebook camera app for
iPhone offers many of the features
people loved about Instagram and adds
new ones that Facebook users will
certainly appreciate right as soon as
you launch the app you can see the
camera icon in the upper left for taking
a picture which I'll get to in a moment
but you can also see thumbnails of your
latest shots below that is your Facebook
feed with great big images posted by
your friends and options too like the
photo or comment on the post in the
lower left the new layout is excellent
for viewing photos and I think it'll be
easy for Facebook fans to embrace this
app but back at the top you have the
option to snap a fresh picture or you
can swipe downwards to access photos in
your photo library one thing you'll
notice here is that you have the option
with the Facebook camera app to batch
upload photos by touching all the images
you want to use
notice how the pulse button in the
lower-right shows how many you have
selected from there you can touch the
post button to bring up options for the
location of the shot tag as many friends
as you like then touch post in the upper
right to send them to your Facebook feed
you also can hit the gear icon to choose
who can see the photos as many of you
Facebook fans probably already know all
of these features were sorely lacking on
the regular Facebook app snapping
pictures is just as intuitive simply tap
the camera icon in the upper left to
open the camera after you snap a picture
you can use the tools at the bottom for
cropping and adding effects the crop
tool brings up a grid and you can touch
and drag each corner to frame your
subject you also can use the rotate
button at the bottom to make sure your
photos post with the right orientation
when you're finished hit the check box
now you're ready to add effects the
Facebook camera app offers 14 effects to
choose from and you can swipe through
and touch any of them to preview what it
will look like I'll choose boost for my
photo with the effects selected you can
the post button to add the location tag
your friends and add a headline like I
did earlier the Facebook camera app is
available now for free at the itunes app
store and I think any Facebook user
should download this app immediately
thanks for watching everyone this has
been a first look for the Facebook
camera see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
