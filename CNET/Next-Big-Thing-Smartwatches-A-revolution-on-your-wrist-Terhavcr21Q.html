telling folks about Google glass and
smartwatches because they give you that
look like what is wrong with you then I
wait for the Dick Tracy jokes to subside
and then tell them how smartwatches
could have a real shot at ubiquity if
they succeed in making our increasingly
chaotic mobile devices simpler and more
personal just a moment I just got a
message so you can put it up to your ear
like this and take calls privately swipe
down to activate the built-in camera
which lets you snap still images and
10-second videos all the uses could be
taking a picture with your phone
remotely or checking your group while
you're on a run or controlling the
volume of your music agenda swipe
picture from one feature to another
going back is as simple as swiping down
from the top bezel camelus research
predicts some 5 million smartwatches
could sell in 2014
nobody really knows but even that gold
could be awfully lofty if smartwatches
as a group don't nail three things first
look good this is fashion not just tech
but how many tech companies do you know
are actually good at fashion Apple is
Sony was Google Microsoft not really and
startups like pebble they do have a
certain new cachet but not an
established style language second makes
sense not just making it clear how to
use a SmartWatch but why I would use one
though makers who get that done first I
think will win first getting across the
message that a SmartWatch can thin out
and surface the important stuff on our
increasingly busy and vertical phones
and tablets in other words play the hits
of digital living on my wrist and third
measure me the market for Fitness
wearables is for real
think of Fitbit flex Nike FuelBand
a jawbone up those overall will sell
some 80 million units in 2014 over 200
million by 2018 and yet I don't think
most people are gonna want to wear both
if they don't have to so here's a place
where smartwatches could eat a lot of
lunches if they can roll up that body
metrics piece that fitness piece as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
