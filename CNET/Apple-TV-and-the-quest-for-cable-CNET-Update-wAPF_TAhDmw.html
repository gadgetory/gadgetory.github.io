I'm Bridget Carey and this is your cnet
update there's lots of buzz about a
report from The Wall Street Journal
saying that Apple is working on making
its own cable box replacement you could
think of it as a blend between live TV
recorded shows and streaming choices on
Apple TV the report says Apple has not
made any deals with cable providers but
has talked with Time Warner also we saw
Apple was granted a patent for a cable
box earlier this week but Apple is not
the only one with a one box goal
Microsoft has been working on making the
xbox 360 into your main entertainment
device and it already has made
partnerships with some cable providers
what we all would love though is just
one box that does it all smoothly with
one easy search menu for all the live
and on-demand that cable provides and
the streaming choices from subscription
services yes one box to rule them all
hmm that'll be the day Sony's new
touchscreen ereader is out now for a
hundred thirty dollars it doesn't have
any big new tech perks like a glow light
but they did add some social features
also made it easier to download books
and improve the battery life so good for
Sony for hanging in there probably will
be more popular overseas though than in
the US but glad to see they're still
around also for some reason only the
black version gets a free copy of the
first Harry Potter book the Google+ app
on android and iOS has been updated it
lets you join live broadcasted hangouts
on air from your mobile device it's also
letting teenagers use hangouts via
phones and tablets because before that
the video chat service was adults only
and they're having reports of Google
gift cards being spotted in the wild the
blog androidcentral posted photos of
gift cards for the google play store
which sells movies music books and apps
and today's appt to watch can come in
handy on a vacation it's the free Google
Translate app and the Android version
just got an update that lets you take a
picture of text to get a translation the
technology it's called optical character
recognition or OCR for short you point
your camera at the text take a picture
then use your finger to
highlight the text you want to translate
pedo noah's perfecto i found it to be a
bit tricky to get it to work just write
the words cannot be at an angle and it
needs to be in focus it took me several
tries to get a sentence translated right
even though I got a clear shot and it
just kept giving me a bizarre
translation each time now keep in mind
it will not work well with stylized
fonts it translates 11 different
languages but it can't help you with
East Asian characters google says though
it will be adding more languages for the
photo feature in time now that's your
tech news update for today from our
studios in New York I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
