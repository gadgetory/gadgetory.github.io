welcome to the Apple bite for everything
good and bad inside the world of Apple
it's the aftermath of the September
keynote and the devil is always in the
details now let's get it out of the way
this was arguably Apple's best keynote
in the Tim Cook era even with the rumor
blogs getting about 80% of their info
correct there were still surprises now I
wanted to see the new Apple TV and I've
been dying for an iPad pro but it was
the iPhone 6s that surprised me the most
this is not a typical Apple s phone that
we're used to and then seeing 3d touch
in action it's not going to make this
phone more complicated it's gonna make
this phone more awesome now let's just
say someone in our office who I won't
name because I don't want to call him
out pretty much um wet himself Apple
even killed me with their iPhone 6s
marketing saying the only thing that's
changed is everything you know you said
something just like this to that girl
that broke up with you in high school
that you were trying to get back with
hey baby
I'm telling you right now this is real
and it's from my heart okay I'm
listening right now the only thing
that's changed is everything
will you take me back
I guess sure
I'm good with that works like a charm
see I told you it worked an apple it
worked on me the 3d touch the processing
power the camera with 4k video and like
last year the 6s plus we'll get optical
image stabilization for both Stills and
video but this 6s won't which is a
bummer but for all of you with a 5 or a
5s this is a no-brainer now the new
iPhone 6s starts at $1.99 for 16 gigs
what Apple you're really putting a 4k
camera in this and starting it at only
16 gigs now marques Brownlee found in
the settings that one minute of 4k video
at 30 frames per second on the 6s will
take up about 375 megabytes of storage
that's 40 minutes of video without the
operating system apps or a single
picture and I'm still trying to figure
out how in the world the new Apple TV
starts at 32 gigs but the iPhone 6s with
4k video starts at 16 gigs oh you know
what that is a bad apple and then Apple
bumped up the price for Apple care for
the 6s models to 129 bucks
compared to 99 dollars for the iPhone 6
and earlier and if there's actually
little damage to the 6s phones the
additional fee is now 99 bucks instead
of 79 hey Apple I'm impressed with this
phone and I have nipples but I'm not a
cow so stop milking us and you get
another bad apple all right now let's
talk about iPad pro I might be the only
person you know who's been wanting this
since 2012 and I loved what I saw this
is Apple's surface pro without a desktop
OS and if you're in the ecosystem and
you want a bigger screen this is it
like I said I might be the only one it's
twelve point nine inches of glory but
you know what that means
if you thought people taking pictures
with iPads was bad oh it's going to get
a whole lot worse I mean how are you
going to be able to see Justin Bieber
anymore where were you
you need to really where are you now
I'm loving the speaker's four of them
finally real surround sound five
generations later but did you think we
weren't going to talk about the pencil
that pencil looks awesome I mean look at
how it glides across the iPad glass like
butter and it can even uncomfortably
manipulate a woman's smile really it's a
good thing it's not a stylist because SJ
would never have anything to do with
that No
who wants a stylus you have to get them
and put them away and you'll lose him
yeah
you tell them Steve tell them good hey
yeah Brian okay what's up Charlie
hey I heard apples producing a pencil no
they are it's crazy like a you use it on
the iPad you do this cool art stuff
touch-up things that's really neat yeah
I don't know but does it have an eraser
oh no no it doesn't hmmm should have
lead you know the kind you sharpen no
well it has this like um kind of tip
that when you touch the screen it senses
it but uh yeah it doesn't mmm
can you bite it maybe I don't know I
don't know how much is this pencil cost
99 bucks bucks nuts yeah it's apples
pencil
sounds like a stylus to me no Charlie
Apple calls it a pencil still sounds
like a stylus to me Brian
well the iPad pro starts at $7.99 for a
32 gig model the pencil is $99 and
they're smart keyboard is 169 add it all
together for the entry-level model and
you're starting at close to 1,100 bucks
this won't be a top seller it's for a
very specific use case but I'm one of
them and I can't wait for it to get here
oh yeah there's a new iPad Mini 4
thinner lighter taller with an a
processor
sorry net 399 and finally the Apple TV I
always felt the Apple TV would lose some
of its impact if it didn't launch the
streaming TV service at the same time in
you know it kind of felt that way it's
all new interface is
with TV OS same with a new remote they
showcase Siri a lot and the most
interesting thing to me is how
absolutely developed for Apple TV
interacting with the MLB app was a cool
real sneak peek at how we might engage
with future sports content and more down
the road there really wasn't a I gotta
have this moment but the Apple TV might
have the biggest impact out of all these
products in two or three years just not
right now I still think it's a huge miss
that the new Apple TV will not support
4k I know it's running an a8 processor
but Apple you just gave us a phone that
shoots 4k video but we don't have a way
to instantly watch that content on a
bigger screen I mean maybe it's just me
but I'm throwing out another bad apple
the Apple TV removes the optical audio
out port which is something I use so I'm
not happy about that
it supports third-party m-phy
controllers for gaming and even though
it's at the center of home kit and the
new iPhone and iPads support Bluetooth
4.2 the Apple TV does not now the new TV
OS will also only run on the new Apple
TV with the a8 moving forward so current
Apple TVs are left behind this new guy
starts at 149 for the 32 gig model and I
still don't want to think about the fact
that the iPhone 6s still only has 16
gigs you know what forget about it I'm
throwing out another bad apple and even
with all those bad apples this was one
of the best Apple keynotes I can
remember because I wanted to buy stuff
all right that's gonna do it for this
week's show email me at the Apple bita
cnet.com or tweet me at Brian Tom and
I'll answer when I'm awake thanks so
much for watching and we'll catch you
all next time for another bite of the
Apple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
