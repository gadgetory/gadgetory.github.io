francisco california it's the apple byte
extra crunchy podcast with your host mr.
brian Tong hey what up B Chum what up
Apple biters what's up Apple biter extra
crunchy extra munchy what's up Apple by
nation welcome to the show it is episode
58 you all are still hanging with us
like still hanging out with that aight
what we show nothing but love and the
only way that we can show love back to
you is to continue to do the show bring
the noise but the noise is always going
to be brought from you all so we want
you to when you have a chance write this
number down or not right i guess you
like I've been in added on sure no no
yeah voice dictated call us at one eight
hundred 61 62 63 eight that is our
voicemail you can leave your name where
you're from your comments your questions
your bad apples we just like to hear
from you try to keep it around 20 to 30
seconds sometimes we let a few one
minotaurs get through some compelling if
they're compelling enough like you gotta
really raise your game I almost want to
do tutorial like good calls and bad
calls you know even if you just have to
write on your paper like three bullet
points you want to hit just make sure
you hit them I'll start collecting some
bad calls we need it we need to do like
the bad apple call of the day just and
if it goes on it goes on we're just
gonna we're gonna clean ever run out of
content if we know we won't but I will
say you guys call and you do a great job
of it and it's actually from the
beginning it's gotten a lot better oh
yeah for sure so let's jump into the
show because that's why you're all here
this week I was gone for the early part
of the week I was in New York and I
gotta check out the Nike mags bro you
know the nike eggs are bro did you see
that when I want a pair to go snowboard
bag like system I'm sure two shoes are
you kidding me I gotta try those on okay
they're only making 89 it's the only way
to get them is to enter a raffle through
nykeya it's like ten dollars per entry
and then you just test your luck but it
was amazing it was like it was amazing
to try their shoes on because that's
think about it when you were a young kid
you see things in movies and imagine now
teen 89 the movie came out it's 2016
almost 30 years later crazy this shoe
has come out now yeah it looks so cool
man it really does like led so playful
yellow super soft it was self lacing
okay I should I don't know why I got on
that tangent but it was important to let
people know but we're gonna talk about
all things apple and when I jumped to
earlier this week because I wasn't here
I wasn't actually doing the live show
for I hope I can say the sacred word on
this show the google keynote ooh
dangerous I mean let's be honest I love
tech yeah you say Android burn burn we
might have to leave the studio but look
I think it's always good to have
perspective of where different
competitors stand in the race and where
does Apple stand in this race and Google
drop their pixel phone that is their new
flagship phone it is really a phone that
in if you look at it from a taking step
back it's google's way of doing hardware
and software their way much like Apple
has done hardware and software their way
we know that HTC built this phone but it
is really Google's first one that they
claim to be made by google now the
number one thing you can talk about
specs all you want I really don't care
as much from a standpoint of reports are
out Apple's iPhone destroyed it in a
geekbench benchmark tests but hooyah we
also kind of know that benchmarks don't
really matter because it comes down to
optimizing the software in the hardware
also most every phone is so fast these
days like it's hard for me to argue to
say oh the top four phones in the
industry right now are one of them is
really slow they're all more than
capable well there was just that test
recently where he was doing the
individual yes I on the Samsung and what
the iphone was like seven seconds faster
overall or something I mean it's seven
seconds is that's quite a that's that's
an entire life that's that's an entire
loading life I mean we just talked 47
seconds just imagine what you could do
with those seven seconds that's a lot
it's so much but the big thing about
this phone is really to me the
artificial intelligence the Google
assistant and when I see this thing in
action I'm I'm blown away from a
standpoint
this is the best AI we have seen in a
consumer electronics device to date the
way that it's conversational and it's on
the market we know there's concepts and
other things but it's but then I look at
apple and I'm like dude like Apple you
do make a great phone you have your
ecosystem but does Apple really have an
artificial intelligence problem do they
have an AI problem yes like what do you
think using Siri and what you've seen so
far where you out with this my go-to is
google I I do talk to Google a lot more
I mean I ask Siri to like set alarms and
and so basic stuff for the phone but if
I if I want like real information like
I'll ask Google you know like who won x
NBA championship in 2018 heard 2018 you
know 2015 or whatever will tell me right
away and that's that's what's crazy to
me Google's the power you know there's
always excellence in hardware excellence
in software google has had a search
engine it is the roots of their company
their Google now was better than a you
know and their google voice recognition
was always and always has still been
better than apples and apple has been
trailing again for the record Apple Siri
is so much better though that I actually
use Siri for voice to text and I would
say it's a lot it's significantly more
accurate these days I still will get a
few boo-boos once in a while just
because you know maybe it doesn't
understand when I use those dulcet tones
you know like what's up David Oh sexy
boys sexy voice you interpret my sexy
excessively no but it's funny because i
use google now to ask it actual
questions that i want to know but i
never use it to like set alarms or
remote right anything like that i
totally don't do that like I use Siri
for like you said set an alarm or
reminder yeah i will use google for like
actual information yes so then let's
take all these things together and now
amp them up where you can start talking
to your phone in a conversation that
understands context so if i say hey
Beecham let's go to the AMC metreon and
then order to say Oh am I free and my
schedule Google's suppose can see that
then you can say hey right after you
don't have to redo anything just follow
up like what movies are playing and it
knows you're talking about that movie
theater in your earlier comment like I
natural language conversation right that
is on and then I'd like to get dinner
reservations at an italian place nearby
so then it takes knows because you're
talking about a theater uh-huh it knows
the address of that and then recommends
things like that's crazy sounds crazy
and it's multi later stuff and look
Apple is behind in that space and we
always talk about different features to
me artificial intelligence isn't a
feature it is a platform now yes is it's
it's a platform that you're gonna either
be a head even like it's like it yeah
it's like iOS you know like it's going
to be its own thing other than it's
going to be its own thing and in
addition to that Apple has introduced a
lot more deep learning computer learning
from Cirie and that's why it's been able
to get a lot better and more accurate
but they still trail that's the reality
I am NOT bashing on Apple I just want to
give you all a sense that sometimes when
people listen to us I like to give
people perspective of what is happening
around them instead of just being closed
mine on Apple because it's easy to if
you're in the Apple yeah yeah it's um
easy to forget many people just like I
don't really care about I'm telling you
you need to care about what's going on
it's amazing so you know I hope that
they can get better at this but right
now Google's assistant is just blowing
my mind and this is just the start like
I know this is the iceberg right this is
the moment where artificial intelligence
and consumer electronics are really
going to start to take take off we all
know about voice assistance but when I
talk about artificial intelligence this
is what we're talking about so you know
it's an exciting time protect it's a
little disappointing and then just to
even talk about what the competition is
doing samsung just acquired viv now if i
don't know if we talked about viv but
viv is also a very smart multi-tiered
multi-layered AI the funny thing about
viv is that the roots of the company
okay the founders of viv were the
founders of Siri and you're like how is
that possible the two guys that created
Siri were they were acquired by Apple in
2010 okay three years later they left
Apple Apple decided to do
they want to do with Siri these guys
like we want to do more with Siri so
they created viv if you go online and
look up there's like a techcrunch demo
of viv and watch how he orders pizza
it's not just ordering pizza it's like
adding in ingredients taking away
ingredients asking for different cheeses
like you're like what and it's happening
in a single flow conversation on this
video your phone yeah I mean you won't
be able to you know you're just showing
people what it looks like that can see
this but it like blew my mind so so that
that since your samsung has acquired
this company the company that Apple
originally acquired Apple decided to do
something different for and they're like
we're gonna make Siri even better with
this thing called viv yeah that's crazy
so what happened like these guys did
they hit a wall with Apple or something
like who knows what happened but why
would they I think the reality is that
in the past they had said they didn't
necessarily bump heads with Apple but
the creators of cerium the two names
adam share and chris brigham they said
that Apple wanted to go with a different
direction and use Siri differently and
if you look at how Syria was used it was
used as a voice assistant based on
specific tasks it wasn't used as an AI
Yeah right right i mean that's like
launched things in your phone it was
very rudimentary like open this out or
you know just very simple remember i
remember the early days would be like
play metallica play the beatles yeah i
was like excited just to be I was cool
and that was cool but they they had a
bigger vision of it so now you have
samsung that is acquired viv and again
look up the demos if you can online and
we have Google who has google home we
have Amazon who has the echo and we have
apple that has series so these are like
the for AI platforms a home assistant is
going to be a big deal arguably a I and
the home assistant is to me the most
exciting platform in the next 2-3 years
yeah we're gonna see a lot of really
cool crazy stuff so it's something to
keep an eye on but i just wanted to
bring up the topic because really the
question is does apple have an AI
problem more than anything where do they
stand in this whole race and they're
definitely not first and i don't think
their second either yeah so um and god
bless 3d touch I thought it was going
to be legit and I don't even really use
it anymore I don't I never use it in
fact it like gets in my way sometimes
I'm trying to move apps around or if I'm
trying to copy pay something get to my
way yeah I I really was I had high hopes
for 3d touch because I think it actually
can still be useful but because there's
when it launched it was like sometimes
it worked on things sometimes it didn't
it wasn't ubiquitous it work differently
in different apps it just doesn't it
didn't translate and I really don't hear
people talking about 3d touch at all
yeah I would love it if like a developer
called in and told us you know any
issues that they run into with you know
programming for 3d touch or something
like maybe we can try to get someone on
the show people that are watching her
like yeah 3d touch basically died look I
mean what you think it even will be on
the next phone iphone 8 or the iphone
future or the iphone acts I mean it's
whichever we need to have a poll we need
it emit poll and just like see what
people think I want I've now I mean I
loved iphone future because that's like
our baby but i also think iphone x is
just bad i'm into your time iphone xt
right okay um just a quick thing as we
transition over some few bullet points
about the iPads we know that there's
rumors about them we're expecting to see
them sometime in 2017 realistically the
first half of 2017 a MACO takara report
and they typically play and swim in the
rumor mills of rumors and news with
apple and you've probably heard of their
name before a new report from them does
confirm that we expect to see three
different ipad models in 2017 the big
different tiers we will expect to see a
12 point nine inch model r it with a
true tone display hope something that I
desperately wanted and still don't have
okay the other iPad though appears that
it'll be moving from the 9.7 inch which
we have currently as the ipad pro kind
of the smaller version it'll bump up to
a 10.1 inch model and then if this
report is to be believed the ipad mini
will be refreshed into the ipad mini pro
still at seven point
inches but we'll have everything a true
tone display the four corner speakers
better processor yada yada yada um so
the ipad mini may still have life
according to this report will have to
wait and see cool and interesting and
another thing related to that is that an
alleged benchmark of the a 10x processor
if you're familiar with how Apple does
their processors for their phones
typically right single numbers a 7 88 89
when they customize it or boost it for
the ipad line specifically you'll get an
X in it sometimes they'll use a lower
end processor in kind of something like
the ipad mini but according to
benchmarks that have leaked out the
antenna the a 10x is real and it
destroyed absolutely destroyed the
iphone 7s a 10 processor I wonder why
that is like how much different is it is
it larger I don't understand why it
would be so much faster than they just
added more it just wears the be
optimized it yeah where's the beef I
just to give you these are numbers that
I don't want you to remember and we
really shouldn't care but the iphone 7
and 7 plus 4 single core performance
coming around 30 550 600 for multi-core
test this is like a benchmark score the
eight 10-x device came in at 4236 for a
single core and a 6005 6500 score for
the multi-core test so it's not like
it's it's it's about twenty percent
faster basically but still that's that's
still pretty good jus seein if you like
I some people say I don't care about
iPads I don't even use iPads anymore I
can't honestly I might be with a few
people I care about iPads like
religiously because I travel with it and
it is my favorite it is my ultimate
travel buddy a bad Prague iPad pro you
got to watch that if you know it okay um
we're not gonna take a break this week
we actually are completely unsponsored
meaning we can say whatever that we want
show is sponsored by cnet com booya
don't worry we're in we're in sponsored
transition don't worry we got we got
some coming but we do want to thank I'm
not trying to plumb

to say it with you do you remember is
like it anyway we gonna look at me choke
a look at each other's I ready I devices
involving your home beautiful thanks
guys alright news stories Apple music
sorry you know what I I'm sorry I
actually accidentally changed my my
document oh yes I'm all over the place I
am sorry but what I actually wanted to
talk about is for those of you that
don't know this week was the fifth
anniversary of the passing of Steve Jobs
obviously you can't say Apple without
thinking about Steve Jobs he passed away
at the age of 56 really the great
arguably the greatest mind innovator and
thinker when it comes to consumer
electronics so I just wanted to kind of
open it up because you know everyone has
memories or thoughts or stories about
Steve Jobs and how they impacted him so
I kind of wanted to hear from you
Beachum you know what when you think of
Steve Jobs what do you think about what
stands out oh definitely the iphone i
mean like changed my life completely you
know it like i have i still have like my
own small business and like I that's
that's my computer my work phone my work
computer my security camera my
everything remember the first time I
held one I was working for a game spot
and one of my co-workers had it and he
handed it to me and I was just I was
like you know it's incredible it blew it
literally blew my only bloom imma at the
time if you if you have to rewind back
and everyone that's watching if you guys
can chime in um will will shout out a
few of the things that you guys say of
what comes to mind when how it changed
the game I remember my phones before
that were a motorola razr and then the
t-mobile sidekick okay it had a keyboard
i had a flip screen I love the sidekick
to this day I wish they may have so many
feel like that okay yeah it was so cool
but then the iphone i was like what the
hell is like
I never knew you know it's one of things
like you didn't even realize a device
could do this we saw like blackberries
and other phones like the palm and stuff
like that but nothing ever like that not
never enough never like the iphone you
know he he i can't remember the words
exactly but he's like it's a phone it's
a music player and it's an internet
browser here and every designer
netconnect he's like a phone yeah music
player streaming internet browser and
everyone's like that was amazing cuz
everyone was first like oh yeah and then
they're like oh shit like everyone's
like dude they started like one thing I
guess so um it was someone says internet
communicator I don't exactly remember
the words cuz look don't don't hold it
against me because you don't know either
okay but I do i do in remembering Steve
Jobs i do want to tell a few quick
anecdotal stories that i had because
people that don't know a long time ago I
used to work at the Apple Palo Alto
retail store this was the second retail
store in the chain and it was also steve
jobs to store so he would come by on the
weekends he would sometimes just make a
surprise appearance he would come
typically on a bike with a basket with
his son and they'd hang on the store but
i do have a few cool stories from it 11
is probably like one of the funnest
memories that i actually had is that he
came in at the time vp of hardware john
rubens that Ruby they called him ruby
jon rubinstein they were they had
executives from canon and they wanted to
show people they wanted someone in the
store to show them I life and it's funny
you talking about I live cuz I feel like
every week we get people calling like
his up with ilife right I'm you know I
life is what really set up the mac is
like the home you know from music to
photos to movies to DVDs like I still
love I DVD even though it's gone now
okay so basically I they pulled me aside
you know my manager and said we want you
to do a demo for Steve and Ruby in these
execs at Cannon so they put me in this
corner with freaking six people Steve
Jobs being one of them and I spent I kid
you not about an hour and a half to two
hours starting from like this is the
ipod and this is how it seamlessly works
with your music this is your photos and
how it work
I photo this is your movie let me edit a
mini-movie cool and then poured its I
DVD the whole time okay like Steve Jobs
just kind of watching and like nodding
his head he didn't say anything he
interjected a couple times but he didn't
interrupt me cuz he knows all that stuff
like almost I was like right I was like
dude don't f this up Tom and I'm like a
young buck so you're like holy crap
Steve job at the end of this whole damn
thing all he did was say thanks just Pat
me on my sore just walk away and I was
like good that I was like you hear all
the stories out he would like quote
unquote fire people and later no you you
got away clean yeah I was like dope okay
so point you know five points btz okay
another fun story this does not have to
do with me at all but you had a lot of
times where he's purchasing things at
the counter and it's his store right
it's an apple store yeah and so like a
lot of times some of our retail
associates that had never dealt with him
would be like um they get nervous and
then they'd be like so uh do I just give
this to you or do I give an employee
discount that's what I you know he's
like so how do i how do I ring this out
you know you buy software and like all
the time and you just beat he'd be cool
about it just like I don't know like you
could tell people are super nervous
around it he just really no no discharge
it is uh you know his whole personality
was like intense I could you imagine
seeing the person that basically is
responsible for a lot of enjoyment that
you have in life and a mention a large
Arab paradigm shift to world yeah like
oh we're a great mind of the world
that's kind of crazy right he's like
they're it's like yeah you know
basketball fans Michael Jordan you know
Tech fans Steve Jobs he goes like leo
yeah like somebody's dying like straight
up right so okay wait I found the thing
with which lists doing the thing here
here okay look it see Oh where's the
sound internet communications device
okay here we go so what here goes way I
Letta Letta listen
so three things a wide screen ipod with
touch controls a revolutionary mobile
phone and a breakthrough internet
communications device wife students to
an ipod a phone and an Internet
communicator an ipod a phone are you
getting it
these are not that's the magic that's
research of devices this is one device
and we are calling it iPhone today all
right okay so I remember I remember
being there in that moment it was like
you were there yeah because I worked I
worked before store before I worked for
this company called speck products this
is a case company and that we were
obviously at that keynote as well that's
awesome so it was fun you were one of
the one of the Apple people in the crowd
like clapping like I would never do such
a thing ee always make Joe got yeah I
know every t know all the Apple
employees like really clapping for
always liked from this day it was legit
yeah I do have one more quick story this
is a fun one uh Steve Jobs is at the
register buying something and a customer
was right next to him it was a lady and
the customer said oh my goodness you
look so familiar and we're like there's
three of us working at the table were
like oh man this is not gonna this is
not gonna go well it's like you just
feel that oh this is so like awkward
yeah and she said where have I seen you
before and he looked at her and he's
like she's like oh I forgot yeah I said
where have I seen you before do you work
for Apple and everyone's like oh my gosh
and Steve Jobs Turner he's like yeah the
mac division and she goes okay and then
he smiles nods and walks out the store
and then I said her do you realize who
that is and she's like no who was that
and what we said that's Steve Jobs and
she said oh my gosh I can't believe it I
used to work at Apple Wow she clearly
didn't pay attention to her job no
wonder she used to work at Apple yeah it
was a funny it was a funny mode but you
know sometimes people get all like
flustered about that right I get started
drag man I feel like big famous star I
like can't talk there's not too many
people I get starstruck by I get star
showed by creators of things that I
loved growing up yeah yeah don't like I
could tell you who I was starstruck with
but then he's kind of my friend now so
it's like I'm not anymore but he like Ed
Boon the creative Mortal Kombat oh yeah
I got time three can
like super cool and he watches our stuff
does he really yeah that's also when I
first met him at at e3 he called me by
name and I'm like huh and I thought a PR
person till he's like did you like
couple pass out no I was just like dude
literally my childhood hero like come on
man if anyone knows me they know like
how hardcore iam about Mortal Kombat
it's it's kind of crazy okay back to the
show right but those are just three
stories that we just wanted to talk
about in you know remembering Steve and
just like kind of those crazy things
that happen like man dude the iphone
like for reals still still rocking one
right now seriously seriously my like
fifth one or 6 16 bits II think I'm a
little more than that um I just wanted a
even though we're transitioning to over
just like to talking about the iphone
I'm gonna skip that skip this next door
and just jump ahead to addressing some
of the iphone 7 issues that are
happening and are going on there have
been reports that some iphone 7s and
even 6 s's have this are basically
activation locked and what that means is
when they turn on their phone to
activate it because you have to kind of
authenticate it with a server it's
actually showing another user's email
nowhere and so it's like unintentionally
linked to another customer that's you
obviously don't know their password and
so you can't get in the phone which
means you can't set it up you can't sink
it and several people more than like
several are saying that yeah they've had
to go to apple and request for an
expedited replacement but that really
sucks like you have your own and you
can't even activate it because it's
under someone else's name you email that
person be like give me your activation
number please yeah give me give me your
Apple ID password cuz gonna set this up
in that name that's not important at all
now um these aren't widespread issues
but in all to be fair we do want to
bring up the fact that there was a
report of an iphone 7 that recently
exploded a single one up to this point
um what has been reported is that it
exceed it exploded in transit so he
doesn't know how or why attacks exploded
but when he opened up his apple iphone
in packaging the phone was burnt up you
can see pictures of it online the
packaging was burn out but it actually
it didn't go any further than that it
kind of X ended up extinguishing itself
whether there wasn't enough air to
continue to feed that or not it just
ended up burning out like like most of
these phones do but that did happen he
what he didn't have it on him or plugged
in but it's still kind of a semi mystery
there you go that's the picture look at
the magic that Steven Beach of those
like during the show I just that is an
iphone that looks like it was burned and
there's a skeleton I don't know where
these are all other random photos the
other thing is that an iphone 6s this is
now roughly either the second or third
story we've heard about a gentleman who
had an iphone 6s in his back pocket and
it exploded it gave him 2nd degree burns
this is a difference is that the
southern iphone 6s you know we aren't
seen anything as widespread as what's
happening with the galaxy no 7 and i
just think the whole note 7 situation is
a shame because there's a report about
an actual replacement note 7 potentially
and actually setting on fire in an
airplane a southwest flight they don't
know exactly every all the details
behind it they're investigating it to
see truly if it was a replacement phone
or what's behind that because they could
arguably face a second recall if it's
that serious we aren't very very serious
cuz that's it Seth the way it's a plane
you have the Federal Aviation you know
like that's huge I don't we don't I
don't know I didn't unfortunately didn't
read the details I don't even know if
the phone was technically off or it was
left on so I I for some reason I felt
like I had read it might have been off
but correct me if I'm wrong you know I
don't know but these these are you know
where these devices are getting more
powerful they're staying the same size
they're getting actually thinner there's
less room for you know heat dissipation
and we all want bigger batteries bigger
batteries and that's what the danger it
that's what we're getting therein lies
the danger yeah like my iphone 3gs
exploded but i had literally exploded
yeah it wasn't like there was no fire
there was no flames but i'd already
owned it for like two or three years and
then it was having problems and it like
broke down when my kid was getting born
which was like a huge bummer i was like
where it is gonna get us all the
pictures but it had it turned off for
like a day and then I plugged it in to
charge it and it just like expanded like
the do it start like war penis you sell
like the phone
expanded in a bad way I just that's a
great load and inside but there's no
flame and plugged it right away clearly
yeah yeah yeah well yeah it happened to
me but I had already on the phone for
like two or three years but thanks to
the magic of periscope people have told
me that the gentleman on the southwest
flight was actually turning his phone
off when it happened ah so um you know
Apple has been replacing their phones so
far they aren't doing ain't every call
we're not hearing as a major widespread
thing but uh but that's happening but
here look just uh while we're staying in
the iphone news i don't like to get
ahead of ourselves too much but you
can't help but talk about like future
iphone stuff like you just can't help it
yeah and we know with the iphone X or
the iphone future we already got a call
like last week some guys like he tell me
anything know about the iphone 8 is true
like I can't think that I can't take
that call I clean take that call no but
a new patent that has been granted to
apple and was found by patently Apple
has revealed that we know we will know
one of the rumors that this few this new
phone coming out is potentially going to
have no physical home screen an edge to
edge glass and the ability to detect
your fingerprint um on the phone a new
pan kind of backs this up that we might
see this where it's a pound specifically
for technology that can recognize your
fingerprint to unlock the phone not from
a single location on the phone but
anywhere on the screen that's crazy
because then it can also like collect
other people's fingerprint or who maybe
steal your phone sure and then like
that's actually cool idea i didn'ti
about that other believes are like oh
you got your phone stolen okay do you
have tracked the phone track my iphone
on okay we got his fingerprint oh yeah
he's got a record day I are you been
watching CSI lately or something this is
like CSI cyber an EVO robbery a good
little Snowden we text from Russia and

font I can't remember it's that their
service there Sam school fun is a little
different than that but yeah that looks
like myriad pro pretty way back in the
day so it's pretty good see that's how
you know that's how you know you're like
loser status when you know the fonts of
the Apple fonts like there's like you
can be a geek and then you can be a
super geek and you can meet rookie when
you know the fonts I know right of the
company you need to get out more yeah

to you start to like really see fonts oh
hell yeah and how fonts like affect your
mood and Stella totally i'm all about
that i'm totally all about that that's
funny we have a specific font for machal
sierra
it's very specific so should we get to
our voice calls because we know this is
all about you all Apple biters that call
us in so yes let's talk to you and hear
you what you guys have to say got a lot
of good calls this week and here we go I
Brian I Steven this is Jack Daphne from
rain to Illinois love the show my
question was do you believe that Apple
may one day maybe not in the near future
but in the distant future create a
streaming movie service similar to how
they created Apple music maybe like a
Apple movies to compete with Netflix and
other movie streaming services thanks
bye jack I love this question it's so
relevant and topical right now because I
didn't include it in the show because
you know nothing's really happening
right now but there have been rumors
that Netflix could be could be acquired
in the near future by a variety of
companies that look like good prospects
one of those companies being the big a
you know aka apple now we don't know
when it's going to happen the other
companies in contention right now our
disney amazon and apple but here's why
it makes sense from a from from an
acquisition standpoint you are so smart
because you pointed out how they did
Apple music remember apple acquired
beats music Apple couldn't get a music
subscription service set up yes apple
acquired beats and their assets and then
turn that into Apple music so Apple has
had trouble even setting up their own
video streaming TV service right we had
all those stories of the Apple execs
just walking into meetings with movie
studio and just trying to strong-arm
yeah strong arm and they're like nope
hey hey ain't happening and so apples
has still yet to launch an actual their
own TV streaming service it doesn't look
like it's happening but could they
launch any type of video streaming
service if that was the case Netflix
would be it now this is why it also
works on the other end Netflix I how
about this Netflix has is pretty much
for the most part has started to plateau
from a standpoint of
user base they are still growing in
subscribers but not exponentially
anymore they've expanded internationally
and the way that netflix has to make
more money or more revenue is really
from the content right we have all these
awesome shows that they put out yes but
guess what shows cost a lot of money to
support so if your user base is still on
like a 9 95 plan we've seen when there's
been resistance to be like hey we're
gonna bump up your subscription service
to like 12 bucks or 14 bucks people ask
out people ask why where am I seeing
this people are resistant to that where
else can I go yeah exactly right because
service exactly so you know have a large
company like Apple who is sitting on
billions of dollars much like Disney
much like Amazon to be able to absorb
those costs and almost in a way use
netflix as an arm for content for them
it's almost like I'm it sounds silly but
like a marketing expense Netflix is
content but what does it help do sell
more devices yes and so from that
standpoint I think it does make sense I
think Disney buying it could also make
sense Disney has worked out exclusive
deals for content coming to netflix
first in the future so they have a
previous relationship I don't think
Amazon makes as much sense just because
Amazon because I'm sorry I like why yeah
why would they do that this this
actually kind of bothers me because now
i feel like if one of them buys netflix
then there's going to be less
competition between all these networks
and all these streaming services and
then you know just I feel like we need
more there is less there might be I
think that if they kind of leave it on
like it would be weird to just get rid
of the netflix name and also call like
Apple yeah having apple video like hell
no right like that seems like something
they would do to or stay with you man
crap so um we'll see how it plays out
nothing nothing may happen at all quite
honestly but Netflix is at a point where
well I'm surprised cuz Netflix seems
like i love nefeli profitable you know
yeah you need to get on that I mean like
I've told you over and over I've like
shared my friends oh they finally share
to share with
with you can you watch daredevil so we
can talk about this very devil dudes
right I'll try to watch daredevil Luke
Cage I want to watch luke a okay how
about this can't how long will it take
you to watch luke cage a month I know
you got you got I know you time and
stuff like you know about this one i'm
free after ten I 10pm it let's do this
watch the first episode before next week
that'll that one or that I got you one
hour in a week and then let's ride let's
talk because I might just bend watch the
whole thing that's then then then then
Ben watch that cuz I haven't I haven't
started yet ending a lot of positive
reviews I wanted netflix bond with you I
like Netflix bonding it's like it's an
I'm glad I'm amazon prime bond too we
can do that okay that's good alright
that was a long answer but thank you for
that it it's really cool okay we have
more calls let's do some more hey guys
this is Blair in West Hollywood they
knew to the Apple wat and knowing that I
can delete apps default apps from my
phone what happens for my if i delete
mashup how do I default different Maps
app to the phone and to the watch thanks
so when you're talking about deleting
apps what happens how do you default
other apps for example with the maps app
and the Apple watch what happens there
so I've actually never even though I
don't use it I've never deleted the
apple maps app I did I did and then it
never did and then there was some
something I think I was like on safari
or something and it's like get
directions to this place right yeah so I
click the get directions thinking it was
going to take me to google maps but
instead it takes me to the App Store to
redownload Apple maps and that makes
sense yeah and that makes sense because
it's integrated I will tell you that
google maps does have an app for your
Apple watch I do know that when you set
your home point and your work points
like kind of your key points it saves
them as like a quick touch to go to from
your Apple watch but I believe because I
haven't really tried it you know and I
could be wrong so people can call it and
correct me but it's not like all of a
sudden google maps is going to be
integrated into your Apple watch much
like your phone like if you click on a
map like it's not gonna be like
we're gonna use google maps yeah like I
which would never Apple would never let
that happen I were so you know like I
use an app like Yelp and always defaults
to Apple maps when I when I when I I
always have the comedy I have to copy
and paste from UM from it to go to
Google Maps instead so the worst um yeah
you can use them but I don't think it's
gonna I pretty sure it won't default
okay next call hi my name is bradley
augustine and just touching on the
iphone 6 touch disease problem a few
months ago before this whole lawsuit
thing came out my 6 plus had the whole
touch disease thing and everyone said I
was crazy it was just my phone so I go
to the apple store they had no idea what
I was talking about and long story short
they made me purchase a 6s plus and this
was before all the lawsuits for
everything and it's just now that
everyone's doing them stuff it's just
not right that this happened to me and
I'm really pissed about it so what are
your thoughts pistah for you man I'm
hurt for you I thought the reason why we
wanted to play your call is just to
really emphasize how much crap and how
much bad apple pneus this whole iphone 6
touch diseases and someone might be
going like why did you buy a new phone
and I'm this is what I'm guessing
happened your phone was out of warranty
they said okay well this I don't know
what you're talking about your crazy but
because it's out of warranty you can
either buy a screen replacement and we
can see if it works for 329 or you can
just buy a new phone what are most
people going to do buy a new phone
because why are you gonna put 329 and
let me tell you this whole thick
replacing the screen on iphone success
hasn't fixed the touch disease issue all
the time because that chip in there gets
loose and then it stops working i know
people that it's happened to twice
that's a bummer and Apple isn't doing
anything about it like that is just a
bunch of crap I could like feel his
dilemma like sitting in the store like
I'm gonna go home without a phone right
now yeah that's it's almost like leaving
your house without any clothes on at
this point you know so I feel your pain
man well it might kind of uh I'd like to
see you I mad like I know it is my time
I'd like to see that I mean if it really
is an uncomfortable feeling yet it's a
little nerve-wracking but no one can
still see my junk cool with that unless
you wear your phone on your over your
junk okay sure next call true hey big
dog this is scott sacramento love the
show got a question for you about the
ipad pro at the large model my wife's
recently bought the 9.7 inch ipad pro
and i gotta say it's the most beautiful
screen i've seen on an Apple product I
feel sorry for anybody Brian who may
have gotten the large I've had girl
without this screen anyways my question
is I'm really thinking about getting the
large one myself but I want to know how
long I'm gonna have to wait till Apple
upgrades to the new screen thanks again
another show foxy later but this guy
straight up con man this guy's this guy
should have called me out on his
voicemail he's like Brian sucks about
you sucks gonna rub it and how really
sucks to me use my wife is way better
than you you suck man uh I still that
still burns today I don't know if I
should be nice and tell you when the
next iPads might be coming out maybe I
should hold that information back and
you can wait no it it my hunch and what
people are looking at is could be the
March April timeline of next year that
apple will update the new iPads so uh
we'll just wait until then and for those
of you who don't care about iPads I'm
sorry I'm gonna keep talking about I
love that thing okay next last call for
alcohol hi my name is matthew kowalski
and i am from michigan and my question
for brian is on october twenty fourth
which is the rumored date for the event
that will be announcing new macbooks and
stuff do you think they'll release a new
version of high life and a new version
of the desktop i work and buy ilife i
mean like garageband and I movie and
stuff thank you and have a nice day I
hope so I hope that we see a refresh of
ilife if there was any keynote to do
that it would be on the new mac release
because we're talking about not only
macbook pros we're talking about imax
we're talking about potentially although
we haven't heard a peep a new mac pro
a new mac mini maybe I mean that's
really that's really stretching it but
uh Apple needs to show us some cool
stuff software wise and hardware wise
they have in the past I just think that
they have they're so spread thin now the
mac although is it is an important part
of their product line it's just not a
priority and so when you're referring to
the whole Apple Keynote the latest that
we know about the mac keynote is that
Apple originally was set to have their
earnings report on october the 27th but
what they did is they changed the date
just this past week and shifted their
earnings report over to the 25th why
would they do that the thinking is that
when they announced their earnings on
the twenty-fifth will probably hear
about Oh iphone sales lower than
expected you know a few Downers but it
what's the best way to counter an
earnings report that is kind of man
announcing new products two days later
oh yeah perfect so I think that right
now circle october twenty seventh as the
date for new max we've heard rumors of
late october anyways i think it all
lines up apple doesn't typically change
the dates of their earnings report and
would only do it to make room for
something else so i think that keep your
eye on that date it were just what a few
weeks away from there yes so we said
that we should expect to see that
october is moving quickly October
October and that's it man that's a
little world where were that's last call
that's last last call alright everybody

listening really mostly all y'all that
are listening and just continue to have
