whatever you want to call it call it
mainstream something like two-thirds of
all cars in the EU have it had it for a
long time
every BMW I've driven in the last three
years has had it Ford says we're gonna
have it on two thirds of their f150
seventy percent of their entire fleet by
the 2017 model year I can go on and on
it is here to stay but what is it and
how does it work the technology has been
around since Twila first offered it on a
crown sedan in the mid 70s VW put it
into mass production in the early 80s on
a version of the Polo now auto
start-stop has come later to the u.s.
for a variety of reasons primarily the
fact that we have much less sensitivity
to fuel economy because you
traditionally had much lower fuel prices
relative to average household income
that's well known we also have less
sensitivity to emissions at least
historically in this country which is
also related to running an engine less
than you have to but in general the
world is becoming an auto start-stop
automotive commuters now the name should
tell you everything but let's be very
clear here's what it does I come to a
stop in traffic and the electronics that
run the engine stop the engine they do
that adjust the engine by the way by
turning off the spark to the ignition
and turning off the fuel flow to the
cylinder then when I lift off the brake
those are instantly restored and the
engine is restarted by its starter motor
to
so they instantly come back to life now
ideally that transition from off to on
off to on takes place in just an instant
almost imperceptibly but allowing a car
to do that requires much more than you
can do just twisting a key first this is
engine shutdown not car shutdown the
electronic stay on and they don't hiccup
or flicker when the engine restarts next
the car should have electric assists and
pumps not belt driven ones so you don't
lose things like power steering or
automatic transmission readiness when
the engines down you need a tougher
starter motor because it's going to be
doing its job a lot more often a deep
cycle battery which is one designed to
be deeply discharged and then recharged
readily sometimes the car will even have
a second battery for auto start-stop an
air conditioning system that can
override auto stop sometimes to maintain
cabin temperature and harder smoother
internal engine friction surfaces for
durability starting as hard on engine
bearing now if you're driving a hybrid
car there's a little bit of a difference
there and that you already have a large
battery the big motive battery that can
handle the start/stop electricity and
you've got an integrated motor in the
powertrain that can also function as a
starter not using a traditional starter
like a standard gas engine car with you
and by the way auto start stops
available on manuals as well as
automatics though most cars are
automatic so it's really what we care
about
you can save anywhere from three to ten
percent of the fuel you would otherwise
use without start/stop by having the
technology those numbers are huge in the
auto maker world but they will spend
millions to gain one percent for a fuel
economy the downside is you can't take
those numbers to the bank
it varies wildly depending on the kind
of routes you drive you live in Montana
where everything is a 2-hour interstate
drive from everything else you may see
very little if any benefit from auto
start-stop if you live in Los Angeles
you may very quickly get auto start-stop
to pay for your xanax prescription that
you take because of your community it
varies very much by how and where you
drive okay after driving almost every
car out there with auto start-stop let
me give you my shoppers tips for what to
look for in a car that happened fast
restart with the goal being the time it
takes to move your foot from the brake
to the gas very few cars get it done
that quickly most do not few rotations
slightly different this is the number of
engine rotations taken within that
restart window to get the engine running
again I find this varies as well low
body vibration related to the number of
rotations as well as the engine mount
technology I don't want my German luxury
car to feel like I'm starting a 72
Bronco every time I lift off the brake
and it should be defeatable of course
most cars have a button for this if you
do not
now that said shopping for auto
start-stop isn't necessarily all in your
hands know that whether you like it or
not it's here to stay because car maker
is like more than that they need it
because it's incorporated in the results
they get in the epa mileage test cycle
and can do wonders for their fleet fuel
economy so they're not gonna get rid of
it just because a few owners say I don't
like it or I keep defeating okay so the
bottom-line penciling out the value of
auto start-stop to you in your
pocketbook
let's ballpark that it cost two hundred
and fifty to three hundred dollars worth
of the MSRP of a car you buy that has it
now earn that back is the complicated
man it depends on fuel prices in your
area how many trips you take each week
and what kind of trips are they and
whether you have a propensity to get the
auto start-stop some of the time none of
the time or worst of all all the time in
which case it's never gonna pay for
itself more car tech demystified right
