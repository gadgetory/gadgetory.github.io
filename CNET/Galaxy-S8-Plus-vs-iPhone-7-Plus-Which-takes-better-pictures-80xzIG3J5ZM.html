camera as the previous s7 which means
it's relying on better image processing
to outshoot the iPhone 7 plus with that
dual lens setup the s8 has a slightly
wider angle and the clouds seem more
dramatic the grass on the iPhones has
more texture and I would say it's a
tough call unless optimal lighting the
s8 shot looks a lot warmer and more
vivid but less like the actual scene the
s8 has an 8 X digital zoom while the
iPhone has a combination of optical and
digital thanks to that dual lens setup
which allows it to get 10 times closer
neither looks crisp at 8x but the one
shot on the s8 looks noisier more
pixelated and slightly blown out and for
a scene like this one you can actually
get closer on the iPhone and still see
some detail actual close-ups are a
different story the iPhone lets you
focus manually on an area the s8 has a
pro mode that lets you pinpoint exactly
what you want to focus on i want to
complain i kept accidentally switching
to the front camera while controlling
the focus these butterfly shots of the
California Academy of Sciences show the
difference the greater contrast on the
iPhone gives the shot more depth while
the green on the s8 is more vivid but
the iPhone had a hard time focusing once
I got up really close when you zoom in
on the shots you'll notice the crazy
amount of detail the s8 managed to
capture on the wings and torso of the
butterfly next we went to the Marine
Mammal Center to see the rescue center
in action both phones have impressive
burst modes but the s8 takes more shots
per burst so you get more frames to
choose from the shots are similar but
the s8 captured more detail on the
flying fish and the pieces of ice
the iPhone 7 plus has a portrait mode
which uses both lenses to create a
blurred background effect the s8 has a
selective focus mode which in theory
does the same thing but relies solely on
software since it only has one lens both
ended up getting it right eventually but
getting it with the s8 was a challenge
the effect won't work unless you get up
close to your subject and have time to
focus which was nearly impossible with
live animals I got some great portraits
with the iPhone but missed out with the
s8 because my models kept moving and
even when the s8 does get the effect
right it's not great smooth sealskin is
one thing but try unruly hair and the
shot is a mess part of the rock is just
as in focus as my hair and half the
scarf is blurred out the front camera on
the s8 also has the selective focus
option for selfies and other gimmicks
you may never use it packs in more
pixels in a wider angle lens with a
super wide option that gives you even
more room I like the warmer skin tones
on the iPhone but the s8 is the selfie
master
to test these cameras in low-light we
took them down to the Twilight Zone
exhibit at the Academy the differences
in these shafts are almost imperceptible
both up close and far away but what it
took to get this shot is what made the
s8 a clear winner the iPhone had a hard
time focusing in the dark and it took a
few tries to get it right the s8 was
quick on the draw Wow look at that and
if the results are the same I'd rather
take the s8 so the si+ managed to beat
the iPhone 7 plus in our shootout but
not by much considering it's last year's
model and now the balls in Apple's court</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
