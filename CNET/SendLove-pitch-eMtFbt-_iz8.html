send love to we are a people polling
platform the idea is to allow readers
who read blogs to rate public figures
and we provide the scoring of those
public figures in real time think of it
as a Yelp for people all right let's
check out them so here we are on a
political blog this is a pretty big
political blog called the moderate voice
they have some article called did
President Obama get independent voters
wrong I go ahead and say that's a yes so
as you see these names are underlined in
here you can click on President Obama
and say yes fail on indys okay and I can
post my opinion about Barack Obama and
what happens is once this amazing 3g
network works ok so the opinion posts
below we're sort of a writer along
comments so you've got your normal
commenting engine discuss facebook
whoever you use and then these tabs get
built for every single person you
mentioned in your article in this case
Barack Obama has a 50-percent score
across this network you can see the
moderate voice he's running a little bit
lower so this is maybe a more
independent than our national average
you can see Barack Obama's love scores a
little bit higher down here sort of like
comments you've got these discussions
going on but this is where it gets
really interesting this first article i
did this first comment i just wrote yes
fail on indy's from did President Obama
get independent voters but this very
next comment is from a guy named Brian
who believes that Obama is a left-wing
liberal progressive socialist commie
fascist bastard and hates Constitution
okay raising the level of debate here he
has a really raising level but the point
is is this is from another article on
the same network quote of the day our
pathetic debt ceiling what you've got
which is so interesting is in all of the
five thousand articles on the site about
Barack Obama you've got this living
conversation that brings together old
content and new content we call this
content rediscovering the idea is to
drive more advertising dollars into our
publishers hands so who's as far as this
for people who want to play in social
networks and show their friends what
they like or is it for Obama's political
team so he
use this instead of traditional polling
this is for the general public who is
who has lots of opinions and they're
sick of shouting into the black holes of
commenting space and they actually want
to be heard and this is a way for them
to get their voice out there okay thanks
a lot cool</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
