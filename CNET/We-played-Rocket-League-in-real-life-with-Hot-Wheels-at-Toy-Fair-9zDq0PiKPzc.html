Patel is bringing a popular video game
to life this is Hot Wheels rocket League
before we get into the toy you need to
know rocket League it is a wacky and
addictive video game where you play
soccer with rocket-powered cars that's
right
car soccer and Mattel turned that into a
real-life Hot Wheel set players use a
smartphone app to drive the
remote-control cars to knock the ball
into their opponents goal it comes with
a card charging station at max speed the
cars lasts about 15 minutes before you
need another charge so these are popular
characters in the rocket League game and
they made physical versions of them that
you can now race around in this arena
and could be more characters coming in
time this is to be priced at around 180
dollars it's scheduled to be out by
December Mattel gave us an early look at
the 2018 New York Toy Fair you don't
need to know anything about the
videogame to have a blast with this set
but if you are a fan there will be Hot
Wheels bonus content you can download to
the videogame Mattel is also adding
videogame magic to toy racing tracks by
using augmented reality in the odd moto
playset two real Hot Wheels cars zip
around a track but players face off
holding tablets or phones to battle with
cartoony augmented reality effects on
the screen the cars are synced to the
app so it tells you in real time when
the car needs a recharge at the pit if
you have enough juice tell the car to
take the loop if you make it you get a
special rocket that you can shoot at
your opponent to keep him smoking in the
pit and if you're stuck you gotta tap
the smoke to prepare the car augmented
reality is something that a lot of time
acres are interested in dabbling with AR
keeps it zany it's all very fast and
manic and it's hard to even notice when
a car crashes but they want to add a
feature in the final edition that will
pause the game when a car flies off the
augment rack is scheduled to come out in
time for the holidays for about 120
dollars</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
