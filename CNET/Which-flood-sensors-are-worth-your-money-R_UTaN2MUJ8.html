a lot of potential hazards for
homeowners and renters alike we're
talking broken pipes floods and
potentially thousands of dollars worth
of damage but some companies think that
there's one simple device that can save
you that money a flood sensor so let's
break up our options into their price
categories first you have the $80 luxury
Honeywell lyric leak and freeze detector
it's going to cost you 80 bucks because
it has temperature sensors humidity
sensors it works with Wi-Fi so you don't
need a smart home hub to use it and it's
got a nice loud audible alarm it also
has a cable that you can attach to it to
extend it's sensing range the problem is
even with all those features
80 bucks is really expensive for this
kind of gadget plus it's not waterproof
so if the flooding is substantial it
could just be a one use product I don't
really like that at all when it comes to
mid-range flood detectors there are two
big ones
the d-link Wi-Fi water sensor is really
cool because it plugs directly into the
wall negating the need for batteries and
like the Honeywell it has a cable to
extend its range and it works with Wi-Fi
of course because it plugs into the wall
if the power goes out you're kind of out
of luck the other mid-range option if
you do have a smart home hub like smart
things or wink is the Favaro flood
sensor it's a feature-rich device that's
definitely worth checking out if you do
have a smart home hub though then you do
have a couple of options that are pretty
reasonably priced the a/o tech and ever
spring sensors have wired probes which
kind of limits them to just monitoring
sump pumps or particular drains between
those two a otech gets the nod for
having the slightly lower price tag of
35 bucks for more conventional sensors
in the affordable category you've got
the fortress II and smartthings flood
sensors and both of them are really easy
to install but they don't have a lot of
distinguishing features but I prefer the
smartthings detector because it has a
slightly lower price tag of 40 dollars
and as a design that brings any water
that contacts it toward the probes which
kind of extends its range a little bit
when you're looking for the perfect
flood sensor this year
of options can be kind of overwhelming
the trick is to know what your price
range is and know that whatever you get
it will at least be a positive step
toward avoiding some of that flood
damage</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
