the new xbox console I'm Bridget Carey
and this is your cnet update microsoft
finally unveiled its next game console
it's called the Xbox one and it's coming
out later this year it will come
packaged with a new Kinect camera sensor
and a new controller most of the focus
around the Xbox one was around its home
entertainment and television features
the xbox one will connect with your
television provider so you can quickly
switch between a game and live TV or use
a command to search internet explorer or
play a movie this is all without having
to mess with changing TV inputs the Xbox
will answer to your voice commands so if
you say Xbox watch ESPN it'll turn on
ESPN or you can say Xbox what's on HBO
it'll bring up the channel guide for HBO
and you can also quickly go back to a
game xbox is tracking what other users
are watching so it can tell you what
shows are trending both live and
on-demand xbox one will be able to give
you TV recommendations and we're told
it's going to be more social with some
sort of interactivity as you watch live
events one example for sports was being
able to pull up live fantasy football
stats on the side of the screen as the
game's going on the big question is
which television providers will this
work with the only one mentioned during
the presentation was comcast xfinity
connect is getting smarter not just with
voice commands but also with detecting
your movements the camera can read more
joints so picks up on slight rotations
of your wrist or shoulder and there's
more depth it also claims to read your
heartbeat the Kinect will know when
you're picking up your controller and if
you're moving it around and we saw that
users can move their fists in a pinch to
zoom like fashion to pull up more
screens so you can multitask and you can
use the Kinect for skype calls the
machine itself has a 500 gig hard drive
and an hdmi in and out and the ability
to play blu-rays as far as games go we
know within the first year of launch
there will be 15 exclusive Microsoft
Studios games and eight of them will be
new franchises one unique title was
called quantum break which included live
performances mixed in with the gameplay
it looks like Microsoft is saving more
details for the e3 conference happening
in three weeks there are still many
questions to answer like how much is
this gonna cost one answer we did get
that many of you probably won't be happy
with there's no backward compatibility
so you won't be able to play old xbox
360 games on the Xbox one and Microsoft
is pushing against use games if a game
is installed on more than one machine
the player has to pay a fee to play that
game doesn't sound good that's your tech
