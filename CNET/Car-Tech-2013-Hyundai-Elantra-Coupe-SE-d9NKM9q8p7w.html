sedan we came to the conclusion that it
was good actually almost better than the
Civic good
so Hyundai's taking an if it ain't broke
don't fix it sort of approach to the new
Hyundai Elantra sedan let's hop on this
2013 model and check the tank now the
sedan already had a pretty coupe like
profile a lot of people looked at it and
didn't even realize there were four
doors there so for the coupe what
Hyundai's done is they've actually given
a little bit more aggressive rake to the
roof of course they've dropped the rear
doors and the long gate at the front
it's a bit of a me-too Hyundai civic
coupe but I mean they're trying to take
out the best here so they're pretty much
sticking with the script so it's
actually a little bit amazing how
quickly car tech is starting to progress
this dashboard infotainment system is
only about two maybe two and a half
years old and it's it's already the old
one this is the same navigation system
that we saw debut in the Elantra sedan a
couple of years ago but it's not
Hyundai's newest system that has the new
blue link infotainment connectivity and
telematics system now down here at the
bottom of the center console we've got
your sort of standard Haeundae USB
auxiliary input combo down there and to
connect an ipod you're gonna get a $30
cable that's gonna bridge both of those
connections into a dock connector now
that 30-pin dock connector is definitely
not iPhone 5 friendly so you're probably
out of luck if you've recently upgraded
your phone other audio sources are going
to include bluetooth for hands-free
calling and audio streaming Sirius XM
satellite radio and your basic AM FM and
CD sources if you spec the version with
the automatic transmission you also get
the option to activate what's called the
active eco mode by pushing a button over
here next to the steering wheel now what
that's going to do is it's going to
slightly detune your throttle response
and your tip in so you get a little bit
better fuel economy at the expense of
bit of responsiveness now if you want to
get pretty close to what that EPA
estimate for combined fuel economy is
you're gonna want to use that button
now under the hood you're gonna find
Hyundai's 1.8 liter four-cylinder engine
now this small engine places an emphasis
on fuel economy not power you're looking
at about 148 horsepower 131 pound-feet
of torque now you can get the Elantra
coupe with a six-speed manual
transmission and your fuel economy
you'll be 28 in the city 38 on the
highway and 32 combined at least that's
what the EPA tells you we've never
actually gotten anywhere close Hyundai's
quoted numbers they must be really good
at gaming the system now if you have a
6-speed automatic transmission like our
vehicle is you lose one mile per gallon
across the board on all of those ratings
now I don't know what sport Hyundai is
talking about when they mentioned the
sport-tuned suspension in the vehicle
but it surely ain't racing because
there's it's just not very sporty at all
there's it's pretty soft
I suppose what do you expect from a you
know about $20,000 vehicle and of course
also as you'd expect from the 1.8 liter
engine without a tremendous amount of
power you don't get a lot of grunt from
a go the 6-speed automatic transmission
also isn't really helping here but I
mean I've had a hard time keeping up
with our camera van for this shoot it's
just that little amount of power now the
active eco mode that I mentioned earlier
it does really just kind of scale back
all of your throttle inputs and kind of
you know there's not really a fun car to
begin with but it does take all of the
fun out of it
I almost hesitate to drive around in the
active eco mode because I mean even
though you do maybe get a couple extra
miles per gallon it really just adds a
little too much lag in the
responsiveness there's an extra sort of
one one thousand two one thousand before
the vehicle actually decides that it's
going to downshift
for a pass or an extra bit of paddle
travel that I think a lot of drivers
aren't really going to be comfortable
with
the 2013 Hyundai Elantra coupe start at
17,000 $445 now now for the bass GS
model with the manual transmission but
to even get the option to add any tech
to this car you're gonna want to step up
to the SE model and then again to the
6-speed automatic transmission for
twenty thousand seven hundred and forty
five dollars that gives you the option
to add the tech package for two thousand
three hundred and fifty bucks that
brings you to our as tested price of
twenty three thousand ninety five
dollars and as is the case with most
Hyundai's that's probably the Elantra
coupes best selling point it's a really
good car with pretty decent tech for
thousands less than the competition</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
