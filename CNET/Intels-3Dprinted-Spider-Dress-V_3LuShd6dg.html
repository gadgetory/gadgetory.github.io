actually covered it on our show and we
were really excited to be able to have
it talk about it here at CES this is a
there's a intel has this robotic spider
dress and I don't know if any of you
have actually seen it quite yet but it
looks absolutely terrifying we have
video of it we have it there was a
teaser trailer that was released here it
is
this spider dress looks absolutely
credible is 3d printed it has proximity
sensors on it so when people get a
little too close like they'd like to do
here at CES it lashes out and the most
exciting part about it is we actually
have the dress with the designer on nuke
VIP precht
right here at our video spirit but I'm
careful everybody don't get too close
it might attack you I just want to let
you know can we grab so we have them
coming up to the stage they're gonna
show off this beautiful creation Anouk
actually has designed another designs
and other 3d printed dresses for seeing
it so it's gonna lash out I'm frightened
Kael do not touch the model okay really
far away model you will lose an eye but
this is one of my favorite I like when
we combine different things so it's like
it's like future-tech fashion and you
know robotic so can you tell us a little
bit Anoka about the process of designing
this and also you know what your
inspiration was in creating this
beautiful piece I open okay yeah first
of all welcome for the invites and so
what we have here is a robotic spider
dress is based on the Intel Edison a
small microcomputer and module of Intel
that's let's go inside a rebel industry
so what we have here is an dress as soon
as you step into her personal space
which I want to try to do here she's
she's attacking you yeah I'm walking to
her very close you know like if I do
this a little bit faster Wow
so yeah basically the the dress is all
3d print sets in in collaboration with
Philip H milk it's all 3d prints in a
technique called selective laser
sintering so
that's a really cool way to create this
kind of geometry you see here the
mechanic legs
there are several base and in front of
the dress you have two proximity sensor
so those are measuring the the intimate
space the personal space a social space
and a public space that she has around
her body that's really helpful when
you're walking around the Intel booth
freely you're like just stay away just
photos only photos only now can I can I
get this in a size four kale can we get
one I think he would look really good at
me yeah invites are in black oh I like
whites
it looks so angelic you you've made a
dress before this the synapse dress
correct that's the one one that you wear
it it detects where you're focusing and
whatnot where do you want to go next
oh wow that's a that's a good question
we just released this one this morning
so it's a very newborn baby so yeah well
yeah due to the use of the Intel Edison
I'm doing much more with Wireless bio
signals in collaboration with the team
at Intel the new devices group working
with a wireless bio signals is really
interesting for me normally I use
proximity sensors a lot so my designs
were able to sense the surroundings but
they were not really able to sense the
body and to connect my interactions to
the body and her surroundings sort of
yeah so working with that it really has
really yeah pulled off some really
interesting things for example I witness
using a respiration sensor here so as
Whitney is working in the Intel booth
and she doesn't want to go in an attack
mode all the time she's just breathing
in deeply and her assistant goes to a
little bit of a breath mode sort of so
she can stop her dress being attacking
by her own body for example that is
fantastic I have one more question what
are the benefits and and just the pluses
of using 3d printed like clothing um you
don't have to sue anymore no no pokes
and fingers all right I got you all
right and how long have you been
creating 3d printed designs
2d printing have been basically for four
years now materialized whoo
also at CES saddest moments I'm printing
a lot with them and they they guided me
into the world of 3d printing which has
been a very fruitful it's it's yeah it's
super cool you can create such a complex
complex design sort of with its that
you're not able to do with your hands or
with sculpting or such things so so
that's really cool yeah it's so
impressive anza if anybody wants to
actually see it you can go to the Intel
booth if you're here at the show please
feel free to stop by she's walking
around and and you can take some
pictures of it and check it out I know
it's up on stage so she's not walking
around in the audience or anything but
BK at his speech off today that's 40 I
think that is BK of himself he will also
highlights the spider dress in his talk
fantastic so much thank you really
appreciate that thank you thank you yeah
thank you for wearing that gorgeous</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
