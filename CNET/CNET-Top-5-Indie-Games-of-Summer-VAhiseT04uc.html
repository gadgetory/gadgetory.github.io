the Halos bioshock's GTA c.o.d these are
the reasons why we buy consoles but a
lot of people still don't know about all
the amazing and fun independently
produced games you can also play on your
console Donald bell and this top 5 i'm
counting down just a handful of the best
indie games of the summer 2014 ranked by
cnet senior editor jeff beck start
things off at number 5 sports friends
available for ps3 and ps4 this is a fun
goofy collection of multiplayer games
perfect for breaking out at a party you
and your presumably drunk friends can go
head to head in the game of Hope row or
bar abari ball or johann Sebastian joust
or the most pornographic game title of
all time Superpole riders wow I guess
what you do with your friends is your
business at number 4 1001 spikes out on
xbox one ps4 Wii U 3ds Vita and steam
this one will definitely scratch your
retro NES itch it's like super mario
brothers for sadomasochists it's an
adorable side scroller while you'll be
randomly impaled on bloody spikes at
every turn if you get frustrated easily
this is not the game for you but if you
can handle dying a few hundred times
working your way through this game is a
lot of fun coming in at number 3 Waka
melee Super Turbo championship edition
available on ps4 xbox one wii u and
steam you're a down on your luck mexican
wrestler fighting your way through gangs
of undead henchmen so that you can stop
the bad guy and save the girl pretty
standard plot stuff but infused with a
great sense of humor and a graphic style
unlike anything you've seen before in at
number two velocity 2x out on ps4 and
Vita in September or basically next week
it's a great sci-fi action game that
bounces back and forth between a Metroid
style side scroller and a top-down shoot
them up that as the name implies moves
namely fast feel an epileptic fit coming
on just watching this game but if you
like that feeling of constant reflex
ripping engagement this is your game but
finally Jeff Bakalar is picked for the
number one indie game of the summer
rogue legacy out on ps3 ps4 Vita and
steam you can think of this as ghosts
and goblins meets Charles Darwin when
you die in this game and you will die a
lot your character does not come back to
life instead you come back as your kid
and this time you have slightly
different strengths and abilities that
evolve with each generation you might
even have a genetic handicap such as
color blindness dyslexia or my favorite
chronic flatulence how do you say no to
that so there you go five great indie
games that will tide you over between
those blockbuster megagames for Jeff
Bakalar full list of 12 indie game
recommendations head over to cnet.com
and it's more top 5s for me top five dot
