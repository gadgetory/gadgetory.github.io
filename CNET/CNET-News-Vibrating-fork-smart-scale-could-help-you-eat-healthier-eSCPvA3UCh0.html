with the best intentions to eat
healthier but old habits die hard and a
few weeks in you may need some tech to
help you stick to your goals a scale is
one way to control portions but a new
gadget takes that idea a step further
for the home chef who doesn't follow
recipes ingredient for ingredient the
prep pad and countertop app gives you a
way to still find out the exact
nutritional information of the dish
you're preparing to use the prep pad
place an empty dish on the scale then
enter each ingredient of your meal into
the countertop app before adding it to
your dish we're kind of first in terms
of giving you the visual breakdown of
every ingredient you know your completed
meal everything that you're that you're
preparing in the kitchen when it comes
to eating health experts say what's the
rush the happy fork reminds you to slow
down your dining the electronic utensil
times the intervals between your bites
and tells you when you're gobbling your
meal too quickly by vibrating and
sending an alert to your smartphone
you'll have to charge up the device
every few hours and currently there are
no happy spoons so you're out of luck if
soup's on the menu but happy fork is
dishwasher safe just pull it apart to
keep your electronics nice and dry
another proven way to trim the fat a
food diary the MyFitnessPal app tracks
what you eat and your exercise down to
the last calorie thanks to a barcode
scanning feature and a massive database
of workouts and food part of the
database is entered by us part of it is
entered by our community so it's a lot
like Wikipedia where people will
contribute foods people can edit foods
you know you can think of it as having
millions of people who are constantly
quality checking our database and
because people often eat the same meals
the app will soon roll out a feature
that remembers foods eaten together if
you just tap on the hotdog what you'll
see is will show you all the things that
you've logged with that hot dog before
so you can easily check them off so the
mustard the ketchup the relish will all
be there for you makes it really simple
to log the whole group of foods together
with some tech on your side maybe you'll
keep that New Year's resolution after
all at least
