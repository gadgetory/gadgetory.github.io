com and welcome to road warrior where we
take a look at the hottest gadgets for
life on the go coming up a Wi-Fi camera
to avoid a laptop to love and chocolate
let's start with a portable DVD player
from Panasonic it has a 9 inch screen
but wait till you see how flexible that
screen can get it has a sort of
swiveling armature that the screen is
attached to so it gives you a lot more
flexibility in viewing angles and
whatnot when you're watching this player
that can be particularly useful in a
plane or any other cramped area where
you might be using this player and
wanting the best viewing angle possible
the LS ninety weighs in at a spelt 2.75
pounds and we got the battery to last
more than five hours not bad next up
will Greenwald gives you the straight
scoop on the 6 megapixel kodak easyshare
it does of this listing stylus so it's
not quite as bad navigating the
touchscreen as it could be but it's
still clunky and very unintuitive
unfortunately this camera suffers from
performance issues and its images just
aren't that good clear enough will says
if you want more than Wi-Fi in a
touchscreen get a different camera now
some positivity Michelle Thatcher has a
new ultra portable toshiba satellite
laptop it's almost the same as the
toshiba tecra m6 but this one's fancier
really the only difference between the
two are these multi media controls above
the keyboard you've got web and media
player quick launch buttons as well as
disc playback controls otherwise they're
pretty much the same you've got a very
comfortable keyboard it's good for
pretty extended bouts of typing it's
very impressive for an ultraportable to
have a keyboard this comfortable
Michelle did think the trackpad was a
little small and noted the U 205 has no
built-in webcam finally snack time the
delectable and much ballyhooed LG
chocolate VX 8500 the main display is
very attractive can be a little hard to
see when the backlight in this office is
also very reflective and it attracts
fingerprints but it is very bright and
colorful shows everything pretty vividly
navigation buttons are a little
different almost resemble an iPod
way I do have a rounds mechanism they
can have buttons on either side buttons
on the bottom as well these are touch
buttons so I like a touch pad you don't
actually press down on anything to
simply have to press your finger against
it cat says it really doesn't have
anything other phones don't it just sort
of looks nice hey I work for the
motorola razr that's it for this edition
of road warrior I'm Tom Merritt check
back next time for more gadgets to keep
you armed and dangerously productive</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
