who says I noticed that Tesla cars with
autopilot partial self-driving upload
their self-driving data to the cloud and
that is shared with all other Tesla's
that have autopilot he says imagine if
there was a way for cars
other than Tesla's to tap into that data
as well and use their own driving
assistance tech - perhaps warn drivers
about dangerous Road or other conditions
ahead maybe Prime the car for an impact
he says could this sort of hivemind
technology be adapted for our normal
cars a lot of things going on here both
technologically and in terms of policy
and competition in the auto business
first of all we have something called
DSRC digital short range communications
it is set to be proposed formally in the
US and 2016 for formal adoption as
standard equipment some number of model
years after that that's one piece that
allows cars to doovy to the vehicle to
vehicle they can talk to each other and
say hey I'm here I'm stopping short so
you car behind me should know that
things like that the bigger picture what
you're talking about
is more of a cloud technology where cars
talk up to the cloud to some sort of
master control that shares their wisdom
with all other cars three things to look
at that could get in the way of that
pretty credibly first Wallis idea of
Auto learning starts with connectivity
you gotta have cars that are connected
Tesla's do have connectivity to the
cloud so they can report what they've
learned and then it can be shared back
down to them as well most cars don't
have that it's still pretty rare to find
a car with built-in 3G or 4G I'm not
talking about pairing your phone is a
different thing it's gotta be really
built into the car for robustness and
that's still quite a rare vehicle the
next thing is you've got to have
standards so that one car is learning
this can be uploaded and downloaded to
another one car maker does one thing
nothing there's another thing and
they're not talking the same language
they're not talking into the same cloud
servers they have basically complete
silo ization the third thing is even if
we answered the connectivity and the
standard space you've got this one of
cooperation or competition car makers
like to be different than others in as
many ways as they can you're asking for
Tesla to use their data their
proprietary information to make another
competing car company's self-driving
tech work better Tesla does not want to
help her Sadie's work better they want
to die so this is a very cutthroat
competitive industry BMW Mercedes Tesla
outie infinity they are not in the
business of making each other's cars
better so I really gets a long shot to
say that's gonna happen until and unless
self-driving become so much of a
commodity so much of an expected
technology that the regulator's get in
there and say okay it's time for us to
require this on all cars require it be
common and consistent on all cars and
that starts to lay the ground for a more
unanimous system where everybody is
talking the same language and perhaps
would start sharing some of that data
but to be honest it's relatively
unprecedented Leon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
