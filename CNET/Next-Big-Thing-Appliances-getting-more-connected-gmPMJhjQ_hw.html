begun doing appliance reviews it's true
we don't focus on how the zucchini fairs
in the crisper but how well these
appliances are getting connected and
smart that's about time basically a
socket that you can power on and off
with your smartphone and that's a really
cool thing because you can plug anything
into it and then make that into a
remotely controlled device so if you
wanted your porch light to come on at
6pm for you to come home it'll be there
on waiting for you the whole bottle is a
really smart vacuum it's got this camera
on the top that is taking dozens and
dozens of photographs and this helps it
navigate and tell where it is where it's
been and where it's going to go but now
we get to the high-water mark of this
refrigerator which is the LCD screen
Sampson includes above the ice and water
dispenser one of the things I really
like about it is that when you have it
just in home screen mode it'll tell you
the exact temperatures of the insides of
both your freezer and your refrigerator
so that if there is a problem and you've
lost power to one you can always tell
now to my mind we're seeing three big
changes around the landscape of smart
appliances compared to 10 years ago when
they first began to emerge the first is
the mobile ecosystem everything ties
back to our phones and tablets these
days persistently and smart appliances
will be no different that gives them a
more persistent presence in our lives it
also helps to make them more personal
and less like well appliances the second
one is less pie pie in the sky no one's
talking so much anymore about the
internet fridge replacing your computer
perhaps now it's a more practical vision
like a dry herb that will message your
phone when it's time to get the clothes
out before they wrinkle and then there's
clouds smarts look at something like the
nest thermostat most of its goodness
actually comes from its cloud back in
the date of the history the processing
and software that's out there behind it
not stuck on the wall i'm also watching
the sort of wild card area around
replacement cycles of white goods or
major appliances most of us are happy if
the thing just works and dread replacing
one being the old one taken out and a
new one brought in and installed mobile
devices laptops never had to go through
that kind of friction I also want to see
how well these major appliance brands
can morph themselves into tech and
lifestyle brands this is new territory
for them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
