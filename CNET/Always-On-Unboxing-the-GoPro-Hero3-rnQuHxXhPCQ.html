so the hero3 is available in three
editions there's a white model which is
actually kind of the headline because
now there's a GoPro out for 199 dollars
then there's the next step up silver
which is 299 and then there's this guy
right here the Black Edition it costs
400 bucks but let me tell you this thing
can do it all first though let's get it
out of the box typical like GoPro
packaging I have to say if you've never
used one of these cameras or bought one
the hardest thing about it is getting
the Box open I think not everyone thinks
could just be like a problem that I have
because there's like always this thing I
think it's taped up here too oh right it
does have little arrows though help the
little arrow pull here Molly dear Molly
it's not that difficult just pull here
okay one dear Molly also pull here 22
there we go see how is your pick okay
and then we have like a whole second
layer in the Tower of Power pull here
you're already noticing i know that
there's more stuff in this box than they
used to be for example a remote control
can kind of i think just I don't know
remove oh this is new I think maybe it
has a little thing here that says
removed cuz I was always like is it
supposed to be stuck to the space
forever undo this thing get nothing
awful of me why are they okay whoa i
freed the camera okay everyone the
camera is free almost free so it's got
this comes with a case with a little I'm
too stupid for Cobra there okay it does
look at this though I am clearly not the
only one who's had this problem because
there are helpful little arrows all over
this thing like pull this thing this way
and this one down and you'll be able to
get the camera out shut up first thing
you're gonna notice this thing is way
smaller than the previous GoPros look
how tiny this is tiny little GoPro Hero
and like I mentioned it comes with a
remote which is gonna be probably stuck
on here forever and I'll see any helpful
arrows around it oh so you have to be
like action Jackson to get these things
out of the box because you need
calloused fingers to be a little bit
like you know what I'm just going to
work on this remote thing for a little
while while we talk about the specs the
GoPro Hero 3 is a hero in terms of
recording formats it does 1080p 720p and
of course 4k that's the new video
standard that is about as good looking
as it gets the Black Edition has a 12
megapixel camera that adds burst mode
which is key for those action shots
there is built in Wi-Fi so you can
upload your photos right away there's
also a Wi-Fi remote included it's
compatible with the GoPro app but
unfortunately that app so far really
just acts as a viewfinder that's a nice
bonus but I want to see them add stream
soon now that they have Wi-Fi there are
now two indicator lights on the front as
this camera gets easier to use the red
one indicates you're recording and the
blue one says the wifis on in terms of
ports the hero3 now has a micro HDMI as
opposed to the mini HDMI it had before
and it gets a microSD card slot instead
of the full-size SD card slot it
previously had the hero3 does not come
with a microSD card but it does support
cards with capacities up to 64 gigs it
charges via mini USB some bonuses you
get with a black edition it has a faster
processor and it also has a better
camera that's supposed to offer much
sharper images
alright I have to warn you i had to call
/ camera guys sell so to get this thing
out of the packaging it kind of reminds
me of when you buy like a kid's toy at
Target and it's in there like you
wouldn't believe with 50 million of
these kind of wrap around cables that
have metal in the middle that you can
kind of cut but not really I mean while
your kids screaming because they really
want the toy really bad that's how their
remotes in there that's annoying okay
but back to the actual unboxing part
let's see here the first impressions on
the camera itself it is extremely small
like I mentioned but it already looks
like it's much more intuitive the
previous models made you feel like an
idiot when they came out of the box
because you go sort of course the
buttons and what do I do here this has a
nice big power button very clearly
labeled you've got a clearly labeled
record button here now one thing I do
want to point out that's a little bit of
a bummer is that the GoPro threes are
going to micro SD instead of standard
size SD cards so if you already bought a
bunch of SD cards to go with your old
GoPros you're going to have to get new
ones they unfortunately don't fit and
there's not one in the box and you're
gonna lose this little thing trust me
ASAP of course I'm prabhas have a case
on all the time alright so you have your
battery cover here the batteries in the
box let's get that out and see what
other goodies it comes with GoPros kind
of legendary for including all kinds of
stuff in the box that again you're not
totally sure what to do it alright
here's our USB what I think is our
charging cable huh so that's kind of
weird figure out what that is later well
maybe oh I think it could be related to
the remote
you like locked up sign here okay I'll
play with that a minute see GoPro
baffling all right this is the part
where we get into a couple of our
awesome mounts use your imagination
connector thing to put it on something
else to make it go a different way
another one of those we could do a
thingy standard USB charging cable there
we go battery this is the skeleton
housing so you can put that on the
waterproof one it's better for sound I
did learn that over the years or months
see oh it looks like you have little
keychain thing in there and the key to
go pro marketing everywhere stickers so
clearly the hero 3 gets a lot more
portable and I'm happy to say a lot more
intuitive now I still think that the one
to get is probably the hundred ninety
nine dollar hero 3 that's a really
accessible price for a really fun camera
not very many people are going to need
for K and you have to have the latest
and greatest editing software to make
the video work I could see this as
something that pros would start to toss
in with their toolkit and I'm sure that
GoPro is hoping that will start
happening you can get a lot more details
