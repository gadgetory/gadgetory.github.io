running into some roadblocks thanks to a
new touch ID previous rumors suggested
the home button would completely
disappear on Apple's 10th anniversary
model to make room for a larger
edge-to-edge display the fingerprint
scanner would be embedded into the
display panel making the entire screen
and unlock surface but unless they
figure out something fast they may end
up having to scrap this feature
altogether according to Pacific Crest
securities analysts Apple's component
suppliers are struggling to make this
technology happen on time in this case
Apple would still announce it's 5.8 inch
iPhone
during its slated September launch event
along with a 7s and 7s plus model but it
wouldn't get into the hands of consumers
until as late as November or Apple could
take a page out of the Samsung playbook
and just slap the sensor on the back of
the phone as reported by slash leaks
Samsung was said to be considering a
similar feature in the s8 but ended up
having to move the sensor to the back of
the phone next to the camera lens or if
all else fails Apple could rely solely
on facial recognition to unlock the
phone a potentially less secure form of
authentication unless they're able to
deliver on that 3d depth sensing camera</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
