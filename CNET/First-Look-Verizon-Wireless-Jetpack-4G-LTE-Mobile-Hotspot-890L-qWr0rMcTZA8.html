something very cute to show you the 4G
LTE mobile hotspot 8 9 0 L from Verizon
now this router here is kind of choppy
in fact is one of the largest one ever
seen but see it is so pretty
is only mean there's more to love but
first let's talk about how it looks now
the black top right here is actually
very shiny
in fact I've look at myself so many
times during this review just couldn't
help it
so ridiculous but there's more function
than just a mirror on the right mirror
here you can see a small but very crisp
LCD that show you everything you want to
know about your network from the signal
strength the amount of connected Wi-Fi
client and other things and using this
up and down an OK button here you can
also dig deeper and even change the
setting of the router right on it
without using a computer now that kind
of measurement is the first I've seen in
a small row like this on top here
there's also another thing that I've
seen for the first time the slider power
switch you can slide it to the on
position very clear there's no way you
can make a mistake and turn the router
on off accidentally when it is in your
pocket or your purse now next to is
there is the micro used to be port for
charging with the included power adapter
now the bottom is also the batteries
cover and underneath unify a small
battery that's awful up to six hours of
battery life in my testing which is
pretty long but I was hoping it would be
longer considering how much bigger this
router is compared with its peers under
the battery is a SIM slot pretty
standard in my testing around the set
fiscal bay area the router offer great
4G signal with 4G connection almost
everywhere and that's great considering
how much it cost just twenty dollars if
you're willing to sign up for two-year
contract if you're not it costs two and
fifty dollars and of course you can also
have to pay 50 or $80 per month to use
it for the data plan that cap at five
gigabyte or 10 gigabyte respectively
now that is expensive
for more information check out the full
Viacom once again my name is dongho and
this has been the first look at the jet
bike 4G LTE mobile hotspot 8 9 0 l
