small city car even though it's electric
and often you think of those two going
together it's compact
it's got a people mover profile but it's
a full five seater with good cargo
capacity because mercedes is looking at
this as being a vehicle that
accommodates the suburban American
lifestyle
okay now the guts of this car which is
really what makes it interesting being
an Eevee only model in the u.s. this is
a Tesla powertrain that's always a
pretty good headline to have these days
horsepower is 177 torque is 251
foot-pounds that's a really good number
and electric cars tend to be very good
in that area makes them fun to drive
it's backed up by a 28 kilowatt-hour
lithium-ion battery now the EPA hasn't
banked the range on this officially yet
but Mercedes is talking somewhere around
85 miles in ideal conditions zero to 60
s being quoted at seven point nine
seconds but seven point nine in an
electric car feels different than in a
gas car quicker you can get a full
charge in three three and a half hours
from almost dead on a 240 volt what they
call a level two outlet which isn't hard
to get installed in your garage if you
got to go by and use a household outlet
obviously it's going to take like half a
day but that's a survival mode anyway
there is no level three or what you
might call a Tesla supercharger outlet
Nissan Leaf has that Tesla has that but
not this vehicle
this car has a gauge I've never seen
before they call it the e sale gauge it
shows you whether or not you have the
full potential of maximum power as the
battery gets very low or conditions are
very high or low in temperature this
would drop and say you can't get full
power right now it's not a measure of
battery charge that's a different game a
cell indicates whether you can get
maximum power transfer now under way
you've got sort of the standard Mercedes
shifter
here on the column very simple put it
and driving off you go you've got some
other drive controls to be aware of E
and s eco and sport makes a big
difference really brings on the inverter
when you hit sport you can tap into a
lot more of that battery but notice what
happens on the dash the projected range
goes down a fair amount the b-class
battery is one big low broad unit set up
under the belly that gives you a nice
low center of gravity and leaves cargo
and passenger space alone couple that
planted 'no Swit the spirited nature of
its sport mode and you've got a car that
is by no means sleepy
nor is it trending toward AMG levels of
aggression the other thing is you've got
paddles on the wheel negative on the
left positive on the right those puts
you into two different regen modes so
I'm in Auto Drive right now if I tap the
negative one I'm now locked down into a
heavy regen mode so it's going to really
regen hard as I lift off the throttle if
I tap it again I get to standard D and
then if I tap positive on the right I
get to more of a freewheeling mode so
now it's regen unless it's going to put
less juice in the battery but I'm going
to glide in Khost more I'm not sure how
well Mercedes will be able to train
drivers to use D D Auto D minus D plus
and while we're talking regen this car
has what I believe is a first a radar in
the front grille that will automatically
apply some regenerative braking if
you're closing too fast on traffic in
front it figures why not you need to
slow down anyway I may as well recapture
some energy while doing it for you they
are doing a credible job of creating the
Mercedes of electric cars it has
Mercedes straight
it has a comfort mission it's got great
isolation of noise and sound that is
unpleasant and the creature comforts
inside are very Mercedes you'll
recognize it immediately as a modern
Vance
now as I mentioned this beat class is
coming to the US as this only this
electric drive model they sell them as
combustion engine cars and other markets
around the world but here they're trying
to use this new shape to make a new
statement that Mercedes has their first
electric vehicle now aside from ride
quality and torque and charge time and
range as another reason Mercedes is
going to still an Eevee it's to satisfy
the regulations in California and other
states that require they sell an
increasing number of zero emissions cars
or face penalties price will be around
forty one five roughly before you start
adding some options on top well detail
that more later when it arrives summer
of 2014 as you've seen this B class has
plenty of Mercedes DNA throughout it
compare that to the BMW i3 which if it
didn't have the famous badge you might
not know as a BMW so the Battle of
German electrics is now on and pitting
two very different playbooks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
