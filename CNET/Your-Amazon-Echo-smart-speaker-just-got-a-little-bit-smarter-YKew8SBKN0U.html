smart Oh with the trio of Alexa echo
devices here from Amazon to test out the
new echo spatial perception feature it's
a new feature that's rolling out to
every echo device that's already out in
the market via a software update that
includes the original Amazon echo the
first generation Amazon echo dot mini
speaker and the new $50 second gen echo
dot mini speaker now all echo spatial
perception or ESP as it's called really
is is the ability for different echo
devices to distinguish which one is
closest to you when you say the
wakeboard usually Alexa so if I say
Alexa all threes will wake up but only
the closest one should respond to me so
let's turn the mute off on all of these
and test it out now if I had to guess I
would say that the original Amazon echo
here is the one that's gonna respond to
me because it's got the microphones up
at the top of the device a little closer
to my voice than the to echo dots down
here but let's give it a shot
Alexa tell me a joke what did the shot
have a wish just that she'd be a little
bolder it's really bad joke as you can
see the echo dot in the middle is one a
pipe that to me is the one right in
front of me so I guess that makes sense
let's try it again spread the devices
out through the room here in see how it
does Alexa what's the capital of Sweden
Sweden's capital city is stock boat now
ESP is a pretty important role out for
Amazon because it envisions us having
Alexa not just in every home but in
every room of every home and that won't
work so well if all the devices in your
home are all piping up to once every
time you try to use one of the devices
the echo spatial perception update is
live now so if you've got an echo device
in your home already or a couple of
devices you'll start to notice that they
only pipe up one at a time you'll also
find it already installed with the new
echo dot the second gen $50.00 unit here
that's shipping out to people that
pre-ordered it starting on October 20th</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
