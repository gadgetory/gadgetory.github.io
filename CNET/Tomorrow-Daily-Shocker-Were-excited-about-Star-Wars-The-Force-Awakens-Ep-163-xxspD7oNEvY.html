might someday charge your cell phone and
a robotic flower that you control with
your mind and there's a whole bunch of
Star Wars news that ah yes it's tomorrow
daily
greetings citizen to the internet
welcome to tomorrow daily the best ski
talk show in the known universe I'm
ashley's gether joining me as always
jedi master Cale anonymous still a
Padawan but I appreciate that you're a
Jedi Master to me you always wanted cool
all right you know so we've decided we
need to launch off with the Star Wars
news let's not bury the lead here let's
hit the headlines so we talked about it
before Star Wars Celebration is going on
currently thursday friday and saturday
and sunday yeah thursday being the
biggest day because we have not only
gotten a chance to see a panel but we
also got the trailer for another teaser
Star Wars teaser for Star Wars Episode 7
force awakens and as you can see it like
you see on the screen it opens
fantastically my favorite shot um but
yeah there's a lot of details that came
out too because there was a panel
apparently is gonna be a lot more Ashley
what did you see on the panel so the
things I liked about the panel was I
loved that first of all let's just
discuss bb-8 because bb-8 the droid is a
droid is a practical real real working
robot that's the droid with the ball
almost floating head yeah super cute and
they brought it out on stage there is
and it looks like magic like that
doesn't even look rip my brain can't
even process how cool that is it just
doesn't even look real it looks really
big ceej eat it right on stage but that
right there is pretty good reflection of
the fact that JJ Abrams is having a good
time oh yeah like a bang-up job but what
else are what are some information that
we learned so we got to meet the three
actors that play these three kind of
Maine new roles we got to meet Daisy
Ridley Oscar Isaac and John boyega and
we learned what their kind of weather
rolls are a little a little bit they
were eight they were just barely JJ
Abrams took them away for off of
gunpoint for two seconds each and they
were able to tell a little bit about
their characters uh so Oscar Isaac is a
is a pilot he who described himself as
the greatest pilot in the galaxy right
um and then Daisy Ridley is she said
she's a very self-sufficient scavenger
on a desert planet that is not tattooing
and that's the desert planet that we're
seeing in the trailer
is it's not tattooing a lot of people
thought it was no different planet yeah
there's other desert plant there does
our plants guy jerks and then John
boyega described as up so there's some
debate going on in the internet because
John boyega described himself as a
person who is on this desert planet and
like something happens and he has to
kind of make a choice about what kind of
person he is and they asked him very
directly are you a stormtrooper or are
you in disguise like that was a big
thing oh and the new storm trooper
costumes these are the new storm trooper
costume which are gorgeous yeah um that
was a very weird way of saying it just
they're gorgeous there you got these new
storm troopers outfits and they're
gorgeous this is Star Wars fashion
police aren't really impressive
apparently they're supposed to be more
mobile like they can they can move
around a lot more oh okay and then of
course we learned the John boyega might
wear one of these himself mikey is going
to be my injured need to be a
stormtrooper movie because he looked at
Kathleen Kennedy and JJ Abrams and was
kind of like looked at everybody else
was like so I hoping that me and Tia is
a stormtrooper beyond the panel and I
don't know if we even have any files for
this but we also got a chance to see in
like living motion the villain that's
gonna be in Star Wars Episode 7 the guy
with the lightsaber that has the little
cross guard yeah the crossguard that
comes off and he looks awesome I know
that we have that we don't think we have
that um okay oh there ya go it's only
for like a sec again right but you get
to see him like he swings the the
lightsaber and whatnot and then there's
also vo somebody wanted to do a
breakdown I'm like I don't even have
enough it trailer preview the vo is from
Luke yeah yes from Luke and he may be
talking to his look at this letter but
he kept the helmet Franklin you just
gotta sit down you gonna watch the
trailer there's so much I do so much
going on I almost I literally got choked
up you guys I'm I was so excited because
I was telling my best friend Mike in the
car on the way here this is my star wars
I was too young to get to have the
nostalgia that people have about the
first set of starting the first trilogy
the original trilogy I was too little
like I didn't get to see it in a theater
until I was too old to like really like
that Matt for that magic to sort of
activate and then the prequels I was
is like they just weren't good and so
it's like okay well that's not my Star
Wars either and I oh I never felt like I
I love Star Wars more than I did today
where I was i saw that trailer Mike this
is my star wars this is my trilogy like
this is gonna be a trilogy that I
connect with the most like I'm really
jacked about I I think the thing that
stands out more than anything about this
particular run of Star Wars is just how
many fans are involved in making the
product yes whether it be JJ Abrams
who's a giant fan John boyega like
geeked out even even like even the
people in the cast even Hamill they're
all super stoked about being back in
this universe and then it's not just it
you could say it's a money grab but it's
absolutely not everybody involved is a
for sure about that's why they released
it at the star wars celebration yeah not
the star wars funeral downer time no
they're everyone is super excited Peter
Mayhew came out with his star wars
lightsaber cane which I thought was
adorable cuz he just had knee surgery um
he had a couple knee replacements and
yeah Mark Hamill Carrie Fisher they were
all out there that his big photo op
everyone was so excited and you know I
just I am so thrilled like I'm very
pleased and I think it's in the right
hands I know a lot of people are really
skeptical about JJ Abrams like oh it's
gonna be all full lens flares lololo
like that was the whole internet joke
but from what I've seen thus far it
really does seem to capture the spirit
of the original trilogy with all the
practical effects and puppetry but also
really kind of bring it into I know I
know that's basically all you can say
about it is just fire up your
lightsabers everybody fires oh not meant
not many details on the story but
they're not a whole lot now hold on all
right so we have to talk about other
things well we've hashed out of the day
oh oh alright which is TT star wars GD
star wars and we just want to know based
on the teaser trailer or if you saw the
panel who is your favorite care who
you're most looking forward to seeing it
could be an old character a new
character you most looking forward to
seeing and in the force awakens the
villain bb-8 i'm all about bb-8 alright
mean baby oh he's gonna let you down
competitor likes milk he's never don't
let me down I can't wait to the villain
we really haven't seen too much of the
villain and it always has to be
something ominous and asked me something
we've never
seen before they wouldn't just force us
to have another Darth Maul or another
Darth Vader he has to have like very
messed up intentions and I'm sure he's
going to start he's gonna start a domino
effect that's gonna go for this whole
trilogy so I'm very excited see what
happens here do you um that's Adam
driver right that's he's done yeah the
rumor is the rumor is that he's playing
a Sith there's no word on whether that's
him that could be Andy Serkis for all we
know who does Moe cab for him or
whatever okay we don't know well no any
circuses character did have a name now
but I forgot what it was yeah but I I'm
just really excited to see what this it
like I am excited to kick off a whole
new trilogy of Star Wars like it just
looks really fun and I'm excited to go
see it so there you go um so TT star
wars that's your hashtag a day okay we
got to talk about this the smart fabric
this is pretty cool and it might charge
your smartphone someday so kmart fabric
fabric of smart fabric yeah yeah okay so
pay a Star Wars fabric or Star Wars
fabric no smart fabric but Star Wars
fabric I'm sure I'm gonna see a lot of
tomorrow at celebration I will be there
so it might take some pictures and stuff
okay so right now there is a group of
scientists and researchers at
Sungkyunkwan University in South Korea
and I i am going to feel confident about
my pronunciation of that and they put
together this material that is two
layers of fabric together and when the
fabric rubs together with natural motion
it creates the like kinetic energy well
it creates the it creates this scenario
where static electricity shows up so
like you know kind of rubbing your head
on a balloon yes same type of thing okay
so what they're doing is they're like
okay and then you know you have static
electricity that you touch a doorknob
and you see that little arc and it
shocks you so they're converting that
into power which is kind of insane yeah
so you walking around you're gonna be
generating enough generating a little
electricity so there's look they're
powering some of those LEDs right there
that's that's from just moving that's
incredible which is pretty cool and they
were saying that so they were able to
power on a six and bed
at LEDs a smart a small LCD screen and a
keyless car remote inside the jacket one
at a time so not all at once but they
were able to power all of those things
like in succession which is pretty cool
and they did it successfully like it was
it worked so they're saying at some
point there they said obviously right
now you can't power a smartphone it's
not enough power but they said in the
future maybe connecting that with a
battery pack that would be able to store
that energy and then you can connect the
battery pack to your phone maybe your
emotions throughout the day could in
fact charge your smartphone yeah you put
it like on that inner thigh area of your
pants and when you like walk in your
pants you're like actually just creating
that kinetic energy yeah exactly in
there all day we're like right here all
right here you're walking yeah you know
here doing your power walk yeah and if
you need charge your phone you're like
you're like I gotta go faster day Oh
what ya know this is really cool it's
like you're your own little Tony Stark
down yeah you good self power you're so
you're all self powered um but yeah I
thought this was really neat and so
they're they're working really hard on
this and there's some fascinating
science that goes into this and I won't
even try to pretend to understand it
because they talk about the different
materials that they went through and how
exactly they're using the energy to make
it charge but we have the article up on
cnet if you want to read it super it's
super interesting if it's something that
you're interested in smart fabrics okay
so last story and then we will jump into
a break and some other fun stuff but I
really like this I think this is really
cool so a lot of people now it's really
hard for us to like relax focus maybe
meditate a lot of people well you
meditate with the force that's fine I
don't get to do that I don't get to
meditate with the force so this girl who
has a fantastic name who's Ashley Ashley
Newton is a cooler name of mine actually
Newton way cooler name yeah Ashley
escalators really hard to say escalator
yeah is Ashley cause idea um so she made
these robotic flowers with her
collaboration with an artist named Sean
Stevens and they made these robotic
flowers now they kind of look like
jellyfish they remind me of jellyfish
but they're clear and they have all
these beautiful lights in them and you
put a EEG device on your head so the
ones that measure your brainwave
activity and you can actually
make the flowers change color and expand
and contract based on how focused or how
relaxed your your brain activity is oh
wow yeah so she's got you can so they
have like a little little head bands and
stuff that track your your brain
activity and so these are the flowers
that they made to sort of show exactly
how you're using your your your brain
waves so the light and the the blooming
is all controlled and so they're saying
like the colors change if you're more
focused or if you're more relaxed and
then also the the flower opens up or
closes based on how you how your brain
waves are acting so yeah there you go
that's that's incredible like it just
it's really neat and and I like that um
I really like that this is kind of a
good way like maybe in the future maybe
this would be like something you would
buy to help your mindfulness or if you
need to meditate if you really you know
like it would be a good way to train
your brain to sort of meditate but be
able to see results right in front of
you like I feel like that would be
really encouraging to some people who
feel like oh I just I can't meditate too
hard so I like that I like that a lot
very cool yeah nice where cash in Haven
I'd buy that I feel like I kind of want
one so um yeah it's pretty it's pretty
neat and they were at a festival in san
francisco last week and then now they're
gone but hopefully we'll see them again
we'll see them pop up somewhere but but
yeah so that's it for headlines and
we're going to take a quick break we're
gonna before we leave we're going to
watch an intense there was an attack on
Los Angeles I don't have you heard about
this it's very serious and in honor of
Star Wars Celebration I figured we'd
show this at break and then we'll be
right back with into it which is some
good stuff and then of course your user

don't have to work at them like I'm
working but it's like I get to also have
fun yeah it's pretty good but yeah Star
Wars Celebration super easy no-brainer
for us it was very easy this week Hills
like I literally have been living in Los
Santos and I'm like well I am super
excited Star Wars so maybe they'll have
the convention in Grand Theft Auto that
would be kind of cool oh my god if you
could drive down to it that would be
amazing you can only get dress up as any
sort of nerd I bet you could dress up as
a Jedi but there's some Jedi robe and
there'd be maybe there be a mod in a
couple weeks I'm dressed up right now as
clockwork orange so fair enough really
fair enough a little bitty ol little
Alex was it altra violence so hyper
violence alright so that's it that's it
that's what we're into uh and now we're
gonna talk about what you're into
because it's time for user feedback
you ready hit the pool cues hit the pool
cues eight eight Ball corner pocket Luke
hit the eight ball feel before it's been
a rough day guys it's it has we haven't
eaten yet um so hey we asked you guys
use the hashtag TD protest tell us about
the hologram protests people were really
interested in this I also find it very
fascinating um but we asked you guys
instead of politicizing it we asked you
guys to literally think of the pettiest
thing possible to protest you guys came
up with some really good ones my
girlfriend saw mine by the way did I
laughed so hard about an hour after we
left the studio yesterday filming the
show Cale sends me a picture of the
Splenda packet ripped in half on the
counter next to the club that was the
one thing that I was against laughed so
hard I just it was so funny and so
perfect great great timing I mean I
think you literally sent that to me
maybe five minutes after the show
wondering what you want to go you want
to go on my camera yeah do it go to go
to there it is there it is
disappointment there it is you can see
the Splenda pocket right there next to
the coffee machine and then there's the
where she would throw it away so yeah I
was the best um so you guys came up with
some really good one she said I'm a jerk
by the way yeah definitely for throwing
that out how dare you uh but anyway so
okay what everybody else said hey soos
wrote in and said rise up against hard
plastic packages there as evil as the
great old ones so much blood lost oh no
yeah your teeth probably suffered too
from those yeah you're trying to go to
choose a room and so and then you gotta
you can't figure them out it's like and
then I'm ribbon and you can't return it
cuz like a wheel package all right you
feel terrible and then Frank wrote in
and said this is to Microsoft I demand a
live-action halo film and Dave Batista's
Master Chief's voice that is a very I
never thought of that but i like it i
did think about that he's so good i like
it it's pretty good that's good casting
good casting you should be casting
director Frank then Ansel wrote in to us
and said I would I rally against EA to
make them put their games on steam and
not origin that's a good one nobody
likes nobody likes origin I'm I'm all
for multiple platforms existing fair
enough so competition is good
it's just not origin has crept right
origin pretty good it's pretty awful to
use Rob wrote in and said the most
trivial and ridiculous protest that I
would protest would be is there are not
enough Pete's or philz coffee shops
around San Francisco it's all starbucks
on every am corner too many Starbucks
build a krispy kreme doughnuts in San
Francisco so that was his email yeah
like he needs some coffee yeah you need
some coffee I'm gonna get your caffeine
fix Robbie seem cranky and then Michael
wrote in lastly and had a few different
things to say said dear Ashley Kalin
Logan I've been watching from the
beginning also this show brought me to
cnet which got me into technology thanks
oh yeah anywho first going off with a
snuggle seat I can't believe they're
really calling it that it's an okay idea
but just okay I might use it but I think
I'd rather use the ostrich pillow which
is the one where you put it all over
your head and then you have like the
little okay like that one next I
estimated the price of an apple to watch
and it is around 125 dollars without 3d
printing third I probably wouldn't take
part in a protest mostly because of a
minor but I don't know TD protest I
would protest YouTube too for not giving
us the new UI which I actually found how
to get on Android Police I want to know
the new UI yeah oh it's so nice um the
the bars on the bottoms of art like
transparent the play like the controls
and stuff it looks good right look
really nice yeah um lastly from your
episode the other day the leg shocker
people mover thingamajig which i think
is the perfect name for it I do not like
that idea because that opens up an
entire new world of hacking where you
can't control where you're going and
basically UK a mug door something super
like a yes yes that's dangerous where am
I going yeah legs are just dragging your
right leg help me seriously though I
feel like I feel like that is a that's a
story that we need to get someone I
think we should have producer Logan try
that they were pretty sure Logan you up
for that yeah I just need more writing
that's all I need my life hahahahahaha
right sorry he's busy writing a
different oh she's writing a screenplay
writer yeah well we'll worry about that
later um okay so that is your users
feedback so good don't forget your
hashtag dated a TV star wars and it's
time for our last piece user feedback
which is our photogra for the day
oh it's tough I hit in this video you
know it you're lyin see but like right
outside this box there's tons of like
that there's like seven lights over here
there's three down here there's like
this thing you get is really dangerous
here like I look I'm touching something
now and touching something now it scared
thing too that's damaged it's very
dangerous kale is a dangerous animal max
wrote in to us and said greetings
citizens of the internet tomorrow daily
I'm max from one of the tiniest
country's Singapore he's from Singapore
okay first of all we're gonna discuss
this picture in a second but he says
just want to share some photos I took
with my samsung galaxy s2 the pictures

that day Setting Sun wasn't in my
favorite a lot of Sun reflection but
still I've been watching every episode
we like to share some pictures I took
these in Singapore in the background is
marina bay sands and the central
business district in the foreground is
actually a floating platform and some
tourists and joggers if you look closely

been used for other purposes too um he's
had time to get a new phone keep up the
good work all the best haha max uh so
first of all I love it this like because
it's a little bit kind of Vaseline on
the lens ish it's like got that kind of
