to set up straight look right and left
everywhere you know you really drive one
hand on the wheel and kind of collapse
back in the seat cause you're tired it's
been a long day your wife got the kids
are killing you this is a seat from for
SIA that tries to follow you as you go
from the right way to sit for the real
way you see let's check out the backrest
here as you slouch back and your lumbar
kind of goes crunch the headrest comes
forward with you and this shoulder
support follows your shoulders forward
here's a seat that actually kind of
follows all the parts of your body as
they go together in one place without
you having to hit a bunch of power
controls to readjust a bunch of lumbars
and to readjust the back incline the
cushion changes incline even though the
actual back frame stays in the same
place that's interesting and the
headrest of course follows with you in a
variable ratio down here at the bottom
typically you tend to slide your butt
forward as you get tired on this one
it's got this sort of spring action here
that wants to keep putting you down in
the bucket so your butt stays back here
where this lumbar can do what I just
showed you and do its thing
this seat control is real simple push
down on this tab part of it here on the
front and that's your fore aft but
notice it's also your incline because
the rails are inclined the logic is
pretty simple if you're shorter and need
to reach the wheel by going closer you
probably need to get your head a little
higher to see over said wheel that's so
simple and this other lever here is the
one that actually inclines the back
frame itself and notice this technology
is envisioned on a traditional frame
system we've seen other high-tech seats
where they get rid of all this frame
apparatus here that's a big step for
automakers this continues with
traditional steel hoop frames but gets
rid of this big foam bun that normally
lives here foam and steel Springs that
opens up a bunch of knee room for the
passenger behind you they also leave
room for a footrest not so much for
adults but for the kids they're sitting
behind you little legs are dangling they
don't know what to do with them so they
of course kick you in the back instead
now maybe they'll put their feet right
here and stop doing that why can't they
put these on those coach
cabins on airlines</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
