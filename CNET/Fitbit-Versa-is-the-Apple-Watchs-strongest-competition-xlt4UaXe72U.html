fitbit's made a lot of fitness trackers
aiming at everyone from the casual entry
level to higher-end athletics it looks
like their latest watch is aiming right
at the middle the Fitbit versus a
SmartWatch Fitbit second full app
running watch after Fitbit psionics
SmartWatch debuted last year the ionic
was expensive angular and full of
features the Versa runs the same apps as
Fitbit ionic fitbit's growing app and
watch face collection feels a lot like
with pebble smart washes to have it not
a surprise since Fitbit acquired pebble
at $200 or 230 for a special edition it
now undercuts the Apple watch it's also
more compact than the 42 millimeter
Apple watch and thinner it's one of the
lightest Fitness smartwatches I've worn
Versa has almost all the Fit Body onic
features - GPS there's heartrate
including an extra spo2 sensor that
could help detect sleep apnea or atrial
fibrillation down the road it can store
music side-loaded from a computer or via
Pandora or Deezer subscription apps it
can be used for swimming with 50 meter
water resistance risk payments are
optional they're only included on a $230
special edition model in the US which
comes with an extra woven band
accessories like silicone woven leather
metal mesh and steel bands cost 30 to
100 Fitbit software updates include more
on wrist information on activity
workouts and heartrate and added women's
health tracking for menstrual cycles and
a family mode that can add kids to your
account speaking of kids fitbit's also
launching another fitness tracker
specifically for kids eaten up called
fitbit ace it's a rebranding of the
Fitbit Alta tracker with added kit
oriented software I'm not sure about the
kit angle but versa looks like a total
blend of Fitbit and pebble to go up
against Apple watch we'll find out soon
enough if it succeeds</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
