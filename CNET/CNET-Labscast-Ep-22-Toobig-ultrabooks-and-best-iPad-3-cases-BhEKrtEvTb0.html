conversation again we were saying that
ultrabooks was a really good idea at
first 13 inch laptops like this guy the
toshiba really thin really light seven
eight hundred maybe nine hundred dollars
but they all have like that 128 gig SSD
and that's that's really cool so if it
looks like a macbook air quacks like a
macbook air but costs less then that's
that that's a good thing the problem is
now that it's become popular they're
taking this Ultrabook name and putting
it on everything that meets you know
Intel's sort of semi secretive
definitions they don't really even real
publicly what all the things you have to
hit to have that ultrabook sticker to be
considered an ultrabook are but they're
moving into 14 inch and even 15 inch
laptop and I'm a little concerned that
i'm going to show you one Dave right now
look at this laptop this is a 14-inch
from Samsung oh I'm was trying well
don't hold it right in front of your
camera hold it a little bit back yeah
there we go so that's a samsung series 5
ultra and it's a 14-inch laptop you know
what it's a relatively slim relatively
lightweight 14-inch laptop it's got a
its got a CD as it's got a DVD drive in
it here take a look at that feel that
yeah it's got actually a regular 500 gig
hard drive in there so it that seems
like a fine 14-inch laptop i think it's
about 850 to 9 50 depending on where you
buy it but nothing about that says
ultrabook today we'll call it laptop
light yes it's a light laptop but does
that look like an ultrabook teams that
was like a macbook air is that one have
an optical drive and now okay so i think
that either does macbook air that should
be the definition to me that's part of
it definitely it's it should be you know
a certain that 20 millimeters is usually
what they say to 2.5 pounds well this is
let's go through what do you guys if you
could define an ultrabook how would you
define it well the problem is it's not
mine to know did a fine let's do it
let's give it a different that's define
it come on well if you were III would
called something different because then
it's not just open only to Intel systems
but i think that the basic things that
we've been working under 20 millimeters
or thinner I don't care about weight so
much because once you get down that then
you got to be a certain weight anyway
solid state hard drive that's key and
obviously a core i3 or Core i5 not
some weird old like pentium dual iron
atom I think it's the most important
factor right but once you get down to 20
millimeters or less is going to be
lightweight no matter what but this guy
here the Samsung again is called an
ultrabook weighs four pounds yeah like
3.96 and was essentially for Pat what is
it retail for it's like eight 59fifty
but it's a very nice thin laptop if she
if you showed this to me last year I'd
go out that's a really thin 14-inch
laptop but you show it to me now and say
it's an ultrabook I go come on really
guys now you're just stretching the
definition because you had a hit so you
have to find everything you can in label
an ultrabook and they're killing the
category now before it even started in
in five months they've killed the
category now by saying well anything is
a 4 pounds hard drive instead of an SSD
optical drive it's an ultrabook it's
crazy not the midget we've seen thinner
laptops from Samsung well sure they have
their own uh they actually had their own
ones that are much more ultrabook like
but don't use the Ultrabook name for a
variety of weird corporate reason that's
a series 9 yes so so so that is my
concern that is my complaint they'll be
story about this obviously later about
how they've oversold this Ultrabook
concept the one hot thing they could
have had they finally had a hit in
computers was last time somebody was
excited about something with computers
well I mean I by the same token I I
don't think people are actually looking
for computers just by the Ultrabook ran
they say oh they walk in a store and
they're all sure they want a thin and
light woke notebook they look for
something that's uh it weighs a certain
amount has certain processor processor
in it and after that that's all that
matters but that was the that was the
key with things like centrino from Intel
you didn't have to worry about the
things you knew if you bought a century
no computer what seven or eight years
ago it had Wi-Fi in it and you could
connect your work network in your home
network he was like a label where you
knew you were getting at least a bare
minimum so they wanted ultrabook to be
the same way if you just go let me see
all your ultrabooks at the store you
knew you were getting something that was
kinda like a macbook air well that's now
sometimes that's not that's not the case
anymore problems they can just walk in
and say what are you I can't I say give
me a back look at what's it would give
me a macbook you know what do you have
version macbook air yeah that that to me
is what what the real Intel seem to
think that you need to invest three
hundred million dollars to develop these
other things instead they should I just
talk to you why they call it window care
ah that's good that's good a week we
call thee we called the dell one the
dell book air the dell XPS 13 ultrabook
those are all very nice so or the or the
air book or the aerbook I'm after Apple
would have objected to that one they
should solve it win slim win so I like
that see in slim we could have saved in
tough 390 dollars right that sounds like
a cigarette break and like Winston slim
or something we know slim well it
filters yes by the way big oh that's my
rant for this week III think they're
taking this Ultrabook Brandon making it
way too wide and killing what what was
actually interesting to people exactly
cuz they had a very rare just like
netbooks were several years ago netbooks
were hit unexpectedly so everyone had to
make all these different netbooks and
they killed the brand same thing here no
they say the ipad killed Brad well that
too but they were already you know
people already fed up with netbooks well
I might have the ipad came well I think
the problem with netbooks was they just
were so underpowered and they didn't
evolve and we're still disappointed with
that that chip they'll be out of ya who
stopped making it they pretty much have
we saw one netbook all this year so far
stop making these poor guys at a sous
cette went over we're just like really
they make a netbook which is an i3 in it
called a day yeah yeah it's called the
HP DM 1v it's about 500 bucks will say I
don't mind I'll sacrifice some battery
life just to get what I need to get done
who needs 12 hours of battery if it
takes like 20 minutes to encode one song
the convert one song from a rip one song
from a CD well that's why they were cool
at first when the network's first came
out and you you we were all working here
when that happened was like because they
were small they perform their 299
they're disposable pretty Pettis is
almost twice my but what was interesting
was that chip was supposed to evolve and
it doesn't really seem to that's correct
the keep putting out new versions but
not any faster and they don't run any
longer so I'm not sure they're a quad
core atom you know they were to do core
atoms but that had no real effect on our
on our benchmark tests at all it just
gave us two windows when you look at me
when you looked at the fast
to give you two windows what are you
doing sorry I should have my little box
here i could put stuff on I have to lean
over and pick it was oh yeah all kinds
of stuff your Davis all kinds of stuff
let's talk about ipad i got an ipad 3
you got one Joey you're still on the two
but I feel the draw I feel you're
getting drawn in I show you that screen
difference you're like not sure I want
it so bad I don't uh huh you can sell
yours back to uh what's a place where
you sell your iPad's I'm not showing in
this week is el ghazal yes no this is
this is gonna be Jordans I bet it's
gonna be my son's all right all right I
mean he has the leappad he prefers this
over is leappad so this okay if I'm
going to 46 if you say so because that
you know what will happen right I'll
have the 4 which will have the retinal
display it'll be even thinner if
planning way ahead of an wait wait
advantage make it thinner they're gonna
make it thinner and I made that pound
and a half thing out of my face all
right all right so so I asked Dave to
bring in some of his favorite ipad 3
cases I have a few examples as well
maybe we can just go back and forth and
you can just tell me like which ones you
think are really oh yeah ma yes I like
that actually yeah you you actually have
a couple there that I also i'm actually
using one of those the one I have on
here right now is the the STM the grip
grip mm-hmm which is very thin I mean
I'm really funding that with the ipad 3
since it got slightly heavier it's
better to go to a thin really think case
the nice thing about this is that it's
thin and it has this little kickstand on
oh I like that so if slipped a doubt let
me see that you're holding up a little
it yeah okay and it's got 22 little
kickstand so you can actually put it
into three different angles or two
different angles and you know in terms
of really thin cases it also feel nice
it's got this like surface like the Stay
I mean then what I don't know how this
is going to hold up over time you know
when you start rubbing stuff it's like
rib yeah I like it but you're tableting
pleasure Dave I don't know i think this
one costs about fifty bucks mm-hmm they
all they all tenant costs that the good
ones tend to cost a little bit more but
there there's also another they also
have something called the skinny which
you have there i see the Kantian but i'm
liking these STM cases i like their
laptop bags make a lot of really good
laptop bag so i got the skinny right
here
that's good that's why I totally had a
version of this for the ipad 2 also
that's got a bad sort of got a fabric
for it dumb Griffin just sent me one
today called the what I like that it
doesn't fold like this but the one thing
i don't like about this particular STM
case is is this moment that goes in
there to me that's how you stand it up
that's how you know i'm just saying i
don't like it yeah i don't like having
to worry about this thing or have it
flattened out and around I agree thank
you Dave I mean no problem this is
another was another slim case from a
Griffin okay Griffin called the in
telekis which I've literally just I
still have a plan to be on it but it's
also a very thin case this one it sort
of looks like an apple sorry I'm moving
away from the mic but it looks like an
apple smart cover oh yeah totally um and
then it tucks in behind it's got this
little Ridge here on the back mm-hmm um
one thing I'm curious about that's
interesting he actually hinges that yeah
that seems a little it does over time
with that turn white and just break off
I feel like it might the way Joey
handles things I think da hah right
right I handle it ruff Ruffman oh you
know a lot of case makers actually
didn't have to do anything to their case
the case is still fit yeah anything with
a little bit of plane at this for
instance is the is I skins or a case
which they simply rename the aura to but
didn't actually change anything about
its the or two for the ipad sorry but
yes that's not confusing you know but it
well because it is confusing is not even
the ipad 3 it's the new ipad so
everything is confusing now and this one
dan I know I know he has the UH it's
funny you mention that is this the way
now another you guys he's got the pad
and Krait and the other guys is actually
this is actually case for the kindle
fire but it is from DODOcase yeah they
make really nice ones do dodocase they
have one a new one that's just about to
come out for the the ipad 3 they had to
just the Justice eyes a little bit so
they haven't sent me one yet but it
looks like the Bible it's got a bamboo
energy and it was carved by Sir Francis
and and the other the other company is
uh pad and quill right and I got that
one right here here just look look like
over to me here and that one's made in
so this is the ipad 2
pad and quill case that I actually try
the ipad feet 3 fit right in it and they
have some new ones coming out as well
that are actually thinner yeah more
leathery so that's exactly what you said
since it's bigger and heavier you want a
thinner case but I tried it in here and
it was fine you open it up and again you
kind of gravity sort of holds it in here
uh and that's pad and quill that there
and I your family I a nice family
business entity they make iphone cases
ipad cases kindle cases and they're all
sort of hand machined and really nice
i've used this one for my ipad 2
extensively and i try the three in it
you know the case is kind of heavy so
combined with the heavier ipad 3 i felt
the whole thing was getting a little
heavy so I'm looking forward to checking
out the ipad 3 stuff they have coming
out in the meantime though I I tried out
because I wanted something that was
really lightweight just like you said
one of these targets cases this is the
targets slim I think everyone has a case
called the slim and they have a couple
ones and I think it's pretty cool it's
got this weird cutout in the back that
we all better than it was it's better
than uh uh gays got the blue version
yeah a little cutout in the back for the
logo yeah we couldn't get dance ipad3 to
fit I doubt this one that was the
pre-release mock-up version they say oh
my my but his didn't mind my to fit my
tool fit and kinda you know goes like
this it's got the magnetic thing in it
and it opens up to you can go like this
so it stays up at an angle but it's not
as flexible as uh some of the other ones
we see is just based like one angle like
this oh yeah too and like this yeah you
guys gotta do you gotta put your iPad's
in them and you gotta do though the
weight you gotta put them in there with
the ipad and weigh them all suppose I
this one's a Senate kind of or Joseph
you could just know what the ipad ways
and then just way the cases and anthem
together well just put the total hbu one
another total man it's give the total
that STM company is an Australian
company okay this is another Australian
company called signet who okay that
looks cool so it's a pretty
straightforward folio case they have a
few different versions of this name
different things but it you know folds
up and look at Dan now that that runs a
fallible my personal ipad case pet
peeves open that up again Dave I don't
like the little like border the leather
border with a fabric or whatever border
that goes around the outside of your
your tab
or your phone I just personally don't
like that look that is one of my lap
that's one of my tablet case things that
I just don't like how you feel about it
but yeah I mean I i like i like more
form-fitting ones but i like the entire
screen to be sort of exposed and this is
why this is a this is the odd new oh
yeah so if you're going you know
spelunker with your tablet what the heck
is the otterbox that's the dark knight
case ah it's actually they actually made
it slightly this is the defender series
case yeah it's got actually a protective
built-in cover right in there mm-hmm
they claim to have made it actually a
little bit smaller than the previous
model because these guys are really
bulky these kinds right but it comes
with a waterproof no but it comes with
this it actually comes with this thing
that that goes over the top of the cage
to protect the screen and also has a
built-in stand inside so that's what
that's way to make a stand out of it but
they have a couple these you know sort
of more for like you know the military
if you're out and you know action guys
Afghanistan or Iraq then or you let your
your child use it yeah well there was
one case it was kind of made of a
rubbery sort of cell material that you
suppose people like throw off a building
or drop a bowling ball on that's what it
was no that a bowling ball on yes yes it
was that I figure that was now yes or no
but that was more of a sleeve yeah yeah
yeah that was asleep this one I they
actually resent me this one it's from
zero chroma it's actually it's designed
to be to work with the smart cover and a
lot of the back covers for the smart
they're supposed to be used with the
smart cover don't have a stand on the
back but this one actually has standard
swivels and so you can prop your iPad up
in a vertical or horizontal position
okay so that's just a back cover for the
it's supposed to go with a smart cover
but are any of these better than the
Apple smart cover which is brilliant in
its sort of simplicity I know Joe you're
a big fan of the Smart Cover I just got
to protect the screen when I drop it in
my bag that's it I like the fact that
you need for like a different kind of
case like the ones were showing off here
or you like a smart cover
I honestly think the smart cover should
be included the day my bad okay that
that's a good point but did you ever get
like a net like a third-party case I've
my car I've got a spec I've got I've got
a couple lingering I don't I don't this
may sound crazy to some people because
everybody buys their iOS device to sell
it I actually bought it to touch it and
use it and i spent seven hundred dollars
on this thing and i'm not touching it
through no damn glass bottle mm-hmm i'm
judging my ipad look at me the whole
time you're talk I don't mind I don't
know buddy reading my lips babe yeah but
actually i purchased it to touch it i
think one of the most elegant things the
nicest things about an iOS device is the
way it looks and feels and I think it
just crazy that when you go out you
spend X amount of money to buy you never
get to cover it up well here's an ear
that silly trip this is my iphone
exactly doesn't get a touch it but it if
this is the lifeproof case and it is
totally waterproof and drop a friend of
mine just bought that yeah she was going
to the Bahamas yeah so you know the
snorkeling skiing anything in water
anything your kids I can hand this to my
kid not have to worry about it so I mean
that there is that's the point of it if
you could say the same thing Joseph is
there any case strong enough that would
protect your iDevice from there's
nothing I've dropped it identity ready
I've got a little dent on where is it
sup it's right here right there at the
edge oh wow you can see it right that's
what happens that's life such as life
you get you break it you fix it that's
all at least I could say I touched it I
used it I hate to get like very intimate
but I never mind I won't do it well but
will get banned if I go that route but
anyway okay it matters you're a banjo my
and Jojo is actually more of an android
guy it should be is that is that true
would you would you call yourself an
Android even my phone is beautiful I'll
show you my phone my phone is just a
hard-living guy I've dropped this thing
got a little on the edge right here
that's seems fine to me you know I like
my devices to get used I gave him a case
for that too yes are using the candy
gave me one I used it and then I took it
out because I prefer to keep it on my
hip that's true sometimes with my old
iphone 3 I like just having the phone
before though I keep that I keep that
covered up here I'll show you one more
case here just don't get it is another
targets one is the view scape and took
them all to figure out how to actually
use this so
thicker but it has one thing I really
like which is because I use it in the
landscape mode a lot um where it's got
two levels of tilts and go here or you
can go here so so the the pen and quill
case alex is pad and quill case I like
the same way so for me that's a key the
multiple angles right so when the just
make an ipad case with a cup hold its
ridiculous or yeah I mean Jesus hey I
did they have an iPad holder for
strollers now I saw that it's all
getting ridiculous I mean sure it should
be it should be mentioned so I have this
some best ipad 3 cases roundup up if you
just keep best ipad 3 cases into google
you'll find it and there's actually i
think i have about 35 cases on there
some of some aren't out quite yet i love
the cases manufacturers had to just
slightly adjusted ways to see I've had
also there was a measure there's also
been this weird issue with the magnets
in some of the third-party cases where
they don't work they worked with the
ipad 2 but they don't necessarily work
with the ipad 3 they apparently Apple
change the polarity of the magnets in
the did they do that on purpose of
course they did course they did you know
they did we all know they did I I think
there must have been some sort of
adjustment they they didn't feel is
quite good enough I'm not sure there's
some just working some down right we had
some here in the office of early samples
for instance from belkin the case worked
with it worked with an ipad 2 it did not
work with to Wi-Fi only ipad 3 this is
we're talking about the smart on/off
feature right and but it did work with
the Verizon 4G version of the ipad 3 so
it was a very mysterious situation that
you know I going on there under this
under the surface yeah so some some some
case manufacturers are now have some of
their early cases that shipped some of
them are coming back that some of the
people have to return them because that
that that automatic on/off feature isn't
working okay okay somebody in the chat
room asks if it is the ipad
wall-mountable and if you go back and
search in these cnet archives you'll
find my cnet a story about the ipad one
where I wall-mounted it I think I built
my own wall mount and put
up in my office and they took some
pictures wrote a story about that is off
you can put up with velcro no they will
have la they have wall mounts now but
when the eye when it first came out I i
went and invented my own wall mount and
you can find that story say it kitchen
mounts there K stands a very you know
what am I got big magnet thing you
prefer do I don't I have nice one is a
standard that you actually put a little
piece of metal ring on the back you
stick it onto the back of the ipad and
then there's this magnet that like a
ball okay and you can swivel you I like
that so they did you know it's X they're
actually kind of expensive they're over
our dollars fell and I left if you want
to keep your iPad in the kitchen just
put in a ziplock back that ambassador
regret that's good i got one more thing
I'll secret old secret tip wanna show
you guys as we wrap up our show for
today we were talking about draw
something before the existing product
completely popular um iPad and now
android and iphone game where it's like
pictionary where you get pictures and
you draw them here I'll show you a
little tiny bit there's the game let's
see now if I got a picture from somebody
let's see if there again somebody from
there's a plan no not playing right now
since i'm watching a friend of mine draw
a picture and I have to guess what were
this is basically looks like a hand
dinosaur pointing at something key uh it
could be let's see p I and KY I got it
now you got it I got it okay you got it
just thank you so so I won that so I
started right away no matter how great
the ipad is with your finger on the
screen you're not really drawn anything
that that fantastic you have to draw a
camel a field or read at all I'll draw a
camel the tap to draw okay so you take
your finger you drawn here I'm cheating
now I went out and I got this it's an
ipad stylus little rubber tip is about
12 bucks at best buy this week and i
just saw it was an impulse buy what
could I think this I'm sure you have a
got drop on them and somebody on cnet
row after the show rota how to make your
own stylist story i think i'll buy
forget exactly how Donald L did I think
it's so sunny dead so to share anything
so i'm gonna slip right here I want to
cam with two of you can see this and if
they're watching the show they already
know what it is
River you're playing well good thing
we're playing live and they'll to watch
the tape later okay I'm or maybe they're
watching let's see what the camel look
like let's let's try one number two
homes I want to humps and it'll just
don't draw a thermometer I'll never let
you live that oh man too funny as a
really sad looking a cow looks more like
a promise or here we go can you erase
and start over you can you know what I'd
put like a cactus league maybe think
desert uh I'm not sure there any
cactuses in the desert with camels I
just an but I would just do it to get
because I it looks like that's hot look
at that tail it looks like now it looks
like a dog with a tumor I'm gonna draw
hang on hang tunes can draw some
lawrence of arabia in the background

trying to draw some pyramids in the
background i didn't work out draw your
seven veil dance I'm gonna race this
pyramid and and draw it again hang on
one sec with my stylist that's not
helping my artistic skills at all
mmm-hmm okay we could put a Sun up in
the sky with the Sun up there well I
like that I'm gonna do that okay I got a
bigger period pyramid now there's my
finger pyramid oh that's good looking
for the Sun up here I had a color the
Sun yellow okay here we go this is my
drawing for camel oh but imagine how
terrible this would be without uh
without the stock descendant we have
think Joe Camel though I don't know is
using a stylus and draw something
cheating you guys tell me though okay
you don't know Joseph I didn't hear the
question I'm sorry is using a stylus
cheating in this game uh not Allah
cheating okay you have it you have
fantastic I'll I mean obviously from the

cold oh sure like that
all right well anyway that's my that's
my tip of the week possibly my first and
last tip of the week then since the
rumor had it and it actually was a tip
it was a tip and I use the tip of my
house to drop there you go uh so you
guys probably heard by now that they're
getting rid of all of the cnet live
shows sorry for no starting all the same
time we're actually the best obviously
the best weekly show I'll just um
they're gonna keep the four for every
day but that's it they're gonna redo all
this stuff as on-demand programming
which actually makes more sense because
that's all point of the internet you
want stuff when you want to watch it
yeah appointment base viewing is very
old-school very television I actually
agree with that but honest I'm gonna
miss my i will miss getting together
with you guys every week i think we're
gonna show next week that might be a big
farewell show but then we'll come back
and do some of these on demand shows
which will be different uh but still
have the same vibe the same fun people
and maybe we'll get we'll get to do what
we always wanted to do Joe which was
take cameras into the lab and shoots
down I'm gonna miss interactive my boys
Harry Michael they can all Jamie with us

which we will continue to maintain and
put up videos and stuff Henry psych who
just came to new york henry give right

you interacting his best part but we're
gonna keep the facebook page going and
we're gonna post their own videos up
