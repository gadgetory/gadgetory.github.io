welcome to the Apple by for all the good
bad inside the world of Apple now i just
finished learning how to sew a pillow
today so let's get to the show there are
a whole bunch story so let's start off
with the latest i watch rumors bloomberg
reports that the rumored iWatch could
end up launching this year and according
to their source some of the features
under consideration include letting
users make calls see the identity of
incoming callers and check map
Coordinates it could also house a
pedometer for counting steps and monitor
other health related data with
biosensors like some of the patents we
talked about a few weeks ago now no one
has still confirmed if it will be able
to tell time the bloomberg report adds
the watch market is a lot more lucrative
because of its margins that are four
times greater compared to the TV
business now the verge also chimed in
with i watch rumors saying that apple's
planning for the watch to run a full
version of iOS instead of a simpler OS
like the one we saw on the ipod nano
they say Apple has reworked the fool i
OS to run on the watch but prototypes
are seen subpar battery life going for
only a couple of days instead of the
targeted goal of four to five days
between charges now also nick hayek the
CEO for swiss watchmaker swatch had his
own thoughts on the apple watch at
swatches recent press conference for
their annual results he said personally
i don't believe it's the next revolution
replacing an iphone with an interactive
terminal on your wrist is difficult you
can't have an immense display you know
he's absolutely right see it really is
difficult and only a few companies in
the world could pull it off like samsung
google oh yeah an apple and no one said
they were trying to replace an iphone
with a watch mr. haic denial is not just
a river in egypt now you almost have a
feeling Apple is making their I watch
their top priority right now especially
with media content deals slowing down
the Apple TV so we'll keep you posted
and this is definitely something worth
watching an iphone rumors rumors site
I'm or says that Apple is currently
planning the iphone 5s release for
sometime in August and next gen ipad 5
and iPad Mini tues may debut as soon as
April now their sources say the 5s does
indeed have the same basic design with a
more advanced processor and improved
camera but the Cupertino kids have to do
much more than that Samsung is revealing
their galaxy s4 on March the 14th and
we're expecting big things even a
revamped iOS under jony ive's direction
will not be enough and they have to
bring more than that in the 5s or the
iphone 6 or whatever it's going to be
called and Mac Pro fans I know you're
out there in a report from bright side
of news they say Apple may be developing
a two terabyte solid-state drive for
their next Mac Pro release now the form
factors they saw used industry standard
three and a half inch size drives with a
SATA connection if the new mac pro's
have the same amount of bays for hard
drives that they do now they can
potentially stuff aight terabytes of
solid-state storage now we know the new
macros are still expected sometime this
year alright guys to the quick bites
Google Maps gets its first iOS update
since its launch including integration
with your google contacts not Apple
contacts but Google ones and also a
quick search for local places by
category like restaurants bars and
hotels and if you like fast cars and if
your love with the new laferrari
unveiled at the geneva motor show this
past week Ferrari and Apple are in talks
to expand their partnership with in-car
entertainment they wouldn't get into
details but their FF coupe four-seater
will incorporate a pair of ipad minis
into the seats for the use of their rear
passengers and direct access to their
infotainment system with Siri voice
