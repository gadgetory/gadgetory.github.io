showroom
hey I'm Donnell bell for cnet.com today
we are unboxing the Apple iPad air one
of the hottest tablets of the year let's
open this guy up fresh iPad smell and
look at this pops right out
holder is there to hold it in place
a little receipt now look at that that's
the iPad air kind of a typical iPad box
here wrapped up in cellophane tear that
off all right here we go the real reveal
there it is the iPad air still the same
size and dimensions here as any other
iPad but much thinner much lighter it's
just a pound it's wrapped in another
little layer of plastic here looks like
we got the Space Gray version nice
dapper and look at that aside see what
else is in the box
we have got the package here with their
kind of instructions your Apple stickers
what have you also this is interesting
this is actually something I'm used to
sing in the iPhones it's a little SIM
card remover you can poke it on the side
of the iPad if you ever need to switch
out the micro SIM card that's included
here neat detail it's also a lightning
cable for lightning the USB cable so
your charging cable is also your syncing
cable if you're gonna move anything from
your computer onto the iPad good to have
and if you're gonna charge it you're
gonna want this this is the charging
brick for the iPad it's got a USB cable
on here you can easily switch out the
actual charging connection here if
you're traveling overseas so that's it
that's the entire contents of the box of
the Apple iPad air one thing you'll
notice that's not in here our headphones
so if you're buying this for someone you
might want to chip in for the headphones
too all right so let's boot this baby up
iPad air turning it on there you go
pretty quick to boot up one thing you'll
notice here this is the lightning cable
connection instead of the 30-pin
connection of the iPad 1 &amp;amp; 2 you've got
your volume buttons your lock switch
you'll also notice here we've got the
cellular data version here which is
about $130 extra to get that but it can
be able to use this even when you don't
have a Wi-Fi network around works on
every major carrier here depending on
which one you sign up with pricing
starts at $499 for the 16 gigabyte
version but you can pay more for more
storage going all the way up to 128 gigs
again that cellular data option is going
to be an extra 130 dollars and the
headphones depending on you know how
much you want to pay could be anywhere
between ten to fifty so there you go
that's the Apple iPad air a much thinner
much lighter much faster version of the
iPad than we've ever seen a great
upgrade for anyone who's coming from an
iPad one or iPad 2</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
