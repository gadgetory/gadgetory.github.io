word exoskeleton suddenly brings to mind
things from science fiction in the
movies like Doctor Octopus Ironman
things to give you superhuman strength
and superpowers well the reality is not
quite there yet but I'm here at a
company called suit X and they are
making an exoskeleton with three
different components for the shoulders
back and legs to give people like me
with normal amounts of strength pretty
intense strength indeed so let's go
inside see what it does and I'm gonna
try it out
exoskeletons are being used in factories
to help prevent workers from getting
injured and it only helps you when
you're in a high-risk posture like
lifting a heavy box or installing screws
overhead the suit xmax is modular with
three components to protect the
shoulders back and legs each piece cost
between four to six thousand dollars so
how much improved performance or less
strain on the body can you achieve by
wearing one of these components like can
you quantify that yeah for four back
acts we've been able to reduce back
muscle activations when you're lifting a
load by about 66% for our shoulder X you
can reduce the significantly we're using
a 5-2 pound or a 10 pound tool and then
four legs we actually have a setting
that allows you to lock the leg so
you're maintaining basically a chair and
so in that case it's like sitting on a
chair you don't really yeah you know you
don't you don't expend any effort at all
so I can see in a chair position without
feeling like I'm using any of my energy
and I could stay there for like how long
forever I've used it all I've used it
during an eight-hour day yeah it's it's
you can maintain that position for as
long as you like so how are these
powered the actual mechanism for
generating power is all passive so it's
a really clever arrangement of Springs
however the leg has a very small
computer in it that basically tells it
when to turn on and turn off but all the
other devices are purely mechanical if I
put all of them on all together am I
gonna feel like I'm literally like
walking in an Ironman suit the weight of
the device is around 27 done everything
put together comes in probably around 20
pounds however when you're wearing the
legs all that weight gets transferred to
the ground through the legs okay let's
go suit up but stop I put on the back X
it's gonna help me lift heavy weights
like boxes
okay so now you're in that's the device
it's it's pretty lightweight you
shouldn't feel like it's in any way it's
comfortable and then so when you bend
down you know nothing nothing's
happening yeah that's all nothing's
happening you come back up the two
switches down on the back and then when
you bend forward you'll feel it
supporting yeah Wow
if you'd like to lift just kind of do it
with and without the suit how heavy is
this this is probably about 20 pounds
okay so something I would probably
struggle with normally oh maybe I'm it's
a weight that's pretty common in
packaging and warehouses all right
switches are off proof this is just my
normal strength and the knees yeah I
mean I can lift it but switches going on
and then go ahead and try to give you
notice that I'll kind of pull your foot
like that would be Thea 20 pounds is
easy so I take it up a notch and try 50
pounds no go ahead and push the push it
down alright it's like supporting Riya
the check this is crazy like I know I'm
lifting it but it's not that heavy it
feels like the 20 pound box we don't we
don't necessarily recommend lifting like
a hundred pounds you recommend lifting
the same amount of load that you would
normally do but with the suit you'll no
defense a lot like it feels like a lot
next is the shoulder X it supports your
arms while working overhead or anything
that involves you having your arms up
like using a drill I'm locked in and
ready to try installing some screws on a
wall so if you bring your arms down
completely to the side you'll notice
that there's no support right now it's
not helping you but once you bring your
arms up to overhead position you'll
notice that it it's actually providing a
support
yeah I like I'm not doing anything
animal my muscles it's not working at
all like they just just hanging out it
feels really light all right Oh feels
like nothing I could do this all day I
see what you're doing you're trying to
put me to work to fix everything in here
you didn't need to put that board up
last but not least is leg X that helps
you maintain your position Vinc
jackhammering and you're on the right
track turn go ahead go ahead and turn
the device on all right there's two
buttons here two buttons right there no
it's blue so now you can go ahead and
walk around you'll note that it's not
going to turn on it's not gonna impede
you in any way
yep no but when you squat it'll provide
you a spring support all right oh it is
a string so I have to balance myself
right I'm not gonna order balance me
right the balance is still on you but
you will feel that your quads won't be
working in I mean I'm just jumping
it doesn't make you jump haha but it's
very easy and it takes a little strain
off another mode here which is called
chair mode which is basically where it's
gonna lock out your knee joint and so
you can just basically sit on the device
kind of like a chair okay
there we go I hit I hit the floor yep
it's very comfortable mm-hmm yeah so
easy okay it makes this look easy my
body can't do this without this so now
I've tried all of the three components
separately it's time to suit up and put
all of them on at the same time but
funnily enough we found another use for
shoulder X our cameraman John is using
it as kind of a makeshift stabilizer
slash Steadicam it looks pretty
comfortable it's taken the weight out of
his arm I think we should get one for
you oh yeah here we go just kidding I
don't actually walk like that I walk
totally normally it's completely fine
it's not restricting my movement I can
feel it and I look arms up like my arms
are floating I wanna crouch down
Springs me back up again but everything
on this is so cool
shame mode activated I feel like I'm in
Titanic you know the same for I'm like
at the front when Leo and Kate Winslet
or at the front of Titanic
the exoskeleton is not designed to
impinge on movement so you can do just
about anything you normally would like
driving riding a bike or even running on
a treadmill unfortunately though it's
not helping me walk any faster so I
don't know why you try running in an
exoskeleton but the point is you can do
it I'm going to show you how this is
brisk walking speed 3 miles an hour
basta far enough off miles an hour ok
the pasta 5 miles an hour I got this I
can be back in 1 alright I've got my 10
calories in now bring it back down
so wearing all three components of the
suit xmax the leg X the shoulder X and
the back X I kind of feel superhuman and
I don't want to take them off thanks so
much for watching make sure to ring the
bell and subscribe and like this video
I'll let me know what you'd like me to
test out next thanks for watching too
easy I could do this all day and I want
to do this all day but my body could do
it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
