I was excited about what it could do as
a budget phone and half the price of a
mid Ranger this one still manages to
have good things like an all-metal build
a fast and accurate fingerprint reader
and two cameras on the back two cameras
are something that even the Samsung
Galaxy s8 doesn't have so this is a bit
of a feather in huawei's cap why are
they there to help add depth to your
photos one's got a 12 megapixel lens and
the other a 2 megapixel lens there's a
mode that you can go into to give you
more control over the depth of field and
that's an advanced feature you just
don't see in budget handsets at all
there are also pro photo and video modes
on here some really neat editing tools
an 8 megapixel front-facing camera for
those grooming selfies but here's the
thing
although the honor 6x has way more photo
tools the motorola moto G 5 plus takes
cleaner clearer photos all around
in fact it's simply the better phone all
around the honor 6 X was less
comfortable to hold a muse battery
didn't last as long it isn't splash
proof it runs an older version of
Android it won't let you make mobile
payments and although it's got a faster
processor on benchmark tests it
sometimes lagged both of these phones
have microSD card support for up to 128
gigabytes but the Moto G 5 plus has an
option with more storage for a little
bit more money here's the thing you
can't buy the Moto G 5 plus everywhere
and that cuts the honor 6x a break
because the phones benefits even out and
you match it up to the Moto G 5 neither
of those phones has NFC for mobile
payments and the honor 6x has those
abundant camera tools and a larger
screen for those who prefer room to roam
so while the honors 6x camera tech is
definitely on the right track the phone
just doesn't have what it takes
compared to the budget King</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
