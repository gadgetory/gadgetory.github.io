the apple pie for all the good and bad
inside the world of Apple now we're
doing giveaways and exclusive promos
every show for the holidays through
December because you know what we're the
gift that keeps on giving so let's get
to the show and the latest rumor report
from the commercial times based in China
claims that Apple will begin trial
production of the iphone 5s as early as
december am I the only one that just
threw up in my mouth now the paper says
the iphone 5s if there even is one could
enter volume production in the 1st
quarter of 2013 and be set to launch
earlier than expected take what you want
from this but there's no need to rush on
Apple side look for fall 2013 to be the
time frame unless they pull an ipad 4
thing on us like they did but with the
iphone then yeah i might get a little
crake right just like that now in more
iphone news a recently released report
says that text messaging in the u.s.
dropped for the first time in years
thanks to apples iMessage and other data
based messaging apps text messages for
an individual in the third quarter drop
from 696 texts per month to 678 now that
might seem like a small number but SMS
messaging has seen continuous growth
every year up to this point now most of
my messaging happens after 11pm you know
what I'm saying okay well Apple was
awarded a few patents recently for that
page training animation in iBooks that
some of you still can't stop doing over
and over and their iPad Smart Case that
uses magnetic sensors to turn the screen
on and off and in great news the big a
published a joint statement with HTC
announcing they have settled their
patent dispute and agreed to a broad
tenure licensing agreement between the
two companies proving that yes enemies
can end up being friends but not all of
them Samsung Shin Jung Hyun who heads
their mobile and IT division was quoted
was saying it may be true that HTC may
have agreed to pay 300 billion 12 Apple
but we don't intend to negotiate
all ok fine not everyone can be friends
but hey guys have you been looking for
the next evolution of headphones and
some really cool future stuff a patent
filing recently revealed Apple has
invented the next-gen dual-mode
headphone design that can be operated in
two modes now the first mode would be
your normal everyday headphone design
with sound specifically targeting your
ears but the second mode would allow you
to rotate them out 90 degrees rest them
on a table and put them in true speaker
mode with a full amplifier so the music
could fill a room in a social setting
how sweet would that be very sweet let's
just hope you don't pick them up to use
while they're a masseuse to promote now
to make sure you won't with a sensor but
this is a really cool concept an idea
that I'd love to see all right let's
take a quick break for our App of the
Week with editor extraordinaire jason
parker hey everybody welcome to tap that
app i'm jason parker and this is the
show where we check out the hottest apps
in the mobile space Angry Birds Star
Wars is finally here just like the other
angry birds games you're presented with
a level where you'll need to destroy all
the pigs but these Imperial Pig troopers
have new tricks up their sleeves
including blasters you'll need to avoid
as you progress through the levels
you'll unlock new Star Wars birds like
the obi-wan Kenobi bird that uses a
force push to knock down objects and
take out pig troopers your birds level
up as you play too so the original loop
bird you get in the beginning well later
earn a lightsaber that you can use to
take out objects in your way of course
if you fail to finish the level you'll
get a glimpse of a pig Darth Vader
continue to try again there are more
than 80 levels to explore including
hidden levels you can unlock by getting
a specific number of stars an early
bonus level I played let me use c-3po
and r2d2 birds to take out pig troopers
in space using the droids own special
abilities if you get 30 stars you'll
also unlock the mighty falcon which you
can use on particularly hard levels to
blow away all the pigs at once
