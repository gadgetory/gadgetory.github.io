today I have with me phil molyneux
president and coo of sony electronics
today Sony hosted an event in New York
to show some of its new products that
has recently announced so Phil maybe to
start cause you kind of talked us about
what recent announcements we've seen
from Sony you know what you guys are
showing that it is your pleasure and
actually what we've done today is showed
a wide range of new products that we're
bringing to market some of them we
showed up the consumer electronics show
in january so right behind us is a great
example this is our new 55 inch and
65-inch 4k ultra high-definition TV and
just to put that into context with these
products can give you a visual display
that is four times the resolution of
Full HD for consumer I think a normal
average consumer who would look at this
you know would say the picture is
beautiful but I think it's hard to
differentiate between normal HD so what
are you guys doing to kind of show the
benefits of 4k and make sure people know
you know why why should you spend you
know thousands of dollars on this where
you can buy regular yeah of course our
marketing campaign will be coming in
shortly as we bring these products to
market and then I'll consumer messaging
our messages to our consumers will make
it clear on what is the benefit so
brighter colors
I have followed to a feature in a
real-life pitcher policy that they can
experience at home better audio output
but I think the real key for the
consumer will be when you go to retail
and you see Sony's 4k Ultra
high-definition TVs and you compare it
to HD you just go I want that that
that's already history right along with
you know some of the hurdles you know
people not necessarily tell me the
difference I think content is clearly a
big issue for 4k you guys had talked
about this you know new video offering
that you know that you're planning to
roll out this summer rose are there any
more details you can give us about that
or explain a little more you know how
that's gonna work yeah let me give you a
bit more of a flavor on the content side
so we have a very complex processor that
are brilliant engineers of develop and
what it enables the TV to be able to do
is you can take broadcast content feed
into the TV Internet content because
it's connected TV or blu-ray one of the
seven thousand bits that i mentioned we
read this and it will upscale it in
other words improve the picture quality
dramatically so the contents over there
but we can make it better
and then the native content 4k content
which is now starting to proliferate
there are many movies have been shot in
4k native content in Hollywood today
we're also remastering content as we did
for our 84-inch to being so last week or
you know recently you guys had your
another you know major announcement for
sony doesn't directly fall under you but
i think it's pretty relevant to what
your what you ever see and that was the
PlayStation 4 yeah so I think one of the
one of the criticisms or you know I
think one thing people were surprised
about there weren't as many details
there was no actual hardware shown you
know was that deliberate is this not
ready yet you're just not ready to show
it you know what what's color I think
you know which like Pride and when we
show a product that it's fully
functional so you know we're time off to
the product launch itself and we want to
show the consumers the best right out
the gate that's important so you know we
bring the TV's today these are you know
pre-production samples but they're
stunning and they were to the level that
we want them to work but we need them to
work for consumers so we show them today
so we you know it give us a little bit
of time we won't disappoint okay great
well thank you fo my pleasure thanks a
lot it's up
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
