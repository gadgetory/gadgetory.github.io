2015 in Barcelona and right now we're
checking out the MHz which is being
billed as a 5 in 1 health monitor now
right away this isn't a medical device
it has to go through the FDA it senses
consumer use only meaning it's not
intended to treat or diagnose any
medical syndromes or issues so it does
have five different functions the first
one is that it can read your temperature
and to do that you take the device put
it right on your forehead start the
temperature reading in a few seconds
you'll know what your temperature is the
next one is that it's also an ECG so it
has three different sensors to do this
you put your thumb here your finger here
and your other thumb on the edge of the
device and it'll give you an ECG reading
now of course we haven't tested this
against an actual ECG machine at the
doctor's office and we don't know how
accurate it is
however MD does say that it has a 95
percent accuracy the device can also
track your blood oxygen levels and the
MD can also read your blood pressure to
do that you snap it right into the strap
hit the start button and if you are in
the right seated position right now I'm
not in a few minutes you would have your
blood pressure and your heart rate this
device will be available in may however
we don't know exactly where the company
is working on getting this distributed
as far as
tours around the US and worldwide but
when it does become available
