gaming has become a surprising theme of
this show and razors here showing off a
final development of something that we'd
seen a bit of last year in something
called Project Fiona this is a Windows 8
gaming tablet called the razor edge it
has a 10 inch screen it has nvidia
geforce 640 m le graphics and it starts
as low as 999 it's going to be available
starting q1 of this year what's really
interesting about this is not just that
as the gaming punch but the fact this
has a wide variety of connected
peripherals you've got a gamepad that's
available in a bundle up to 14 99 for
this edition which has you know really
console like controllers here and analog
pads and feels like a handheld you've
also got a future forthcoming keyboard
peripheral and now the razor edge is not
just a gaming tablet it's really being
looked at as a connected console and the
dock connection accessory makes it so
you can connect it to your TV output to
resolutions up to 720p and it's got hdmi
and connects up to two controllers so
you can play splitscreen gaming in your
home or even use it to stream movies to
your TV a really versatile device plus
there's an extended battery pack if you
want it all sorts of different gaming
modes now this show you're definitely
looking at stuff that's beginning to
look at where the future of gaming lies
what's nice about the razor edge is it's
ready to go right now with PC gaming
really all of these modes don't require
any sort of future SDKs or future
developments it's a it's a ready to go
tablet and it's really not priced all
that high compared to what you'd expect
for a device that's crowdsourcing is
kind of almost an experimental device
I'm Scott Steiner tha's a look at the
razor edge gaming tablet at CES 2013 so
I rich brown I'm here talking about the
pc gaming aspects of the razor edge now
you can see from the set up here looks a
lot like a desktop setup there's a
keyboard mouse the screen is maybe a
little smaller than you might be used to
in a traditional desktop arrangement but
you can always output this system to a
higher resolution it'll go all the way
up to 1920 x 1080 another thing you have
to really worry about is that the higher
the resolution the lower potentially the
performance the razor did let us look at
the options for dishonored and it's set
up at 13 by 7 on the screen that's a
native resolution but it really looks
great it plays smooth if you were to go
bigger I don't think it would suffer
that much of a performance hit so this
is definitely tableau
a bunch of different ways you can use it
what's pretty encouraging for PC gamers
is that you can in fact use this as a
desktop PC it'll take a little getting
used to probably but it's really not a
bad setup so Irish brown that was
Scott's done we're here at CES and this
is the razor edge</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
