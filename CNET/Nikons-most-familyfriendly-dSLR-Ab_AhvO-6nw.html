really stand out from its specialized
competition Canon t4i has a video
optimized AF system the Pentax K 30 has
weather resistance and Sony has its PD
models with built-in geo-tagging but in
practice the d50 200 more than succeeds
as a general-purpose model for family
and vacation photography since it's
based on essentially the same body as
the d50 100 the d50 200 retains that
models streamlined shooting experience
it feels a little plasticky but not
flimsy and it's lighter than most of the
cameras in its class the control layout
mode dial and interface are pretty
standard and there's one programmable
function button and no ability to save
custom settings that's par for the
course though I prefer the record button
on the back instead of on the top I like
the cameras live view switch operation
and placement more than most the
viewfinder which Nikon updated over the
D 5100 stands out though it is the same
size and magnification as before the
autofocus area displays are bigger and
brighter and it supports a grid overlay
I find that it makes a huge difference
over the tiny AF points that most
consumer DSLR support the feature set
hasn't changed from the D 5100 and
retains its uncommon options such as the
night vision scene mode time lapse and
intervalometer if you're looking for
modern options like Wi-Fi or GPS go
optional or go elsewhere photo and video
quality were great on the D 5100 and
they're just as good on the D 5200 the
big change is in performance nikon
really improved the autofocus speed and
it feels quite a bit zippier and much
better for continuous shooting if you
don't mind the slower performance the
d50 100 millions a fine option
especially with a street price of a
couple hundred dollars less than a d50
200 but the d50 200 delivers a
noticeably better shooting experience
that makes it an excellent choice for a
sub $1,000 DSLR I'm Laurie groanin and
this is the nikon d50 200
