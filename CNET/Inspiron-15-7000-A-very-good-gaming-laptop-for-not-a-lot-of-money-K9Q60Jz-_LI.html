without feeling like you're playing a
stuttery slideshow but you don't really
have a lot of cash well there's good
news it can be done but the question is
just how many corners are you willing to
cut Dell says you can get a great gaming
experience for as little $7.99 in this
new blaring red Inspiron 15 7000 by
putting pretty much all the money into a
new Nvidia 1050 graphics card and
skimping on the CPU display another
features and it's true the Nvidia 1050
is a great budget graphics card and the
1050 Ti and this $8.99 step-up model is
even better even very new games like
Battlefield 1 or for honor play great a
full HD resolution and a high detail
settings but that doesn't mean this is
an automatic buy first the screen just
doesn't look great it's washed out and
it has terrible off-axis viewing angles
if you move your head just a little bit
the touchpad feels cheap so you'll
probably want to just plug in a mouse
most of the time and the smallish hard
drive really only has room for maybe 4
full-size games at a time for a longer
term investment I suggest spending a bit
more in getting a better processor
better display and bigger hard drive but
you're looking at maybe another $400 to
do that if you can't break that thousand
dollar barrier this is a lot of gaming
laptop for not a lot of money
it gets my enthusiastic but qualified
recommendation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
