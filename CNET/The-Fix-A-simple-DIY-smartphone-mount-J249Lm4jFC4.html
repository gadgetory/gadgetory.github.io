smartphone has become an indispensable
part of getting around by car you
probably already have some kind of mount
in your car to help keep your phone in
view and out of your hands but what if
you're not driving your car what if
you're driving some kind of rental car
and your crazy summer road trip what do
you do then well I'm going to show you
how to make your own DIY universal
smartphone mount using supplies you can
probably just pick up around the office
alright so here's what you're going to
need you're going to need a large binder
clip you'll need some rubber bands and
at least one wrench to is better now
let's talk about the large binder clip
now if you can shop around for binder
clips which is a lot of fun try to find
the binder clips that have this
rubberized handle that rubberized bit
that's going to hold your phone in place
a lot better so that's going to be a lot
easier on your hands when you're trying
to bend this thing back and that's the
next step grab your wrenches clamp one
bit and then get the other half to bend
the little tips of the arms down these
are going to act as fingers to kind of
hold the phone in place they're really
tough if either Franklin I can do this
by hand
they're going to flip it around bend the
other arm if you can get these
practically touching each other that'd
be great because that Bend is what's
going to help hold the phone in place
not just horizontally but vertically too
that's pretty good
the reason why we're doing is cuz your
phone's gonna go in here and when it's
gonna clamp down on you you want these
ends to be kind of gripping like a pair
of fingers that's pretty good
now when adding the rubber bands any
rubber band will do but if you really
want to kick it up a notch
you should try a plasti band they're a
lot stronger and that strength is gonna
help hold your phone in place a lot
better I just wrapped it on to the arms
here until all the slack was taken out
that should be good enough to help keep
some tension to keep my phone in place
now the next part is tricky placing this
thing in your car sometimes you've got a
nice horizontal air-conditioning vent
that you can latch this thing on not the
case here I've got these vertical vents
here's a good spot right up here about
the clock a little place I could pinch
onto that's gonna be in my field of view
but not too far to be out of reach
look at that perfect so there you go
it's holding my phone staying in place
doing everything a car mount needs to do
for next to nothing I mean I've
practically stole the materials for this
thing cost me maybe a few bucks at most
