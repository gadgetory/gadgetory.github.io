Charlie Cooper I'm here today with my
colleague Josh Lowensohn and Josh today
the topic is Microsoft parenthetically
microsoft made some news for us today
announcing that windows 8 will become
available on october 26th now earlier in
the week you were at a press conference
downtown san francisco microsoft also
announced that office which is one of
its cash cows will become available but
there was a bit of non news news why
don't you tell us about it sure i mean
the big missing details what happens to
other platforms offices we know it has
always been something for Windows but
there's no denying that companies like
Apple and companies like Google have
kind of come in from the sides and
really taking up some of Microsoft's
business so office the new office as we
know it is an answer to that partially
but there's still the unanswered
question of what happens these people
are using tablets and non windows
devices to to get their work done so if
you're an iPad user you're out of luck
for the time bein that's pretty much the
the vision that Microsoft has not really
laid out for people now is this more of
a question of the technology was just
too difficult to manage or are we
talking more of a business marketing
angle in that Microsoft has the new
surface tablet which is it's relatively
new entry into this this market a market
dominated by the iPad I think it's safe
to say only Microsoft knows its strategy
for what it's doing but you can also
look at the the upcoming crop of Windows
tablets that are coming up and assume
that they really want to make a case
that if you want office you need to buy
a Windows 8 tablet or a good reason to
buy it is to have the specialty software
that you can't get on any other platform
now if you are an iPad user and you're
just dying to get your hands on
something that would have office like
functionality if you can't wait what do
you do I mean the truth is there have
been alternatives you have companies
including Apple which have come out with
single productivity suites and apps that
let you do a lot of things that you
could use office for there's also
alternatives that stream microsoft
office too
your iPad or Android tablet for instance
they give you that same experience
through a touchscreen so it's not that
people can't get it they just can't get
it from Microsoft and this as far as
your understanding is a question of when
rather than if I think so and I think at
some point microsoft does need to
acknowledge the fact that more tablets
that are out there at least for now more
touchscreen devices or on other
platforms you have Android you have iOS
that's how people are doing work down
and there's no ignoring that segment and
for Microsoft he's also you know a huge
software company that's how they started
that's how they're going to continue
they can't ignore it so this iPad thing
safe to say it's going to stick around
for a while yeah that's a safe bet
thanks Josh for Cena it's inside scoop
