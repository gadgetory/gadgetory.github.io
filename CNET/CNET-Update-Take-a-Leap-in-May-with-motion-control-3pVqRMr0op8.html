a Jedi I'm Bridget Carey and this is
your cnet update in just a few months
you'll have the opportunity to control
your computer just by waving your hand
I'm talking about a motion sensor called
the leap which sits below your computer
monitor and senses your hand and finger
movements so you can interact with a
computer without using a mouse a
touchscreen or stylus the leap will work
with programs in a special leap app
store the leap will be sold online and
at best buy stores in May for eighty
dollars and pre-orders are being taken
now and there are other ways to control
a computer with the wave of a hand at
the Mobile World Congress trade show in
Barcelona stmicroelectronics is showing
off technology that can censor your
movements near a touchscreen there's
nothing special about the touch screen
itself rather it's all in the chip that
manages the screen it monitors the
electric field that the screen gives off
and when an object gets within two
inches of the field it registers it as a
touch this tech is not available right
now but the chip maker is trying to sell
this technology to manufacturers here's
another new feature coming in May
samsung smartphones will have an app
called wallet and it's pretty much the
same thing as Apple's passbook app while
it will let users store barcodes for
event tickets boarding passes membership
cards and coupons all in one place and
like passbook the wallet will send push
notifications to alert you when you're
near a place that can use one of your
coupons or a ticket Samsung wallet will
not be supporting NFC technology so
there won't be any integration with tap
to pay at least for now if your Facebook
friends post good news such as getting a
new job you'll start to see a button
near the post that nudges you to give
them a gift facebook says this is a test
of a new gift-giving feature and it
looks for particular keywords in your
friends posts Facebook recently acquired
the gift-giving app karma which did the
same thing it monitored your friend's
Facebook feeds for good and bad news and
if Facebook follows all of Karma's
features you might even see the
option to give a gift to cheer someone
up on a bad day calling all creative
types Sony needs some help naming its
pink balls and it's holding a contest
for people to come up with names for
this Bluetooth speaker there is also a
black and a white version of the ball
which costs 70 dollars and comes out

names get free balls that's your tech

contest and the other stories mentioned
