I'm Bridget Carey and this is your cnet
update in a year or two you may purchase
a wireless data and calling plan from
google several reports indicate Google's
taking steps to launch its own cellular
phone service and it would ride on the
existing networks of Sprint and t-mobile
the wall street journal and the tech
blog the information are among the
outlets reporting the plan Google would
pay sprint and t-mobile to use those
networks and that's how it works for
smaller carriers like tracfone and
freedompop so why would Google want to
do this well it's complicated you see
Google needs to stay friendly with
wireless carriers that sell Android
phones but it does want more control the
whole buying experience so if Google
isn't controlled both the foam and the
wireless plan that simplicity could
lower the cost of a plan and it means
Google could experiment with new ways of
showing you advertising through its
network but this is not happening
anytime soon and maybe it'll be a
limited launch when it does become
available google has been exploring all
sorts of new wireless projects lately
including delivering internet to more
countries using drones balloons and most
recently low-orbit satellites with an
investment of 1 billion dollars to
SpaceX meanwhile while we have Google
working on new Internet services and
Microsoft creating hologram viewing
headsets the folks at Amazon are dealing
with dirty diapers one of Amazon's
recent projects is causing a stink with
consumers about seven weeks ago it began
selling its own line of discounted baby
diapers as a perk to Prime subscribing
parents but it has stopped selling the
diapers to make some design improvements
and there's other Amazon news leaking
today yeah I can't help myself the
retail giant has launched a new program
to create digital textbooks and
educators and authors can use the Kindle
textbook creator tool to turn PDFs into
interactive digital textbooks that can
be accessed on multiple devices not just
Kindles but also iPads PCs and Android
tablets and in Amazon competitor news
overstock.com is also getting in the
video streaming game going up against
amazon
I'm instant video in a few months it's
going to launch a video streaming
service for overstocks Club Oh loyalty
program offering 30,000 shows and movies
overstocks loyalty program costs twenty
dollars a year but unlike amazon / stock
is going to charge another fee for video
the price hasn't been determined and in
social media news you may start seeing
older tweets pop up on your mobile
twitter feed twitter has a new feature
that will show you some of the tweets
you missed since the last time you
logged on the app even though the point
of twitter is to see things in real time
twitter just can't resist the urge to
act more like facebook that's your tech
news update there's more details in cnet
com for more studios in New York I'm
