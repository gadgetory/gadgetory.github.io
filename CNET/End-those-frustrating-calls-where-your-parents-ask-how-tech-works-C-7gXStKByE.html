help others you can look through the
camera that they're looking at and then
simply annotate your screen so that you
can create annotations that someone else
sees right there in their environment
hey JJ I have an early morning meeting
I'm trying to get this coffee machine
working just can't figure out what I
need to do got it alright so you're
going to need to set the automatic timer
here that's actually up at the top of
the coffee pot right there push that
first okay got it okay then just go
ahead and hit that power button right
there until you get to the time you want
the coffee setup okay 6km ready though
looks good just go ahead and push
classic brew you should be good to go is
that all that's all
hey JJ I got a new sprinkler system and
I'm trying to connect these wires these
are so complicated I do see at least one
loose wire up here getting close on that
yellow one and then plug that into this
terminal right here okay give me a
second so now he's putting down the
device to actually work on it and I'm
waiting for him to come back and
complete the step so his AC picks that
back up and he's looking at the step
that he just performed I can jump over
to a view that I saved previously and
now that AC has completed that step and
you can see his is live view up in the
corner I can actually direct him to
another part of the sprinkler system so
I'm going to highlight that and send AC
to the other side of the sprinkler
system to install you see that Waypoint
that pops up that's actually guiding AC
over to the other end to plug that in so
AC go ahead and plug that into the port
there that ribbon
so he's plugged-in he worked on a repair
when he wasn't even looking at it
previously so by delivering that
capability of being able to draw on
somebody's world we've enabled people to
have interactions that they couldn't
have otherwise had unless they were in
the same physical space</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
