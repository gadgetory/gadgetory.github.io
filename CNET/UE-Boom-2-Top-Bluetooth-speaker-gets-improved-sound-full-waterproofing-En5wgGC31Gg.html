on my left I have the original UE boom
portable Bluetooth speaker and on my
right I have the new UE boom - which
like the original carries a list price
of $200 as you can see they look almost
identical on the outside but there are
some small cosmetic changes the new
model has a tighter weave on the fabric
cover making it more durable also the
flap that covers the port's is now more
integrated into the unit with a groove
in the top of the speaker that makes
everything flush the original was
water-resistant but this model is fully
waterproof and youie says that even if
you forget to close that little flap
that covers the USB charging port and
audio input you don't have to worry
about any water getting inside the
speaker all the other changes are on the
inside
youie has completely redesigned the
driver so the speaker not only sounds
better than the original but also plays
25% louder at its top volume that said
like all these compact Bluetooth
speakers it still distorts a bit at
higher volumes with certain tracks but
most people will be very impressed with
how loud the speaker plays for its size
and that it's able to deliver as full
sound as it does while the driver is
heavier in the new model UE took out a
hidden weight that helped the original
boom balance itself when lying down in
the horizontal position with that weight
gone the new boom weighs just about the
same as the old boom at five hundred and
forty eight grams or nineteen point
three ounces you ease also added gesture
controls you tap the top of the speaker
to pause your music and double tap to
skip a track forward and you'll now be
able to update the speaker's firmware
over the air via you ease new boom to
app instead of having to connect the
speaker to a computer via the app you
can also pair a boom - with another UE
speaker and in the future you'll be able
to join up to ten UE speakers as for
battery life it's rated at fifteen hours
at moderate volume levels and the
speaker does offer extended Bluetooth
range when paired with many new
smartphones while the boom - is a little
pricey at $200
like the
original model it remains one of our top
picks in the portable bluetooth speaker
category and is a great choice
particularly if you're looking for a
rugged wireless speaker you plan on
using outdoors a lot that's the UE boom
- thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
