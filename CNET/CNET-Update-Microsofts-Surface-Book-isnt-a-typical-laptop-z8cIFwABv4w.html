it's not a typical laptop I'm Bridget
Carey this is your cnet update what if
the surface tablet was more laptop than
tablet microsoft unveiled a whole new
laptop hybrid it calls the surface book
the surprise product made its debut at a
New York event on Tuesday where
Microsoft showcase several new devices
that run Windows 10 this surface book
has an interesting bendy straw looking
hinge you can pop the 13.5 inch screen
off completely for some tablet time you
can think of this as a more powerful
version of the surface pro I briefly got
to check it out for myself at the event
and it is pretty lightweight just 3.3
pounds there's one button you press to
release the screen and it requires power
to detach you can also snap on a new
surface pen magnetically to the side to
draw or jot down notes this is packed
with a number of high-end features as
for the processor microsoft says is
twice as fast as a macbook pro and it
can last 12 hours on battery it costs
fifteen hundred dollars and it arrives
on october twenty sixth meanwhile
microsoft is also coming out with a new
surface pro 4 it's slightly smaller than
the book it's twelve point three inches
but the specs inside are upgraded in a
number of ways including a better
processor and more memory and storage as
you'd expect this new model has a
fingerprint scanner for security both
the surface book and the surface pro for
work with a new pen that comes with an
eraser and the screens can capture more
detail in your pen strokes the pen also
comes in a few colors the surface pro 4
starts at nine hundred dollars and it's
coming out october twenty sixth with
pre-orders opening up on wednesday now
part of microsoft's big selling point to
Windows 10 is that you're getting the
same operating system experience on a
laptop tablet and phone microsoft showed
off to new Lumia phones the 950 and 950
XL the most noteworthy aspect aside from
the liquid cooling inside which is just
nuts is that you can dock these phones
to a monitor in a keyboard and you get
something like a normal Windows 10
working experience the Lumia 950 starts
at five hundred and fifty dollars
microphone
there's also coming out with a new
Microsoft band it's the second version
of its fitness wristband and it packs in
nearly a dozen sensors including a
barometer to measure elevation and it
puts a focus on some specific types of
workouts for example it has a golf swing
tracker to automatically detect if
you're putting driving or just taking
practice swings and finally a bit of
news on the hollow lens augmented
reality headset if you're a program
developer and you want to try it out
Microsoft is charging three thousand
dollars for early test units and they're
coming out early next year that's it for
this tech news update but we have more
on all the Microsoft news at cnet com
from our studios in New York I'm Bridget
