easy-to-use interface and dual fuel
technology are some of the highlights of
the day poor Renaissance er 30 D SCH
this model is 30 inches wide and it's a
dual fuel range what that means is up
top we have gas burners but down below
we have an electric oven the dual fuel
technology is a great feature if you're
serious about cooking because you have
the precise gas cooktop that's gonna
give you a direct open flame but you
have an electric oven that gives an even
baking performance like we've seen with
other ranges this range is super easy to
use there's a really cool control panel
that actually tilts up with the push of
a button so you can really see what you
need to do the buttons are really clear
with all the different cooking modes so
it's really easy to figure out what the
best cooking mode is for you this model
also has decors
blue LED lights around the burner knobs
that indicate which burners are on this
is a great feature so you know hey
what's cooking and what's still hot this
range has a powerhouse of an oven that
cooks food really quickly and evenly and
produce one of the best roast chickens
we've ever had in the CNET appliances
Test Kitchen
now this range is it for the casual cook
it's pure convection feature in the oven
is very powerful and can cook food so
quickly that biscuits for example can go
from perfectly Brown to scorched
very very quickly I recommend
experimenting at home with your own
recipes so you don't end up with as many
burnt biscuits as that did now this day
court doesn't come cheap this is a
luxury brand so the cost is recommended
at six thousand three hundred and twenty
dollars this is going to knock a lot of
people out of that price category but if
you can swing it and you're serious
about cooking and you're willing to pay
a little attention and experiment this
is definitely the oven for you to learn
more about this range read my full
