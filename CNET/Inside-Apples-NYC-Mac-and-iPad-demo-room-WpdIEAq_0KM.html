the New York Apple demo room so go in
the Apple announced three different
things today the Mac minis the MacBook
Air and the iPad pro all of them are
hovering around the thousand dollar
range or a little less and we're inside
a giant demo zone wrapping up and you
can see that it's adjacent to the
Brooklyn Academy of Music it's beautiful
and there's a big wraparound life so
stay tuned with me as we're about to go
oh here we go we're going to go up the
stairs and check out the demo room
so much I'd waiter in line for a little
bit but now at least I've got a little
breathing room let's talk about the iPad
pro first the iPad pro if you know what
it does before this is an improvement on
the overall construction screen
processor the proposition is not all
that different though but it has an 11
inch screen or a 12 point 9 inch smaller
bezels LCD that's similar display
technology they said to the iPhone 10
are a new pencil which has got tap zones
there's a new folio keyboards you can
see there and as an a 12 X processor now
kind of jump to generation from a 10 X 8
12 x starting price or the iPad pro
$7.99 which 64 gigs of storage look at
all those iPad pros and you can go up to
one terabyte now which is a lot just a
lot of iPad storage the twelve point
nine inch version is smaller the 11 inch
version is the same body size at the
10.5 which is also sticking around for
650 these are not affordable iPad G's or
high-end iPads they also have USB see
not lightning and this can also charge
an iPhone or any USB Z type thing it
also supports
let's take a look I really
pencil technology has Capstone's are
going to lie to do things like zoom and
also magnetically charges on the top of
the iPad it's a thinner iPad overall but
iPad pro if you know what an iPad pro is
it's very art oriented you can
definitely use it as a laptop but there
is no truck that option on the keyboard
that's still not doable
Adobe announced its new apps that are
coming out next year there are a couple
of other specialized tools and Apple
claims is going to be a lot better for
AR as well as significantly enhanced
graphics and processor speed but it does
seem like it's going to be designed if
you want to be a graphics professional
and want to make the most out of a
larger display and using the pencil the
one that might be the most practical is
the MacBook Air let's see if you define
that MacBook Air right now we're an iPad
layout here's the MacBook Air this is
what people who wanted this is the
retina MacBook Air so it's 1199 to start
it's got us PC Thunderbolt the ring
ports it's got the third-generation
butterfly keyboard and also has touch ID
in the corner so if you want that plus a
teacher security chip that's onboard
configuration stand increased storage to
a pretty significant degree the MacBook
Air is landing somewhere in the zone of
where the 13-inch MacBook Pro and the 12
inch max look at then the proposition
here in terms of price size and overall
performance is probably going to hit
that spot that you've been waiting for
it looks it's feeling yeah that keyboard
if you've been following along with
MacBook Pros is that refined keyboard
the one that seems to have been around
in the most recent generation so flat
but click here and more responses pretty
large trackpad and let's take a look at
the display which
looks pretty good to me as far as you
can tell from from a YouTube video comes
in up three different colors as well so
if you want to take a look at the gold
kind of bronze color silver and space
freight it was right over here and let's
just get in close yes that's a headphone
tag so that's the short however
headphone jack on the iPad pro no but
stay tuned let's take a look at the Mac
Mini and I'll show you that two Mac Mini
kind of looks like a large Apple TV well
the Mac Mini keeps that cool small form
the price has gone up it now starts at
$7.99 it can be specked out pretty
significant internals you can get up to
six cores and processing you can get
pretty significant amount of RAM the
starting configuration for $7.99 uses a
core i3 processor however eight gigs of
RAM and I believe it is 128 gigs of
storage this is being sold as a semi-pro
device basically you know you're gonna
be hooking this up to a high-end music
rig maybe using it as a server using it
to video edit that type of stuff and a
lot of people would use Mac minis before
all sorts of stuff which is listen to
the music
now there's a lot of other use cases set
up here there's the whole family of
MacBook Air and iPads and over here you
can look at another use that people do
where they stack them that's the that's
the Mac Mini five device stack right
there you can set them up as some sort
of advanced photo server processing
whatever you'd like imagine the price
times five those are the three products
and that Apple and those are three
products that Apple introduced at this
event if you want to take a look at the
twelve point nine inch iPad over here
and it is really small stay tuned for
all not more here at CNN where we're
gonna dive in we're gonna take a look at
these products and eventually we're
gonna review them they're available
November seventh just going to show you
this space that we're standing into
because that's pretty awesome as well
I'm Scott Stein here in Brooklyn Nach
California at Apple's newest iPad event
and Macbook event</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
