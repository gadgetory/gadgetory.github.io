on your favorite Android iOS Amazon fire
device it's everywhere and the app is
designed to bring together all of your
purchase movies into one place but we
have some questions so to answer those
questions we have the general manager of
movies anywhere Caron Guildford thank
you so much for joining us thank you um
thank you to our studio audience for
being here today as well you guys are
fantastic ok so we wanted to ask
questions that we felt like everybody
has about this new service because as
with all new services we want to know
everything about it
so how in the world we have Sony
Pictures Entertainment Walt Disney
Studios 20th Century Fox Universal
Pictures and a Warner Brothers
entertainment all came together to allow
their movies to be viewed on movies
anywhere how did you get them to agree
to this it's unprecedented for sure so
movies anywhere does represent a huge
investment in innovation by those five
Hollywood studios but I have to tell you
it wasn't as hard as it sounds they were
ready for this opportunity the time is
right and they've been in lockstep with
us the whole time we've been developing
this service that's amazing
we so rarely see so much collaboration
in in the industry in the sense of
Studios collaborating with each other
on that note though there are a few
studios missing and I'm wondering if
there are plans for adding additional
studios as you go so we hope the app
will continue to evolve and grow we want
to add more content more retailers
launch on more platforms and we're in
talks with all of the studios we know
consumers would love to have more
content in movies anywhere from other
studios and we hope that they'll join us
and in addition to Studios I'm wondering
if there will also be plans to add
services like Xbox and Playstation
stores absolutely so we are going to
continue to evolve movies anywhere to
meet consumer demand and we hope to be
everywhere that consumers are purchasing
movies one of the things that really
struck us right away was that there
wasn't support for 4k and HDR and with
that being a huge part of how we
view our movies today what are the plans
or general roadmap for adding that to
the service
sure so movies anywhere currently
supports HD and SD but if you bought a
4k movie on one of our participating
retail partners which are Amazon video
Google Play iTunes and Vudu we will
honor that and we will send it across as
you sync your accounts so if you bought
a 4k movie on Vudu it'll go across to
Google Play in 4k so while we don't
playback in 4k right now we will have it
soon it will still transfer your 4k
entitlements across retailers if they
also support 4k so if I bought Wonder
Woman in HD yes and then Apple gave me
my free UHD upgrade yes at some point
I'll be able to watch that in UHD on
movies anywhere yes you will also go
you're also able to buy movies on movies
anywhere and I'm really curious how you
decide or how the app decides what
service you purchase those movies from
so different platforms have different
purchasing capabilities so for instance
on Android we offer the ability to
purchase on google play amazon video and
Vudu and it's really cool because
consumers are presented with a choice
and then they can app set one as a
default and then you're sort of on the
fast track to checking out and getting
your movie purchase on iOS we send you
right to iTunes you're also able to
download movies offline for viewings
so when you do that is there a specific
resolution that is required by certain
services so let's say if you buy a movie
through Vudu it only lets you download
an SD or do you have HD capability
across the app there's HD capability so
we default to sd to just respect the the
storage on a consumers device but you
can choose really easily rightly
interface to download to HD if you
prefer that perfect um and I think a
really big question for me is it's the
golden age of television
so Karen when will we see TV anywhere
well movies anywhere currently supports
feature films but we will continue to
build the product and add more content
to meet consumer demand excellence I
needs my Breaking Bad yeah I just have
it with me everywhere I go
and my last question is where do you see
movies anywhere in a year or in
five years you know we're really excited
about the possibilities for movies
anywhere we sort of see it you know
growing into a movie companion I mean
right now we're giving consumers the
ability to have their favorite movies
with them at all times
wherever they go and we are looking
forward to building more features that
meet the needs of future film fans so I
just had a thought
here yeah features for film fans I
really love sites like IMDB and I really
love things like Amazon's x-ray are
there any maybe plans in the future to
sort of integrate those types of things
into movies anywhere well we are backed
by the studio's so we have access to
great content and we want to keep
building out features that put the
control in consumers hands to make that
decision on what to watch it at home on
Friday night or any movie night and last
question are there any plans for
exclusives for movie movies anywhere we
the product is set up for exclusives
we're not launching with any but we hope
to have some in the future so keep
checking back excellent well thank you
so much thank you joining us we really
appreciate it you can check out more
information on movies anywhere on Sina
com we will keep you posted on all of
the
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
