report the show about the tech news that
everybody's talking about this week it's
serious data lost car theft made easy
and old school going new school but
first it's the gadget of the week the
gadget of the week is the dyson
bladeless fan it is gorgeous it's like
art it doesn't have any blades that will
chop off the fingers of the little ones
or worse get all dusty and gross actual
cool air comes out it's a marvel of
modern technology and design and then
here's the thing it is super awesome but
who puts out a fan in October it's cold
now we don't need fans especially not
$300 fans but call me in May Dyson I
like it and now for the news the big
ongoing story of this week and last the
sidekick data loss Microsoft and
t-mobile notified sidekick users that
all the data from their phones had been
lost for good although now it sounds
like some of the data might be recovered
and then t-mobile has given affected
users a hundred dollar gift cards and a
month's free service now why when this
thing happens do companies offer gift
cards because i know it saves them money
but do you really think that all those
pissed-off customers want to spend a
hundred bucks on t-mobile stuff right
now really tacky speaking of data loss
Apple this week finally acknowledged a
serious bug in Snow Leopard that deletes
all user data and completely resets your
account a small number of users reported
seeing the bug back in September but it
wasn't until the media jumped on the
story that Apple finally admitted the
problem and said it's working on a fix
let me be clear this bug erases all of
the user data on your computer and they
didn't facet Wow in a related story we
know seven comes out next week yeah and
Barnes &amp;amp; Noble has confirmed that it
will hold an event October 20th at which
many expect them to announce their ebook
reader in fact gizmodo posted some
leaked versions of the
ereader and it actually looks fairly
cool it's kind of kindle looking with a
standard e-ink display on top but then
this color touchscreen LCD on the bottom
that you could use as a keyboard or
maybe for viewing images or turning
pages and I don't know why I find this
whole thing so weird I mean amazon sold
books and made an e-reader that made
sense but i guess it's just like nothing
about barnes and noble says e to me they
say more like p for paper and like
parking validation I don't know fine
okay I guess anybody can do their own
ebook reader these days why not you go
brick and mortar Kings good luck with
that and finally a quick look at what's
clogging the tubes as i mentioned
windows 7 makes its public debut next
week it's a big deal very exciting for
Microsoft and we wish them well with the
launch but it just felt like an
appropriate time to look at this great
blog post which chronicles the 30
funniest blue screens of death you can
find them all at the blog but here are a
couple of our favorites good times I'm
sure that won't happen with windows 7
and that's the buzz report for this week
everyone I'm Mollywood and thank you for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
