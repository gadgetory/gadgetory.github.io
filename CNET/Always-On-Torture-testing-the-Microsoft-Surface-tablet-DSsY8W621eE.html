Surface that Molly sent me of course
she sent me the hot pink version and
kept the cool black version but that's
that's alright I'm cool with that
I'm actually really diggin this device a
lot I don't want to torture it I like it
I really really like it I think it's
slick and cool and the OS is really fun
to play around with but unfortunately my
job is not to enjoy but to destroy we're
back in The Bachelor Test Kitchen in my
apartment we're gonna throw the surface
into the freezer do the cold test first
I'm keeping the case on hot pink might
keep it a little warmer we'll see but I
want to check out how the coolness
effects maybe the input of the keyboard
who knows throw it in the freezer
all right surface stay frosty we're at
two and a half hours in the freezer so
it's time to check on the surface
and it is chill e / still pink let's see
if it turns on when we open the lid hey
look at that no delay whatsoever putting
in my password nobody look there we go
and we're at all systems go it is you
can see the ice on the on the screen
it's freezing cold but man this thing
didn't care
didn't care about the cold so cold test
pass with flying pink colors time for
the heat test which means baking in the
Test Kitchen I'm going to take off the
sensitive keyboard and since the surface
looks a lot like a baking sheet why not
just use it as one hey ready for this
it's going to be a mess I predict oh
it's it's touch sensitive alright going
in the oven preheated to 250 degrees all
right success here we go I'll check on
that in a little while okay it has been
over an hour in the 250 degree heat of
the oven so it's time to check on our
baking to see how the surface is faring
delicious very hot to the touch
turns out the surface is a nonstick
surface mmm
who is hungry
it's a little overdone but the good news
is the keyboard accessory makes them a
wonderful knife all right I had a little
time to cool down and see if it turns on
even with egg all over its face I'm not
turning on Tripp plugging it in if that
changes anything up there we go just
needed a little juice it's working but
look you can see there's weird screen
discolorations from the heat and that
the top here is weird so you can really
see it Wow I'm ecstatic about the
results of the test
I I consider myself an expert in
torturing and this is exactly what I
expected
the surface is clearly a high-class
device so we're doing a high-class
liquid test exited a consider if you
will a dinner party where you're sitting
around with your friends sipping some
wine enjoying good times and you think
yourself I've got to share with my
friends something I found on Bing
powered by Microsoft Oh Bing has all the
best stories friends friends gather
round I've got something to show you
where's my Microsoft Surface oh I'm
looking for what I'm looking for oh no
oh no oh no I spilled my wine all over
my Microsoft Surface well look at it
freaking out it does not like that
doesn't see it doesn't recognise my
fingers anymore huh let's dry it off and
see if it passes
home mom nothing guys that's a fail
maybe it's just drunk so the surface did
not survive the water test functionally
but we want to test the durability
Microsoft Steven Sinofsky tweeted out
pictures of them using it like a
skateboard to prove just how durable
this thing was so guess what I'm going
to do I'm going to use it like a
skateboard Molly I see your hot pink
keyboard and I raise you hot pink
skateboard wheels let's do this
you
that seems pretty solid Molly you
thought you could embarrass me with the
hot pink but no no I embrace it service
is on as you can see still no touch
recognition so that's unfortunate but it
is on and we're going to see if I get
its cake on it
Hopa don't die
hasn't broken
there's definitely a bend
pretty impressive pretty impressive
let's see if it turns on it is not
turning on and it oh wow
is that it that's a crack see that it's
a crack it's it's it's it's for
transportation you know not for
freestyling I would say I'll see you
guys later
the surface is not functional it is not
functional the wine took out the touch
sensitivity skateboarding it won't even
turn on now the screen is is messed up
but I will say this the glass on the
front is not cracked I stood on it you
saw I jumped on it you saw the glass is
not cracked that's pretty amazing the
the case cracked but the glass did not
crack so the last thing we're going to
throw at this thing is the ground o
surface I hardly knew you but landed
flat so that's usually not a bad sign ya
see that was no problem that was no
problem I mean if you were sitting you
stood up sees no little scuffing on the
corner of course but that glass isn't a
problem so let's up the ante a little
bit oh that did it going down in the
corner always is a problem light it on
the power button too so that doesn't
help so don't drop it from a height
larger than yourself
well the surface is dead but you know I
love this little kickstand in the back
that it's got to prop itself up and I
kind of want to check the durability of
that so perhaps the surface can be used
as a footrest or maybe not</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
