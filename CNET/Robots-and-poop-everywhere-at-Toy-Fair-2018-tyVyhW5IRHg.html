hunt for what the next big toy trend is
does it have to do with technology or
possibly is it something else
what do you think Toy Fair is a huge
event filled with cool new inventions
and previews of what is coming for the
holidays technology always gives toys
new magic or in the case of Harry Potter
the magic its new tech Harry Potter's
wizard training wands have motion
sensors to teach you how to cast spells
and you can battle friends with wizard
laser tag LED lights on the wands handle
indicate different modes and spells each
wand is about $25 toy drones have a bit
of magic - air hog supernova is
completely controlled using your hands
swipe your hand near one of its five
sensors to perform tricks and have
yourself a drone dance party it costs
$40 a small price to pay for being the
envy of all your friends that is cool
they also have these extreme air border
dudes that can do tricks but it may take
some practice that was very when I
wasn't destroying booths I met many
robot pets ready to learn a few tricks
some like Zoomer the playful pup can
actually understand your voice commands
for $100 you can have a pouncing puppy
without the need for potty training but
not all robot pets are housebroken all
right so the robot toy pets now also
food this is from Spin Master it spelled
hungry bunnies the $30 critters have a
bunch of touch sensors but when it's
feeding time they munch up paper snacks
and leave their digested gems behind
look at what you did look at what you
did on the carpet exploring Toy Fair can
be a
little silly sometimes you don't know
what will pop out at you or what's gonna
pop up at you I'm sorry I just have to
take a second and point out this curious
game flushing frenzy you have to stick
the poop in close the lid and push the
plunger till the poop pops out and catch
it why am i catching poop just when he
sees something brainless behold there is
hope for Humanity with a smart kid toy
there are plenty of ways robots can
teach kids programming skills Mattel's
booth in front of kamigami robots and
these are robotic dinosaurs I'm here
with Patel's chief technology officer
spender it's can you tell us a little
bit about these absolutely would love to
these are great examples of a product
that can make technology more accessible
and compelling to kids with lots of
interests so kids may want to play with
these because they want to build
something they may want to learn how to
program something physical or frankly
they just may be into dinosaurs like
most of us right I'd have to agree not
all robot pets are complicated some are
pretty cheap do you remember this little
guy fingerlings the hottest toy at the
holidays ah sure oh yeah he's back in
bigger flesh form for $30 the Sun sir
stuffed monkey blinks and shrieks and
gives plenty of kisses watch you too pom
zis is another wearable fuzzy bot eye
colours indicate if it's happy hungry or
has the hiccups shake it up throw a
dance party or whatever kids do with a
fuzzy cooing creature it's just 15
dollars
as I was leaving the pom Zee party
something not so cute caught my eye
could it be another poop thing how much
research goes into making poop a lot of
research this was we went in the
backyard our CEO in the backyard found
the poo of his dog chose the best one he
brought at rodney of the office and the
designers molded it it didn't work the
first time it didn't look as good so we
would take a couple different rounds to
get the exact perfect poo you heard it
here first this is the exact perfect poo
and the more I ran around the show floor
going from booth to booth the more I saw
think I'm stumbling on a real stinker of
a trend here what did I just stick my
hand in do get back in there what is
happening at Toy Fair you can't help but
step in it at every booth it's poop
again poop checkers bag of poop poop
ends put mugs
I blame apples an emoji poop for all
this Thank You Apple your advanced
technology has changed the world by
making cartoon poop the coolest thing
for kids but not everything about Toy
Fair has gone down the toilet boxer is
an $80 robot that follows your hand
using IR sensors it can kick a ball or
play a number of games retro seems to be
back again look they made my little pony
like the classic My Little Pony I had
when I was growing up they also read it
light bright I mean all the pegs and the
and the lights here and oh my favorite
Koosh balls hmm
retro video games are all so big and
small this working tiny arcade starts at
$20 but if you're looking for something
more substantial I am ready alright
later this year arcade one up is gonna
sell these arcade cabinets that you
build yourself at home
they cost $400 and come with a few
classic titles like Street Fighter this
is still my favorite kind of check to it
let us know what your favorite toys are
in the comments I'm Bridget Carey and

time for another round
