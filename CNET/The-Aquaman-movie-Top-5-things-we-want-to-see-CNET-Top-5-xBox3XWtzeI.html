see in the Aquaman movie there's a movie
coming and of course we've got opinions
let's count it down number five do not
set up any other movie in this one
normally I love world building and films
but I don't want to see that happening
at the expense of a good story or pacing
no hard drives full of other metahuman
videos tell Aquaman's story and stick to
that there are plenty of Aquaman stories
and concepts to explore in this movie at
number four
totally self-consistent I don't care
what tone Aquaman goes with just go with
one James Wan is at the helm of Aquaman
what I love to see horror like elements
with sea monsters darkness and tension
yes what I don't want to see is a by
committee movie that does not know what
it is if you're gonna be campy or
serious or whatever be that 100 percent
go for it and number three and awesome
villain DC and Marvel movies have had a
villain problem look a hero is only as
good as his rival if you've got yet
another CGI bad guy spouting off generic
dialogue like you'll never win good guy
you're way off a developed antagonist is
critical to making sure we see a hero
take on someone who's this match
otherwise we've got a conflict problem
and number two be the best DC EU movie
no one is asking Aquaman to be better
than the Dark Knight or 1978 Superman
I didn't say best DC movie ever I just
said the best DC EU movie the
competition is not fierce what are the
best
DC EU movies right now Wonder Woman and
Man of Steel Man of Steel became a
better movie by comparison to the others
Wonder Woman is a solid movie and it
looks great compared to the rest of
those Jokers Aquaman can be the best DC
EU movie so why not go all out in a
number one a true showing of Aquaman's
powers contrary to popular belief
Aquaman's powers are not just yelling
Mon man and yeehaw Aquaman is one of the
most dangerous
characters in the DC Universe he
controls three-quarters of the planet
he was standing the pressure of being
underwater and see while he's down in
the dark depths and yes he can talk to
sea life that means he can probably
create massive waves by sending hordes
of animals in one direction that's just
a tad bit dangerous show us what Aquaman
can really do Warner Brothers for those
of you who think it's impossible for
there to be a great story about an
Aquaman you're dead wrong
check out Peter David's run from the
1990s it was something else
Amaya's act hard I've got my fingers
crossed for a good Aquaman</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
