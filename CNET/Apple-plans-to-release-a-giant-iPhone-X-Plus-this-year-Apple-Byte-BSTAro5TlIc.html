to the Apple bite for everything good
and bad inside the world of Apple and
it's a real beefy show today so let's
just jump in the big story this week
according to Bloomberg Apple will indeed
release three new iPhones in 2018
echoing the early rumors from kji
securities now Apple is working on a
second generation 5.8 inch OLED phone a
new larger 6.5 inch OLED iPhone that
will be the iPhone 10 plus but come on
you know let's have a little fun here
let's just call it the iPhone XL because
that's still too large for my
form-fitting you know skinny jeans it's
so tight now there's also a third
lower-cost 6.1 inch iPhone with a
similar iPhone 10 design but with an LCD
screen that's cheaper and aimed for
everyone after iPhone 10 sales missed
expectations all models will feature an
edge to edge display face ID with the
true depth camera and yes the not the
report says the two higher-end iPhones
will feature new a12 processors at least
one model could be available in gold
because you know I know you do
Bloomberg says Apple is considering
including dual Sims to make it easier
for people to switch carriers while
traveling but it's not a sure thing yet
some prototypes of the larger 6.5 inch
feature a screen resolution of 12 42 by
2688 and check this out a sneak peek at
what could be a first look at the larger
iPhone display leaked out from an LG
display plant in Vietnam unless that
person has really tiny hands now if you
still can't wait but you don't want to
drop a grand of cheddar for an iPhone 10
Asus is looking to fill that void on the
cheap with their zenfone 5 announced
that Mobile World Congress that looks
almost just like an iPhone 10 but it
will cost around 590 US dollars it even
has the horrible notch but Asus can brag
and say our notch is smaller than yours
apple and then Apple will counter with
yeah bruh but you got a big ass chin but
you know we know Apple would never even
stoop that low or would they alright
Mobile World Congress also brought us
the debut of the new Samsung Galaxy S 9
a solid incremental upgrade for Galaxy
users by far their best phone but how
does it compare to the iPhone 10 when it
comes to speed benchmarking of a demo
unit at the show by Anandtech showed
that the Exynos 9810 chip inside the s9
is fast but it was still outperformed by
Apple's a 11 and even there a tension it
may not have been optimized so we'll
give them that for now but at least
initially out of the gates the Galaxy S
9 is slower than the iPhone 10 and
iPhone 8 so Apple by nation you can now
relax and start relentlessly posting
Samsung sucks in the comments you know
if you didn't already alright in other
news that you might not be too thrilled
about Barclays reports average wait
times for battery replacements for older
iPhones
has jumped up from 2.7 weeks to 4.5
weeks based on their Apple Store checks
now once you initiate the $29
replacement stores need to order the
part from Apple but it won't be a quick
process like I've already bad Apple this
whole situation enough at least they're
doing something but you know what this
just reeks of rotten apple now want even
more goodies I told you this was a beefy
show we missed this last week because
guess what surprise we're a weekly show
bloomberg reports Apple is planning to
release an upgrade to the air pods
that's still for the record looks silly
but you know you see enough of them and
you start getting used to seeing this
every day now the update will bring a
new wireless chip that will manage
Bluetooth connections better and enable
you to bring up Siri by just saying hey
Siri without physically tapping the air
pods which can still feel a little
uncomfortable you know to push in your
ear hole I'm a huge fan of this
functionality because it will open up a
slot for more physical controls directly
on the air pods by making Siri all voice
but you know I still want to slide up
and down for volume control at the least
now Apple is also working on another air
pod model for release as early as next
year that's plan to be water-resistant
Apple has never made that official claim
with the current air pods although
everything Apple pro has put them to the
test
and they survived well let's have some
fun here like what should Apple call
them you know I could see them called
the
air pod sport or let's just get
cray-cray and call them water pods or
you know do you even have a better one
guess what I'll pick the best name that
makes me laugh and give the winner
something you know from my secret stash
so tell us in the comments now also a
patent as far back as April of last year
hinted at an Airpark ace that could
double as a wireless charging dock for
an Apple watch or iPhone and there was
even a version of the air pods case that
was described to be waterproof as well
so there's a whole lot more we can see
coming from Apple's air pods that still
look like this
all right KJ securities reports Apple is
working not only on new air pods but
their own high-end over-the-ear
headphones with an all-new design that
will reportedly debut in the fourth
quarter of this year at the earliest
design to be as convenient as the air
pods these could be a direct competitor
to their own beats line appealing to you
know a slightly more mature audience and
with the brand cachet of Apple you know
just slap an Apple logo on it because
you can never underestimate the brand
also you all know I enjoyed the sound of
the home pod but it really didn't do
anything else that great for me so much
that yes I returned mine so sorry to let
the fanboys down but I'll come back to
it if it gets a whole lot better
like I've said it's good but it's not
349 good with everything else out there
now NPD Group data found the home pod
beat out all other smart speaker
first-day pre-orders with the exception
of the Amazon dot that product was $49
we know Apple you aren't gonna bring
down the price but you need to pump up
the value with more features a smarter
AI and smart home compatibility and then
you've got something that can really
compete beyond just being an Apple music
speaker ok patent use a new Apple patent
has been granted for a dual display
MacBook or a second-generation iPad pro
titled dual display equipment with
enhanced visibility and suppressed
reflections now this would eliminate a
physical keyboard or trackpad and the
second display can also be used as a
sketch pad for for gaming controls based
on past patents now in one version a
hinge would hold two displays together
to form a new MacBook in another version
the hinge could be designed with
magnetics so it could become a
two-in-one device or set
an iPad and you know how much I love my
iPad pro now this doesn't mean Apple is
going to do this right away or ever
other companies already have dual
displays or laptops with this fully
rotating hinges and are also guess what
they're also thinking about this and
before we go we couldn't even pack in
all the stuff we wanted to this week but
we couldn't end this show without saying
happy birthday to Steve Jobs who would
have turned 63 years old on February the
24th like he's really the reason many of
us fell in love with tech the reason
this show exists and the reason we're
all watching it together
thank you yes Jay all right that's gonna
do it for this week you can email me at
the Apple bite at cnet.com or tweet me
at Brian Tong and remember to comment
earpods port water pods or you got
something better thanks so much for
watching and we'll catch y'all next time
for another bite of the Apple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
