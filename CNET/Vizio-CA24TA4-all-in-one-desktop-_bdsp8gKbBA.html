gonna take a look at Vizio 's new 24
inch CA 2040 all-in-one desktop so you
might recognize this system from when we
looked at the 27 inch model a couple
months ago that system came out without
a touchscreen and before Windows 8
launched now that Windows 8 is out Vizio
has updated its all one's to include a
touchscreen now other than the
touchscreen the features for the system
should look pretty familiar if you saw
the old one you get all wireless input
devices here there's a keyboard or
remote control and kind of uniquely this
wireless touchpad there is no mouse
included with this system so that's
maybe something to consider the system
itself has the same sort of small
profile though Vizio cheats a little bit
because it takes the power supply and
bundles it here with the subwoofer you
have to have this device connected to
the computer and rotor on the power
cable out so it's not an option you can
get rid of if you want to clean our
desktop so this 24 inch vizio is a
little bit more expensive than the
27-inch model we looked at it has a
mobile core i5 chip six gigs of ram a
terabyte hard drive and embedded Intel
graphics now those are similar specs to
the 27-inch model but this one of course
has a touchscreen which adds to its
price for the screen it's a 19 by 10
display it looks pretty good the touch
screen is also reasonably responsive for
basic interactions although it's not
quite as smooth as we'd like to be if
say you're playing a game like air
hockey now in this case you really kind
of want smooth drag-free input and
although it's not bad you can see that
it's not really as responsive as you
want it to be now there is no optical
drive in this PC and that helps preserve
the slim profile of both the screen and
the CPU unit you do get two HDMI inputs
though which gives you some nice
flexibility in terms of connecting
external video components so overall
this Vizio is fairly competitive first
price Asus and some other vendors have
beefier pcs in the same price range or
maybe for a little bit more so if you're
concerned about performance or want a
really beefy feature set you might look
elsewhere
it may appeal for this system is
probably it's sleek profile so I'm rich
Brown this is the Vizio CA 2040 - a 4</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
