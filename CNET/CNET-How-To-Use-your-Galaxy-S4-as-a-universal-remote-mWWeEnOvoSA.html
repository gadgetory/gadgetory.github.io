universal TV remote with the built-in
infrared blaster you can control your TV
cable box streaming media player and AV
receiver without ever lifting the
clicker you'll even get recommendations
on what to watch based on your interests
and your viewing history well there's a
lot to dive into here so let's set it up
launch the watch on app to get started
the first time you launch it the app
will ask you about what kind of shows
you like this is for those
recommendations I mentioned uncheck the
genres you don't like and rearrange them
in order of which you like best then
you'll be taken to the main interface
this is what you'll see each time you
launch the app but before we dig into
that I still have to pair my phone with
my TV and cable box tap this remote icon
and then hit setup now I'll select
Samsung as my TV brand then the app will
try to figure out which code pairs with
my TV when it gets the right one the TV
turns off and I know I got it right then
I'll pair the cable box with the phone
and I know it's set when my phone
successfully changes the channel looks
like we're good now that my phone is
paired with my TV and my cable box let's
test it out I'll just choose a show from
this list here hit watch now and it
works let's dig into the personalized
interface this area is what I call the
catalog you can tap through different
times here or go to this left sidebar to
browse in other ways the app lets you
filter by movies TV shows and so on when
you find a show through the catalogue a
card comes up like I did before hit
watch now to switch to that channel but
also check out these options down here
make a habit to like or dislike shows so
the app can give you better
recommendations on what to watch back in
the sidebar this channel guide is like
your on screen TV Guide except better
because you can actually edit it and
remove channels you never watch to do
that hit the menu button and hit edit
channels now what about using the s4 as
just a regular remote no matter what
you're doing that option will always be
available up here you get a simple
remote with volume controls that you can
change up and down and channel controls
too but if you swipe up there are more
options like access to DVR features for
recording and viewing or even the TV's
menu back in the catalogue open the menu
button and go to settings here there are
two things to look at room is where you
can add another home theater setup
located in a different room it's also
where you edit your existing room to
make changes or even add more devices
here's where you add more components
like an a/v system Roku box and anything
else you want to control below that
there are some notification options
these are the settings that really make
watchon work take this first option to
make the remote show up in the
notification bar for easy access and
turn on the second option to have it
appear in your lock screen so you don't
even have to unlock your phone to change
the channel you can even set it up so
that it only appears in your lock screen
when the app knows you're near the TV
just tap it to set it up obviously this
app has a ton of features and even
challenges the way you interact with
your TV but with a little practice you
might find yourself discovering new
shows things to those smart
recommendations if you have any
questions on the way hit me up on
Twitter and check out how to see Netcom
for more tips on the s4 for CNET I'm
