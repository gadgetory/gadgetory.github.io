with cnet com we're on the floor the
2013 detroit auto show and we're taking
a look at the ford atlas now that's a
very strong name for a very strong truck
this is a early preview of what should
we should expect from the next
generation ford f theories of pickup
trucks now the Atlas is powered by a
next generation version of Ford EcoBoost
engine there's not much detail known
beyond that we pretty much know is that
it's going to use direct injection and
turbocharging it's also going to use an
auto stop/start system to help it save
fuel when you're idling at a light but
that's the only part of the fuel saving
technology at work here it actually uses
a lot of interesting active shutter
technology their shutters in the wheels
that slam shut when you're at rolling
speed so that you get less turbulence
from those spinning spokes and reduce
the wind resistance and drag that you
pick up when you're rolling their active
shutters in the front grille that flem
shut to reduce a little bit of cooling
but you get a lot more of a flick
profile when you're traveling through
the wind and there's also a drop down
lower air dam that slides down from the
front bumper reducing the amount of air
that flows underneath the car again less
wind resistance Ford's also working on a
lot of driver aid features for the next
generation f-series driver including a
trailer assist that helps you reversed
when you got a trailer on you a hitch
activist if that helps you line up the
trailer hitch the first time every time
when you're trying to actually attach
the trailer to the truck and a 360 a
bird's-eye view camera that lets you see
all of the ground around the vehicle
this is similar to what we've seen in
infiniti vehicles previously you've also
got retractable side steps that slip up
in and under the vehicle when you're
rolling so they're not contributing the
drag also pretty much all of the
exterior features this vehicle or tailor
made towards making this big hunk of
metal as slick as possible when
traveling through the air at high speeds
the outlets also uses LED lights all
around for the headlights the taillights
there are even some LED spotlights in
the side
mirrors inside the cabin we have a very
concept car interior with big blocky
features and a lot of exposed metal but
the basics of the ford sync with apple
inc system the ford my key system the
Wi-Fi enabled dashboard integration all
of that probably going to be in place
for the next generation of the vehicle
well I'm antuan goodwin with cnet com
we've been on the floor taking a look at
the ford atlas pickup truck concepts</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
