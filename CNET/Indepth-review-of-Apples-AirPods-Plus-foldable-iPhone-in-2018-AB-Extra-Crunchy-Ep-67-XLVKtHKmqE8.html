studio in San Francisco California it's
the Apple byte extra country podcast
with your host mr. Brian Tom what's up
everybody welcome to the show it is
episode 67 we just want to make a note
the holidays are coming up seeing that
completely shuts down so you arguably
won't we're not gonna do one from CES
are we I don't think we are you probably
won't hear from us honestly for arguably
about three weeks to four till month I
mean maybe if Apple does something like
crazy crazy and predictable then we
might have to do something but uh you
know the holidays are coming scene that
shuts its doors then we go straight to
Las Vegas so we wanted to let you know
this is the holiday episode but if you
still want to be our friend and you want
to call us because we continue to get
tons of calls from you on we love it you
can leave us your name where you're from
and what you want to talk about on the
show 1-866-376-8255 December if you're
here in the u.s. the 21st of December
were the initial starting days if you
got in early on the pre-order you can
still pre-order but I know at least for
us customers that has been pushed out to
six weeks
but a report here also claims that the
air pods if you run into your store
early enough according to Mac rumors and
their sources some stores will begin
selling air pods starting on Monday
actual Apple retail stores now we have
been able to get a pair of these from
our friends at Apple believe it or not
although they don't invite me anymore to
any keynotes although I was wondering
like how did you get those yeah you
don't need to tell everybody but I
killed somebody
I literally killed somebody I am NOT I
am I'm actually making a mask out of his
skin that I'll be wearing to the next
keynote awesome Yuki you can find me in
the front row I'm Johnny bribe so we got
these ear pods air pods in her hands and
I did want to talk about them because
people have given their initial
impressions their initial reviews I'm
gonna hand these over so that
Beechum has never touched these before
I'm gonna let you touch these okay
you're gonna touch these but I will talk
a little bit about them feel them if you
feel like putting in your ear I don't
really buy it yeah they're very light so
here's the thing I'm gonna do a quick
review and then the things that I wish
were better first thing that I like if
you use Apple's wire to ear pods you're
going to like the fit of these if those
for your ears well these are going to
fit your ears well okay
also the syncing is amazing the first
time you open up this little dental
floss kit pop it open a panel pops up on
your screen no less and maybe one or two
seconds yeah model does offer me well
while we're talking about this Beecham
about one or two seconds and then they
sync to your phone what also is nice
that that syncs to the iCloud services
that you use therefore on my iPad and my
macbook pro it gives me an option to
sync to them later on
that's just sounded really spoiled like
also on my iPad and MacBook Pro that's
disgusting boy but we are blessed and
you know I got acknowledge that cuz it
just sounds disgusting
alright you know when I put them in I
heard a tone yeah because it
so there are accelerometer and proximity
sensors on here you'll see little dots
when you put them in your ear it detects
that you're wearing them and then it so
dududu so therefore it will then hear
the audio okay so air pods we got them
right here right
looks like the wired
earpods the other thing I like is that
true to what they said when you put
cables or cords in them like I bought a
third party from I think it was like
spigen because I'm OH to hold them just
because I'm gonna reviews and I'm
disgusted by how they look
there's no honestly but I'm not gonna
rip on them anymore because some people
like them it's a choice so what I did is
I put this little cable on because I
want them to look a little better right
you put on this little basically it's a
tendon that holds them together and
believe it or not when you shake your
head side to side violently they
instantly pop out oh really
but when you just wear them as they
should be without any cords or anything
connected to them because no there's no
weight on it they don't fly out they
don't fly out they stay in your ear so
what about have you used him outside
yeah I know there was an issue was did
you have any problems with that I mean
they were they were talking about this
you know one of the issues we talked
about last week was they might have been
delayed because of bluetooth syncing
between the two headphones Apple I was
on a phone call with Apple they did not
confirm exactly why that is you know
what they told me during the process of
a developing a product we find that
there can be improved in both software
and hardware and that's what we found
with the air pods they'll never tell you
exactly what happened right yeah nice
guys no doubt and I appreciate that they
got these out to us the other thing I
like is what is it the other thing that
I like it's oh not a big deal everyone
wants to know what's the sound quality
on these it is slightly like ever so
slightly better than the ear pods just
it's just a subtly a little audio
quality better than the original
originally at the rim yeah these are the
I I need to enunciate and pronounce air
pods are the wireless ones ear pods are
the ones that come with your phone for
free so they're slightly they're
slightly better than them but if you're
in a loud area which you mostly are if
you're walking around you're commuting
you're doing things it literally won't
make a difference you know what about
like changing tracks and you know
pausing and stuff like that have you had
any problems with that okay so now I
guess you segue me perfectly you know
what I'd like them to fix antastic
okay so the number one thing we talked
about it but people are not talking
about this even some of my favorite
youtubers are completely missing this
because I don't think they've actually
done it okay yeah seriously because they
got it in three days these air
they show how you can DoubleTap on one
of the sides to prompt Siri and you can
but you also can tap on the side to
pause and play your music the problem is
you have to go into the settings of your
of the Bluetooth device the air pods and
select whether you want one or the other
your only either gonna say I can only do
Siri or I can only use this to pause and
play tracks the other thing it these do
not have you have no volume control
whatsoever on the air pods you have no
tracks skipping forwarding or advancing
whatsoever on the air pod so you only
have one option either Siri or to pause
and play and I want to make that very
clear so you're losing a whole lot of
functionality and again when you pop
these in the thing is that they do look
dorky but you don't see what they look
like you just feel it so I think a lot
of people that are Apple fans that are
already excited about these I honestly
think you're gonna really like them yeah
but I still think they look kind of
ridiculous in the prices hi 159 so the
number so when I talk about that
functionality Apple has to fix that and
there's ways that they can do that the
other thing that I wanted to talk about
what they can fix is I mentioned that
double tap where you just tap it right
in your ear so when you tap it you
actually have to push it pretty like
it's not like a light tap it's like a
tap tap and when you do that you're kind
of pushing the earbud into your ear yeah
and it's annoying like I don't like how
that feels I actually could be
uncomfortable it is and so I did I asked
Apple are you gonna make it less
sensitive is there a way to fix that
they're like well you will get used to
the pressure that you need to put on it
over time right saying oh it's me who's
typing it too hard but I've used these
for four days and I still have to tap it
harder than I'd like
so I don't like that I think what they
could do in the next gen is these aren't
like multi-touch air pods they're just
tapping that's its uses I basically
think the accelerometer gets jarred with
a double tap and that's how they know Oh
prompt Siri it takes a second to delay
so what I think they should do if you
really want to make these even more
special is these long annoying ugliest
stems right mm-hmm
they need to put some sort of
multi-touch functionality on it so I
talked about it doesn't have
functionality what if you could swipe
down and swipe up for volume that on one
side what if you could swipe down
and swipe up on the other side to change
the tracks that would be awesome and
then instead of double tapping really
hard maybe you find you still keep the
double tap what if you just touch on the
top of the air air pod and then that's
Siri on one side and then that's pause
and play on the other like you that
would give it all the functionality you
need right here so they don't have to
change the form factor so that's
something that I really hope that they
could fix I think it would actually make
them a lot better now could you bypass
that Siri prompt decision they have to
make by having enabling hey Siri on your
phone so you could just talk to it
instead of having it prompted with the
thing you know that's funny I haven't
actually the thing is that when you say
you know what the magic a chess phrase
it's supposed to by default have your
phone you know if you turn it on on your
phone it should so yeah I'd actually
never try that with the air pods at the
same time and I can't because my phone
is being used for you know our stream
right now but that's that's an
interesting point like I guess you could
the the thing is that no matter what
when you say hey you know who it takes
longer to talk to her to tell you to
turn down the volume and to turn down
the track than just either going
directly to your phone or using those
actual wired remote the wide remote
which is a lot better so that actually
slows down how you do things it doesn't
simplify it so this is a good try I
think there's a lot of people are gonna
that again if you're an Apple fan you
want to try these I think by default
you're already sold on them you already
know if you want these you're gonna get
these but someone like me uh I'd accept
them as a gift me too honestly without a
doubt but right now I would not
personally buy them further up for
variety reasons but again I'm not
knocking these I think it's a great
first step and they do the syncing is
untouchable but they need to improve
that lets so there you go that's I could
say a couple other things about the
singing but I don't want to linger on
this too long I think know people wanna
you're you're saying that sometimes the
tracks don't skip forward I mean that
happens with the regular headphones to
you you miss the clicks like I you have
to double click it to triple click to go
back yeah and then sometimes you'll
double click and then nothing happens
and you're like did I pause the track oh
yeah I paused it quite that happens to
me all the time yeah
quest question on here someone's asking
can you tap on either pod the answer is
yes also another subtle thing in the
settings for the actual air pods
you can use them independently so for
example it actually knows when you take
one or the other off which one you want
to use is the microphone for hey s or
you can default it and select it
manually to be okay I only want the left
one to always be my mic so because some
people may not want to use this as a
permanent headset they might just want
to use it really as a Bluetooth headset
which you can the other caveat is you
can this actually does connect to other
Bluetooth device like you could sing
this with other phones you just won't
get all the crazy functionality and the
syncing won't be as hot oh that's cool
but you but you can't do that then what
since we're on it and I guess people the
fact is that we're on a podcast so we
can talk about in an extended way yeah
the syncing is different weather here's
the thing that I like and don't like you
sing at your phone for the first time it
puts all that data into the iCloud so
then I can access it on my macbook pro
or my iPad the problem that I have is
that on my macbook pro i click up into
the bluetooth panel and then I go down
to my air pods and I connect them on my
iPad
I go into the music options and then I
find it and I said it they they really
need to make it a cohesive unified one
any product in proximity just show that
cool panel that shows up on your iPhone
and then just be able to select iPhone
iPad or Mac Book Pro depending if those
devices are nearby and if that showed on
every device you had it would just
alleviate and make it just a simple
clean
boop-boop-boop instead depending on your
device you have to go into different
settings to access it so it's connected
that sounds like a good ten minutes of
work to get it set up on all your device
well it no here's the thing it actually
is literally like 30 seconds to get it
set up yeah but it's just once you want
to switch using it from let's say I'm on
my phone uh I now want to use these
specific with my macbook I just have to
change an option I'm just saying
changing them looks different on each
device and it's something you just see
right yeah oh really I want to listen no
yeah iPad now so someone's asking how do
you change them it's in the Bluetooth
settings on your menu bar on the MacBook
Pro at the top and then on your iPad you
have to swipe to your music player and
then it'll show like you know you can
choose the output of where the audio
plays so it's it's a little different if
it's on your phone it's pretty much it's
like ready to roll pop him you're you're
good to go so how is your battery life
man have you run into any
issues I would see the thing is I've
been charging them constantly right you
know how they say oh they have about a
five hour battery life I've been
charging them constantly the oh the
other cavi the other thing I wanted to
bring up to people specifically with
this is repairs and services everyone's
asking what happens if you lose one what
happens if the battery dies so Apple has
their support page and I put the link up
on the show for you
Beach this one right here it's um it's
the next one actually and you can scroll
all the way down um yeah scroll it's
called the iPhone service there's a link
okay so scroll all the way down until
you see the air pod section I'm gonna
read this and describe it to people that
are listening okay so the air pods right
again this this dental floss guy is the
charger it's the charger for the air
pods which is cool so you can take it
wherever you want now here's here's how
they break it down if you are under
warranty and let's say the air pods or
the charging case no longer functions
within that one year so right it's just
an actual defect they will replace it
but then here where is where it gets
tricky there's two other aspects of this
that arse battery service or out of
warranty service so let's say you
completely damaged an air pod or you
lose one no matter what whether you're
under that one year warranty and this
makes sense if you lose it or completely
like roll over in a car or something
like that or get smashed it's going to
cost $69 for a single replacement of an
air pod well we're in the air pod one
air pod cost sixty nine dollars to
replace okay okay whether you're under
warranty or out of if it's damaged or
lost now even if you have a warranty it
well let's say I'm saying if you lose it
or it's like smashed by God let's say
you have it it just not functioning
properly you know they'll probably
they'll probably replace it okay but if
you like took it and you uh like Roy a
hammer Nate or something right some
someone's calling us on our on our Skype
I really I can't go don't want to say
dong haha okay so here's the other
aspect about that let's talk about the
battery service this is the battery
service is a little gray and I actually
talked to directly to Apple to try and
find out a little more specifics let me
just read really briefly how they
describe it our warranty this is on
Apple's website our warranty covers a
defective battery but it doesn't cover
wear from normal use if the battery
capacity
on your ear pods or charging case
decreases over time you can replace them
for a battery service fee now on this
breed out it says to replace air pods
for battery service a single one will be
$49 to replace the charging case it will
be $49 as well but then I said to myself
well so what exactly what are how do you
define really you know what is is it if
the batteries just completely dead or if
the battery's not functioning properly
what is the real definition so here's
the actual words directly from an email
that is okay to talk about that I got
from Apple and it is a little PR e but
it does at least give a little more
introspection of what they're thinking
about all batteries change in
performance over time however if there
is a defect in the product that causes
an unusual decrease in battery
performance which includes pretty much
any noticeable charge within the first
year of ownership then it would be
covered by the one-year warranty sorry
my voice is correct for replacements not
covered by warranty the 49 battery of
placement is applicable now I asked them
directly is this just if the battery
naturally fades or if it's actually a
defective dead they said they'll swap it
out if it's defective dead but like all
things the battery does dissipate over
time and so let's say towards the end of
the year your battery is only maybe at
three hours and not five and it's just I
kept that last end of the year I think
they're gonna make you pay for a new air
pod yeah I just the way that they
described again they didn't make it cut
and dry but they they at least got into
a little more nuance the statement was
all batteries change of performance over
time
no Sherlock right yeah so just to let
you know if it's damaged or lost $69 if
it's a battery performance issue it's
around $49 got it
got it 49 49 not too bad after a year I
guess yeah so there you go I mean that's
just the overall take on the air pods
and they are coming out
let the 19th of the UK the 21st in the
US and then right now again the
pre-orders are like what is it six six
weeks backed up so it's gonna be a while
to get them totally but I honestly you
know I I think they're they perform
better than I thought but I just don't
like
how they look quite honestly yeah they
look kind of silly and they need more
functionality and then then I'll then
I'll be like okay I'm paying attention
to you but I think there are better
solutions even a someone that calls in
about the beat X that I've been delayed
in will will answer that in the
voicemail so let's keep on rolling
through the show we know that also
earlier this week iOS 10.2 for iOS
devices watch OS 3 point 1 point 1 was
released as well as TV os 10.1 the we've
talked about iOS 10.2 for over and over
about the emojis and the TV app and blah
blah blah so I'm just gonna gonna gloss
over that one thing that Apple doesn't
always have the most flawless track
record is with the Apple watch OS 3.1
one update it actually bricked
completely bricked some Apple series 2
watches that's awful ok what do you do
when that happens so you want me tell
you what's even worse you want me to get
into this please under Apple's warranty
coverage they cannot restore an Apple
watch via the diagnostic port in store
at an Apple so you can't even go to an
Apple store and get it fixed you know
what you have to do you have to mail it
in if you have a brick Apple watch
series so you got to mail that in bro
that is frustrating man dude so I wonder
how long that price happens anyone let
us know how long that process takes I
feel for you feel like probably a couple
weeks three weeks maybe a month
you gotta mail it in like Oh hopefully
they send you a pre you know a
prepackaged well case or something
that's the thing right even if they send
you a replacement battery or sorry an
Apple watch now your replacement Apple
watch it's like a box to ship it in yeah
yeah yeah I would assume so that's what
they've done in the past but even just
like they can't your backup of your
Apple watches on your either on your
iCloud or your computer at home yeah
right so even if they just sent you a
new watch like oh I got a single it's
just a pain in the butt right is so
fearful to update in the future that's
why I always tell people wait a few days
even though we got to be on top of this
wait a day or two for any of these
software updates yeah any it's they've
no I'm just waiting for Apple to come
out clean just one time like it's been a
while since they've come out clean
I know more iOS devices Moe iOS devices
mo problems yeah
famous words a P dating notorious b.i.g
alright we'll stop singing
next up the Apple TV TV app I just
wanted to talk about it briefly this is
Apple's kind of new really they're their
new interface over all over anything for
the new Apple TV this is that whole TV
app that allows you to it's the goal is
for you to watch all your video through
via these TV apps that you're sorry via
your different TV network apps like AMC
Hulu HBO now food network things like
that they want you to just have one
destination watch it all and that's
contained in this TV app from Apple TV
right yeah movies TV shows people's
tables now the issue that I have is I
set this all up one of the advantages of
TV OS 10.1 is this whole thing called
single sign-on Beach so that's right you
site you have a cable provider yeah you
sign in and then it basically unlocks
this so all of your apps you don't have
to sign it individually it just works
right that's really cool that's a big
right right right right you feel that no
matter what you always set up everything
individually yep okay this is a great
idea in theory but then when you go into
the settings of your Apple TV and you go
to single sign-on there's like eight
cable carriers and three of them do not
include Xfinity do not include Time
Warner does not include Verizon FiOS
really those are three major networks
I'm sorry major cables provide so the
whole dream of single sign-on
that's like all west coast yeah no
there's no Bay Area no LA do you know
they get here because they didn't cut
the deal so what does that mean now
right if you don't have single sign-on
that means you have to individually like
go into every app and you know it gives
you a code you go to a website you type
in the code and unlocks and you're like
okay fine but then even at that some
networks that are even part of your
Comcast Xfinity setup like mine aren't
and haven't signed on board
like Comedy Central doesn't it won't
won't unlock for me Food Network won't
unlock for me purely because of these
different rights deals and everything
that's so it's like look this is a
really nice thing if you're if the
networks and the shows you watch like
really if you buy Apple stuff through
their iTunes Store movies and TV shows
you're gonna be fine and if a few of
those networks on the side like HBO now
and AMC and stuff like that you got your
Walking Dead your West world your Game
of Thrones yeah then you're pretty good
but when it comes to like everything not
everyone is gonna be happy about this
yeah so is that so those at ours is yeah
they exist exist but you can't log into
them currently some of them will how
about this depending on your cable
company will how about this they won't
be compatible with the TV app which is
an aggregator that tries to combine them
all in one Apple's trying to make this
one-stop shop but again if you can't
unlock the credentials for some of these
network apps they aren't gonna be part
of it yeah that's interesting so it's
funny that they would allow the app to
exist on there I mean I don't know well
they can walk I don't know you can watch
free stuff on them sometimes right so I
like promoted exactly yours and
sometimes they'll let episodes that are
old I show up on there so that's that's
that's what you just need to be aware of
and then there's other aspects like they
changed the home button on the Apple TV
used to go to the home screen now it
defaults to the watch TV section of the
app which is like that's not my home
screen so you can actually change that
in the settings I think we had a caller
asked about that so I'll talk about it
then so there you go some quick other
bullet points I don't know if you're
excited about this Beach Amazon coming
to the Apple TV Amazon like the shopping
app oh not the prime not the prime video
I have so many different ways to use
Amazon I don't really care do you care
about Amazon Prime video on your Apple
to you I mean no I don't have Apple TV I
mean I don't care have I already have a
Nintendo Wii U oh yeah and a ps4 so
there's no reason for me yeah you know I
have Amazon on those you have what you
need yeah also like one quick reminder
Netflix and Amazon Prime are not part of
this whole watch TV app thing
it combines everything the goal is for
them to basically say hey you have this
one place you watch the show on your
computer now when you pick up your
iPhone or iPad you can watch it there
that's something to do that in this day
and age yes absolutely I want everything
it was so many networks and like
channels and YouTube you know how they
would have really done this if they
actually got a TV streaming subscription
service true they were able to land it
so they have the right idea but I'm not
gonna knock on them maybe maybe
magically every network and every video
on-demand service says Apple here take
our customer data let will let you know
what they watch how long they watch when
they watch what demographic is here take
this we just want to help you out it's
not gonna happen no because every every
network is building their own place for
that now so just gonna become even more
difficult
yeah well tinder for Apple TV also
coming up do you want to want to see
what it looks like sure sure yeah tinder
or an Apple TV okay here I have the blog
post there's a there's a youtube link
that I put on the side of it that I
haven't even really seen it I don't for
the record I don't use tinder even to
set up an account I would get in lots of
trouble so I don't use tinder I never
have neither I buy I've downloaded it
but I didn't use it so what's better I
mean before you could swipe away people
like worthless cards on your phone now
you can humiliate people with your
friends and family while you do it
I think that's a great bonus SWE's who
who asked for this I don't know did you
ask you relay to do it on a bigger
screen you kind of want it on a private

is working right now but uh that's Lucy
I don't know what's what people are
saying okay well we're asking for that
well we'll get your opinions we'll get
you drunk people like tinder like nah no
they're coming into just a little bit of
delay you know from the time I speak to
the time it streams okay here's some
cool finger finger stuff fingerprint
scanner stuff for the future I phone
companies cement synaptics sy n AP T ICS
synaptics debuted their new fingerprint
sensors capable of scanning through
display glass dude cool so we know that
the really the galaxy s 8 and the iPhone
potential iPhone future iPhone X iPhone
8 if they really want to be boring so
goodbye to the home button everybody say
la vie I'm kind of stoked on that
because I ride casual carpool in the
morning yeah and my home button makes a
noise oh and I'm wondering like
sometimes I've sinned there I'm like am
i annoying everyone in this car except
pushing my own but hey that's just me I
like that's my paranoid yeah that's your
OCD paranoia but it does it makes a
noise so you know you're okay with this
I'm okay with it
so check out some of the tech behind
this the Cape the sensors of the for
this thing it's called the FS 9 oh sorry
it's the FS 9100 it's a natural ID
optical fingerprint sensor capable of
scanning a fingerprint through one
millimeter of full cover glass so
obviously it allows for a free button
design here's the other information that
you might not know about the sensors
eliminate the need for cutouts but cut
because they're under glass what does
that mean the sensor itself is scratch
proof it's waterproof and responds well
to wet fingers that's good because we
all have wet fingers
no comment wet finger users you should
be happy about the upcoming that's a
feature there's there's times after you
do the dishes or you totally you're like
I can't unlock my phone crap totally I
got a dry my finger that's the only time
my fingers are wet all right moving on
to the next so anyways this tech is
expected to come out and be available
for manufacturers and basically consumer
electronic companies sometime during the
second quarter of next year it's great
it's another cool way to get our finger
all our finger prints
Omar yeah in the NSA NSA data why is
someone sending me kiss lips when I just
talked about a wet finger on periscope
I'm really I think you know why bruh I
think I'm I think I dunno what I'm gonna
add them to my buddies listen really not
all right next up article LG has said to
supply apple with foldable displays for
future iPhones are you ready for this
LG's division this is according to ET
news LG's division is developing and
will start mass producing the foldable
displays I put a video link in the in
the notes if you want to see some of
this don't don't stop this start mass
producing foldable displays for
smartphones in 2018 they'll supply them
to Apple Google and Microsoft according
to the South Korean website LG has shown
off a lot of these futuristic looking
kind of curved and foldable displays
over the past years we're going to CES
umer Electronics Show in the first week
of January at CES this past year they
just wrapped a phone on a wrist like a
cuff with a screen baby it's pretty cool
but the best part of this video is the
acting hold was that voice real real
real or not what do you think real nah
nah nah I like pictures of adorable
kitties so she's showing off like a
foldable
oh no you gotta fall pictures of kitties
again turn the volume down before I used
my eye my ears melt that's awesome
no crazy I gotta show love for her she's
she's doing her job I just she did a
great job very very unique voice there
but again foldable displays whether
they're for you know like a book type
tablet option or rapa belong your wrists
come on that's crazy that's like those
toys that you know like they slap and
like land you know I'm talking about the
flapper is what do they call that thing
the slap bracelets or whatever yeah what
exactly I was like I love those things
but it's gonna have what to do that with
my phone and be like okay I gotta get
out here someone needs to call in next
week or at least I guess a month from
now tell us what are those bracelets
going he'll tell us in the chatroom yeah
they will all right should we go check
out our voicemails let's check out some
voicemails y'all got some good ones we
always have great ones you guys are
badass here we go
hey guys it's my clunking which UK I've
been waiting episode after episode after
episode for somebody to touch upon this
small aspect of the new MacBook and by
the way happy ere pause today a you know
the larger trackpad obviously that
signals you know the company is thinking
about perhaps a tablet with more with
the 3d touch capability I'm just
wondering if you guys have boosting the
information about that anyway have a
great holiday in the next few weeks
thanks bye alright thanks for the call I
did want to touch upon he's asking about
just the idea of bringing 3d touch to
the laptops I think the way the 3d touch
has been made up to this point is made
for you know like a mobile device like a
phone because it fits your hand you can
press on it pressure-sensitive there you
go right the way that a desktop OS at
least apples right now is is structured
you could put 3d touch on the trackpad
or maybe you should just give me a
touchscreen laptop
please just touch screen laptop me but
again I think that the actual interface
of how you would use your laptop more
Allah iPad mode maybe like a hybrid OS
on who has high who has a hybrid OS that
does touch and like a desktop remember
you can't remember off the top of my
head it's really difficult yeah yeah so
anyways mots the applesauce maker I got
the mods I got that much so um they
needed the OS would be able to
complement that also having 3d touch
operate on a phone differently than how
it operates on a laptop just would feel
even more disconnected yeah yeah you
gotta use it exactly the same way like
sometimes you get kind of like stuck in
a you know in a movement with a mouse
yeah you know sometimes you're like
swipe and then the whole screen moves
you're like oh I gotta get back
would you say Beach you know what humans
say when they mess up but something bad
happens they usually say that word that
starts with that that's that's just
naughty but yeah like I can see that
being kind of a pain in the ass even the
trackpad it's so big yeah it's so big
that people I have a couple buddies of
mine that a complain like look I'm still
trying to get rid it get used to it but
they don't feel that it has really good
palm palm rejection oh really
technology hmm yeah that's always
awkward to say palm rejection okay so
it's like how about this so it's like
when you're when you're touching it but
then your palm is resting on at the same
time you know register it as multiple
touches instead of you just like they
have a gate your mouse right that's bad
yeah palm rejection alright next call
alright thanks Carl ciao hey Brian this
is Javier from the Metroplex up here in
North Texas I'm calling in regards to
the new beats X wireless earphones I was
wondering if you knew when they were
going to be released since they are
owned by Apple thanks I love yourself
guys keep it up when they call beats axe
beats axe oh it's so apple also released
through their beats part through their
beats you know they own them
who their beats brand or line of
headphones they also released other
earpods earbuds headphones that have the
w1 chip technology inside them as well
so those beats acts are like super
minimalistic they you know have a kind
of like almost that I don't know if
you're familiar with a jaybird
headphones but they're similar in just
how small and how compact they are so I
heard something that was really
interesting so first of all rumblings
are pointing to that we might see the
beat X headphones actually come out
these are their true earbuds or your pot
earbuds they're connected with a wire
and they have physical remotes on them
they might be coming out sometime in
February but I got even something even
crazier so I know someone who has used
them and it has tried them and has
access behind the scenes to Apple stuff
and he told me he's like he really
thinks they're delaying the beat X
headphones for a couple reasons one of
the main reasons is that he says they
sound better than the air pods and he
says that he feels they're delaying it a
not to take some shine away from them
not to come not to basically have them
compete but also to kind of recap the
narrative that makes the air pods
different from the beat X headphones cuz
they are sold from the same company yeah
yeah at the you know ultimately and I
just found that really interesting I'm
like okay how much better are they he
just said they have a fuller deeper
sound and the fact that they have you
know the actual wired controls are
really light and I'm like dude but he
said they literally sound better and
again they use the w1 chip so they have
that awesome syncing capability with
your iOS products they're only like 10
dollars cheaper than the air pause which
is kind of interesting you think they'd
be a little more do you think names cuz
they sound better that's the scoop that
we have so thanks for calling that's all
I know right now okay
next call hey guys happy holidays
this is James from Washington so Apple I
have the iPhone 6s with the battery
issue last month I was told my phone
didn't have any battery issues even
though I went to the whole process
erasing the whole thing per Apple and
took three hours to get my backup put
back on the phone and now I'm being told
that it is
a phone with the battery issue my Apple
TV is totally messed up how in the heck
do you get rid of the Apple TV app I
hate that it goes back to that app every
single time and none of my channels seem
to be our apps seem to be loading
they're having lots of issues now and
I'm just I'm not sure I'm starting to
begin to have a hate love relationship
to the Apple products and I was just
wondering aside from Tim Cook being the
CEO if you guys think that there's more
going on internally with Apple that's
causing all these issues and there yeah
well so that was there's a lot of things
to touch upon okay first thing let's
talk about the Apple TV issues like they
always get me back into that Apple TV
app so there is a way in the settings of
the Apple TV to change that so what you
want to do is you go into settings and
then you go into I think it's devices
and remotes and then from there you'll
see remote and by default after the
update happened
it says TV app what you'll want to
change it back to is the home screen and
guess what my friend once you do that
you'll know it'll now whenever you hit
that home screen button that it was
intended to be in it will take you back
to your front-facing home screen and not
the TV app so for all of you that are
wondering like what the heck how can I
fix that jump into the settings it is
there and you can change that the other
aspect of some some apps not working in
some not I had to reconnect all of my
apps are you serious yeah I had to so
that whole sign-on thing I had to go
into every single one to reconnect them
Oh after this update after the update
yeah
it wasn't like apps still worth the same
like it just wasn't so that's something
that you should be aware so that might
be definitely some time aside yeah so
that might be the issue and then the
question to talk about just what's going
on with Apple again what about is about
his battery on his phone yeah oh yeah
I'm sorry I'm sorry I
I like I like how the funny thing about
is that was a cold event because he
didn't he said he started his comment or
his his talk about he started like this
so Apple and I really like that so I
think if you have gripes or issues that
are hurting you emotionally I want you
to Conte so Apple like let's talk to
them let's this can be our voice to them
cuz I gotta get some sad music for that
yeah so Apple it's very sad
so uh anyways best of luck keep your
head up but from the innovation
standpoint side look we'll see what
happens in 2008 in 2017 hopefully they
get they get some stuff together because
everything we predicted this year
happened which was and people weren't
happy when I called it out last year but
it happened yeah don't mess with no
shirt on his baby we didn't predict that
the air pods would be delayed for a few
months and we didn't predict that Apple
watches will get break didn't predict a
lot of things that's sorry yeah you
can't predict everything but you can do
the big stuff so alright you have one
more call yes we do awesome okay hey
Brian and Beecham this is Mark from
Portland Oregon I'm wondering about the
Mac Pro line or are we ever going to see
an improved model after the 2013 version
if so is it going to cut down on
performance just for design or what can
we expect in that regard Thanks jump in
here man
something that's interesting about this
call is that he's learnt already
preempting like he's already has it in
his mind like Apple's gonna like get rid
of something for the sake of design and
that's kind of like we're all Apple fans
are right now they're like what is up on
and get rid of next what do I have to
you know what do I have to not live with
that I'm used to living with on the next
iteration so that's just very
interesting it's a sad state of affairs
it's like they're conditioning there oh
they're their clientele to think like
this now no it's what is it what are
they gonna take away from me next it
happened with the iPhone it happened
with the MacBook Pro oh how about
they're getting rid of the airport
wireless routers yes that's been
reported
the Mac Pro has not been updated in
three years Wow
a product that when Phil Schiller went
onstage he bragged and said can't
innovate my ass well he actually was
right
haha they haven't done anything
different to it for three this is their
powerhouse desktop
quite honestly I wonder if they're just
gonna let it fade away and not actually
build the desktop other than the iMac
that's that's completely possible I mean
it is and what's the problem with that I
mean they pitched the Mac Pro as a
computer for power users for graphic
designers for artists engineers bla bla
bla bla bla people that need that power
yeah
it has not lived up to that at all hmm I
mean we have we have them in our office
right when they came out three years ago
was like oh it's gotta get the latest
Mac and we never none of us did right
well some I mean what I'm saying like
people are using them they're not happy
with them yeah yeah they really aren't
yeah I've only really seen one in the Y
and not even in the wild here yeah we
have I think we have one or two we -
yeah so I just I just the way he phrased
his question and his phone call was just
totally interesting to me like Apple
users are like okay what are they gonna
are they gonna screw us on the next or
that right wedding in it what are they
so I would tend to feel like that's not
a way to win over your like there's a
lot of people that finally after you
okay I got my buddy my buddy I'm not
gonna name drop here noob D ed boon
Mortal Kombat trader he's like dude
you're legend legendary and he's awesome
he's a great guy I shortened that I know
what the song sounds like you don't want
me to do the whole thing but he's like
dude you're she's like you're pretty
hard on Apple we started talking well
and we started I said look you've you've
seen Apple during the heyday so if we
look how different they are now and then
he started talking about yeah when are
they gonna do this they have an update
that Mac Pro in three years he's like
I'm like really mad at I'm like look
you're sounding like you know like
everything you told me you are sounding
like me now I mean he he represents a
die-hard loyal fan like many of you are
that listen to this that are fresh train
so if our show becomes a place to vent
and it's a cathartic release then then
that's what it is
that's what it is it's funny because
people in the chatroom we weren't saying
like what are you guys gonna take away
from the show next year what is good
what are you guys gonna do this show to
like make it less you know like I don't
know there's making jokes you mean like
what can we do for this we're gonna
we're gonna strip down the show next
year just like Apple does to other
products over last offer you know well
we could remove a piece of clothing in
each episode oh yeah strips strips extra
crunchy until Apple adds a new feature
well we'll remove just like that every
time I hear you know every time they
remove a feature from a product next
year
we'll have to just wear one less thing
it could be a ring it could be a shirt
it could be a sock and we'll see what we
get down to you until we can no longer
pass FCC rules yeah we're gonna like
consuming dude no ports we're not gonna
do that
it's Mortal Kombat out here all right
everybody that's gonna do it for this
week again for the holidays we'll be
gone so don't worry we didn't leave you
