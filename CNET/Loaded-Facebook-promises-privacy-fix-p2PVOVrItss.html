Facebook has disabled applications that
were found to transmit users personal
identifying information to dozens of
advertisers and tracking companies the
wall street journal found Facebook
guilty of this privacy violation this
week causing what I think is a
disproportionate blowback against
facebook on the web facebook says that
they are disabling these applications
and that there was no evidence that any
personal information was misused or even
collected Research In Motion announced
the blackberry 9670 flip phone they call
it the blackberry style it has an
external screen for need-to-know
information like time and your messages
but it also has a full keyboard on the
flip side it runs BlackBerry OS 6.0 and
is available for pre-order for
ninety-nine dollars with sprint and if
you want tunes on that new BlackBerry
you can get the Rhapsody application the
streaming music service is now available
for all blackberry phones this means you
can stream albums and songs on demand if
you're a rhapsody client and you have
blackberry OS 5.0 or higher you can
stream over 3g or Wi-Fi but in the
future downloads will be available for
offline listening to and if you're an
oak user you might be let to know that a
software upgrade is on the way it will
let you read your books across all your
nook devices so if you read on the nook
you can pick up where you left off on
the nook app in the iPhone or on your PC
there will also be improved search and
faster page-turning when the update
comes out next month and microsoft
released a lineup of games that will go
with Kinect when it launches on November
fourth the motion gaming system will
have all the games that were shown at e3
this summer but also some that I had not
been aware of like zumba fitness which
is all the exercise rage with some of my
friends and harry potter the deathly
hallows part one so get ready to stupefy
you can read about the entire lineup at
cnet com and finally plio the dinosaur
is back in time for the holidays this is
the robot dinosaur that responds to
petting and love the new and improved
plio has a two-hour battery tougher skin
and more sensors including smell gravity
temperature voice recognition
internal clock it also comes in blue and
pink instead of just green like the
first one we don't know pricing yet so
we're hoping it's not too expensive
because after all it doesn't do much
more than just be adorable those are
your headlines for today I will see you
tomorrow at more i'm natali del conte
