feet 2012 I'm Wayne Cunningham in the
studio here with antuan goodwin we're
not in the studio we're not really in
this video we're actually on the show
floor at the geneva auto show this is
the F 2012 geneva auto show the a second
international auto show we in Geneva got
the bag right here to prove it and so
there's been 80 one of these before now
this is indeed Eva this makes it sort of
the neutral ground show of Europe
there's an equal representation of the
German automakers and the French
automakers which both have a huge
presence in Europe of course there's a
lot of other ones around 2i think we
have co-op which is a Spanish brand i
believe and make their german own the
you know volkswagen yeah but yeah
they're different a lot of different
companies the japanese manufacturers
here of course north american
manufacturers as well Chrysler's have it
has a pretty big presence here with with
the jeep booth directly across from
Ferrari but and I saw over there's
actually a Chevy booth over here right
next to the Cadillac move of course GM's
representation and I saw in that booth
they actually had guys walking around
wearing that police uniforms with a
patch on the side that's at San
Francisco police there bit out of their
jurisdiction I think I think so they're
also women like roller skating around
them too so I think that's part of the
show and maybe not so much GM security I
don't know why they would have imported
San Francisco policeman here this is
some weird theme
just don't understand the connection
between the two of those yeah I don't
really get that theme necessarily but
one thing I did see near there which was
pretty cool was the infinity emergy this
is a new concept car from infinity and
it was actually it's really enough it
was actually built and designed in that
Europe out of the Nissan infinities at
european design centers as opposed to
being built in japan these are the same
guys who built the juke-r mind you yeah
they've got a little interesting lingo
Don these guys obviously there's an
independent spirit going on in Nissan
infinities European design headquarters
so I'm expecting something crazy from
this mr g so what are we dealing with
here well it's actually not as crazy the
Duke car it's actually really cool
looking this is a mid-engine sports car
and it's got a really nice design it
actually is kind of reminiscent of the
old NSX and the newer NSX to the concept
we've been seen around this is also a
concept is called the emerge Ashley so
that tells you right there that it's
actually got an electric element to it
it takes advantage of the electric
powertrain that Nissan is used in the
leap as well except way differently
because it has two electric motors
powering the two rear wheels lithium-ion
battery pack and a range extender
gasoline engine now it needs that
gasoline engine because it only goes 30
miles range on those electric motors
right but I'm hoping hoping because I've
seen this car it's really sleek like
formed by wind sleek supercar sleep so
I'm hoping that for those 30 miles
released get to have some fun well i'm
not sure if you do it for the full 30
miles but it will get you to 60 in four
seconds ok i'm impressed which is yeah
that's good I mean it's not like as good
as you can be I mean those are my faster
cars but they also said 220 miles per
hour in 30 seconds
okay that's got to be pretty good too
got to be pretty good and I'm assuming
what you get past that 30 mile mark
that's when that gasoline engine that
sits in the middle of the vehicle kicks
on and starts generating electricity for
the right now well if you have you blown
out your battery from you stuff a starts
like that yeah you know if you've got no
more juice then yeah then then you get
that engine and get your extra range now
they didn't have they haven't released
when he specs about this we don't know
what happens when you're under engine
power probably doesn't go nearly as fast
right and the concept it probably
doesn't even run they're probably just
me they could just roll out a clay model
would call it a day yeah a lot of these
concepts we never actually see them
driving on the roads and there's some
exceptions like a Nissan also has their
nismo RC they're sort of racing version
of the leaf and that when they've
actually been driving around other
people driven it so they can't do things
like this yeah anta and I would love to
see this this emergy make it into
production somehow because it is really
a beautiful looking car and
he's never had a real sports car like
that I mean certainly the G coops are
really nice and fast and sporty but it's
not like hardcore sports car no no I
mean well I guess the IPL geez art do
you know it's kind of like the the
vehicle that I'm thinking is sort of the
opposite side of the coin of this
because it's also green it's also pretty
close to production ready but it's not
performance oriented or attractive at
all is the Toyota ft bh concept and
that's basically they're small i guess
their idea for like what a future Yaris
hybrid would be or the prius of the next
generation essentially they kind of
built this really small hatchback style
vehicle using I guess what they would
consider to be economically viable and
eco-friendly uh
materials in kind practices so it's not
formed out of a single piece of carbon
fiber or anything like that it's got a
really sleek profile that gives an
extremely low coefficient of drag oh
yeah that's that really ugly car I saw
over there in the Toyota B&amp;amp;AMP it's got
a front that looks a little like the bow
of a boat I keep seeing it out of the
corner of my eye and I just don't want
to but it gets get this sort of like it
looks like a boat flipped upside down
but it's did these weird channels in the
front headlights that kind of float out
on bars the horrible thing is I mean
that is extremely aerodynamic they said
point 235 coefficient of drag which is
better than the prius right and the
previous is really good as far as they
aren't clean point 25 on the phrase they
claim that yeah if you get the big rims
you lose that and so the you know this
car because it is so I dynamically
efficient this may be what future cars
look like just so they can get that low
coefficient of graph and that's that'd
be a shame yeah they're also trying to
keep the weight down and they're also
going working with a smaller engine here
it's a one liter atkinson cycle gasoline
engine so it's basically a you know the
pre if you're dealing with two and some
change leaders this is a much smaller
engine because it's a much lighter car
also a smaller cars it's about the same
size of the yard but it's actually got i
think more interior space yeah it's got
sort of a hatchback to a weird sort of
bubble looking hatchback kind of ugly
too it's also got what look like Racing
lawn chairs for seats there are these
two frame recaro seats with a sort of
mesh that used to sue mming they're
really light they don't look very
comfortable way to save weight in that
thing too and I know they said doing the
conversion from leaders 200 kilometers
they said well I guess that's 2.1 liters
200 kilometers which translates to about
112 miles per gallon you know it's an
extremely high fuel efficiency in the
vehicle a claim fuel efficiency from
this concept but I don't know if I would
want to be driving that a car around
like I think at that point I just get a
motorcycle kind of has a cool matte
white finish to it which makes it easy
to photograph all these glossy cars on
these lights they usually end up looking
like starfield but i do like this sort
of matte paint but it's like anything
else about it and then it's flanked by
two equally ugly cars you know they're
in s4 concept and their fuel cell fvr
spdr concept also ugly so it's just like
a lot of hug happening at the front of
toyota's boot right you've seen a little
more ugly here too in the form of a
Bentley and let's be out if Billy
doesn't make good looking cars but some
kind of a way they manage to take the
design cues from the molson and the
Continental and put them on a vehicle
that's even uglier than either of those
vehicles and that's the Bentley exp 9f
concept so I'm thinking what happened if
someone in families marketing department
said hey you know fortress make it a ton
of money on those Cayenne I think we
should get in on this SUV thing and then
they just did it I wouldn't be surprised
to find if that same Cayenne platform is
underneath that since Bentley's a member
of the VW group so that same platform
that's underneath the q7 and the touareg
and the Cayenne I'm sure really just
grabbed that and then they tossed their
w12 engine under the hood
it 8-speed transmission basically the
power train from the current Continental
GT with the w12 and that's their SUV so
as far as an SUV is like high up is it
something that looks like a go off road
or anything like that it's pretty high
up it's a large SUV again I think it's
about the same size like the audi q7 so
it looks like it could go off road but
it's got 23 inch chrome rims with
extremely thin tires and you know a lot
of chrome work on the front they've cut
kind of got this turbine theme happening
at the front of the vehicle where the
lights have these sort of radial turbine
blades inside of them but then out back
there doing something completely
different with the sort of squared and
very linear thing happening so it looked
like it was designed by two different
committees even two different countries
who were communicating via teletraan or
whatever tell if I tell you tonight but
inside it's it's what you expect from
Bentley really nice materials just
extremely comfortable really quiet cabin
where the look would look like a
new cabin tech interface for Bentley
they've got like completely virtual
gauges that are on LCDs they've got a
tablet-based rear seat entertainment
system all glass roof and best of all
you can't see the outside of the vehicle
when you're sitting in it so you don't
worry about that right i was looking fab
you know if you're inside you don't
really care what it looks like outside
and it's the bentley so it's super
comfortable but of course it's still a
concept so whether they'll produce it or
not is
it shouldn't be hard for them to produce
it they've got a 10 year old engine a
two-year-old transmission and then
basically designed is there sort of
coach building for the interior that
they're already doing on the mall sign
so if they've if that platform is truly
borrowed from the rest of the VW Group
it wouldn't be hard for them to make it
the problem is I don't think anyone
would buy it well the car I would prefer
as opposed to that Bentley is the
rolls-royce phantom series to avoid back
we've got rolls-royce I mean this is
sort of a rare event when rolls-royce
actually has you know an update to their
cars and the Phantom is sort of
perennial and the series too doesn't it
has some different design fuse than the
current phantom like it looks like the
rear trunk drops down a little more a
little more curved that still got that
massive kind of coach like look to it
and the carriage doors they call them
opening up but interesting enough that
phantom series to book not only affects
the the standard phantom the big sedan
it also affects the phantom coupe and
the Drophead coupe too so they all are
using the same body and I imagine with
that that body design that redesign
they've mentioned to you that the engine
is a little bit cleaner less co2
production which of course they're very
concerned about here but in that case
it's like 350 grams per kilometer which
is way it above the targets you know
other companies we're reaching for
fortunately they're probably only sell
five of these for years so you're not
really hurting the environment that much
as it's not a huge impact as again
there's not a lot of them on the road I
guess at that point you're sure fer
would be the one hurting you know and I
imagine that they've got the new
electronics in there too because
rules race is part of the BMW group and
they've been Bennett Eve benefiting from
my BMW is really good cabin electronics
and BMWs had some updates since the last
phantom came out so it's time to
rolls-royce benefited from those updates
as well maybe they'll get the mini
connect system in your roles where I so
talk to you that'd be awesome except for
it would be goofy it'd be really kind of
snooty that's right like a butler your
your app connection there you're
connected drive in the rolls-royce I
think they probably do have something
like that I mean it's kind of the the
next thing you know think they would
definitely fit in call it Jarvis or
something that's ever on pretending like
you're Tony Stark they're gonna be
pretty awesome but you were telling me
about someone else he was like a new
Kevin take package like what's what's
going on and out ya outta ya so this is
actually a car that's more affordable
for most people audi a3 the new audi a3
and it's interesting that the Consumer
Electronics Show this year we saw the
dashboard for this car we saw the new
interface for this car but we didn't see
the car the car is here and they
unveiled its actually shorter the one
thing I've here is actually a three-door
not a five door and we're used to we
only get the 5-door in the US but they
probably they will soon have a 5-door
version which they'll probably show
maybe at the New York Auto Show next
month
but it looks like a shorter car looked
shorter than the current a free to my
eyes I haven't actually compared the
specs yet but it is a nice little car in
the cabin tech package is really
impressive because they manage to put a
lot of the same stuff that you get in
the a6 a7 a8 the really big premium cars
in the a3 and they three in the US is
like their cheapest got great so you can
basically if you want a small car but
you still want a really nice car you
don't have to make the compromise ago do
I kind of want the Bing and all of them
found system but I don't want to get the
a64 it exactly and that's yeah that's a
key point is you can actually get a bang
and olufsen sound system in the audi a3
it's a cheaper system than they're
really high-end ones and it only cost
nine hundred dollars only 900 bucks a
deal or nine hundred euro is what I
heard so well I don't know what that's
going to translate a few dollars in
North American market but it sounded
really good I got a demo of the audio
system in there and really crisp and
clean as you can i'd expect from beggin
all ups and they don't have the little
acoustic lenses that rise up out of the
dash like in some of the other systems
so to compensate they've actually got
light up rings around the door speakers
oh so like a kia soul yeah a little bit
you wouldn't think that you'd see them
doing that but i guess there's sort of
the theatricality to bang an elephant
but I do kind of think that acoustic
lens is kind of their trademark
I'm surprised to see that it's not there
even if it's just not motorized so kind
of you know rather see like a fixed pair
of those lenses or at least a fixed
Center one that maybe doesn't move yeah
why they chose not to do that it might
have been purely cost might have been
that they saw doesn't sound is just you
know in the lower slightly lower quality
sound they're going for in the three
they might have said you know other
speakers we have are good enough they
have just standard a pillar tweeters
right and maybe Audi just said we don't
we don't have room for you to put these
these acoustic lenses in our dashboard
that's possibly might have been a
packaging problem there too yeah one
thing to load the screen in the a3 it
actually rises up straight out of the in
the middle of the dashboard it's not a
touchscreen but it is very thin because
it's LED backlight and so that allows
them have it's pretty much iphone so
kind of looks like a pop tart yeah
that's just you know tena get the
rounded edges and it just kind of comes
straight up it's like a pop tart but
instead of frosting screen that's pretty
awesome which is pretty tasty right
there yeah definitely and the control
for it they have their multi media
controller they call two mm I but on top
of the little dial for the MMI is a
touch surface so you can actually trace
letters and stuff on there and make
choices from what's on the screen it's
good take taking advantage of the small
spacer or making doing the small space
of the
in the a 6 and the 8 you got more space
you got space actually put a touchpad
but you've got a smaller centres tunnel
in the 83 so you got to put it somewhere
yeah why not take a take advantage of
the speakers on top of that dial there
were two more cards that i saw this year
that i think i have to mention before we
leave the first one is a little bit
stupid in my opinion but it's stupid in
the sense that the company that makes it
is awesome because of their stupid
dinner and that's the the Lamborghini
Aventador Jane I'm cilenia dorje I've
seen an Aventador right what is the jane
i don't know i know where that jay came
from but essentially what they've done
if they've taken an invention or LP
700-4 and then chop the top off of it
but then instead of like a regular car
company putting a convertible top up
there that you can close when it rains
they just said nope we're just going to
not have a top and while reddit we're
not going to have a wind screen anyway
either so they cut that off too and then
they said well this is good enough and
then they sold it for 2.1 million euro
to somebody and they're not going to
make any more one just one one car yeah
most automakers make one concept car and
then it just ends up in a and if
someone's garage somewhere to 20 years
from now but they're actually selling
this one or have sold it to someone for
2.1 million euro so the one aventador j
is at the show here it's there okay and
well so the the owner is nearby making
sure no scratches the paint right we got
photos of that car up on the site yeah
we do we did excellent but then if
you're into like you're looking for an
awesome super car sometimes you can
actually buy enough Ferrari actually I
had a rare debut with their new f12
berlinetta and essentially I think it
shows a lot in common with the FF that
made you too recently there a shooting
brake right well this is a new platform
for them pretty much right so it's got
the same v12 engine but way more power
740 horsepower instead of an
all-wheel-drive system it's rear-wheel
drive only because this is basically
their 599 replacement that front-engine
rear-drive grand tourer and in the
photos that we saw before the show we
talked about in the last episode of car
tech lab it looked a little weird kind
of had this Viper vibe going on with it
in the photos it's got a big deep
contour on the side to which might
disturb me at a very snake-like face
yeah when you see it in person it
actually printed really well in the
sheet metal and in my opinion it's the
best-looking car in their lineup right
now that deep imprint in the side is
actually part of their aerobridge so
what happens is the air comes over the
hood of the vehicle generating downforce
then it enters two inlets where it gets
channeled underneath this sort of like
floating wing that kind of sits where
the the rocker panel meets the window
and it goes down through those side
channels where it interacts with air
coming off of the front wheels reducing
drag pretty much the entire car is an
aerodynamic element any curve that you
see on this vehicle has been wind tunnel
tested and designed to reduce drag or
generate down for us we can do 120 miles
per hours car this car the vehicle is
pushing down on the front end with
almost 270 pounds of downforce Wow those
cars are lifting at that point pretty
awesome and with 740 horsepower you can
get way above that 120 miles per oh yeah
that's definitely I think in the top
speed of 200 and some change at 220
something oh yeah and that's that's
going to be one of the well they're
competing in bugatti territory yeah i
mean they don't exactly have a thousand
in one horsepower but this is a much
lighter vehicle than ave right it's
actually lighter than the previous
dinner the 599 that it replaces it's got
a shorter wheelbase so it should be more
nimble also but it's still a pretty big
car you see at park next to the 458
Italia and it makes that 458 look like a
lotus yeah but you see it parked next to
the the FF next to it the FF just looks
like a gigantic abomination last week I
thought the FF was a good-looking car in
the wake of the the f12 berlinetta it's
just not going to do it for me anymore
right it's spoiled it I mean this is
that Ferrari GT cars like the 599 and
now the f12 berlinetta is I mean those
are the cars for you get in you cruise
to the Opera the grocery store
you know I mean it's not necessarily the
race around cars even you can racer
editor for your horse for I think they
want to change that opinion yeah and I
think this is kind of like in the wake
of the vehicles like the the 599 X which
was really hardcore race only this has
got more power than their their tracks
special version of the 599 and this what
zoopla is the base model of the the f12
chatting so right but as opposed to like
the app for the 458 Italia I mean that
well that was more of a you know I get
to take it to attract table you can
afford to take a car like that to the
track there but it's up that's more of a
showy sort of sports race car where's
the f12 berlinetta it's something like I
have space for luggage are well and of
course it comes with luggage yeah oh
it's got its own like like soft like
leather luggage set that kind of fills
up the whole rear hatch so I mean you
could take this car on vacation you can
drive it to the track in another country
I proposed to me the four or five eight
which you probably want to get trailer
there that's pretty much not the whole
show because there's like way more cards
than we actually have time to talk about
but not all the time you have one thing
yeah yeah we gotta get back to seeing
more of the cars that are on the floor
here we've got more to do more stuff to
look at but the impressive show so far
we'll have all of our coverage posted on
our site at our special geneva show
package area of the site well have links
to that all over the well over this blog
post and all over our cars cnet com or
you can
find us well I've been waiting
Cunningham and I'm gonna answer on
Goodwin we're on the show floor Geneva
you don't see me after the show it's
because I've been arrested for stealing
