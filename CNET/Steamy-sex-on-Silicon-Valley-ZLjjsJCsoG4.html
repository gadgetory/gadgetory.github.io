here there wasn't in the trailer I can't
say we really embraced the HBO sexy
sultry I got a scoop thanks guys
scoop City two scoops of scooping Jeremy
agreed not to do the tunnel leap we did
HBO Silicon Valley is back again for a
fourth season of Pied Piper pitches and
nerdy drama we sat down with the cast of
the show in San Francisco to see if they
would reveal any secrets about the
upcoming season
describe season four in one word the
trailer is kind of all over the place
hey awning nerds but chaotic nerds uh
for twisty sexy Oh Pied Piper is
pivoting is it still gonna be called
Pied Piper in season four can you tell
me this well I know that Richard makes a
big play to keep the name Pied Piper I
keep the name Pied Piper and I won't
budge on that yeah but the company that
splits off from Richard is eager to be
to shed that name because the only
person who likes it this rich and we
won't like will won't tell you what name
they settled on but here some this was
some of the ones or out there the new
company maybe was going to be called the
Doyle brothers uh pizzas everywhere
Hello Kitty - um Oh
Hachi chachi that's not my dog was a
front for the company one of the
episodes is just them brainstorming
names for 22 minutes you don't remember
that episode there's something called
mansplaining ladies have you heard about
weeds we know what not sure I know what
it is but are we gonna see any love
stories unfolded yeah than four
particularly between the nation'
guilfoyle yeah that is an interesting
thing I feel like people think that
there's some sort of sexual tension
between us under the surface but not
anymore as what he's ready to say
because of this season there's no more
tension yes
because the tension is hey what you will
released if you catch my drift you are
wearing the same exact pajamas as Dinesh
and you're saying random I don't know I
think we look rad let's just say yeah we
shared more than pajamas let's just say
those pajamas are comfortable you're
looking at while the subjects of a very
intense full episode long we show a B we
show showing off what can be done even
on paid cable you see my whole naked
scalp
some people say when it goes into whore
no it's not filmmaking but I think what
you're just really prove otherwise
there is erotic fan art of the three of
us lying in bed in a post-coital bliss
Monica's smoking I'm happily passed out
I think and your look fretful so there
they will get their their loves triangle
threesome in season fours guaranteed
100% that's happening yes we will pledge
to that yes yes
Wow I think we just got a good job alert
no they lied to you

find out Silicon Valley premieres April
23rd on HBO</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
