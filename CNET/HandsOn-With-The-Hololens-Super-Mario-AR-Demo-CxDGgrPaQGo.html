and augmented reality went viral this
summer that someone was Abhishek Singh
who mapped the entire first level of the
original Super Mario Brothers in 3d and
put it in microsoft's hololens
there's no way to buy or download this
but I did play it with Singh in our
office ok I see that mushroom coming ok
just let it fall on got it we wanted to
play it in the park too just like in the
video so we did at Madison Square Park
here's what happened
the lunch crowd is gonna love me yeah
look around you should see the bushes
maybe actually in the bushes right there
oh yeah yeah this is perfect yeah
they're kind of like lined up with the
real Pia Mario plants and real moments
side-by-side oh here it is ok I can see
him yeah yep here we go Jenna get him
I'm a terrible jumper yeah hunter points
what what inspired you to to make this
how did you start or where have you come
from
um well it's actually it wasn't a linear
process and how I arrived at Super Mario
so when I started playing with the
hololens I knew that I immediately saw
its potential to be used in outdoor
environments and for like large
expansive gameplay yeah so I wanted to
create some stuff on earth
so when I was learning how to develop I
basically took this white cube and I was
just like moving it around the space and
for some reason I placed it a little
above my head and I stepped underneath
and I jumped and as soon as I jumped
like all these memories came flooding
back and I was like oh my god this is
Super Mario he just made more hair
there's the crazy crazy pet here which
yeah feels like it's extending down a
ghost in the pavement yeah
I'm just gonna give a little running
jump here and just kind of yeah alright
I feel good with my terrible jump there
that's much more than you needed to jump
what's it like to actually play well
it's pretty linear and a lot of things
overlap with the real world like a
flagpole sprouted from a sedan I
couldn't jump on it this Nissan contains
the princess's castle exactly yeah
it's sprouting right out of there and if
you look up it's probably the flag the
flag had prior kind of jumps on I look
like I'm crazy yeah
this is the future where everybody's
gonna see extra things floating around
exactly yeah now it's not a perfect game
but it does show where AR could be
headed into games and Singh is going to
be looking at Apple's AR kit for the
iPhone that could be where people play a
lot of AR instead of wearing it on their
face I'm actually experimenting with
right now is putting an iPhone into
something of like a cardboard kind of
viewer and seeing whether you can
actually have a hands-free experience
with AR K but this is definitely a taste
of where the future might be heading for
mixed reality I'll be shaking
thank you for exploring the future a
little bit and letting me dive into it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
