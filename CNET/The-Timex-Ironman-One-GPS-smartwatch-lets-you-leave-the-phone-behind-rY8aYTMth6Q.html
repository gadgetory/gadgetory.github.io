checking out the Timex Ironman one GPS
plus now this is a GPS watch that's
gonna be available later in the fall but
before the holiday it's gonna be able
for $400 but it comes with a few nifty
features that we should really check out
now the first and what I think the most
important feature is going to be
built-in cellular connectivity
connectivity is 3d coming care of AT&amp;amp;T
and the first year is free and add the
second year will cost you 40 bucks with
the Ironman one GPS plus you can
actually just leave your other devices
at home because of that built-in
cellular connectivity so 3G connectivity
is cool but what are you actually gonna
be doing well with the watch well to
start and the most obvious feature could
just built right into the name is
tracking your runs or your activity with
the GPS connectivity you can actually
push a button and have a pre-loaded
message sent to an emergency contact
of course emergencies are the only
contact option you have with the box you
can actually send emails to contacts
that you've pre-loaded onto the watch
now these emails can be pre can messages
hey I'm on a run Kentucky right now or
they could be method that you actually
tap out on the a keyboard a virtual
display keyboard obviously that's on the
watch so this is not a small watch it's
got a 1.5 it's display but it's actually
fairly thick that's yet it's really
comfortable and really very light it
doesn't feel any larger or heavier than
a watch it I'm used to wearing and the
other important part and the reason it's
a little thicker than a watch you might
be expecting its kids it's a ruggedized
watch again it's right in the name the
Timex Ironman it's water-resistant to 15
meters and it really looks like it could
take a beating the watch also has a
really attractive display it's the same
Mirasol display we've seen on the
Qualcomm wat and that means very legible
color screens it's actually get easier
to see in sunlight so the Watts also
offers Bluetooth connectivity which
you'll use to pair with a Bluetooth
heart monitor that's sold separately and
Bluetooth headset and they'll be using
those Bluetooth headsets to listen to
music because there's four gigs of
on-board storage so that's the Timex
Ironman one GPS plus it'll be available
for 399 later in the fall but before the
holidays be sure to read my full hand to
report to learn more
I'm Nate Ralph thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
