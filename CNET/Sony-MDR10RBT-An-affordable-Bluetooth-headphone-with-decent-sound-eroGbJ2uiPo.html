affordable over the year wireless
bluetooth headphone which retails for
one hundred and ninety nine ninety nine
but can be had for closer to a hundred
thirty dollars online at that price it
goes from being an okay deal to being a
very attractive bluetooth headphone for
the money hi I'm David Connolly and the
first thing you'll notice about this
headphone when you put it on is that
it's pretty lightweight and very
comfortable it doesn't clamp down on
your head to firmly and the ear cups are
nicely padded it doesn't do a great job
of passively sealing out sound but it's
not bad and is well suited to office
environments I like how Sony's done the
controls both the volume switch and the
raised rocker switch for advancing
tracks forward and back are easy to
operate by feel and the power button is
clearly labeled and easy to find on the
left ear cup on a small critical note
that aforementioned raised rockers so
easy to operate that when a jacket or
another piece of clothing bumps up
against it you might find that you've
unwittingly jumped forward or back a
track so with the good you get a touch
of bad extras include NFC tap to pair
technology for phones that support it as
well as app tech support battery life is
rated at 17 hours which is quite good
and a cable is included in case the
battery dies or you just want to use the
headphones in Wired mode the headphones
charge via microUSB unlike all
headphones of this sort there's an
integrated microphone for making cell
phone calls and inexpensive but useful
carrying cases included weirdly however
the flap doesn't seal the case shut for
a bluetooth headphone the sound is quite
decent it isn't as full dynamic or
natural sounding as the $379 Beats
Studio wireless it's a little bright
with some trouble push and lots of base
so it's a pretty forward sounding
headphone and lacks a little bit of
warmth but I'd say this model gets you
about 75% of the way to the beats for a
lot less money and that's why at $130
it's a good deal and arguably a better
value than Sony's swankier mdr-1r bt
which costs around 260 dollars online
it's definitely worth a long look if
you're in the market for a decent
performing full-size
bluetooth headphone is comfortable to
wear and relatively affordable I'm David
karna I thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
