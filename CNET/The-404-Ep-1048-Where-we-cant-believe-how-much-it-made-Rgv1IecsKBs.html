2011 2010 2012 why was this a in 2010 I
have no idea that's so weird what movies
came out she's a year off that's the two
years off was that inception losing it I
was incepted over the weekend we'll get
today right after we introduce ourselves
it's the 44 show on cnet I'm Jeff
Bakalar amscot Stein and this is the
show where we can't believe how much it
made my god yeah that's a lie a lot of
money to make for one movie we're
talking about the Avengers that pulled
in over 200 million dollars this weekend
obliterating every record that was
previously held that you buy such fine
films as like what spider-man 16 or
something like that yeah it no it really
a dead man's chest as they call it an
outright the harry potter movie was the
one that it actually dethroned yeah it's
the biggest a jump in terms of just cash
just strictly speaking cash in in
history it looks like judging by this
little infographic that we got our hands
on and they say they would be a 30 years
yeah yeah and they say the movie
industry is having problems well that's
a pretty awesome number for Phil it I
still do think it is having problems i
think is his avengers one of these films
that was out in 3d was this one of these
yes it was yes all right well but it's a
it's a isn't it a converted so it's not
a didn't post is what you're saying yes
I believe that's whether that's what I'd
read about this all right well
regardless I do think this does speak
volumes about what people are willing to
see and it takes this enormous
blockbuster for someone to be like hey
you know I'm gonna go see a movie if it
involves literally every Marvel
superhero put into one film and that's
sort of what the Avengers are I mean
it's got an all-star cast I can't this
movie had to cost 200 million dollars to
make as well I can't see it costing any
less than that yeah it seems seem pretty
epic and they invested so much time in
making all of these films that led up to
it with the same cast
right it's kind of like the biggest uh
it's like a tantric movie release you
know like we've got every Avengers hint
in other trick in other movies and
credits yeah we've been watching through
iron man and even people who SAT through
Thor for sure did you saw thor no I see
I didn't say I heard mixed stuff about
Thor yeah I did everything but Thor and
I thought about watching it to get ready
for this one but I'm still not sure I
want you i heard doesn't make that much
sense with some of their comment saying
like you know if you want to find out
Bubba with Loki well just let it go you
know it was like okay well I guess
there's no continuity exactly with that
I gotta I think I gotta do this I think
the right people are behind this i mean
i really like joss whedon roll the
Avengers yeah yeah you don't mean and I
really like the way they sort of handle
this that's it sounds awesome you know
with all the movies that were leading up
you know I feel like a lot of people
just think like oh I you know I hey I
hate on everything this is something
that I'm marginally excited about we're
the only you know dahod cast room
there's not seen this movie that we
really owe nobody is seeing the film we
really it's funny kind of amazed us the
three of us have not seen this film uh
but again it just obliterated records it
really just made every other I mean when
you think about the summer blockbuster I
do think that I do think dark knight
rises is going to beat this I do real I
do I think it's going to beat I think
it'll do like 210 or 220 so I was had a
theory that at least half of the box
office for the dark knight was centered
around the heath ledger phenomenon you
think so yes because I think I'm i think
so many people were seeing it in a way
is a tribute are people who like movies
with heath ledger that maybe didn't like
batman movies okay am i wrong i don't
know i know III i was prepared forgot
about that yeah there was this um
phenomenon but behind that like oh my
god it was his last film yeah it was a
good for you tribute viewing yeah um
almost like a titanic tight but it was
also an amazing film you know it was
amazing like I don't give my respect to
the people who wrote you know the
Avengers right who's uh who wrote it
Joss Whedon
but the stories by zak penn helped write
the story of thing to write to the image
alright so i'll give them some credit
for that you know what i mean but i do
you think it's as good of a film I we
don't know we haven't seen it but the
thing about the Christopher no I mean
those are really good movies they're
recognized they're you know they're
they're sort of on a different level
yeah you know I mean that's that a
Prometheus or the arrival of the films
of the summer once we were like I gotta
be in the theater with the right
conditions sure maybe on my own big
adventures like a group of people using
my own yeah the Avengers you could have
gone wasted in C right seen a projected
on the back of a you wanna see good
quality I'm sure we go back of a truck
or sign but um the thing about the
Avengers I find fascinating is will it
inspire more and that's in the comics
but more mashups like could you ever see
like these things like Jurassic Park
meets transformers you know I go take
all of the blockbusters and throw them
together at least adventure the event
the Avengers is based on an actual group
within the Marvel Universe yes so they
need pre-exists they would they weren't
like taking Batman and spider-man I
guess they're there some mesh upper that
exists too but I'm saying like they
didn't just smash up two franchises that
have nothing to do with each other right
i mean it's true an alien and predator
never really found that magic cocktail
no they did that didn't work that dad
was like oil and vinegar just did not
mix those don't even people talk about
this being the next alien movie
prometheus but i love that nobody
discusses alien vs predator yeah which
technically are out there where we do
with those is really just like on the
back of the spice rack yeah I you know
it's it's it's you know open them just
uh we just found out over the weekend as
well Prometheus will have an R rating
which is due important yeah and I can't
stress this enough I'd I wish the dark
knight movies were rated R 2 they're not
they're not they're pg-13 that feels
messed up well if there's you know or
that dark of politics of the NP double-a
and you know yeah they sort of pick and
choose when it comes to you know the
violence and you know the box offices
have ambitions about who they want the
demographic to be and they sort of work
with the NP double-a and
is obviously just freaking rank and they
do what they gotta do but yeah prob it's
was just a Prometheus will be getting
the r rating which i think is important
uh yeah i think it's it's it's the whole
that's the essence of the alien movies
now you tell me that human centipede is
technically pg-13 if like I'm not my
mind blitz not technically no not at all
no it's a complete soft PG but I'm just
feeling like I imagine the technicality
like well if you go by the letter yeah
now that's a such a horrific film but
I'm actually so excited about prometheus
I really am that and dark knight rises
I'm just really getting psyched for I
don't arise I'm like a b-plus excited
and the Prometheus I'm like through the
roof upsettingly excited watch the
trailers multiple times despite people
saying not to I'm worried because the
last film i got this excited about i I
really do think was phantom menace what
you were excited for phantom menace I
was because do you remember the original
trailer to the Phantom I do it was
awesome it was but I come on it I looked
like I mean it was gonna be little stars
over you and Phantom Menace came out to
the old enough that no bears ten jobs
that's what I was finishing graduate
school I was sweet you were so you in
your mid 20s like for you and you were
learned I learned a film goer you knew
what the what the story was you knew how
things work in the industry and you
still let yourself fall victim but they
hid so much about that movie they hit
prep they hit the crap they hid the crap
you saw production art and you saw those
trailers were just amazing yeah I just
don't want a jar jar cheering up and
prometheus there's not going to be a jar
jar please dude there was and was there
one in Blade Runner no there wasn't
Blade Runner which it's gonna be awesome
great Primus gonna be i hope i really
hope it's tough to get too excited about
stuff you know and it also has the the
opposite sort of you know ramifications
like I remember getting it really really
excited for inception and I was I was a
little it down by inception I was too
until the very end and who this is
influenced by the audience with the
spinning top and then every
you got to it but it was also everybody
start gasping in the audience for some
reason oh and then the credits ran and
then because of the gasping I thought oh
that must mean even more than I thought
yeah and then I kind of got excited but
only then because the rest of the movie
was did feel like a letdown it was a
letdown hell too much like a matrix it
was da trick yeah I was like it was too
much action running through a hallway
people with guns right yeah it should
turn this corridor while they run around
all right every dream world must feel
like a UH action movie yeah that's
that's the way I don't want to get in I
don't want to get incepted ourselves
into this whole thing prometheus uh has
a little bit of avatar in it which I'm
worried about yeah there's a there's a
dash of it I'm worried that they'll be
like a unobtanium oh jeez maybe that's
what they're looking for I don't know I
I trust Ridley Scott I really do he's
got an amazing track record um you know
I mean think it looked at this guy it's
funny because it's like it's like
Hannibal Black Hawk Down alien Blade
Runner gladiator and then it's like oh
yeah Thelma and Louise I forget oh oh
yeah that was cool that he did that he's
just he's like I'm just playing around
doing it's awesome it's awesome he's
he's a fantastic director I'm really
really excited about it he speaking of
avatar like you saw that the whole James
Cameron there he's committed to avatari
said in a recent interview he's planning
on he shut down his development office
just another random thing I remembered
reading over the weekend cuz he's going
to Neptune he wants to go to he was
gonna be the first director to go to
Neptune and come back so he's not
developing scripts he's making avatar 2
3 possibly even for he said yeah that's
okay why would they need to go back well
what's gonna happen I know I I don't
know is it just gonna stay on that world
and it's gonna be exploring like the
aquatic side will the next one just be
the Navi and no humans like I know
you're like the Navi deal with their own
problems you know or maybe like the
history yeah just going back to their
natural history you know something like
that or a prequel how did this happen
how did this start i would say i would
rather see a prequel than a sequel for
avatar I kind of like to see an
alien-type sequel where it takes place
four hundred years later yeah after like
the world has been totally destroyed in
the
after almost like the United States and
the you know the history of like the
Native Americans like they're gonna take
that analogy yeah like imagine like what
if the humans just one flat out it'd be
cool in the end and alternate history
right nut battle never mattered yeah so
yeah again The Avengers beating deathly
hallows part 2 by over 30 million
dollars 200 point 3 Millions with the
Avengers took in over the weekend so
this me is gonna be a nice little
weekend it wasn't a holiday weekend now
it wasn't uh you know anything like that
it just kicked ass by itself good for
them and it's 640 1 million worldwide
already that's nuts that's an industry
already in for sure they got it now
they're gonna make 16 of these well a
top avatar will it become the highest
grossing film resistors gonna be like a
very I don't know about that it's all
about the trail off kind of upsetting to
see that well I guess depending on how
you look at it there are three Batman
films I'm sorry there are four Batman
films on this list we're talking about
weekend records from 1983 denounced
basically 30 years wow you got Batman
the first batman and batman returns them
Batman Forever and then the dark night
and uh you know I would be shocked to
find that the Dark Knight not the dark
knight rises to not be on here I think
it will be I think it'll be on this
little beyond this in just a few short
weeks this blows me because I remember
how big spider man's opening was and
quarterly is 2002 that mega opening was
114 million yeah and what's really cool
is the percentage jump so but so this
little this little info graphic here
talks about the two biggest gems one
monetarily so that was Harry Potter to
the Avengers and then the biggest
percentage jump was uh it looked to be
like the Last Crusade / Ghostbusters up
to the first Batman if you could see
that little bunny out on there which is
before that it was 29 million dollars
was a mind-blowing opening weekend yeah
that's what's crazy when you look at the
film from 1983 which is return of the
jedi pulling in 23 in one weekend 23
million bucks yeah and then all the way
up
that's amazing to two hundred million
dollars in a weekend in just 30 years I
mean you got it was just for inflation
and all that stuff but still that is a
nutty amount of money all right let's
move along just a little bit there's
some rumors floating around in our own
Scott Steiner can speak to all things
laptops and all that good stuff a lot of
rumors flying around that there might be
a cheapo macbook air an
eight-hundred-dollar MacBook Air is that
a possibility for this year on cnet
there is an article saying that a report
is claiming such a thing the DigiTimes
is saying that we might see an
eight-hundred-dollar macbook air as
early as the third quarter citing the
usual sources from the upstream supply
Jay it always a mixed bag there yeah
this the site says that a more
aggressively priced macbook air could
crimp rival ultrabooks especially if
Intel is unable to bring their average
selling price down to its goal of seven
hundred bucks hmm interesting do you
think this could be a possibility I ask
you mr. Scott Stein king of the impact
book air well it's interesting that
intel says that its goal is to bring
those laptops down to six ninety-nine
also i think that's ambitious ambitious
but then a lot of these are showing up
now with you know instead of getting
flash SSD drives you're going to see a
lot of those now having regular hard
drive right or hybrid higher hard drives
with a little bit of SSD cache sure
those who care about that stuff but um
that could bring down to 699 yeah I
think that there you're always going to
have that white macbook crowd right in
the back to school that the cheapest
apple laptop which usually was 999 right
and as of this past year they made the
shift to say that well your macbook air
will be the entry level sure macbook and
hey that 11 inches 999 which of course
with 64 gigabytes of storage that's not
really going to get done for any student
heading to college course not so so
that's going to have to change so that
has to change and and you'd think that I
would think that the if there is one
that it might make sense to make a very
specific type of a macbook air like
machine
maybe again go to plastic or maybe
include a full regular hard drive Brian
you go he'll I think a regular hard
drive I don't you think they're done
with that I would personally in the air
I would think that but if they can't get
the you know I could even fit a crisis
can't go down below 999 yeah I would
have a hard time believing that they
would that apple would cut that low
because that goes into the ipad
territory right it does you're right and
usually there there's with every product
line there's always like a little leap a
little like hundred four hundred dollars
a little bit of premium you're paying
right in to make the decision in your
head to say oh maybe I spend up and go
there yeah I think 999 might make sense
but I don't know if you can get enough
flash storage in there to make it really
useful yeah do people go back to school
care do they just want to plug in an
external hard drive or live in the cloud
do they say well one dates fine for me I
don't you know what I don't I am NOT
giving the the average student enough
credit and I don't think they can handle
the whole cloud thing I don't think
they're yeah they're privy to it I don't
think they're savvy enough I think it's
a mess too I think a lot of cloud stuff
we talked about it here you know dan and
I talked about he says he's living in
the cloud all the time and I'm not
really living in the cloud all time I
think it's broken him it's an illusion
it doesn't work it's it's not it doesn't
work it's um I wish I could come up with
an analogy that that's sort of where
we're at with it there's certain things
that get pushed out prematurely and I
think the whole cloud universe
regardless of what you know medium
you're using it for feel like the only
one it sort of works with is music right
now right somewhat reliably that I don't
think we're there yet I just don't think
we're there yet the problem with music
is is really you have to use the cloud
services rules for it in whatever way
that means like iTunes Match I use and
yes it'll sink back in a way with my
devices but I can't really add music
directly to the cloud yeah and then add
it back to my devices are gonna itunes
brokered yeah it's it's it's a pain
that's when you think of a cloud you
think of this well the way the way I
envisioned it is this sort of you know
external hard drive that is always
connected as soon as I have an internet
connection right and it's just not like
that there's too much of a handshake
there's too much red tape that that you
know is that sort of damages the
connection strange interfaces and rules
and things that's not as drag and drop
and also to frankly getting stuff on and
off you know if you want to use for me
it's photos and videos hmm I have to
deal with that stuff and sure you get an
external hard drive but it's nice to
keep stuff like that on your computer
right and my iphone 4s videos take up
ridiculous amounts for sure for sure so
suddenly it's like several hundred
megabytes for this 22nd stupid video
issue you know that's the problem is
where do you store all that you can't
dump it into the cloud you can't it
takes forever to pull that stuff back
all right again yeah I'm up I want to
talk about this before we take the break
and I want to get your honest opinion on
someone like this yeah lately I've been
starting to become disappointed with the
performance of certain max I edge why
I'm not impressed anymore I've had a
couple max passed through my desk
because I was waiting for a replacement
as the right nose in the office because
I keep a pilfering love machines from
the lab I was using an i was using a
year old imac with an i5 and maybe about
four gigs of ram i would have two
browsers open with like let's say seven
to 10 tabs open in each one which is a
heavy workload plus photoshop running in
the background and spotify and a few
things and this thing was chugging along
it couldn't handle it is that a my
demanding too much because i'm using a
cosmo laptop for temporarily until i get
my music my thing squared away and this
thing handle handles it with no problem
doesn't skip a beat it i got 10 tabs
open in each one I've got multiple
Photoshop files open and i'm editing and
spotify is running and I could open up I
can I could play portal 2 while it's all
going on to what what's the deal with
that why Mike's I mean I know I'm sort
of like you know I'm trying to just ask
like is there
thing going on have you seen something
recently in in in this sort of like
trend with macbooks that there maybe
they're not performing like the I don't
I have like this weird machine i have
here this thing's a monster but it also
has 16 gigs ram did I mean yeah so is
your father just a beast but I don't
know I feel like what I'm asking this
macbook to currently sort of run I don't
think I'm asking a lot and it's a
macbook retina so that was the AMA
canned then I got an i7 macbook okay
that the company gave me with four gigs
are in and it's faster than the imac but
it's still struggling when I have
everything open like that it's still
taken a few seconds for things to catch
up um cosmo thing awesome handles it has
four gigs of ram I think the cosmo might
have more okay I'm it's probably all
about ram it yeah maybe ram um but yeah
that shouldn't I mean maybe went upgrade
from four but the I don't know I mean I
haven't seen that but i've been using i
used a macbook air a lot recently and I
like the pike the relative speed on that
that's also you gotta consider the SSD
dresses up yeah that's that's absolutely
and it's a perceived it's also about
like am I am i opening that many windows
no right no way um not on there but um
yeah I don't know that's uh I know that
a couple my couple year old macbook is
faring terribly really that it's old I
mean it's more than a couple it's 2008
yeah I swapped out the ram on that and
upgraded it but even so I mean it's
really slow chat room says it's all
about getting uh getting the ram upgrade
the ram helps alarm helps and then the
be master says stop using flash and java
is that really does that handicapped oh
SI OS 10 is that really LOM it says
lying hot down with the flashing job it
certainly doesn't help and it's probably
it's you know apple doesn't make that
stuff uh you know the they make you run
to get it and yeah it's not built into
the browser you really make you run send
you on a wild-goose chase yeah there's
nothing in their computer that really
says we like flash nothing but yeah it
could definitely um there's there that
can that can come up any computer but on
the mac side yeah my cuz im using like a
chrome firefox sort of
I read tandem sort of thing yeah it's
not happy with that maybe I'll double
the RAM I'll get some of the double the
RAM from doubling the RAM is the best
way to deal with that sluggish like any
spinning wheel type weirdness then there
you go jerem also says that doesn't he
know that using utorrent takes up a lot
of CPU that's not what I'm doing they've
closed that port okay I found out the
hard way exactly we'll take a break more
with Scott Stein after this stick around
a lot more 404 after the break this is
the 404 Mr effers the show where we all
sing songs
we don't learn about what's coming is I
think they're gonna redesign the line so
yeah so so you think okay well so we'll
come back we'll talk more we'll talk
more about this yeah um so Scott Stein
is saying that you think this could be a
possibility yeah I think it's time that
the line of macbook products needs to be
rethought out first of all back there's
a 13-inch macbook air and a 13-inch
MacBook Pro doesn't make any sense to me
all right I know people have argued back
to me about this and said no you how can
you raise you can't get rid of the pro
and I'm like it doesn't even have
dedicated graphics it has the
performance wise from on our tests you
know they were pretty much identical
right the air in the pro last year and
now with the Ivy Bridge trip updates
yeah I mean I think all you need to do
to me is pop in a hard drive on their
make a hard drive option for those who
care about more storage right and then
you've got your air pro whatever you
want to call it and then airpro I like
that yeah like make it like a cooler new
air with a new variety of lines macbook
air max they gotta fix that 15 inch pro
yeah I know just it feels to me now I
don't think I think they're just gonna
stop doing the pros altogether they got
a slim it down and make it something
else make that 15 inch I don't know it
just needs to be cooler looking it to me
it's no longer it used to be a cool
looking it's heavy it feels bulky yeah
um I mean it still matches the thickness
of your average 15 inch that's slim but
it's like why am i carrying this around
right I that's I mean at work i decided
i'm going to go air vs taking an option
to go with approach because i'm gonna be
traveling around ya know yeah i wish i
wish i could have gotten in there for
sure it just ended but i'm worried about
this obviously worried about storage
limitations but i think that that's the
problem is how do you take that 15 inch
pro and make it cool again people might
want to hit me for saying that because
there's a there's a lot of talking
computers you know angriness about
performance you know like it's not about
being cool you idiots about performance
right no it's it's about both like they
kick they can retain that performance I
would much rather I mean when you say
and make it more stylish when you say
that when you talk about the aesthetics
of it
I think I would much rather sacrifice
the aesthetics but are you talking about
wait does that fall into that is that's
what i mean by k I mean I mean the sense
of like you say you want to carry it
around you want to join I don't really
care about me materials right or what it
actually physically looks like no and
they're not gonna go too nuts with that
there I think it's me pretty clean but I
think that um yeah I just think it's due
for design overhaul that those MacBook
Pros have not changed in there are in
almost five years yes since 2008 yeah
since 2008 film at four years and
foremost for years um that's a long time
that's when I got mine that's when I got
my the current macbook pro i have now i
gotta wait yeah you wouldn tell the
difference if you left them out for
someone to look at Barrett for sure
unless you went to like about this Mac
right and so you just think like I just
think how is it not do you look at what
Mac about imax were for 2008 yeah game
day yeah you just be stunned and and I
think it just can't it can't go on
another year yeah without changing
things and without keeping up because
also in the window side there's a lot of
change in laptops people are making all
sorts of thin interesting laptops that
may not be exactly what you're looking
for but they're trying for sure and you
can't just sit back on that unibody
design forever right maybe that's it for
a decade right we're now they're
definitely do I think I think we can all
agree with that speaking of Apple um did
they you think they settled for for what
the ipad 3 became is an interesting
article up on cnet talking about how it
is possible that the original plan for
the ipad 3 was to include something
called IGZO technology which is a
display technology uh they talked to
Raymond Sony era who's the founder and
president CEO of display may
technologies he says that the plan was
to use this new technology called igzo
from sharp a lot higher electron
mobility that allows them to make the
transistors a lot smaller and the
circuit elements a lot smaller as well
basically what that means is smaller
transistors smaller elements would allow
more light through and reduce the number
of backlights needed
thus resulting in a thinner overall
display assembly that was possibly what
Apple was trying to do and perhaps they
had to settle for what we now know the
third iPad to be that's I don't know i
mean i guess it's believable it's
believable it's actually more believable
than i thought based on when i heard the
story coming out i thought oh what's
wouldn't mean said well maybe what's
good what's the story because you hear
this every year with features that are
dropped on the ipad right and or that we
hoped would be there we don't know that
they were dropped we say like we want
this this and this and Apple usually
tends to introduce just one of them will
show of them sure and we're left hoping
again for the following year um that's
interesting as far as I tech reminds me
of what ty had said ty pendlebury on the
TV side that I remember when this before
this came out he and David Katz my were
wondering seriously whether it could
happen because of power and thinking
about exactly at the power to push those
pixels on display technology they knew
require more light we require more
battery and that turned out to be
exactly true I mean this seems perfect
for a great way to come back the
following year and say hey retina
display even thinner more battery life
right I mean it seems to me like why not
wait a year because if you solve that
problem right off the bat that's a great
that's a great new fix right on the next
one so you just have a huge check mark
right there yeah I mean because the
battery life on this I enjoy the I did
get the ipad 3 3rd gen ipad what
everyone call it i like it but um for
the first time i feel like i need to
keep an eye on that battery yeah that
battery end of the day i plug i plug it
in to charge are you saying it goes too
quick it does i could spend a few hours
doing something videos or more games and
i can see the battery drop significantly
let's say from like seventy percent of
fifty percent and they do claim it's the
same battery it's the same battery
performance don't they it claims the
same battery performance but you know
they claimed the same battery
performance i believe in the last gen
and there's always flux like yeah i mean
the ipad 2 is actually significantly
better than the ipad 3 and a lot of
tests they've shown a video playback
even weirder there have you seen these
reports that like the new chip construct
chipset constructively called the ipad 2
comma 4 yeah in these new iPads are
actually performing significantly better
on battery life than the last iPad tues
mmm you have to like somehow they don't
list this be like mir ein the 2 comma
for a you no indication but that they
tried video playback and gaming actually
maybe a couple of hours better
performance in some instances well like
a significant like a some were in that
right to look up the amount but it was
like in a greater than fifteen percent
which is significant oh absolutely and
that's something so again the numbers
are not always completely stable now I
mean this iPad does not perform as well
battery life wise that's absolutely true
I've the iPad I've noticed that and I've
noticed that my emerging it is amazing
it's so much longer it takes it fully
charged up yeah you have to leave it for
almost overnight like an overnight yeah
um the the guy they interviewed mr. so
narrow goes on and says there's no
question that the ipad 3 was a plan B
they pushed amorphous silicon to a
higher pixel per inch than anybody else
but the light throughput is not good so
it has roughly twice as many LEDs and
they had to therefore get a seventy
percent larger battery this is seventy
percent large battery in the ipad 3 over
that go to yeah well that's right
astonishing crazy that's what's
astonishing that the battery life feels
in a lot of instances like maybe a
little less impressive being about how
much energy that everything is using
yeah they really just sort of Franken's
finally mash this thing together didn't
they oh they did I thought I still find
it really hard i'm not being an annual
gret buying an ipad 3 no because i think
that the one thing I always felt annoyed
by in the last year with the ipad was
the quality of the resolution for text
agree because just this one of main
things you're doing on right video green
the screens the thing you're looking at
the nose and I'm the meeting headlines
and news and magazines and things like
that so I think you know what's actually
more tangible difference than the ipad 2
which was more of a cosmetic upgrade i
don't i never really use the video
cameras or the
amorous period but I don't for gaming
and video I never noticed it yeah i mean
the rare game i notice sir i'd say only
a handful of games really really show a
difference right the text and and comics
yeah comic the comic i would that the
comics are fantastic and um this is much
less exciting thing comes i was like and
the pdfs are amazing ADF's man watch out
now you know if you are using for pdfs
like i have to say it is great because i
used to have scans that i would put on
there and you have texts all too small
it would come out looking a little weird
now you can look at everything and it's
fine exactly the way it looks great
before we have to say goodbye i do want
to get into a little bit of e3 2012 chat
you and I will both be out there again
braving the los angeles convention
center braving that freaking highway and
those stupid oh there's so much driving
for no reason how are we going to do it
regardless of that we'll get there we'll
figure that i will try to get a good
plane flight and hope that the Devils
will be joining you there that would be
something else I appreciate you bringing
that up it's very possible if the devil
was that because you make it to the
finals if that's a big if they got to
get through this round the next round if
they somehow make it to the finals and
la does the same the devils and kings
could be playing for the Stanley Cup
whilst we are in attendance at e3 2012
now my family our Rangers fans so if
they heard me say that I don't really
have a stake in hockey no they would
kill judges really saying old Jets bet
you're saying hope the Rangers follow us
out well that's not what you want to say
to me I don't want it and I don't mind
either way which my law would hate this
unfortunate I'm sorry to say that so I
you know I would like to see you happy
and that the devil's well thank you
appreciate that could you imagine I
would not get any work done as all I'm
saying I'd have to it's right there I
mean right there the staple center that
the freakin note the Nintendo thing is
in it right it just go right like the
neck into the game I lied only want to
think about that possibility either way
III 2012 right around the corner will be
there in a month
um you know I just don't see the hype
that there was last year sort of you
know it's stumbling into this one you
know very quiet very quiet I think
software will be will rule again I think
besides the wii u you're not going to
see much in terms of hardware unless
xbox on the sony and or microsoft pull
something pull a rabbit out of a hat
right which I kind of hope they do just
because I love seeing I love reacting to
something new like with the wii u that
was so much fun telling everyone that
this thing is that cool you know I was a
lot of fun for me yeah and like you get
a chance to be at a lot of people were
curious about that they were very
curious about the Vita and from as
passers-by to say like um you know what
is that thing all right it was
interesting is it transformed from you
know the Vita's interesting device but i
would say a lot of people became more
casual observers of the tech as opposed
to really drooling for saying like oh
there's a new concert i heard about
right they have to I gly says every year
and I've been wrong but when are they
have to t some new next-gen but do they
I think but do they they both come to
heaven or Microsoft and Microsoft come
out and said you're not showing any new
hardware in 2012 83 but as the video
game industry i feel kind of is juju
economically feels it gets dribbling and
dribbling it's a it's excitement and and
the prophets and I I think it's such a
dangerous game each year to be like
we're good is there like Nintendo like
oh we're all those years that Nintendo
easy i was like we're okay the wii's
fine yeah the wii's find the dss fine
selling great what's the problem yeah
and that could be too late and then
something you're showing the wii u and
it's hard to get everyone back into
being excited i think if they wait too
many years yeah you wait another two or
three running away three years and be
like here's the next-gen Xbox and I
don't know for sure that they wouldn't
lose interest that there might be about
mine in the industry I don't think
though it might interest I know I don't
think I'm reversal interest I don't know
think about the casual gamer and how the
second they hear about it
console they just drop what they're
doing and start going nuts right but
don't you think I I I think yeah I'm
still not giving you that I'm not i
don't think the ipad is is really that
big of a threat to the console not to
the console and I'm I'm again I'm not
defending it as game playing the device
because I think it is a mess I cover the
gate on it there's only there's a one or
two games I like playing on an ipad did
you play max payne playing spin did you
like it i like the fact that it works it
works by not going to yeah you're not
owing to God is full but if you buy
painful it is its max painful but you
know I thought it was successful for the
fact that it could work but I I do think
that there enough people look how many
people out there be honest bought a wii
because they just wanted to play wii
sports right then why something fun they
want to do bowling in their house that
those customers who were considerable
number now think oh I can just download
my play my Angry Bird temple run you
know you're not got a fun I got a fun
quick thing that's all I cared about I
wasn't a gamer right so I'm just worried
about that that amount of people who buy
consoles who frankly don't use them much
but do it for a novelty because they can
play a little bit of games I hear your
games I think that part of the audience
a lot of gamers at sable good riddance
you know what those guys were just
buying that console to play one until
the game but that's a big part of a I
just think it's a part of the customer
base to be don't you think Scott that
the Nintendo is now like you're on your
own you're in your own thing now you're
not I'll put the big boys anymore you're
not with Microsoft you're not with Sony
you have invented your own freakish
category whatever the hell it is that
you guys yeah yeah and you're sort of on
your own and now you you've somehow made
it that now you have 19 competitors
instead of 20 they're definitely in a in
a weird middle zone you know and and
look this is the you made this bed you
must now lie in it again murga Tory it
is it's limbo it's it's like what you
know what are you they've lost their
identity as far as I'm concerned they
really have well I mean it's so
peripheral based in that and that
tablet just hangs over the entire system
the ps3 and 360 the best thing they've
had going is that the systems are so
similar if they were going to coexist in
a comfortable zone and say this is
gaming right there's an ebb and flow
they both have their their own list of
exclusives that are worth it but all the
big games like your BioShock Infinite
all type of stuff they all get made for
those platforms right and easily and
it's all part of that that's what game
they're both content with what they're
sort of doing right we intend Oh has
always been like well we you can't even
make it for us because our controls are
all different right we got multiple
screens right or tablet or the not same
graphics this might get a little too
techy but you brought up BioShock
Infinite and at the sony press
conference last year you and I SAT there
and we watched ken Levine come out and
say that bioshock infinite for ps3 would
have moved support okay and everyone
sort of rolled their eyes that's right
they're all like my memory why what are
you doing Ken you're the Martin Scorsese
of video games and you're going to freak
and tell me that you're putting in just
the right do you think it'll it'll stay
in there do you think because think
about what's happened in a year with
move it's gone from like oh yeah hmm
like lukewarm meh to just as far as I'm
concerned a disaster to playstation eye
to the other thing that goes in the
drawer to that another thing that has
dust on it and is just will find itself
in some obscure electronic museum 30
years in that donkey konga drums exactly
right they think they're still I mean
you might even have some sort of
contract that they can't get out of that
must be like look we you said you're
going to do this you're going to do this
I think it will have move support you I
think it'll be headlined no but I think
it'll I think it will fulfill I see him
it's an obligation he's good on his word
yeah course I think but you know it
seems as opposed to connect which is
speaking of making things work with
peripherals yeah I find that too works
with Kinect is a is a anyway yes opinion
it's an Indian yeah um I think it's
seems pretty easy to make a game work
with the move because it's more like a
controller so I think they can kind of
do that and move on yeah
it'll be like it worse at the person
yeah it's all by the way it'll say that
on the back from whisper chat it's works
with no but don't worry about it a back
page of the inspiration not even
structure males and games anymore
they've all disappeared so mrs. say it's
somewhere as a footnote as the oldest
and longest footnote um so yeah that's
that's pretty much I think the games
were excited about we're excited about
our tomb Raider's abajo shocks are like
the same as lateral it's like right the
big yeah I'm a little concerned about
the about the big games it makes me
think that a lot of every are there are
new things but I feel like maybe we're
due for a lot more new stuff nounced a
lot more new ip's i do i hope i don't
want to see more sequels i know there's
going to be halo 4 stuff and you just
know you just know that there if they
really start with a halo 4 or a block a
black ops 2 trailer gameplay I just
don't care if their event is like 20
minutes of halo for like 20 minutes of
mr. black hall duty yes just are booing
how about and then support for two new
cable providers meme so obscure services
thank you very much right you know it's
just come up with something new you know
that's why I think new new hardware at
some point I get I just get concern
about what else Nintendo at least the
one exciting thing if you if you like
Nintendo is that so we've got to see
well not just the actual launch
announcement for work and I've actual
everything yeah what are the games right
we haven't seen any of that so I imagine
X number of games right you would
imagine hopefully an ambitious number
including third-party how the heck those
are going to work I'm owes a lot of
stuff to watch their I guess for sure
I'm most anxious and excited to to sit
down at their press conference and
nintendo's press conference yeah cuz
it's just like all right how you gonna
spin this how you gonna make it act like
your shareholders and everyone who owns
a little slice of the pie should not
jump out a window I think they're going
to be the same confident calm demeanor
they've always had of course and they're
gonna look at and then it'll bring me a
rather moto miam
we'll just smile and do a little thing
and everyone will love him because he
said he's an adorable genius yeah it
means he there so lucky to have him and
he's amazing yeah it'll be interesting I
I don't want anyone to take away from
this discussion that we put one company
in a more negative light we sort of have
the same with never about look at all
three of them are all sort of in the
same bucket right now so it'll be
interesting to see I hope Miyamoto makes
I know this my final no comment I like
that he's been moved off of some of
those big titles yeah and I would love
if he makes he's got such an amazing
imagination he make some money and put
them in a room with a lab workers right
like small indie games for nintendo wii
the best thing ever I think he just
needs to be as weird and interesting as
possible and no one you she can't be
married and what bad could come of that
surely it's grown for sure except uh we
music anyway we gotta go a big thanks to
