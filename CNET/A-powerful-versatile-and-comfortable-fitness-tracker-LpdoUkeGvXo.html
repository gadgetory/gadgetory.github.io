and right now we're taking a first look
at the Fitbit flex costing 99.95 the
Fitbit flex is the most recent fitness
tracker to join the company's lineup of
personal health devices while not quite
as advanced as the Fitbit one which also
costs 99.95 by the way the Flex features
pardon the pun a much more flexible
wristband style design the Fitbit flex
track steps you make all day long and
then uses that to calculate the calories
you burn the Flex can also record and
report the length and quality of your
sleep
that's something the Fitbit one can do
too but the Flex doesn't require a
separate arm band like the more clunky
one the Fitbit flex can't track how many
stairs you climb though which is a trait
of the Fitbit one the Flex consists of a
flexible rubbery band and a tiny tracker
module which sits inside the LED lights
on the tracker serve as the devices only
indicator when you slip the tracker into
the band you can see the LEDs through a
slim plastic visor tapping the screen
once will cause the Flex to display your
progress towards your daily step goal
the greater the number of lights the
better you charge the flexes battery
using a bundled USB cable the device can
also sync automatically with PCs and
Macs through a provided USB adapter even
better if you're lucky enough to own an
iPhone or a samsung galaxy s3 and galaxy
note device you'll be able to sync in
real time with a Fitbit Android and iOS
mobile apps now the device doesn't have
a screen so you can't use it as a watch
like the Nike FuelBand still it's small
light and comfortable to wear plus is
water resistant that means you can
shower with it take it out in the rain
wash dishes with it whatever floats your
boat
