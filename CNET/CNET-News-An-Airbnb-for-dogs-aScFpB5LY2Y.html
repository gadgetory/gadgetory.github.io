two pugs Roxy and Raymond but she loves
all dogs to the point that she's become
a host mom to other canines through the
website dogvacay calm I'm not looking to
be a full-time dog sitter I have a
full-time job so this is kind of
something I do for my own enjoyment so
I'm hoping just maybe once in a while I
can help out someone in the neighborhood
who needs a good place for their dog for
a few days that's how Hudson a puggle
came to stay with her family for a week
while his owners went on vacation airmen
charges 25 to 30 dollars per night
depending on add-on services like a bath
but I don't do it for the money I do it
just because it's it's a relaxation for
me I got you but as similar sites like
rover.com pop up can you trust your
furry friend to a virtual stranger after
all dogs can't complain if they've had a
bad experience we do a lot of quality
control including there's an online
application process we do reference
checks phone interviews have web
training offer a comprehensive insurance
policy to support providing peace of
mind for dog owners through technology
was a priority for Suzanne Coulter when
she opened her happy hound play and
daycare we use every technology that's
available to us right now which is the
webcams via cell phone we use Facebook
we use google plus we're a very
interactive facility where the dogs are
out in playgroup as for Jennifer airman
she says even her dogs benefit from
playdates and as long as everyone gets
along there's no and they love it I'm
sure Hudson would give this vacay two
paws up in San Francisco and Kara Tsuboi
