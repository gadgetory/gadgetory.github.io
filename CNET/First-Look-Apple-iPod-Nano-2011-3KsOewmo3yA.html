updated iPod Nano for 2011 this is
essentially the same design that Apple
introduced in 2010 offered in the same
seven colors but with an updated
software if you already have a 2010
model the software update comes free as
an automatic iTunes download now one of
the big changes that Apple is made for
2011 is the price which is down to $129
for 8 gigabytes or $149 for 16 gigs the
touchscreen interface now shows just one
icon at a time instead of grouping them
together in a grid of four which makes
it easier to operate also the watch
feature now has 18 different watch faces
to choose from including a few for the
kiddies but the coolest feature Apple is
thrown in here is the full Nike Plus
fitness system before you'd have to use
a sensor in your shoe and have a Nike
connector plugged into the bottom of the
iPod but now all you need is this the
built-in pedometer can track walking and
running as two separate features and
when you plug it back into your computer
iTunes will upload all that information
to a free Nike Plus account where you
can track your progress and set goals
it's a great feature for this kind of
gym friendly mp3 player everything else
on the Nano is just what you'd expect
you get apples outstanding support from
music podcasts audiobooks and playlists
the FM radio has this unique live pause
feature that lets you temporarily pause
and resume live radio and extras like
photos timers stop watches are all nice
to have and of course let's not forget
the clip the metal clip here on the back
makes it easy to take with you and no
matter which way you clip it you can use
two fingers to rotate the screen around
it's also useful to know that a
double-click on the sleep button will
skip to the next track so that's the
update of 2011 iPod Nano a useful and
stylish choice for the gym there's still
a little pricey compared to something
like the sand is sand the line of mp3
players which can be had for under $50
scene is calm I'm Donald ow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
