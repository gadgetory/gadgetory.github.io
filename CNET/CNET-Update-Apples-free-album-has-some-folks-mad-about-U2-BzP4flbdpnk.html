I'm Bridget Carey and this is your cnet
update as with every iphone launch those
that want to be the first to have it
either have to stand in line at a store
or stay up late a week before to
pre-order online for delivery but for
many in the u.s. pre-ordering the iphone
6 and 6 plus early Friday morning proved
to be a headache Apple's website was
down in the US for about two hours when
the pre-orders were set to begin at
midnight pacific 3 a.m. Eastern many
customers also complained on Twitter
about problems ordering from Sprint and
t-mobile although ATT and Verizon seemed
to handle the high traffic the
plus-sized iphone 6 was the first to
sell out of initial pre-order supply
with the wait time for delivery jumping
to three to four weeks later Friday
afternoon there were still iPhone 6
models available for delivery on launch
day even if you're not big into
following apple news most people might
now have heard about the new iPhone 6
models and the Apple watch but not
everyone was aware of one smaller detail
in apple's announcement apple is giving
away the latest u2 album to all itunes
users for free this week the u2 album
automatically appeared in iTunes and on
people's iOS devices which led to people
thinking that their accounts were hacked
or there was some glitch because they
didn't download it themselves but don't
worry you haven't been hit with a
YouTube virus it's just available
through the cloud as part of the
promotion the album itself isn't
actually being downloaded to your device
until you tell it to download now some
users are frustrated because they don't
know how to take it off we have some
instructions on cnet but in short there
is an option you can turn off to show
all music which shows music from the
cloud and iTunes you can't exactly
delete the album but you can hide it by
right-clicking and selecting delete so
you can keep living with or without you
too when you're shopping to buy a memory
card most folks tend to buy a card
that's anywhere between 8 and 128
gigabytes in size but if you're looking
for more storage and I mean a lot more
sandisk now has an option for a 512 gig
SD card it'll only cost you eight
hundred dollars this breaks the record
as the largest capacity SD card and it
has write speeds of 90 megabytes a
second if you're a frequent Twitter
poster you may have heard the news that
twitpic is shutting down but before the
image hosting service goes offline on
September 25th be sure to upload your
photos so you don't lose them if you
have many photos twitpic does have a
backup tool to export all your files
into a zip file that's your tech news
update you can always find more at cnet
com and stay updated by subscribing to
the podcast and following along on
Twitter from our studios in New York I'm
