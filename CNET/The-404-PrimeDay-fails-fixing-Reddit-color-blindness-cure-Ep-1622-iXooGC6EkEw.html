July seventeenth my name is Jeff Bakalar

eyes of Russ rustic how are you sir oh
I'm glorious are you I can't believe you
brought me back for another week believe
this baby it just keeps happening you
know we said we were gonna do this yep
feedback last week terrible terrible
feedback I know I crossed the board my
Twitter was just filled with just people
crying weeping over their ears digital
internet weeping yeah sad oh well thanks
for that flying ahead that's why we're
staying the course and we've decided to
bring you back thanks for being here
buddy my pleasure uh so what's up with
you you've had an interesting week it
was do not yeah eventful week um I got
engaged to be married ladies and
gentlemen hey clap it okay I mr. was
really just us in the room so I guess
I'll clap too otherwise it sounds hot
well I want people who are not driving
their car yet to clap I where they could
be driving like a Google car with us
like fancy no driver cards or and you
know what I'd let you do it in a golf
cart to get those don't are not
inherently everyone else has to clock
right absolutely okay so you are now
part of the club yep you got engaged to
your now fiance yeah I'd Alex how did
that go for you sir I went rather well
we went out to a place called governor's
island which is very lovely in New York
City oh you take a little fairy timid
trip and yeah as a gorgeous saturday and
there's a place in governor's island
called the hammock grotto which is
literally a grotto filled with hammocks
did you propose on a hammock I proposed
in the hammock grotto but I was not on
the hammock when I proposed so was that
the plan the whole time well I my
initial plan is this a very good view of
the city in one part of Governors Island
that I thought I was going to do but
we're in the hammock rata we're chillin
on one of the hammocks and I like look
to my left and there's like there's
probably like six or seven hammocks in
there and I look to my left and there's
a woman in a hammock probably 10 feet
away with the nicest camera I've ever
seen the lens was like a foot law
on gorgeous yes our camera what'll end
and I'm like seems like I should just do
it here and maybe she'll clue into the
fact that it's happening and start
taking photos of the event okay that's a
little presumptuous I mean well look if
it didn't happen and she didn't take
photos nothing to lose right nothing to
lose so roll the dice what happened so I
like with her positioning in mind are
you like I like waving i know but i did
angle myself such that you know I
cheated out a little bit towards her and
yeah so got down on one knee you did it
Alex was in in the hammock sitting down
in the hammock and I got down on one
knee and thankfully Alex wreaked when I
proposed to her oh so she was surprised
he was very surprised really she knew i
was looking at rings she like borrowed
my phone and was like looking at photos
of like her nephew and then kept
scrolling is like no rings she knew i
was looking but she thought I'd just
started and it was gonna be six months
mmm she was shocked wow that's great
yeah so um hmm sorry I need a little a
little parched oh no sure it's an
emotional no Mike yeah this is crazy I
can't believe she she was surprised like
that she was shocked and everyone in the
hemming grotto turns and like freaks out
cuz i think something Horrible's
happened and then they see and this
she's crying and I'm getting emotional
and and and then everyone yes like
wasn't very happy neighbor while
neighborly applause every meanwhile my
ear is listening and yes indeed I hear
tons of photos nice i got the woman's
email address she reached out to me we
got in touch 30 bucks a pop she's sent
over the photos and didn't ask for
anything we sent her an amazon gift card
because we thought that was the least we
could do but amazing we have photos of
me of proposing and and look the best
camera in the world the great camera I
want to see that man was it I can show
have it right here uh yeah I've got him
on my lap no idea check out those so
really good and yeah it's a load off it
was I didn't expect the second that I
got the ring it was like a bomb yeah
apart take on my terrified it's gonna
get revealed or something and then like
you don't want to have that like lame
like uh I guess you found it well I
guess I'll propose here while you're
making dinner like you accidentally find
the Christmas present yeah terrible
ruins all the thrill so I I was really
happy I was able to startle her um and
do it into a scream and it was great we
got to spend the day you know my other
concern is that after you do it you have
to do you know you like tons of families
the whole diaper the whole thing but at
least we're on Governors Island she
obviously made phone calls I made phone
calls but right after that we were like
have a picnic and chill out and it was
fantastic really good so I found out
from social media yeah I didn't get a
call oh that that really so yeah well
here's the thing you know people who are
listening out there yeah I know where
you stand you do in someone's think
someone's pecking order I do uh yeah
he's already I'm method are totally I do
feel bad it was it was basically my
grandma my mom and you were gonna be
next to my phone died so you know I just
couldn't fit it in you were right there
I was right i should have wrapped it up
with my mom that is my favorite thing to
bust balls about congrats you guys are a
fantastic couple thank you i'm
definitely not freaking out about the
actual wedding preparations at all no
could not stressful at all I'm so
nothing so here's a little advice with
some pro tips uh you know I don't have
too many because I would I use what you
would call hands off yeah during the the
planning of our wettest and which is now
approaching five years my lord if you
can believe that wow salman um yet you
know put in exactly what you want okay
and that's what you're gonna get out of
it sure actually I take that back you're
gonna get way more out of it than what
you put in because I I mean I don't
wanna come off sounding like a dick
who's just like oh you're the dude who
just didn't give a about the
weather wages a cliche which is a cliche
and I did give many shits right not just
you know I did a few a few shits were
given sure and uh you know I was very
supportive and that's you gotta be
and it's all about it's all about the
couple right i shore does she want to be
that kind of you know hands-on person do
you not give a crap it's all about
finding the bow no I think we're both on
the same page in terms of like small
relatively headache as you plan a party
at chili's right are you chose yeah okay
applebees would work too um yeah no we
just wanna I don't know my my big
requirement is I want to not be
miserable for a year to be happy for one
night that is my number one goal for the
wedding preparation perfect goal so
we'll see if I can you don't wanna
you're not gonna be disappointed good um
what you might have been disappointed
this week by was primed a prime day is
the best thing that ever happened in the
internet I kind of love it how just just
how goddamn disappointing was amazon
prime day it was really funny cuz it was
so built up and it like fur I felt like
I heard about this thing two weeks in
advance that there was gonna be this
amazing sale and Amazon created it and
not only that it created a rivalry with
Walmart yeah well walmart saw the news
and was like we gotta do so you guys do
something and actually put together some
pretty good deals walmart in with like a
hundred and seventy dollar iPad Mini or
something crazy like that but it turns
that maybe hmm it turns out as we all
know prime day was a total disaster and
so far as like was like earlier it was
garbage they were selling garbage it
like here's the 16 foot hose for your
garden that might have some fork stuck
in it and makes and we're going to give
you 17 cents happen it was a glorified
garage sale yeah people were making a
big deal out of there was a copy of
borderlands 2 handsome Jack collection
on sale and people make a big deal of it
it was five dollars off the normal price
like you you were not saving any all
kinds of money there was also a perfect
example from my personal experience uh
one of the things so like it was really
weird you all the sales and if you don't
work the hell we're talking about you
just were not on the internet for a
couple days but you know amazon have
this massive sale they called the prime
day they said it was going to be better
than Black Friday okay that's a pretty
big tall are they say well here's the
question did they say
bigger or better because I said more
sales more sales so that's a very
relevant factor yeah because more does
not being better but the either way you
slice it amazon is not a company that
tries to necessarily deceive I mean
they're pretty consist and they're not
like a a bait-and-switch sort of
operation in any respect and you know
they had all these you know ever so they
they were like these flash sales right
so yeah you could get this you could get
a vacuum for twenty dollars off but
there's only a limited amount of vacuum
yes and once they were claimed you had
to get into like a virtual waiting list
so somebody who put it in their cart
never went up checking out they would
then go to the next person in line it
was a disaster yeah whole thing was
robbed so I come across this one are we
need a new dust buster okay okay i know
we are at the edge of your seat but we
needed a new does it a brand name or is
that just like the device that's the
device i think dust devil i think yeah
we got a wii that we were looking so i
found this black and decker wonka five
stars thousand reviews everyone loves
this fantastic flash sale $45 oh great
deal regularly 120 wow that's a great
deal sign me up sure i'm i'm into it ok
i go i don't get it i'm in the wait list
okay for it was like 47 bucks i think is
what it was going amazing view my god
damn it sure i'm gonna get blocked out
of this freaking duck a Dustbuster i
want it i want bad could taste it so i
get blocked out then the thing turns
over yeah and the sales over yeah and
the price is 49 99 huh prime delivery
one day yeah oh i was gonna save two
dollars right what the hell what the
hell's going on it is sort of funny that
like the normal price the amazon price
is like so good that the like discounted
price is like not that helpful so maybe
that's what this was maybe like we were
trying to come up with like conspiracy
theories as to what the hell this was
like who's idea was it why was this a
thing I mean it seemed to me like it was
just a way to get people signed up for
prime right it was just like hey come
get prime yeah if you sign up for 30
days you're going to want to be using it
are two to three times and you'll
realize how awesomely convenient it is
and you'll be a member for life yeah so
maybe that's what
they were going for but either way I so
we were saying like one of the
conspiracy cases like no no dude they
just want you to see how gnarly their
prices are to begin uh and that's like
this reverse psychological backing you
in yeah to the set seems like kind of a
roundabout way to do it it does and it
pissed off a lot of people in the
process because ever because by now most
savvy online people is that is that a
genre of petoria demographic most of
those people have prime or they use
prime yeah their prime password of a
relative yes something right agreed so
just to exactly was this for and a guess
maybe was for those you know sort of
people who are not prime people I think
there are people that like buy stuff off
amazon that don't have prime like other
people that like don't even think oh
this is worth it for me yeah so i think
there's a reason for it but you need to
like if you're gonna spend this much on
marketing a sale and like blowing out
and comparing it to by friday have some
like top-tier in there like really
go all out yeah nuts give me a TV for 35
bucks I mean there were some Kindles I
guess they were pretty cheap old no one
cares sandals right the paperwhite was
not on sale ridiculous yes so it did
seem like a big but amazon on amazon
they make so much money that i don't
know that i care they don't care and I
don't really think this is going to be
even a bump on their on their road to
continuing success we went to Twitter
and I said up what was amazon prime day
more disappointing then okay that's
right so this is so we got it we got
like a half a dozen decent responses
that i'd like to read here legend of
Schaefer says amazon prime day was more
disappointing than that one time I
family went to Anaheim and we didn't go
to this there's a really good subway in
and I'm like yeah primo subway that's
weird the hell you doing and I'm besides
go to Disneyland Jeff arc said amazon
prime days more disappointing than Apple
maps
Paul Santos amazon prime was more
disappointing than me according to my
overbearing Asian 50 sad but true not
bad uh beyond the text says amazon prime
day was more disappointing than their
fire phone that's pretty good 95 know a
lot of these are not so much
disappointing as like people like
curious and then they came out were just
garbage totally Isaac uh Isaac says
amazon prime days more disappointing
than shopping at Goodwill after a
structure fire no that's that's kind of
screwed up yeah just wants to do that
there's something really everything's
all on fire kind of upset about that m e
dot d says amazon prime days more
disappointing than getting this shitty
mcdonalds fry there's always one
McDonald's fry the taste like well
it looks like too it looks like all
like way overcooked chris i haven't had
mcdonalds fries in a while are you
talking about like the one that looks
like a cigarette yeah it's at the bottom
it like the weird cracker jack those
were weird crack Jack it's the roach of
the file yeah that's pretty good um yeah
it's uh oh there's ones I can't read I
really their illicit this is so weird to
this at not a celebrity says I was on
prime day was more disappointing than a
sad handjob with us okay that was what
is a set is as I said hanji like just
frowny faces I don't know a calloused
hands would be my guess like sandpaper
hands yeah that's very hanji i were to
extrapolate what the impression was yes
Adam Berry says amazon prime day is more
disappointing than pi day without a
piece of pie no amazon prime day
according to taylor is more
disappointing than Pacquiao mayweather
that's that's that's a good one i think
i probably fits a lot and I think we'll
finish it oh you know I was going to say
that's real good and then tando Gosa
will will finish it off for us amazon
prime day was more disappointing than
sucker punch the movie Sucker Punch yeah
I hated that movie and I was very
excited about it so good one there we go
thanks for participating
in that stuff yay Twitter can follow us
on twitter at the 404 will try and do
some of that stuff going forward we're
going to take a break when we come back
it's time for us to discuss just what
the hell is going on with reddit oh boy
big topic of conversation for the last
couple weeks a lot of controversy we are
reddit fans so we want to know just what
the hell is going on with this site why
can't they get it together more 404
right after this we all know building a
website can be tough have you have you
tried to build what I know nothing about
building anything on the Internet I can
type letters and sometimes they have
symbols around them and sometimes things
happen that's the extent of my knowledge
feel like you're the extent of your
knowledge is like the blinking tag I can
make things like how it's good for you I
used in ah you're talking to a guy who
knows HTML and I have major issues uh if

russ fresh dick yo newly engaged yep I'm
a man now that's it this is like your
second bar mitzvah it is I got three and
four coming up yeah yeah I'll just keep
them coming every 10 years another Bar
Mitzvah that's it yeah just make it
happen man um all right this is this is
a delicate subject but it's something we
absolutely have to discuss because
reddit is a big part of my life okay
it's a part of your life is it not it is
I use it quite a bit you go often do you
go dreadfully daily definitely it might
be the first thing that I check when I
wake up in the morning right so that's
pretty good I mean that it's not that
but I acknowledge how like it's not
important but it is I think I probably
waste more time on reddit than on any
other site so you frequent did a great
deal I do all right what has been going
on who is reddit groms it's naked your
arms mega drums it's not a simple binary
situation yeah okay a lot of ins and out
there are but let me try to boil down
the like a real quick what's been going
on so um they had a CEO who was like an
interim CEO named Ellen Pao um and she
was brought in and people sort of blamed
her for making a lot of decisions
regarding
certain subreddits that she felt well
that the site found objectionable and
also most recently the person that
organized the amas was a very popular
section with a interview celebrities
Obama and various other people um this
woman named Victoria was fired we don't
know why still don't know why I really
said well I have some peculation but we
can go into that in a second she was
fired a lot of people blamed the CEO
Ellen and there was a lot of hate
throwing her way and she basically got
ousted very recently got fired from
being the CEO and they brought in one of
the original co-founders now did she get
fired or did she I think officially she
really she resigned she was a push down
you should pick up and they brought in
one of the cofounders of Steve Huffman I
believe his name is yeah and he was sort
of trying to Harold in a new age of like
communication and explaining what their
thought processes and so recently he's
been doing a lot of posts about like
what's objectionable what's not were you
know they're redefining what their
content rules are like does like this a
really awful subreddit that he calls out
called raping women which is literally
like subreddit is titled raping women
debts and and he went out and said okay
so this is gonna be a get banned yet
there's ready to glare pretty clear
thing to get man but then he mentioned
so there are other sites this one I
don't really want to call them out
because they're really like even the
titles our eyes awful is raping women
but it's their race they're like very
race chart racially charged or racist
gress subtitles that's subreddits right
and he specifically called out those and
the delineation that they're making now
is that they're going to allow stuff
like that so long as those subreddits do
not encourage or demand or whatever
violence or harassment of other people
so you could say I don't like this group
of people but you can't say I'm going to
kill this group of people yes which
seems weird it's like why draw the line
there
because the rationale is if you don't
draw the line somewhere it's a very
slippery slope where you start defining
what is harassment and what is you know
bad and essentially at a certain point
like where is that line drawn so but
like okay fine sure yeah I'm not look
I'm not frequent thing and I know you're
not defending that yeah but it is it's a
tricky problem it's a tricky problem but
as a reddit user yes someone who's been
on the site for many many many years I
really don't think there's ever just an
okay place for that kind of stuff
regardless if they're not going after a
specific person so you're saying it's
good speech right you're saying like
stuff that's like I hate black people
right ample for what I got why not a
place like I'm sure there's a red
subreddit that's not too friendly with
the Jewish PS okay colletti any race
whatever it is whatever it is black
white brat whatever you are yeah I do
not believe that it is in the best
interest of reddit nor does it really
embody the philosophy of bastion of free
speech or if they continue to allow that
kind of stuff okay here's the deal yeah
isn't reddit not still a private company
it is a private company so why are they
bat like battling this short bit while
they Pacific's point specifically i
think the rationale is a they don't
they're worried about their like core
moderator centric user base they have
all these people that volunteer their
free time and they are worried that if
they start banning subreddits even the
really objectionable crazy ones um
they'll lose a lot of that support
because they bill are the moderators
threatened to leave if they ban I hate
all the Jewish people I don't know about
that one in particular but it's a better
example a bike or example let you know
let's just say our / I hate sheep okay
okay but that's a good example right so
let's say for example you you draw this
line you say we don't want hate speech
then it's like okay but like what if
someone does like I hate you well I hate
sheep okay that's see
if so if I'm the collective logically a
common sensed group of moderators yeah I
let that go because contextually it's
not offensive to any human being what
about I hate left-handed people or I
hate gingers is even a better exam so
it's not a race but you might take
offense that I think is like a lot of
integrity I think you need to vet it
right I think it needs to be completely
sure this impact right a second that
there's a lot of interpretation required
it becomes something I think they're
looking down the road and they're
worried about legally what they're
responsible for and they it needs to be
like a very legally defined terminology
for what they allow what they don't
allow because they want to at some point
start making a lot of money on this site
and granted they want to bury the gross
subreddits that are racist or what have
you but they don't want to risk their
fan base or whatever their rationale is
but who makes up what what fraction of a
percentage makes up the people it's very
simple long to I hate cheap it's very
small but also then the moderators
that's a very small percentage of people
that donate their time and the fears
that they would wrap riot or something I
don't know look it's it's very opaque
and it's very tricky and I certainly
wouldn't use reddit to go to like races
there whatever subreddits is not how I
want to spend my time I think they're
just worried of you know once you become
a morality police at a certain point
like that's a lot of time and effort
that has to go into that and you're
constantly you know wacom bowling these
offensive subreddits and you know
definitions of what's offensive changes
all the time so by having this very
clear-cut do you threaten violence or do
you threaten harm on these people is the
determination for for banning something
out right now the other ones are labeled
I guess objectionable and like siphoned
off into a part of the site that like
never shows up on the homepage never
shows up unless you actively search for
it so that's sort of how they're solving
the problem but again it's I don't know
it's a it's a tricky problem that you
know it I mean free speech is a weird
thing especially on the Internet yeah
and so and so right so now I'm gonna go
on like the other side of the fence and
say okay people do you have the right to
congregate and share that those feel ya
they don't have the right to do it on
reddit nécessaire like reddit could ban
them if they wanted of course one
hundred percent but if you want to sort
of couch yourself somewhat in a free
speech zone or like a free conversation
zone you do need to start being a little
less stringent you also have to like
really tread a fine line when it comes
to free speech on the internet because
any privately owned website that
amendment does not write matter yeah so
you have to like say ok well people are
open up so there's got to be free speech
on reddit well no it's up to reddit
whatever the hell they want to do right
well the shame of it and we're a lot of
the kind of humorous drama came from was
because when the new CEO came in he said
something along the lines of you know we
didn't create read it to be a passion of
free speech and then three seconds later
someone sort of dug up a an old
interview or one of the co-founders said
reddit is a batch and frisky or
something along those lies and add but
out of context I mean look yeah and that
was said when reddit was probably dry
filled with really good people and a
small community no I mean it was two
years ago so all right retrospect it was
it was right it was right by the yeah
yeah you know I mean it's in the
difference why those those two things
are so different is because at that time
read it was sort of a in a position of
relative you know removing themselves
from making those decisions you know the
whole like happening thing it was right
around that time and like so they were
trying to remove a lot of the coke
ability that they had the requirements
but you know now these days I mean it's
very clear that they're trying to make
some money and and monetize a little bit
more and at that point you need to
search start drawing those lines it's
surprising to me that they didn't
outright just ban everything I you know
there's been rumors that the board said
ban ban anything that's remotely
objectionable but again this is all
especially if I
if anything you know even though reddit
has four for a number of years been one
of the most popular websites on the
internet yeah there does seem to be this
new awakening like it's going through
another metamorphosis yeah I think an
age of like awareness yeah thought
awareness it's Brits transcending that
sort of under the radar mainstream
dividing line yeah people real everyone
now really does know what about this
site and it's starting to get a stigma
yes because it has this very heavily
male user base which can be construed as
you know a sort of sexist situation or
misogynistic rather and it's you know
you don't want that to be the you know
the the sort of byline yeah on the whole
reddit fiasco and it's a shame because
what like when people when I say to
people oh yeah I go on reddit or
whatever and they're like oh really
that's like gross yeah I do that like
and I'm like I'm looking at like cat
gifs and memes it's like memes and
reading news stories like I think what a
lot of people who have never been on the
site don't realize is like if you go to
the homepage you're not really gonna see
anything objection oh oh except for that
video the rock breaking his finger that
was that was fake really was it fake you
oh my god I only batter up on my father
that was fake okay one on the rock yet
um it looked fake too I mean yeah but
like my mind was so flushed with
adrenaline yeah I seeing that are just
like and you were like man the rock so
strong right that nothing hurts it yeah
you can laugh this off yeah I believe it
yeah it was definitely um yeah what's
weird to me is like like I don't want
reddit and I'm sure I'm gonna get doxxed
for this I don't want reddit to have the
same stigma that fortune has like
fortunes a very ugly stik it does and
yes is there good natured crap going on
on fortune I'd sure hate me perhaps but
now like you know I I just don't want
that to happen but again the Internet is
a living organism this happened to dig
dig did not go through the
political socio sort of cultural issues
that read it not going just a redesign
and did a redesign its up never was like
okay we're I read we're going to because
they're doing a better up what do you
think reddits here three years from now
yeah 100 yeah no question and what like
you were talking about percentages like
how many some less than one right it's
super small and not only that the
percentage of people that like care
about any of this right also super small
like people in my opinion people do not
care where this happens yeah right like
the content that's on reddit will always
seem to manifest itself in some sort of
generalized organic gathering spot
whether or not it's read it really
doesn't matter yeah there's already
competitors that are there that are
essentially doing the same thing the
difference is read it is established and
people like the design the simple design
and now quick it loads and but who knows
like I don't know it would take a major
calamity for them to lose the god
hundreds of millions of users they have
on a daily basis but no I don't see it
happening and i'll tell you this call it
unfortunate call it whatever you want
but this is just the reality of it all
in my opinion it will not take a
situation like this for people to
abandon ship it'll take some sort of
functional thing like the what the site
it'll does a redesign every design or
like where you know and I it's almost
sad to say but it's something like this
where people will sort of maybe give
reddit the benefit of the doubt but then
if they then decide to say hey we're
monetizing amas and now amas are open
for product placement or and
endorsements that's when you know the
again even if that were to happen I
still think the percentage of people
that care yeah everything would be more
a would be worn less than one it would
be more but I honestly like whatever I
don't think it's gonna make that much of
an impact and when we bring up the less
than one percent we reference the people
who have been very vocal about yeah and
and like if you take example like the
people who wanted
uh you know who signed that petition to
get the CEO booted yeah like less than
1% I'll read it but so like a hundred
thousand people yeah which is a lot yeah
but first of all in comparison so that's
yeah it's dramatic I don't know I liked
I still like using site cute cats and
various other things what's your
favorite sub right so for months for
like eight months straight I destiny
subreddit was a subreddit I checked
literally every day and it was
fascinating because we were constantly
fighting like crazy cheats and like ways
to beat the game in weird ways and and I
still go on there just from an interest
level standpoint but I don't play
destiny anymore so it's less engaging to
me and now I mean I'm on aw i'm on oz
one of the default yeah i I don't I
think destiny might be the only non
default really I do like dozens no I
don't know you tell me you don't
subscribe to our / the 440 know as you
probably subscribe to it I go to it a
lot I do actually go to it um I've been
thinking that I maybe I should make a
new account oh why is the old one too
much of a shattered pan I don't know I
feels like people always make a separate
account one that's like the official I
yeah that's part of reddits problem but
I do go on the floor for subreddit so if
you want to say anything to me like it
was a very nice post about me doing a
good job last week was I was alright
yeah I did that that was me as you just
as your as your alt name I just want to
boost your ego a little bit thank you no
no so that yeah I should probably
subscribe to it get the subscriber
numbers up I see you know I still have
questions about reddits functionality
and like the the logic that programs the
front door the front page yeah like I
know there's a default set of subreddits
yeah but sometimes like one that isn't a
default one will make right yeah how's
that work it's interesting like is our /
old-school cool like that's not a
default so bright so that is that just
like well this one really really popped
yeah you wonder whether or whether it's
something that's like you know these
people Trey you know internal people
track it and they're like oh this
deserves there's got to be something and
I think there is a level of moderation
and
curation that happens sure uh where they
sort of say hey r / like are such creepy
yeah I love because it's like all ghost
stories is that creepy pasta is that the
same thing no that's a different so does
creepypasta I think are such group of us
is just like weird things people see in
pasta no no no it's something else is
that's what that scary stories or like I
confuse that with no snow sleep is
another one I do which is not so r / no
sleep and given i read their Sarah some
of those stories are ex some of them are
really good uh so we're just we're
talking about subreddits this basically
the the you know sort of pieces of the
reddit puzzle uh my so what was it
creepy is just the ghost stories okay no
sleep is scary stories but crew pasta
what was it creepypasta be pausing it up
now I think it relates to what was that
really tall gentleman in the forest what
a suit besut did a tall scary guy and
the girl murdered someone over it no I'm
talking about no skinny man no slender
blenders Thunder man Thunderman yeah I
think it's related to that huh um it's
oh I think okay so it's like a genre of
like horror yeah I guess I mean it is
scary as well I don't know it's
confusing but is confusing but yeah a
lot of 45,000 sub subscribers to that
one let us know what your favorite
subreddit is I would appreciate that
mangy 13 yeah keep it pg-13 I'm always
on the lookout for for good and new
subreddit yeah I'm gonna log in to me I
feel like oh I do a lot of like finance
stuff like investing oh yeah I'm so glad
it was down there to you yeah that's fun
there was a pretty good one that was I
think edited commercials I don't know
what the name of it was but essentially
people cutting commercials with like
inappropriate scenes not cut into them I
love that really good I'm a huge fan of
cringe-worthy printer where these
greater / thanks worthy just like those
things that are just almost unwatchable
cuz im so cringe-worthy
pretty great yeah so there you have it
that's the story with reddit I hope we
hope we explain that in a manner that
you can understand and now you will
sound bright and relevant and in the
know when you have your reddit
conversation at your social gathering
this weekend yeah because that you will
be a thrilling person at that party he
will be the one they all go to to ask
questions brief brief segue I was at a
party in Los Angeles actually during e3
we were all drinking at the bar that
everyone goes out there to drink at and
this random guy came up to me and he's
like are you here for the reddit meetup
and I was like nope cuz you look like
that guy and then he sort of just stuck
around for a really long time with and
talking and then it just got really
weird wait a minute so a random dude
rant totally random guy he didn't know
that you were you well no he just
thought I was a guy at a bar and was
like hey you here for the RIT meet up I
mean he wasn't like that it wasn't like
a bear thing so he so he just thought
that's where it was like an e3 reddit
meetup no it was just like I think was a
like a live reddit meetup huh I've never
been to one yeah I heard some story yeah
I don't really have a desire I filled
yet you don't you don't want to do that
now I don't know I'm not gonna tell you
how to live your life out there but hey
people were meeting people so that's
good and as long as everyone's having a
good time staying safe and not hurting
anyone why the hell not Taemin all right
here's a little uh disclosure about our
new co-host russ fresh do ah russ has a
would you call it which what's what
would you call that thing that's wrong
with you I probably a disability it's
not i do not think it's a disability i
honestly think i deserve my own parking
spot the only disability that would like
you could never fly an airplane is like
the disability i could I just probably
wouldn't be very good at or they'd be
like ah no I think it's actually like a
prerequisite like if you are this you're
not allowed to fly a plane right but I
could I mean yes I could also do things
that I shouldn't sure yeah so I'm color
blind Oh gasp yeah that's terrifying so
yeah I'm carbon red green
blue purple colored wine I'm various
other colors I don't just see Gray's
even though it's fun to pretend that I
do to people that I first tell them
cover mine so so yeah like these people
go like to when you look at the
grassroots Luke right so the invariable
follow up to finding out them colorblind
is trivia on what colors things are in
the nearby vicinity like instantly where
every instantly what's that you pointed
something that scenario has played out
probably 30 or 40 times in my life oh
and it never gets old brutal yeah so the
best way I can sort of describe it is
just like it's just sort of dull so
since I left so like there's a red chair
here I think it's red right that's right
that's very much red right but I guess
colors are duller to me so sometimes if
like a red and a green shade sort of
match the shade the lightness of it I I
won't be able to differentiate the two
I'm sorry blue and purple same way blue
purple look alike ok for your just and
that's where I really get hung up
because it's like how carbine am I in
comparison to normal people cuz
sometimes they'll be like oh yeah those
look alike yeah so like navy and grey
for a lot of people look alike right as
they do look well so I have a story of
when I was in high school and I went and
bought a bag like a shoulder bag and I
brought it home and my friend laughed at
me because it was a bright purple
shoulder bag and I thought it was great
hahaha that's messed up so yeah uh and
so now I have to be very careful so you
don't know what purple is I mean I have
a concept of it and if something's like
deep purple I can see it like it needs
to be like a lot of red in the purple
for me to see it put you in can you see
pink again it needs to be like a deep
like if it's like a light pink it might
look like a silver to me huh it needs to
be like a very deep pink because I'm not
seeing the red that's the problem is
that if there's like a very little
amount of red yeah in those shades I
just don't see it it's very weird
because there's like a genuine like
stalemate when it comes to a colorblind
person and someone who can see ya
because there's well because you can't
explain write this thing but there isn't
any more because of this new company
that is not sponsoring the show but it
sounds like it should because that's a
really good lead-in how the hell they do
it so this company called an chroma went
and made these glasses that apparently
color blind people can wear and suddenly
you you see the world as if you were not
horrible how could that possibly work so
the way I understand it is the issue
with like my wiring that my wiring is
fine internal like the otwell the eyes
alone are fine but I'm missing like
certain I guess rods or cones or
whatever the hell that help
differentiate this so they basically
just built whatever those things are
into the lenses and that allows you to
see hmm these colors and they have a
bunch of videos I actually saw this
video this week of this guy seeing color
for the first time and weeping he weeps
in this video and it was like really
made me question like would I react the
same way in the same way that like you
see those videos of the deaf person that
hears the first time I think it's like
ball you're gonna go there like it's
crazy like the cochlear implant am I
being crazy yes I'll let you know no I
don't know because what if i put these
guys none it's like a rainbow world
you're not freaking blind man still see
the world and here the world what if
that red chair was like like a dragon a
dragon no it doesn't matter because dude
 all right are you are you I don't
know maybe there's a part of my brain
that would just explode at the site of
actual color you put there's no way to
know still possess the sense like you
still are able to see and see most
colors sure yes even if you saw in black
and white okay I would still have way
more sympathy for the cochlear implant
person sure hearing for the first time
I'm not I'm not saying I don't deserve
sympathy I the sympathy bright but the
fact that you try to compare it again
sure I'm sure it's a breathtaking
epiphany okay but hearing is probably
more dramatic than picking out Barney
the Dinosaur
yeah he's the the green one great what
the dinosaur Yeah right a triceratops
but the video is it's touching I mean
he's genuinely yeah crying yeah it with
joy tears of joy yeah I don't know I
would I don't think it would be that
impactful to me because I feel like in
my brain I can endure like the brightest
red imaginable right but maybe I can't
have you ever seen like lava yeah and
what is that just look like not he's
made a pretty red see that so you see I
see it but like maybe the real version
of lava is slow your letter and bring
you to tea it's like crazy red that's so
you know I'm saying it's difficult to
wrap your head around and also a drag
cuz like there's no real benefit apart
from like if they reinstated the draft
they probably wouldn't take me but even
then like I could do paperwork right
you're talking about how weird they find
room for you out of it here's the deal
right if this stuff works so well you're
a guy who wears glasses yeah just put
that feature into your going right so
well the issue right now is the in
chroma their their shaded it looks like
you're wearing sunglasses okay so figure
it out they'll figure it out well they
were they actually did a medical test
for recently where they injected
something into mouse eyes and asked the
mouse has asked them out all the hell do
they know that's an easy test you
basically like put a door the title the
red thing to get food ratch the green
thing to not and they don't see it dance
right yeah so I mean and I asked the
facts I no joke if there was like an eye
injection thing that I could get to fix
it yeah I would definitely do it that's
I would definitely do it I wouldn't do
it that year it came out the one point
over I you wouldn't be the guinea pig
but totally yeah like in the same way
that like I would prob i'll probably get
laser eventually me yeah well that's
pretty common yeah but that's what I was
like yeah so become common why don't you
get the laser scary yeah it's scary the
lasers on your eyeballs so I don't know
I feel I feel like my face works better
with glasses is that weird oh no it's
not weird I think that's a that's a
product of you becoming more Young's to
yourself I think you're right with
glasses than without I do like the
convenience I will
want to be able to lie on my side in the
cat on the couch and not have to wear
glasses because they kind of press into
my head yeah I was the laziest reason I
can come up with I just know I can
sympathize because I'm now a like post
6pm glasses guy right we're at the less
light there is in the world the more I
struggle to see ya I have stigmatism
sure um I don't even know what that is
it's I belong I hear about in contact
lens commercials that's it well I
believe it's like my eyes just aren't
getting the amount of light in that they
don't like your eyes are the shape of an
egg well mo gotta guys are I believe in
when you like squint you're basically
bending the shape of your eye sure and
that's what helps you see better okay so
your free k guys need contact lenses I
don't I don't wear contacts I do wear a
very low prescription for seeing far
away as well I don't know um I think you
have to really also what I was saying is
like so when I put the 6pm glasses on
yeah they're like seasoned well I give
them a kiss or something I hate that I
hate that like oh like all you need for
a kiss and it's like it's like it's like
oh yeah sorry trying to hug someone with
hats on yes like sorry I've got a
mechanical apparatus on my face yeah
it's impeding on our cheek kissing yeah
you know it's weird its first world
problems she kissing first row problems
so yeah it's a drag so I would totally
work car wine glasses if someone wants
to send me the 400 hour in chroma
glasses that'd be super cuz I'm not
buying yeah let's see we can do that and
see if we could get rust to cry on air
that seems like a really good investment
for your listeners after uh yeah you
know it i will i would not i would wait
until we're actually recording and try
them on on air for the first time that
seems like a really good show I'd you're
damn straight you'd wait so let's let's
make that happen listeners let's make it
a reality people yep all right there's a
there's a product hunt game there is
that deals with color related to this
yeah actually we we had so as people may
or may not know i work at product on
which is sort of a community based site
we've products i run the games category
on that site and just yesterday we
actually had the devs
from a game called specimen a game about
color in doing an ama on the site and
it's actually just design-wise are
really cool like it's in a Micra it's
set in like a microscope like a petri
dish like a petri dish and you're trying
to match colors essentially but just
just visually it's a very cool you poor
guy mobile game but yeah I can't play it
I mean all right I just can't like I
like the look of it yeah and i was
watching my girlfriend play yesterday
sorry my fiance I gotta get better at
that come on I'll edit that out thank
you my fiance was fine yesterday I was
like oh yeah that's the game we just had
on the site and she's like oh yeah well
I you know yeah you definitely can't
wait why can't they do like the color
blind proof thing where they put like
patterns on I mean it would make the
game a lot uglier like a very pretty
game right now and it just would ruin
you you've heard it's a pretty game yeah
you've been told a pretty good yes oh
alright buddy that's cool it's it's an
iphone right now um definitely worth
downloading it's free so that's good and
I can't play cuz I'm an Android yeah
it'll probably come to Android
eventually uh you know I'm so sick of
this second class citizen crap with an
android phone yeah the problem is
there's it's so much harder to make
money on Android I know that like it's
kind of hard to encourage people do it
all the way through my games is a lot of
free to play games on there right even
though there's like arguably more people
with android phones yeah more poor
people wow wow alright gonna let that
one a simmer we'll take one more break
get a word from our sponsor for a second
and then we'll finish things up with a
couple of nerdy conversations we

back getting ready to finish up the show
here but first I mean you know we're
trying to incorporate one or two of
these like you know interesting geek
trivia / fun little you know k this is
definitely a funds this this particular
story is not fun but it's damn interest
it's really interesting um I think a lot
of people are probably aware that
Brandon Lee was Bruce Lee's son died
while making the film The Crow yeah very
good film worth watching a lot of emo
kids dig it because of all the makeup
and such it's like how long ago is this
now it's gotta be 20 years at this point
this was at the time we were two we were
like what 1230 yeah around there this I
remember this being such a strange story
that no one could properly explain right
well I think it took a while for the
truth to really get out and figure out
exactly what happened and I think a lot
of people mistakenly know it as well
they just put real bullets in instead of
blanks and that
was it because he got shot on the set
while they were shooting some was
shooting a blank basically a pistol a
time with blanks in it and he got shot
while that was going on and killed and
people just assume oh they put bullets
in it by X which like how would that
ever happen well okay so I was reading
this post is actually is on reddit and
apparently a Dave Brown who is a
firearms safety specialist did a QA a
while ago on and he basically explained
exactly what happened which was so they
had a fire on firearms expert on set
okay but they were very it was very low
budget and they didn't have a lot of
money so I didn't realize I was a
low-budget movie it was a very low
budget of a very limited in terms of
scheduling and and what have you so
there was a moment at which they wanted
to film a close-up of an extra
essentially loading a gun this was
separate from the scene they're talking
about with Brad Brandon Lee and all that
stuff just like a close-up of a hand
reloading a gun at this point they're
trying to get as much as they can done
they've already sent the firearms expert
home so he's gone oh what they're like
well I guess we'll just load it with
these bullets real bullets to get the
shot so they do that the boat are in
their lead him on why are real bullets
on set I think they didn't have like
maybe he was controlling the blanks or
something or they needed to buy blank
slate at night or something I don't know
cuz that's how huge like sort of curing
into this story why in the freaking okay
so they say this is in the Q&amp;amp;A he says
the production needed some dummy
cartridges for a close-up shot of
loading a revolver not knowing any
better they purchased real cartridges
from the local gun store pried off the
bullets dumped the gun powder and stuck
the bullets back in their case you can't
do that well that's what they did so at
least they took the Gunpowder out but
that wasn't enough so they got they they
go through this process they have the
guy Prime the gun fire it again there's
no gunpowder but there are I guess the
primer on the on the bullet ends up
pushing one of the bullets like an inch
or two down the barrel of the gun so
this gun exists it's got this bullet
majd in it the gun gets emptied they
whatever it's it's completely empty they
like check these cylinder there's no
bullets in there later they shoot with
Brandon Lee they put blanks in it and
they'd fire one of the blanks and the
explosion from the blank which actually
blanks have a lot more gunpowder in them
than normal bullets about three times
launched the bullet that was in the in
the barrel from before out into bradley
and that's what killed and he'll die
from one bullet he died from the one
point is that unbelievable that's so and
there's so many moments in that process
we're like all someone needs to do is
like check the barrel clean the gun how
did that so many different moments where
that needs to happen and it just didn't
it's pretty amazing it took to it was
two weeks later that Brandon Lee was
shot after this bullet was just sitting
in there for two week two weeks later
but that's what a crazy and and they
even there's even a technique that a lot
actor filmmakers use when firing guns
even then even when they're loaded with
blanks where you don't actually point
the gun right at the purse or it's like
behind like a bullet right plexi users
are you cheated so even though there are
blanks and everything you take all
precautions because you just never ever
ever point a gun at someone unless
you're planning on killing them and I
almost feel like a lot of gun firing now
is like CG yeah well yeah right yeah
maybe we'll Don the lower budgets ya
know even what yeah you're right
probably on like Avengers movies or
agents of shield I don't think they're
firing blanks I think it's just like
they add in some fire effects to the end
of the gun or something I mean we don't
know a genuine recoil well not really
because he's got life you've ever had
have you fired a gun before yes okay so
if you've ever fired a nine millimeter
which in my brain playing video games
and stuff I'm like that's a small a lot
of kickback yeah there is the other
words so I think a lot of people
misunderstand that so like the kickback
that you see actors use is totally fake
yeah because if it was real no one would
it be able to fire a pistol with one
hand with one hand
10 rounds a minute or whatever right 20
rounds a minute um so clearly they're
faking the recoil but yeah it's just
kind of a crazy crazy story that I
didn't until this week like I always
knew yeah there was probably a bullet in
the gun but i had no idea how many like
fail-safes failed for that to actually
happen insurance it's it's really awful
but chances are someone probably wanted
him to die what if I'm just saying do we
that's a freaking twist that seems like
a lot of awful things to happen for that
to end up knowing and I'm not saying a
murder but I'm saying like you know
destiny if well all you're saying like
divine intervention I'd a bit out of
here okay you're joking around I thought
for a second you thought this is like
conspiracy that I kill Brendan late have
some to increase box office numbers on
the crow all that I just remember it
being such a weird story tragic crazy
and so like the craziest part is like
each struck him in the chest yeah and it
just died yeah and they related i
instantly got like 13 hours ever and
they released the movie sure like on
schedule yeah and how did that work well
i think a lot a lot of it was shot a be
you know your main actor didn't keep
that scene and no no i don't think so
it's not like the little person in the
background which arise where they have
you know like death scene in the movie
um but look it was a convenient that
their main protagonist is wearing real
by the way what that Wizard of Oz things
not real well everyone else go yeah go
to can't ask anyone now so how do you
know go to snow truth died with them
yeah no go to snow it's like clearly ass
and egg I see I'm always fooled the rock
video Wizard of Oz there was another
thing too recently I was fooled by you
got duped I don't know be surprised i'm
easily do it happens under fairly
regular basis and that's a new thing try
and do paintbrush dick send me videos
and I'll see and he'll believe there was
something very reason i would i well
know literally just today I was watching
a video of a kid that stole his bike
back you hear what the story where he
was like.he like saw on craigs crab bike
got stolen
he looked on craigslist his bike is on
craigslist he calls the guy he sets up a
meeting and then steals his bike back
when they're at the meeting hit for him
to sell the bike it's all fake it's all
fake because you're watching that Yuri
watch the video and while the videos
going on he's on speakerphone with the
guy oh and you hear the guy in the other
room responding to on speakerphone and
then a second later coming through in
his phone so the guys literally in the
other room and I just didn't notice it
until the end it was very embarrassing
I'm easily duped easily easily duped um
yeah but bread and Lee you know he was
wearing a makeup so they probably were
able to shoot the rest of it pretty easy
yeah it's a tragic tragic story brought
in some ICP fan it was a piece of cake
there's a good movie though yeah I
enjoyed the crow yeah real good so that
brings me to the last sort of topical
half of the day I I had this idea a
while back I don't know maybe it was
like a chemically induced idea okay but
I like you got dropped in a vat like the
Joker yeah and he came out with this I
and I was like oh my god I've got a
great idea for a video game cool I would
love the ability to play some of my
all-time favorite action movies okay and
play the entire movie as a game okay
like now are we talking so when you say
that this is what leaps to mind is like
one of those don bluth like dragon's
lair games or like an F mvgame really
not that I do I'm not not saying that
I'm saying a great amount of effort in
development okay in recreating yeah and
I'll use the example of true lies okay
already a video game intro for choice
but that's irrelevant because I want to
do I want to play that movie here I
think you could somehow keep the
performances of all the actors involved
like as FMV video as like motion can you
they don't realize that no because it's
a flat image you can I was like but you
extrapolate but we did like maybe you'd
have to scan all the actors okay sure
but keep their performances okay fine so
you digitally scan them in
a day sure and you get them digitized
into the the game okay but then I want
to be Arnold Schwarzenegger in that okay
so here's here I think I get what you're
saying and there's so much the reason i
bring up True Lies is a it's like this
hilarious and hashing comedy awesome
games cameras best and uh you know
there's so much diverse action yes and
like think about like the horse chase
motorcycle seem like that would be so
much fun to play sure and I'm talking
and I'm not saying like I want it shot
for shot the movie right but I want like
I wanted to be game over if I like fall
off the trailer guy but that seems that
Mike like are we not talking kind of
like essentially Goldeneye I me not
talking about the same thing that video
game a video game is it I don't remember
using that's it's very good it's and
it's like and it's very close eye line I
mean seen to see in pretty close to what
goes on I thought we're talking about I
mean in the sense of Golden Age you're
talking about a golden I you're talking
about a movie that's like 20 years old
sure we're on nintendo 64 yeah we're now
you could really have fun in and give it
the the the the game adaptation it
deserves and I mean people love that
game totally you know it's going to
garbage now go back by yeah it doesn't
hold up but what I'm saying like yeah
let's let me do that it's a bad idea
I've decided your ideas bad here's the
prob were like die hard okay great great
example diehards a great example the
problem what you're talking about is
like a very because because these games
would need to follow a very strict and
they be short format and they'd be short
which maybe is good maybe it's good but
the problem is it's so limiting in terms
of a few things one development of the
game because the film needs to be shot
so are you talking about releasing this
day and date with the film no now
classics classics you're only talking
about fine like finally so yes John
McClane but like okay it was always
intended you're fighting the long-haired
blonde german dude yeah eventually gets
hung by the chain yeah he's like
shooting down at you with the lights
terug awesome assault rifle yeah
are you following the exact footsteps
where John McCain stepped look first of
all it's McLean mcclain John ok John
became the war I McCain did no no
because that's impossible because then
you just like on Rails chair sucks right
so no you're you're each scene yeah you
maybe you like work this is this is an
evolving okay i really i think it out
we're talking it out is evolving shitty
idea continues weird i'm trying to take
it from to like okay a flower sure
okay so right now it's diarrhea and I
want to be like something you'd want to
put something on the better on the scale
yeah the poops go right yeah uh so let's
say no okay you you then are given like
the scene by scene treatment sure where
I guess they take out some of the fodder
in the in the middle getting out of like
na kotoba getting show like I don't need
to see that okay you know is his name
not gonna tell me or not tell me towers
yeah but with the guy that gets shot hit
her boss I think that's a fair
assumption but may not be right okay I
would not be upset with you sure if you
were wrong okay um are we taking out
Carl Winslow scenes yeah like that
exposition it seems like a mistake it
seems like you don't need that in them
going to like they can mean store and
then hearing and then walking outside
and looking at the building in the
distant maybe that's like the opening
pro like maybe you then play Carl okay
and you have to get to na koto meet our
and like a body falls on his car and he
backs up screaming yeah like easy this
is the issue is that all of these
moments like our coach just reversing a
car is not interesting for a game now if
you're I'm gonna paint you a die-hard
game that I would be totally into
playing yeah but so like so maybe what
I'm getting it okay is what you're about
to say okay so what I'm thinking of for
a dire game and you need you can't
follow the part of the movie because it
does not work in Game four being an
interesting modern game imagine this
instead all of Nakatomi Plaza has been
taken over picture it like an open world
game set in a skyscraper and you're
slowly but surely making your way
through the skyscraper picking off guys
finding whatever notes from Hans Gruber
as he's practicing a better
wish I said why would he leave notes
around knock to tell like recordings of
like him trying different accents to see
what's going to be most fooling you yeah
that seems like a game yet because but
that's also like it's it's limited to
the skyscraper that's why it works sure
has this like but later I rock is
limited to a rapture other levels yeah
yeah buts though I like wandering the
cafeteria or sings like True Lies
doesn't have that okay but true lies a
really good example because it also
doesn't really jive with video game like
the way you make a video game because
the most video games are made with the
core gameplay in mind so the core
gameplay in Need for Speed is driving
right or whether it's like or platformer
where discovers writer based shooting
winner and the second that you have they
call an exotic gameplay right and the
second you have something that's like Oh
totally different from the normal game
place a lot of work totally be a sort of
start from scratch so the second that
you're talking about a movie like True
Lies you need racing you need shooting
mechanics lying any flying iving you
need a motion shooting where horse
riding you drop the machine gun down the
stairs like should be so much fun but
it's just it could never happen it could
never and also I don't like the game's
over in like two hours and I don't think
it would be that engaging digit
essentially it's as engaging as like
like a times was that time cop what is
the the shooting game in the arcades and
the movie theaters now time time crisis
crisis time cross like as engaging it's
like a time Christian which is fun for a
little while I there's a way I've been
there I think there's a way to do it I
think you may be I think the answer
would not be like let's turn True Lies
into like let's let people play the
classic True Lies angry I think maybe
you uh the movie rather I think you like
turn the movie into an extended story
yeah that bet that still touches on
everything the movie did sure it would
be like what it would be the first
person it would be like third person
shooter imagine a game like red dead
redemption which people love by calling
that the good the bad and the ugly which
caused from a lot of the same idea open
world I want the linear experience okay
you want to live I don't I think first
for if you're telling if you're if the
if the if the angle to this is
you're getting to play your favorite
classic movie yeah your diehard your
True Lies your what have you I think you
have to make it linear because your
honor and the expedition a try there for
so many years and just no one can hear
ya better garbage look like so uncharted
ya could be a movie first yes we're like
he is hunting down these exotic treasure
yeah and there's like plot points in
those game yet that seemed to mirror
surface level action-adventure games
yeah in action adventure movies yes
that's true because right fired by like
Indiana Jones exactly so I feel like you
could they have done it in reverse right
where they've like created this
Hollywood blockbuster yeah but they made
so many changes to it to make it more of
a like to make it a game it just doesn't
work you guys do a one to one yeah so
your idea is terrible it's not in in in
spirit yeah and it's in a good place it
comes from a good place I believe that
your heart is pure Jeff yeah that's
really all that matters and that's it so
if I were to pick one I'd say failure to
launch maybe the matthew mcconaughey
movie i think could be really good I was
thinking all the way I was thinking mean
girls mean girls could be really good
Lindsay could come back and provide
voice I'm sure she's not doing anything
else haha um monkey bone man beetlejuice
I would play a beatlejuice game just
watched it this weekend again for the
16-time so what do you like when you
watch a movie like that do you sit down
and turn it on well ours never seen it
already so right we talked about yeah
she's she's definitely we're
experiencing a lot of movies for her
first time together it's fantastic well
I would imagine the the marriage is on
the condition yeah that shall we when we
actually went to the tim burton show me
the danny elfman show she surprised me
with tickets actually like right after i
saw you last week yeah so that was
really great I heard that was awesome oh
my god the show was amazing and
Betelgeuse is a start
finished perfect movie it's amazing like
I didn't remember enjoying it it is
perfect the the production design is
perfect the art direction is the descrip
the jokes every sing ah and the
performances are stellar yeah amazing
although that guy is a pedophile now so
it sort of tainted a little bit ok so
I'm not about to go ahead and defend
Jeff oh no yeah I don't as he been on
the show no I don't know his whole story
like I don't know if he's a pedophile
yeah I don't know if he was ever bad was
he ever convicted I think so yeah all
right obviously I'm not gonna defend him
if he is a bad situation if he's like in
jail or was convicted or anything like
that I don't want to search him because
I'm worried about Lisa me Wow all
right so where did he get his legs not
that we should be laughing at what he's
guilty for but if you don't even feel
comfortable searching him clearly his
legacy is tainted yeah we're talking
about Rooney from Ferris Bueller's Day
Off are you our Laguna i'm looking it up
because an AP news wire story what's his
deal arrested for alleged sex acts with
a minor oh god okay that's no good not
good corey feldman quote from corey
feldman calling out Jeffrey Jones oh Sh
ever good well some of the little more
credibility me but here's one yeah okay
this is a bad it's a yeah anyway i wanna
i want to end on that i want to end on
that but go see beetlejuice if you have
my god it's spectacular it's yeah it's
