just keeps getting worse for blackberry

emergency alert you now have the option
of getting a notification from Twitter

that gives some local state and national
authorities the power to blast out alert
tweets that are sent out as text
messages and push notifications it also
appears on your Twitter timeline but you
have to sign up to get the alerts you
can find the full list at about twitter
com
alerts note-takers love to rave about
the app evernote but for those of you
that's still like using paper and
post-it notes the two worlds are merging
Evernote has partnered with 3m the maker
of post-it notes so users would take a
photo of the post-it and the software
could quickly save it digitally and you
can set it so different colors are filed
away for different notes like pink for
groceries for example there are also
special moleskine notebooks that work
well with Evernote that's your tech news
update but you can get more details on
