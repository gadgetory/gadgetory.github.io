your games you know I like and I'd like
to think that we were certainly with
fighting games I think we were first you
know doing the the reptile and Mortal
Kombat one was literally me driving to
KFC on like a Sunday in the in the
drive-in like you know waiting in the
drive-through and going you know what we
did oran or we did blue we did yellow we
can make a green palette will call him
reptile and like the end of the day he
was in the good I got was it was
literally as as as kind of randomly
inspirational thought you know that
there's like oh we can do it let's look
and didn't even tell anybody didn't tell
John Tobias and tell anybody that that
it's in the game ago let's see when
people find it and somebody sent me a
picture of like their arcade head you
know find the reptile they put it and I
still have that pictures of this day so
those are the kind of really cool that's
what I love to see like secrets in the
games where people freak out over it and
you know want to uh you know if people
just love uncovering stuff in games but
even before the Internet I mean someone
had to find that in the arcade machine
yeah yeah like and that's and it was
spread truly word about it for one guy
to the next to the next and it was even
moves do we move exactly and and um that
that was that was such a big part of
Mortal Kombat was we didn't document
anything we just said here play is Liu
Kang and all of a sudden how did I throw
that fireball well just keep playing it
that somebody figures out you know it's
toward toward high punch and then that
word of mouth let's talk about it and a
lot of people made friends playing mk2
or playing something like that and and
how did you Shane how did you make
shanks tone change into qantarah oh you
hold it for like 20 seconds and you let
go you know and then that kind of
conversation is like you know it's weird
there's a lot of like like it bonds
people and stuff like that so that's
cool do you think that the internet age
has kind of spoiled some of that charm I
mean it's helped obviously it completely
spoiled like I remember we were making
MK 2 or 3 and that's when like like
forums were just kind of getting out
there so somebody in California can post
something on rec games that all MORTAL
KOMBAT or something and it's somebody in
New York can see it that night and go oh
that's how you do so in just fatality
you know and I remember thinking at that
point that's the beginning of the end of
secrets and video games that are you
know discovered</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
