at Qualcomm's headquarters in San Diego
and I'm in a demo a technology that is
near and dear to my heart it's a
wireless charging now Qualcomm calls
this why power this is their particular
solution and here's how it works just
bear with me we've got a wireless
charging pad right here on the table and
imagine that this is something that's
embedded underneath the surface like a
conference table or a desk or it could
even be embedded in it but probably
underneath so this will represent our
surface like a table we lay it on top of
this charging area and then from there
you can just take any device that is
compatible with wireless charging and
drop it anywhere on this area as long as
it's within the target but it means that
you don't have to carefully align it you
can put it sideways and you can even use
more than one device as long as it's
compatible another really great
attribute to this particular setup is
that if you have other common household
items especially if they're made of
metal using other technologies they
could really heat up make things really
hot or even stop the wireless charging
process but that isn't the case here so
you have a couple different form factors
that you can use one is the sort of
tabletop charging device beneath a
surface and another is something that
stands straight up like this demo here
for the tablet so we'll have more
information for this at cnet com go
check it out I'm tussock adult court</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
