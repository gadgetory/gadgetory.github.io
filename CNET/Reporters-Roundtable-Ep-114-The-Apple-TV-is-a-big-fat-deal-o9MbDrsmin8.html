roundtable i'm rafe needleman in San
Francisco this is our show on a single
tech topic each time and this week of
course was Apple leak apple just
announced a new iPad called the new iPad
and also a new version of the Apple TV
now everybody has an ipad according to
apple's data and now they're all going
to upgrade but i think the more
important product here at that
announcement was in fact the apple TV
because it affects it has more potential
from this point forward to upset the
consumer electronics industry the apps
industry the content industry and the
cable the isp industry and so i want to
focus today not on the ipad which
everybody talks about but on the apple
TV and i've got two great guests to dive
into what the apple TV means both this
product and future products and apples
space in the in the content industry or
placing the content industry to talk
about how this is all going to play out
and these guests are both cnet experts
in new york first John Falcone who runs
reviews in New York John thanks for
joining us thanks for having me and also
a Matthew Muscovy akoo reviews all this
stuff again for seen it reviews in New
York Matthew thanks for making the time
thanks for having me right now do we
actually have the video working this
time through this is a second take here
let's put it back smile hey he's moving
this time all right right on hey Matthew
again thanks how you reviewed the new
Apple TV affect you I think you've
reviewed all of the Apple TVs and say
since they started coming out tell us
about this product how good is it and
should people think about getting one uh
you know the apple TV is actually it's
it's one of the top boxes it's out right
now even though Apple only calls it a
hobby it's kind of neck and neck with
our editors choice the roku LT in that
space now Roku has a lot more content
partners so you're going to be able to
you know watch videos from say Hulu Plus
which you can't watch on the Apple TV
but the killer feature on the apple TV
is really airplay so if you have an iPad
or an iPhone you can stream video right
to the apple TV and that's really nice
if you're
invested in the apple ecosystem now does
Apple continue to say that Apple TV is a
hobby I know in the first came out they
said that but are they still saying that
because it seems like an important
product to Apple I think I saw Tim Cook
said that recently in a recent event and
it is surprising but I feel like you
know the thing is that the Apple TV
isn't quite as polished as the other
products and you know if they were
putting more attention towards that you
would think they'd already have
something like an app store or maybe
they would have integrated Siri for say
you know video search because you know
searching for things using an on-screen
keyboard is still kind of a pain so
until you kind of get that full
attention I do think it does feel like a
hobby even though it's still one of the
better products in that space John
what's your take is this a major product
from Apple or just kind of a side note
in the sea consumer electronics industry
I think they're still dipping their toe
in the water on this I mean it seems
clear there's two or three things they
could do to make the apple TV box the
ninety nine dollar box that they just
refreshed they just add 1080p video they
upgraded the processor but it's really
exactly the same otherwise as the
existing box a few upgrades that could
make that everybody keeps begging them
for is more apps or more channels stuff
like Hulu Plus or Amazon or HBO GO all
those things that are already on the
roku and on some of these competing game
consoles and other little boxes and you
know the other thing is do they really
want to add a subscription service of
this thing that doesn't really exist
outside of Hulu Plus right now and you
get kind of a feeling there's a little
bit of a cognitive dissonance with Apple
on this because the more cool apps they
add to the apple TV the less incentive
you think is there for people to buy the
episodes by episodes on itunes for
instance yeah it's really an interesting
problem that i think apple is trying to
figure out with the apple TV i agree
with you kind of see the an inherent
conflict built in there that you know
they can bring the apple user experience
to the living room but what people
really want in the living room is
content from everywhere isn't it yeah
and I think they don't want to figure
out which app they have to go to to get
it which is what you have to do right
now with Hulu Plus is only ABC NBC and
Fox most stuff you know if you want HBO
stuff you go to HBO Go if you want CBS
stuff you have to go to CBS com it's
it's kind of a mess right now and
there's except for iTunes which is an
you know pay-per-view service basically
there's there's not a lot of good
options on the Apple TV right now so I'm
Matthew you've been looking at this
thing what's your take on consumers I
mean you review this the way I mean we
all review products are everybody here
including me who does product reviews
which is you know we try to put
ourselves in the mind of the consumer of
the buyer but what's your take is this a
product that is ready for the mainstream
I know it is kind of mainstream but I
mean really mainstream for everywhere
you go into somebody's house you don't
know and chances are they're going to
have one is this product ready for that
yet I i think it's it's not quite ready
there to be in on the same level as you
know an iphone or even an ipad it the
weird thing is that you know a lot of
people get it primarily just as a
netflix streaming box even though you
can get that on a lot of other devices
but i think you know they need to put a
lot of the pieces together like John was
saying they really need to have
something like a cross-platform search
or the ability to kind of use voice so
that you can just say hey I want to
watch arrested development and then it
goes find it whether that's on netflix
another service or on itunes and that's
kind of the big missing piece that all
of these new connected TV devices have
and some are doing better than others to
do it but you get the feeling that
that's what Apple is going to do to make
this a mainstream product what's Apple
going to do to make this mainstream
product I think they're going to have to
use something like Siri in terms of
being able to say you know I want to
watch this movie and then it's just
going to find it whether that's on
iTunes whether that's on netflix or
whether they add other services now and
yeah good well there's a little bit of
that with Kinect on the Xbox you can
give voice commands in search and Google
TV does a good
a pretty good job of being able to
search some other content sources but
that interface is kind of clunky and it
doesn't work as well as you'd want it to
we're going to get back to that in a
second but I want to talk about one of
the most interesting parts and I think
and I think you'll agree with me Matthew
one of the most important features of
Apple TV which is airplay I want Johnson
opinion on this too why is air play such
an important thing in this product
airplay is great because it's it's the
DLNA everybody really wants what is why
i stopped sup sup what deal what exactly
you know every networked entertainment
box has this feature basically called
DLNA which stands for start gritting
your teeth now digital Living Network
Alliance and if you set everything up
correctly you can use your pc or
something as a server to stream video
and photos and audio to these boxes
airplay is basically an apple only
version of that that works seamlessly
and well and has a cool name and doesn't
confuse the heck out of people and I'll
just give you an example when I was at
my brother's house on Christmas Eve he
had his Apple TV set up and all it was
doing was pulling music from his pc so
nice holiday music and the photo
screensaver was showing all these great
photos of his family and my little niece
and everything and that was just playing
in the background and working seamlessly
and when he wanted to pick a different
song he popped open his iphone which you
can use as the remote picked a new song
and bam it was going mm-hmm now Matthew
other products can do that but very few
of them do it as well and as seamlessly
as Apple TV Matthew what's your take
them you're the one who mentioned Apple
t airplay here tell us why this matters
yeah well the thing that you know we
always criticize the apple TV is the
lack of content sources but with airplay
you can actually get around a lot of
those so Apple TV doesn't have Pandora
but you have pandora on your iPhone and
then you can just stream pinned or right
to your Apple TV and whether that's you
know Rhapsody or you know
the other music services you can take
advantage of them without having the
native apps you know on the Apple team I
want to get drive a little bit more into
apple TV I unless unless they block them
of course like HBO yes don't get me
started on HBO GO I am so mad at hbl go
can I just make a little side note here
does anybody care if I make a sidetrack
okay I have a what is it uh I forget
which device it is either the Roku or
the boxee I got both of them and one of
them has HBO GO uh and I I was really
excited because i have now i have HBO go
on a set time now you're gonna say it's
blocked on Comcast yes what and on and
on time warner it works it works for
time warner on the ipad but not yet on
the roku i want to kill these guys I
don't know who to kill but if I can
figure out who your days are numbered
all right anyway so listen airplay back
to that now I have I'm very excited when
I got my new entertainment system I got
a dent on a VR something that has
airplay built-in and it's very exciting
because I can go and I can do the
Pandora or Spotify or downcast which my
podcast player and just hit a button and
boom it goes straight onto the my
entertainment system so it's really cool
that Apple is putting making airplay
available but they're not making all of
airplay available that's reserved for
the apple TV matthew am i right about
that and why does that matter yeah you
know if you want to do video video yeah
yeah you're limited to the apple TV
right now although boxy does have some
ability to do that and I'm not quite
sure how that works because i don't
think it's officially licensed but it is
interesting that they're holding that
back i don't know if that's something
we'll see this year were other products
can you say bill you know maybe build it
into an AV receiver i think a lot of
people would be interested in that but
as of right now they are holding it back
as a apple TV exclusive feature so
that's that's kind of the big reason for
for some people i think to get the apple
TV so you can do you know the videos
from your your phone just blast them out
to the living room and i think we really
have to mention sorry that mountain lion
the forthcoming OS 10 upgrade never the
max is
also going to add full airplay support
so it already does audio now but it's
going to add screen mirroring which
means basically anything you see on your
Mac you should be able to project right
up on the TV screen so Apple TV is a
really core part of the whole Apple
ecosystem the walled garden where the
height of the walls is variable
depending on how Apple is feeling when
in given year why why is Apple being so
successful at building this out and why
are the TV companies failing so
miserably and the c/e companies feeling
so bad at building products that make it
so easy to incorporate content from you
know my home movies or whatever I think
at a lot of ways it comes down to
software when you look at the other men
of the regular you know standard TV
manufacturers like your Samsung's and
your Panasonic's and them they don't get
you know software and the user
experience the same way that Apple does
so you know when you use a lot of these
other content portals it's clunky
they're hard to use its hard to find
things and they don't feel polished you
don't see kind of the thought put into
them as you do on the Apple TV which has
nice animations between things and it's
easy to just see oh there's movies
there's TV shows there's music it's very
straight ahead and easy to use so do you
guys think that Apple needs a TV i mean
not an apple TV puck but an apple TV or
an actual box so is that would that be a
good idea for Apple would people buy it
I mean I don't sure people would buy it
but I don't think they really would be
able to roll it out the way they want to
until they could make some of these
content bills because my joke with the
apple HDTV was always that they would
show it had all these great bells and
whistles amazing interface great
industrial design and the presentation
would end with and every show is only
399 and and without you know at least
more apps or at least more content or a
subscription service it yes people would
still buy it but it would have such a
premium compared to I mean we're testing
a 60 inch sharp TV in the other room
that's $1,500 that I'd
couldn't believe how low that price was
for such a gigantic television that
looked really good to my casual I are
and you have to think the Apple TV would
have like at least I don't know a
thousand dollars on that one maybe I'll
tell you what I would pay a premium for
the content itself I mean a 599 episode
if they could make the end ending of
Battlestar Galactica better so one of
the big parts of apples move here and
why I find it so weird that this whole
thing is called a hobby is because they
are d they're playing with the big boys
they are dealing with Netflix they've
got a very interesting relationship with
Netflix they're fighting with comcast
and it's an interesting battle let's
talk about the netflix deal first I
don't know which of you guys is more up
to speed on this but with Apple TV now
you can not just use netflix but
actually do your financial transactions
with netflix through apple TV i think
that's kind of major I think you guys
want to get into that for a bit that
would be a no well I mean they change it
so you can sign up for netflix right
through the TV screen which you could
not do before but this is a big deal
because this puts apple in the money
collection category cuz now you're
paying for it through your apples apple
account right yeah i think it's just one
less barrier to entry to have the apple
TV on your TV seeing netflix and saying
hey I want to try that out you can do it
without having to know sign up on
another computer put in your credit card
information and do all that stuff you
can just use up with the same you know
Apple ID that you used to buy movies and
you know TV shows on iTunes so it just
makes it easier for people to write out
and then once you're subscribe you know
it'll just keep building your account
which is of course what Netflix wants
and Apple by the way will continue
probably to get their cut because
anytime you use an apple system for
payment service they take a slice off
the top so anyway so go ahead sorry yeah
I'm not exactly sure how it breaks on
the netflix deal I know they're taking
from some content sources and not from
others but I'm sure they're going to be
getting
some cut for using their back end for
the transactions now speaking of
interesting deals with contra providers
one of the other interesting things is
that comcast has said you know were what
they said we're not going to offer this
is about Netflix we're not going to
offer Netflix so there seems to be this
battle for who runs who controls the
content who's the gatekeeper now Apple
wants to be the gatekeeper they're
opening up to Netflix comcast is saying
no no netflix it will have their own
service do you have any sense of how
this is going to play out over the next
say 12 months for consumers when it
comes to them figuring out how to get
the content they want on their internet
connected in living room I mean I've
always thought the cable companies are
the ultimate barrier here because they
kind of have you coming and going there
they're controlling the largely what
you're seeing on the cable TV system and
and this is the key they're also your
broadband provider for most people so
the example we always used to give is if
you do finally decide to cut the cord
you chop off your TV service you just
have broadband a month later you get a
letter from your cable provider it says
hey we just noticed your your broadband
usage has gone up four thousand percent
we're happy to upgrade you to the super
premium plan that costs 150 dollars
instead of 50 and you're right back to
the same bill you had before you chopped
your your cable TV service that's a
that's a worst-case solution what real
world are is that going to happen i get
i guess in a sense we already notice it
where for example i'd love to cut the
i'm happy to pay comcast for my you know
my internet broadband i like not to pay
them for cable but then this HBO Go
block thing kind of you're right it puts
me back in this spot where I need if I
want to get to the entertainment i'm
used to i need to continue to pay them
what can break the back of that that
that horrible situation ruin where we
can't get the content we want and we're
happy to pay for just not a ridiculous
amount i mean i think one of the
interesting things is that you know some
of these on
video services are starting to actually
produce their own content like Netflix
and that actually may make things worse
i'm not sure it seems like everything's
getting more and more fragmented to the
point where i am a cable cutter and i
have to subscribe to you know several
different services just to kind of put
all the pieces together and that
includes having over-the-air TV to make
it work so there have been you know some
solutions you know like everyone a lot
of people can talk about that area
over-the-air TV service and I feel like
we're the appletv kind of fits in is
that you know they have moved to an
interface that looks a lot more like app
based so if you have a collection of
different apps through one unified
interface that may be some way to kind
of push the cable company that is it a
little bit and you can get the content
you want without needing you know a
cable subscription Matthew you just
touched on a couple of really
interesting points I wanted to get into
one is live content an area was kind of
a part of that none of the set-top boxes
I think with the exception of boxy offer
a live component either live unique
content or over the air now there is
Aereo I want to take a little
sidetracked into Ariel that's a really
interesting little product it is only in
New York but for people who don't know
it's a grid of individual antennas
that's bizarre that you can so that you
can get your over the air content on are
we ever going to see something like that
on a cord cutters box like an Apple TV
well area is going to be available to
Roku and I've already tested that out
and it works pretty well so that's going
to be a pretty interesting solution of
course it is New York only right now and
I think the big thing about Aereo is
that whenever I talk to people about
cutting the cord one of the big problems
is always the antenna you got to set up
an antenna in your house or in your
apartment and it's a pain so getting rid
of that antenna and just being able to
use it as an app where you can watch
live TV or recorded content is a pretty
big hurdle that they're getting over and
assuming they don't get sued out of
existence could be in a pretty major
development for cord cutters now the
other thing that you talked to a touched
on there is apps
roku boxy and your computer and your
iPad etc all have apps the apple TV
doesn't John Matthew when do you think
we're going to see an Apps Marketplace
open up for the Apple TV as soon as they
can cut the deal basically I mean all
the content providers want to protect
their revenue stream and as long as
Apple or anybody else can I think more
or less guarantee that that revenue
stream is going to stay static or
possibly even ramped up that's when
something like that could happen but
they're not going to trade you know a
fifteen dollar a year a month
subscription for a five dollar one it's
just not going to happen I don't know if
I was an app developer I'd be pretty
pretty excited about an apple an app
marketplace for Apple TV by the way if I
was real fast going to point out that i
believe all the the three soon four
major sports networks all have live
programming on roku and other devices ah
and on the roku i know you can get the
live al jazeera feed and i think fox
news does a web-only live feed for like
five hours a day from around 10 a.m.
eastern to 2 or 3 p.m. so it is so there
is some live content out there and it's
more a decision the content providers
are making and let's do about the
technology and the big upset exception
which sports always is that you can't
watch any in market content which is you
know pretty big drawback for most people
let's get back to the products
themselves uh we have mentioned briefly
both the roku and the boxee matthew give
us a handicap that the race here now I I
said I am I had a rogue a boxee box
lying around it was a demo unit and I
finally got an HDTV and I plugged it in
and I thought wow this does a lot of
stuff that man is a complicated so I
went out and I got a roku 4 49 bucks and
so this is an amazing product but I got
to tell you something and this is not
common wisdom the boxee does so much
more I find it almost worth the effort
how did the boxee in the roku and the
apple TV kind of play off against each
other and what are your recommendations
there we talked to the top about Roku vs
Apple TV but looking at the roadmap for
these products does boxee have a chance
can Roku compete if Apple decides to
drop its prices to forty nine dollars
where are we going with these these
three products and others that might be
in the market you know the big thing
with the boxee box has always been the
price it's a hundred and eighty dollars
now compared to these other boxes that
are a hundred dollars or fifty dollars I
think the latest thing they've brought
out is that live TV dongle where you can
hook up over-the-air TV and watch it
through your boxee box that on its own
isn't that exciting because you can
already do that with pretty much any TV
by hooking in an antenna but they are
talking about possibly adding a DVR to
that and that could make it all of a
sudden worth you know that price bring
them over the other boxes because if you
want to cut the cord you really do need
to have a live TV component if you know
you're want to replicate the kind of TV
experience you already have because
local sports news or any kind of big
event like the Oscars of the Emmys you
need to have live TV to watch that and
Roku can it continue to fight the good
fight there I think it can I mean the
fact that it's only 50 bucks for the
roku LT is pretty pretty huge I mean
that's you know people pick them you
know up a couple of them just to kind of
spread around their house they have so
many different content sources that you
can kind of tune in to kind of anything
any kind of each content that you want
to check out I think their biggest thing
is that there's so much when you go into
the channel strip or is kind of
overwhelming luckily you can kind of
filter that out for your home screen but
anyway for them to make it easier to
find that top top level content will
really help that box as we near the end
of this discussion I want to bring up a
couple of other alternatives for people
one of which is TiVo I have an old tivo
box TiVo keeps seems to be finally
getting more aggressive and updating
their user interface and their content
deals but the the common knowledge or
the common conventionalism is that TiVo
blew it and there are not as force in
this market and what do you guys think I
couldn't Matt's been yeah yeah I've been
testing than the tivo premiere box kind
of as an over-the-air
cord cutter solution and it's the new
interface is really impressive it's a
huge update from what was there before
and they do have a lot of streaming
services the big thing there is still
the monthly fee and I think that's when
people talk about tivo blue it is that
people don't want to pay you know twenty
dollars a month for a tivo subscription
now they have been making separate deals
for core cutters if you buy it through a
certain antenna websites where the fee
is only ten dollars a month and that's a
lot more attractive if they can make
that a standard plan I think we could
see a little bit of resurgence from tivo
from the court cutting community finally
one of the big options that we have only
briefly touched on here but I think is a
real power in the Apple TV space is the
game console the Xbox of is I think the
premiere game console that is also a
good media hub where does these
companies these products playstation
never nintendo does where do these
products fit in in the Apple TV market I
think they fit in pretty well it's
amazing how much more the ps3 and the
xbox especially Wow is that an old
picture of me yeah we lost your video
feed we're obviously using Apple
technology here but they have a lot of
the same in I think its own cases more
channels and sources then the Apple TV
does and the ps3 for instance now has
NFL Sunday Ticket so that's you know
it's very expensive obviously but it's
the exact same service you'd be getting
on direct TV which i think is really
impressive and an amazing offer that
didn't exist you know a year ago I think
our one qualms with the xbox for
instance is that you still have to pay
sixty dollars a year to subscribe to
xbox live just to get into all that
video stuff and with the roku LT only
costing fifty dollars all in it's kind
of like wow that is a pretty crazy
premium if you're not going to be
playing like a lot of head-to-head
gaming and things like
and these products by the way the the
hardware on the game consoles I'm i
think the newest one you can get is five
or six years old the hardware design the
software keeps getting upgrade upgraded
so there's a lot of we could see some
pretty interesting upsets in this market
pretty soon and it's it's arguably that
the netflix interface on the ps3 and the
xbox is two of the best experiences out
there Anjali I just have to say this by
the way another side note here I have I
think five devices in my living room
that will stream netflix it's really
remarkable how they of all the company
we might be talking about Apple TV but
netflix is the one that is freaking
everywhere it's just remarkable too bad
the project is as good as Amazon's III
whenever it's like Oh comcast is going
to kill off netflix with this stream
pics thing or something that's all fine
and good but they have to get on all
those boxes first and Netflix is
literally pretty much the default thing
on everything yeah tough to compete with
any final words and any recommendations
for you know the grandma poughkeepsie
who's looking for something that's just
does a little bit more than her cable
company can provide I mean my standard
recommendation is kind of between the
Apple TV and the roku box and it's like
if you have a lot of apple products
already the Apple TVs kind of what you
want to go for but if you're looking for
a lot of different content sources the
roku box is you know extremely
affordable and it's pretty easy to use
all right guys hey listen thanks very
much for the time I expect we will have
you both back on soon when Apple finally
surprises us all by doing a TV and you
know what I think they could do it
