a pilot I'm Bridget Carey and this is
your cnet update personal flying drones
are becoming a popular tool for taking
aerial video you just hook up a GoPro
camera to the small quadcopter and
control it with a remote now most sports
action shots are a two-person job
someone does the cool skateboard tricks
and someone else is in charge of flying
the drone but the next generation of
drones won't need a pilot they could be
set to automatically follow you to
drones asking for funding on kickstarter
promised to do just that airdog is one
that can follow a set path freeze in
position and hover at a spot or maintain
a certain distance from you at all times
it works by following a signal from a
device called the air leash which you
would wear on your wrist or helmet
airdog plans to charge $1,500 for one
another auto flying drone is called the
hexo plus you program the flight using a
smartphone app it tracks you based on
the location of your phone an eight
hundred dollar donation gets you a
complete hexa plus kit with a gopro
hero3 HD camera the makers hope to have
it out by next year but if that's too
much excitement for you maybe you like
to curl up with a nice book the popular
book subscription service oyster is now
available on android devices oyster is
like a netflix for books you pay ten
dollars a month to get unlimited access
to half a million ebooks and that
includes titles from big-name publishers
like HarperCollins and simon schuster it
also includes children's books some from
Disney previously it was only in itunes
but along with android there are also
apps now for the kindle fire and the
barnes and noble nook HD tablet and for
those of you that rather use icons to
communicate instead of words new emojis
have been created to expand your texting
vocabulary emojis also called emoticons
are pitcher characters that in a way
have become our modern-day hieroglyphics
the nonprofit Unicode consortium
released
250 new icons the group offers a
suggestion of what the images should
look like in black and white but it
won't be in color on your phone until
the operating system maker like Apple or
Google ads these icons into the
keyboards now some new ones we can look
forward to include a squirrel the Vulcan
salute and a levitating businessman
among these important advancements in
our digital communication there is also
now an icon for the middle finger for
when words aren't enough that's your
tech news update but there's always more
at cnet com from our studios in New York
