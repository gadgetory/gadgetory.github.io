stage we are live at CES 2013 and this
is CES in depth joining me today is my
colleague Bridget Carey and three of our
best of CES 2013 award winners they
include a view Reichental CEO 3d systems
vladislav martin al CEO of yota devices
and the best of show winner razer edge
represented by Heathcliff Hatcher thanks
for being here we want to take a closer
look at some of these award-winning
products so let's start with 3d systems
have you brought a quite a few different
examples of what your machine can do now
we're thrilled to have one thank you
very much and it's it's we're absolutely
passionate about 3d printing we think is
going to change how we learn how we
educate how we create how we make how we
treat and the ability to bring home in
to the tack enthusiasts to be able to
print professional-grade parts is big as
a basketball in three colors in
intricate detail is something that we
have been passionate about to some time
and to be able to do it and be
recognized for it it's amazing so we're
really thrilled for us at cnet to watch
the 3d printer market grow and become a
little bit more competitive this year
and now with your particular system you
can correct me if I'm wrong one of the
or a few of the things that really
differentiated the volume right you have
I think the highest volume 3d printer
that we seen at the show by far by far
the highest volume printed basketball as
a first I mean now that is a true to
scale basketball absolutely regulation
size and then the ability to print is it
three colors up to three colors of time
we have 30 color choices and you can do
three colors at a time which nobody else
has been able to do yet and at the same
time do nice micro detail
so if you can begin to get at home
professional-grade resolution quality in
two different materials in 30 colors big
size and precision sure and we even have
you have the mobile printer version of
this tool absolutely we have we launched
here at CES a second generation of the
cube which is faster more accurate and
also not points in two colors and is so
efficient that it can print on a battery
for six full hours that's guys like the
Burning Man 3d printer gotta yeah I
supply of proof is the next question and
I think it's almost done printing up
with a little Vegas baby so that's great
yeah all right and so very excited to
have you guys here congratulations on
your win and we now want to talk about
the yotaphone this is one actually our
executive editor it's been raving about
she's very excited that tell me about
the other phone concept I don't want to
spoil it you go for it okay well this is
a premium smartphone android smartphone
but it has one different thing is
electronic paper displayed on a back
side of the phone and the whole idea
came up when we look two years ago on
all constraints or user gaps in it with
recurrent smartphones which is for
example when you're running out of
battery and you have your boarding pass
in your phone you can't hear ya you
can't you can't go for the security or
you using the maps and suddenly it's out
of battery you lost in the city Oh for
example you you have your picture of
your loved ones but it's pop up only for
the few seconds it doesn't stay as you
wish during the day and also we look at
their all kinds of notifications which
pop up in a current smartphones for few
seconds on a black screen and
disappeared so if there is important
message you need to react immediately
and you might find out in an hour to
which is already late and it's not
relevant that's not good so for
electronic paper display because they
are and the main reason is it sexually
power consumption sure
and the battery constraints so we look
what may be a one single solution for
the most current user gaps and that was
electronic paper displaying because it
doesn't consume as much power LCD
display and it's consumed power only I
wouldn't refresh the image brian and
brian cooley now we're talking about he
the first thing he thought it was like
it would be great for a ticketing like
if I got my boarding pass I could just
keep that on the inside and I had to
reference it and it's diving some email
and panic on my baby I can show it right
away so you do just one simple gesture
and you move your e tickets on the back
side of the panel and you are safe if
better completely out to you you can go
to Google to go I also love because I
feel like all year we've been so
distracted by the screen size wars of
different smartphones and not thinking
of other you know more significant more
out of outside of the box ways to
improve that smartphone experience and
in multitasking we always think about
multitasking with phones but oftentimes
you are kind of jumping back and forth
to one specific app that you want to
keep always present exactly so that's
I'm really excited to see that I hope
that that catch is always on you can put
a Facebook page you can put a Twitter
its update in real time you can't miss
what is important there as well what was
driving you to want to do two screens I
mean where did this idea come from well
basically again most of us a smartphone
users most of us found ourselves in a
difficult situation I as I explained and
we want to bring a fresh new user
experience and by the way I think for
the last six seven years most of the
smartphone manufacturer they focused on
the tech spec race I mean bigger camera
like bigger screen but we lost the kind
of focus on the user experience what is
good for user and sometimes they need
more simple better solution to make
their life better not just to have a
better kind of big screen or better
camera and you got Gorilla Glass 3 on
that Thun curve incur fees actually was
also idea behind it because we want this
is the personal space for the user all
important information is there so we
want to convince user to put it on the
flat side of the panel so this is there
they spent the user spend more time
interacting with the back side of the
phone because what is important is there
and by you by the way another thing is
people start using more social media for
the last five six years
but they become less social so because
because our batteries it constrains the
phone its current phones are off they're
always black so we wake up every minute
to check what is going on in the social
virtual life there but usually you lose
me if I go there you lose me from eye
contact point of view from the just
regular socializing type of thing and
you see quite a lot in the cafeteria in
the business meeting people going there
and don't pay attention what's hip
happening in the real world with our
device because it doesn't consume much
power you can bring facebook you can
brick virtual world back and we bring
back to the real world in this and
indeed any kind of innocence but if you
did need a case you could print one out
in 3d with our weekly free da next
generation of our phone which were
already working on and which will be
thinner and will be much better but
that's another and that's another
question all right now let's make sure
we move on and talk about our best of
CES final award winner that's the best
best of show best out there and thank
you that's a given tell us about the
edge I mean I think that's something
like a more Madame question than it
meant to anatomy tell us about your
system well I mean last year this year
we want people's voice award for project
Fiona and project fiona was the concept
product for what is now the razor edge
and we started off I'm one of the things
for us as we are most of us are totally
focused on our community and our
programs with the community through
Facebook or three sports teams and
really learning what they want so we did
a crowdsourcing program for the edge and
went to them to get their feedback and
throughout the year we you know we went
and provided that feedback into the
product you can see here always if you
like to turn around with the camera too
so so in its original incarnation the it
didn't come from a dock or whatever we
received that kind of feedback you can
pull the tablet out and now that is a
tablet full fledge Windows 8 it's a
French windows 8 tablet in addition
about its has a dedicated graphics card
so it has the kind of power that you
really need to drive the games you want
to play so it's a tablet it's a PC as
well so you can
is it in the keyboard dock just like a
notebook and it's a console so in the we
have two modes for the console dot so we
have a gamepad and then we also have a
doc you can hook it up to your
television you know with steam big
picture that we're showing here or we
have a launcher program of our own you
can really you know pretty much do
whatever you want you know so from
office to you know playing a call of
duty it's very do you see a hole that
was in pc gaming that you were trying to
fill that just wasn't there i mean
obviously you were going around asking
people wanted in gaming so is this is
this filling a void we should i could
say we do like focus testing or whatever
but we kind of just make what we want to
play and so we put the concept out there
to get the critical you know get the
feedback and then we try to make the
best toys for us and I should diminish
the fact that you guys also won the
people's voice award for this year as
well so did we and we don't know that in
till the very last minute for the last
three years so you definitely have a lot
of people a lot of fans behind this
product waiting for word to come to the
market we're shipping in a quarter one
and it starts with the i5 version of the
edge we have edge and edge pro and that
starts at nine ninety nine then we have
a multitude of gadgets and peripherals
and stuff we can put in I know actually
I want to pull up a game on here as
possible yes truly put it back in the
dock and let you play some dirt showdown
this is great to now have the that have
the microsoft people seen what you've
done with windows 8 because this
actually seems to me beyond its gaming
capabilities a real competitor for the
the windows surface pro I'm pretty sure
they've seen it because of you guys know
how I definitely i'm sure i'll get a
phone call so it's launching a let me
turn round see if i can turn it so
there's no glare and
there you go now we saw a number of
Windows 8 devices here at the show
everything from gigantic 27-inch tables
down to full-fledged Windows tablets but
this one really stands apart especially
with the graphics processor that's built
into it made for gaming me for gamers
yeah I mean for what we want to do with
it you have to have that kind of
performance so you know it can replace
your your gaming notebook it can replace
you know it can be the one thing you
take whether you I always like to use
the get some game on there I like to use
the analogy that you know you're always
putting your content onto something and
taking it with you before you go on a
trip or whatever this is your one device
so all of your content can be right
there you can have all your pictures and
movies of your games everything you want
all-in-one device and then move it
through the experiential marketing I
mean the experiences that you have so
right if you want to have a keyboard
with it you can if you want to take it
with you one thing with the handles on
tablet wow those are some great graphics
yeah what is the screen resolution on
this issue this is a 1366 x 768 oh it's
not 4k oh come on didn't you get the
memo everything has to be 4k this year
I'll let our engineer who's standing
right over there now yeah I mean we're
really impressed with it we you know
we've had a lot of support from our
partners at Intel to bring this product
to market and so you know with that and
a dedicated graphics card you really see
the kind of performance that you want
from a full-on you know if it's kind of
like if you had a 14 inch gaming
notebook and just took the keyboard off
and then we jammed everything in there
and that's a trend to we're seeing where
laptops are becoming hybrids but in this
case you also have a gaming hybrid into
it which is a different twist on
everything I mean I mean tablets have
the keyboard how you know everyone wants
to be able to take it with you you know
I should have read birds as much as the
next person Jedi i also want to play
like some full function you know
triple-a back i'm sorry this is too much
fun actually you can feel the haptic
feedback into to it only has that bad
it's gotta have to you know we're known
for our peripherals and are for our
keyboards and mice and all the other
accessories but you know we really want
to prove that we're a hardware company
and we show you guys what we can do I
think
you're going to do it this year thank
you guys all of you for joining us here
talking with us and congratulations
again on your awards</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
