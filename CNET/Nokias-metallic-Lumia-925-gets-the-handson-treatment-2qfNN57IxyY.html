with the Nokia Lumia 925 now this is
Nokia's latest Windows Phone device it's
an update to the Lumia 920 it keeps at
4.5 inch screen but this is an OLED
display instead and hopefully that means
you're going to get some writer slightly
more vivid colors the phone is roughly
the same size as the 920 as you can see
here even if it's a little bit slimmer
the main design difference though is the
weight this phone has a metal
construction which means it feels an
awful lot lighter to hold that's
certainly a good thing because it
doesn't feel too cheap build quality on
first impression feels quite high you
can see the metal around the edges of
this phone but the back itself is still
plastic all right let's move around to
the back where you'll see the same 8.7
megapixel sensor just residing on the
Lumia 920 nokia says however that it's
improved the actual optics inside the
camera as well as the software which
hopefully will make some better pics
helping out with those better pics is a
new app called nokia smart camera now
what this basically does is take 10
photos in quick succession that you can
then later edit in and add some crazy
effects like this motion blur or for
example adding multiple frames to one
shot to create an action scene like this
one these kind of features are already
present on the HTC One and Samsung's
Galaxy s4 but it's nice to see Nokia
adding them in as well apart from that
to be honest there's not a lot here that
we haven't seen before the 95 is powered
by the same 1.5 gigahertz dual-core
processor the power the Lumia 920 it
feels very slick and smooth to use of
course is powered by Windows Phone 8 you
also get some of Nokia's own brand apps
on board like here which is a mapping
service you get here drive which is
turn-by-turn navigation and nokia music
which lets you stream playlists so all
in all this feels like a modest upgrade
to the Lumia 920 it certainly seems like
a neat little mobile and I like how
light it feels but will it be enough to
tempt shoppers away from the galaxy s4
or the iphone 5 let me know I'm the best
way to cnet's and this
is the Nokia Lumia 925</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
