of steering you want to move the car a
different direction
you grab the steering wheel and put your
shoulder into it power steering was
either unheard of or very elite during a
heavy vehicle by manual effort only
emphasized the need for a steering
assist we huffed and he even sweated
behind the wheel until the first
mainstream car with power steering hit
showrooms the 1951 Chrysler Imperial
with something that they called Hydra
guy
and then for 50 years power-steering
didn't really change a lot hydrolic was
hydraulic like on this 67 cougar you
basically have your steering rack that
very classic and just let every car of
the era but to help you move that you've
got this power ram right up here this
piece is nothing more than a hydraulic
ram that pushes one way or the other to
get your wheels to move which what you
want it is told how much and what
direction by this control valve up here
and all this connects to your steering
column where does it get all the
pressure is what's interesting if you
look up in there you see that pump
that's the power steering pump run by a
belt off the front of the engine that's
one of the big problems of these systems
it's constantly putting drag on the
engine creating a bunch of pressure even
if you're not using it to steer
that's called a parasitic loss that
consept mpg in power but these days
power steering has changed dramatically
welcome to the era of epass electric
power assisted steering
now underneath this 2014 Jeep Cherokee a
decidedly modern vehicle we find a very
different steering system electric power
steering is here if you look up in this
vicinity you're going to see the
electric motor which is sitting on the
steering rack those arms and linkages
that move the wheels left and right
another model is to take that motor and
move it further up and put it on the
actual steering column kind of heading
up toward the firewall the effect is the
same the electric motor and it's
electronics sense your effort on the
wheel and add their own in kind and of
course the same direction the efficiency
the compactness the cleanliness and the
accuracy of this system versus hydraulic
is the big idea now there are also
hybrid systems that remain hydraulic but
replace the belt driven pump with an
electric one the bigger trend however is
to go fully electric okay so she's
picked up on their four major benefits
to electric power steering let's run
them down first off is efficiency ZF
which makes a lot of electric power
steering system says they can save 90%
of the energy that is parasitically
wasted by hydraulic system put another
way
Chevy says their 2013 Malibu gets two
and a half percent better mpg solely
because it has electric power steering
they've all parked out at 120 gallons of
gas or about 500 bucks saved
across ten years of ownership next up is
addressability
because it's an electric component it
can be harnessed to the vehicles control
systems to automate things like
automatic parking assistance lane
departure correction all kinds of things
that are nudging into the area of
autonomous driving it can also be used
in the background for cornering
improvement in cornering control now we
have accuracy because it's driven
largely by software changing its
behavior and keeping it accurate with a
feedback loop that a computer can
monitor is quite easy that's not the
case with hydraulic systems we want to
change their behavior you largely have
to go engineer new physical components
for them and then there's compactness a
big deal with automotive packaging
designers instead of having a pump and
belts and valves and a power ram you
just have an electric motor and some
wires going to and from it that allows a
lot of space to be freed up and for
things to be kept very compact
very cool in the engine bay so it's a
win-win-win-win then why do so many
driving purists kind of pushback on
electric power steering well part of it
is because it's not what we've always
had it's not hydraulic and let's face it
we've all gotten used to hydraulic
steering and automakers of dial it in
quite nicely and early electric power
steering systems did have some numbness
to them and some poor what's called on
centre feel that's been largely
corrected in my experience I have a very
hard time telling a good electric system
from a refined hydraulic system until I
look under the hood the future when
electric power steering like we've seen
today becomes steer-by-wire electric
power steering
that means the steering wheel basically
becomes a game controller and has no
mechanical connection to the front end
at all that's down the road a few years
and that's a separate car tech 101</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
