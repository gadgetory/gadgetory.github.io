let you send money to your friends I'm
Bridget Carey this is your scene that
update Apple might be getting ready to
take Apple pay to the next level and let
you transfer money between two iPhones
the Wall Street Journal has unnamed
sources saying that Apple is talking
with US banks so that users can send
money to each other with Apple pay we
already have apps that do that one of
the most popular is venmo owned by
PayPal Square cash also lets you send or
request money without paying a fee and
Google Wallet is another option it may
take a year for Apple to launch such a
feature but if Apple does get into the
game it would bring more awareness of
the fact that you can send money to
people by app venmo gained popularity
with young adults who would use it to
request rent money from roommates or
quickly pay someone back for lunch in
other Apple news the new Apple TV is
growing into a more legit gaming machine
with the help of Skylanders and Disney
infinity the new Apple TV which came out
in October can download and play games
from the App Store but some console
games are even being made for it now
like Skylanders super chargers and the
just announced Disney infinity 3.0 the
starter packs are sold with stands for
the characters and gamepad controllers
Activision is also bringing Guitar Hero
live to Apple TV Apple TV has its
limitations of course and I'm not just
talking about gaming it does not have
apps to stream from every type of
service like there's no Amazon app and
it's more expensive than any other
streamer starting at 150 dollars but if
you care more about streaming than games
the Roku will suit you much better it
can stream just about anything and if
you want to get into the streaming game
for cheap the company is releasing a
special edition of the Roku for just $25
on Black Friday the Roku se goes on sale
the day after Thanksgiving it's pretty
much the same as the Roku 1 model which
is normally $50 but it's given a new
name just for the sale switching gears a
bit Microsoft is rolling out its first
major update to Windows 10 there are
some bug fixes it'll boot faster and
you'll see some design tweaks but also
you'll find new features Cortana is
getting smarter she can
scan your email to see what ticketed
events you have coming up it's similar
to what Google can do she can also read
the notes you scribble with a stylus pen
you can beam video from your internet
browser to an Xbox one or Roku so you
can watch on your TV you'll find it as
the cast media option in the edge
internet browser new Skype messaging
apps are also woven into Windows 10 and
the Xbox one is also part of the update
it brings a new Xbox one experience
dashboard that should be faster if you
have any issues or bugs with the
download Microsoft did post an Xbox
troubleshooting guide online that's it
for this tech news update and there's
more at cnet.com from our studios in New
York I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
