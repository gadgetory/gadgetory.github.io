for sale I've been telling people they
aren't worth the money
now it's videos new m-series and
changing my tune that's in part because
4k is getting cheaper and this video is
one of the least expensive 4k tvs you
can buy it also happens to have
excellent picture quality whether it's
displaying 4k content which is very rare
today or good old hi-def content which
will be around for years to come it
outperforms most 1080p TVs I've tested
and quite a few 4k ones as well
including ones that cost hundreds more
talk more about that impressive picture
in a bit but let's start with the least
impressive part of the M series it's
styling the series ranges in size of 43
to 80 inches this is a 65 inch here in
case you're wondering and all them have
the same silver border around the frame
and bright silver legs the overall look
is kind of generic compared to some
other 4k TVs and the silver isn't
exactly understated features on the M
series are minimal for the breed but
that's not a bad thing there's a lot to
like in the design of it's uncluttered
simple Smart TV system and I didn't miss
not having a web browser motion remote
or voice control for example the remotes
one extra is a backlit QWERTY keyboard
on the flip side which can make a
plug-ins and search is easier the second
stream 4k shows and movies from Amazon
Netflix and ultra flicks but unlike some
competitors it won't stream 4k from
YouTube only one of the Vizio is 5 HDMI
inputs can handle the highest bandwidth
4k content and 2 of the 5 won't work
with the latest copy protected content
on the other hand such content is rare
enough that most users won't mind the
omission now or in the next few years
the main thing that does pay dividends
now on the M series is excellent picture
quality it has deeper black levels and
better contrast than most 4k TVs we've
tested including more expensive
competitors from Samsung and Sony that's
because it uses full array local dimming
which selectively dims independent
section of the screen in response to
picture content it works great on the M
series and in conjunction with this TVs
accurate color and solid video
processing makes for an impressive
picture indeed especially at this price
that was a look at the Vizio m-series 4k
TV for 2015 I'm David Katz my resina</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
