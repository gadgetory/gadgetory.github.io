Dreyfuss and I'm Korean levy and today's
episode is called iphone 5 ipad mini the
reckoning because it's our last show
before the rumored September 12th apple
event which means that we have to place
all our final bets no more stalling on
this episode all our chips are on the
table I already have a humiliation Dave
that going that the ipad mini will not
come out with the iphone 5 i bet you
wish you could take that prediction back
because when you lose i'm gonna make you
sing rihanna songs dressed like a duck
i'm not wearing a duck suit but okay
before we go that far let's take a look
at all the iphone 5 and ipad mini rumors
will vote on them and then we'll give
you guys a chance to see if I'm gonna
have to wear a duck suit or if I can
just create in whatever I want and if
the new iphone doesn't come out on sep
tember 12 i guess i canceled my dentist
appointment for nothing first up we've
got a video from smartphone medic a
phone repair service in South Carolina
the video shows the front plate of the
alleged new iphone being thirty percent
larger than the 4 s's and the camera and
proximity sensors have moved the video
also shows some internal cable
components including one for an 8-pin
connector what on earth is a South
Carolina phone repair guy doing with a
video of the most sought-after rumored
device on the planet I know and if he
did have those components wouldn't they
have made him sign some document saying
that he wouldn't take a shaky camera
video of home stuff now for the ipad
mini the unicorn that might head but me
with its horn if Apple unleashes it into
the wild the most damning rumor that the
smaller iPad is a real product comes
from all things D a site we read and
respect the report cites several unnamed
sources drink who claimed to know that
the ipad mini will be unveiled after the
iphone 5 at a separate event in october
great that's when i rescheduled my
dentist appointment anyway Macotakara a
site i like to pronounce but don't
necessarily trust says a trusted asian
source insists that the smaller tablet
will be called the ipad mini first off
drink and second off there's literally
no news here Macotakara if every ipad
mini rumor was this flimsy is this then
i wouldn't worry at all
the fact that I have a humiliation day
bet riding on this duck costume finally
Chinese site Giz China calm claims it
has photos of an ipad mini case and the
kicker it has a hole for a rear facing
camera supposedly or it's just something
they 3d printed themselves or cut out of
a fruit roll-up who knows next up Apple
Insider has been busy looking over
pictures of an alleged unicorn iphone 5
from taiwan-based blog apple pro all the
pictures are basically the usual a home
button camera but one component stood
out to Apple Insider because it's never
before been seen in an iphone it's what
could possibly be an NFC chip now NFC is
sort of a digital wallet that's starting
to gain traction in Europe but it's
still in its infancy here in the US
although a couple of Android phones use
it I'm sure that the minute people here
it's being used in the next iPhone it'll
take off all crazy here too for our
final rumor we tip our hat to the one
dude at our office who is good at math
he counted up all the iphones that have
ever been and noticed something odd the
one that we hope is coming out soon is
not actually the fifth phone remember
that forest disappointment but it's
actually the sixth so could it be called
the iphone 6 and then skipped the number
5 completely like I guess they skipped
number two others have suggested that
numbers are like so last year an apple
will do away with them completely in the
name of simplicity the new iphone could
be called well the new iphone just like
the new ipad and the new coke did I just
ate myself yes you did I think it's
going to be called the new iphone saying
I think it's gonna be called the iphone
5 oh we got a game here folks what do
you guys think do you think it's me
called the new iphone the iphone 5
iphone 6 iphone 7 don't forget to vote
in our poll if you're watching on cnet
meanwhile we're gonna go ask people on
the streets of San Francisco what they
think
do you have any ideas about what it
could be called um probably just the
iphone 5 they usually go with simple i
would guess iphone 5 they probably will
call the iphone 6 based on what they've
done so far it would make sense that it
would be the five again I think it'll be
the new new iphone I think that's
probably the way they're gonna go just
then they can put out new releases
without committing to whether it's a big
release or a small release so just
always be the iphone they should branch
out maybe call it something like the
Apple connect superfone Giga phone I
don't know something like that iphone 4s
is kind of lame stink iphone 5 would be
a good name for that r2d2 they should
call it that no seriously come on r2 d2
he can do everything like so the folks
on the street didn't really seem to
think that the iphones gonna be called
the iphone 6 but they had some
interesting ideas let's go back upstairs
and see what the cnet council thinks the
cnet council is composed of five editors
who cast their votes anonymously their
opinions are not an endorsement by Cena
or CBS interactive obviously because
these are rumors folks and the cnet
verdict is it will not be called the
iphone 6 not a single cnet editor thinks
that it'll be called 6 although three of
them do think that'll be called just the
new iphone and one lonely editor thinks
it might not be called iphone at all I
bet that guy's glad he's anonymous or
readers would send him tomatoes our
comment of the week comes from J bulk 84
who writes do it in the old lady by the
creek voice okay a once posted a picture
of my cable remote my apple remote on
facebook with the caption why I wish
apple on the cable company nuk said I
love that this person didn't just
comment but had to comment about the
fact that they had previously commented
on it on a social media website that's
our show everybody please share your
rumors that rumor has it at cnet com and
tweet to us and thanks to this week's
sponsor ebay see you next time when
we'll find out if the iphone 5 was
released on sep tember 12
