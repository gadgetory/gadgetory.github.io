design remix to keep you listening I'm
Bridget Carey this is your scene that
update Apple music is messy to navigate
but that's no surprise when it comes
from the folks that bring you itunes am
i right although it may soon get a
cleaner interface bloomberg reports that
the Apple music app is getting a new
design with a reboot unveiled during
apple's annual developer conference in
june it was at last year's Developers
Conference that Apple first announced
the music app so it would be fitting to
talk about an update it costs ten
dollars a month to stream music on
demand with Apple but the beats 1 radio
station is free to listen to Apple music
has more than 11 million paid
subscribers but that's one-third of
Spotify subscriber numbers Spotify is
the king of the paid music streaming
apps but it too is making changes to
stay fresh Spotify updated its iOS app
with a new navigation bar on the bottom
that gives quick access to home browse
search and your library previously these
things were tucked away in a sidebar as
music streaming changes so does video
streaming hulu is becoming more than
just a place to watch a day old TV show
next year it's going to sell a bundle of
channels that you can watch live for
about forty dollars a month it's similar
to a sling TV and PlayStation view offer
for cable cord cutters but hulu service
could be different because it is owned
by nbc/universal Fox and Disney now if
you're more into animated gifts than TV
bundles well there's a new app to spice
up your text messages giffey has a new
app called gift keys it makes it easy to
look up an animated gif it shows random
crazy ones or you can search for
something to fit your conversation just
copy and paste one into a text or in
another app like snapchat and for those
of you in the camp that wants to
pronounce it jiff well just know that
the team behind the app does use the
hard g4 Diffie as one should that's all
