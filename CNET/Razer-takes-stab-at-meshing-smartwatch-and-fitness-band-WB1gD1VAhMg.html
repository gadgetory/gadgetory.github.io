what razor is into the wearables game
too everyone's got a wearable fitness
device of the show and razor as the
razor Naboo now this is a little band
kind of a little bit like a Nike
FuelBand or maybe like a Fitbit and a
little bit like the LG band that was
announced a couple of days ago well this
fits around your wrist has a micro USB
charger and it works with iOS and
Android to track your activity but also
to receive notifications like a pebble
watch razor claims the Naboo will work
with all sorts of notification text
messages or incoming calls and again
between iOS and Android devices plus it
will work with razor calm which is
razors communications platform and which
all of its peripherals work with in what
ways how will this work with gaming
devices well we'll have to see it's
going to be available at the end of
quarter one for developers it's going to
cost forty nine dollars for consumers a
little bit more although it's
unspecified we don't mention it schools
feature it has two displays one which is
on the back and one on the front which
provides a little subtle icon or cue to
let you know what is coming in and then
you flip your wrist around to check what
the information is and like a lot of
these others you can check steps and you
check calories and distance and it's
becoming kind of a standard metric but
it's the additional elements the app
support and communication plus the
ability with gesture control to shake
hands with somebody and be able to
transfer information and befriend them
if you wish although we'll have to see
what sort of platforms are supported and
how that works but you both would need
to have a razor Nabu to do it it's a
little look at the razor Nabu nice feel
we'll have to see how it performs at CES
2014 a fitness plus notification maybe
that's the magic metal I'm scotts dine
at CES 2014 we look at the razor Nabu
coming soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
