the realistic look of a
soon-to-be-released PlayStation 4 game
could convince you otherwise you play
the game is Galahad who is actually one
of the knights of the round table King
Arthur centuries ago formed the knights
of the round table and we're just
basically now in the 1800 see how that's
evolved over time the order 1886 is set
to release on februari 20th at cnet
recently visited sony for a sneak peak
players use an array of weapons ranging
from rifles to an ark induction lance
that's inspired by the real work of
inventor Nikola Tesla and the way they
work is it basically builds up a
gigantic charge and it has these almost
antenna like lightning rods on it that
the electricity is allowed to kind of
flow like a Jacob's Ladder as it builds
up and then the player releases the
trigger and the lightning comes out of
the weapon arcs over objects and hits
conductive things like characters and
it's just obliterates but everythings
among the things you'll want to
obliterate half-breeds part human part
beast and the Knights enemy number one
yeah that the game developer ready at
dawn use the processing power of the
PlayStation 4 to give the order a
cinematic feel in a virtual environment
one of the things that's very telling is
the way that light in our world
interacts with the things that it kind
of bounces off of it's like it's very
specific and if you figure out the
science of that you can kind of break it
down and figure out how do you have to
construct and light your world barring a
technique from the film industry ready
at dawn strapped head mounted cameras to
actors for the game to help solve a long
time graphics challenge facial
expressions the camera that's mounted on
this boom off of the headpiece that
they're wearing has a little tiny camera
on it and it's got a light on it so
they're being kind of bombarded by light
but it's so we get a really good image
and then we record their facial
performance with their body so when
they're on set and they're acting I'm
moving around we're getting a full
head-to-toe performance that's basically
times things till every able night to
converge towards Whitechapel rebel and
for an extra dose of realism the game is
rendered on the fly so as you play you
won't be jumping back and forth between
narrative elements and gameplay one of
the greatest things for us is that
you're never really leaving the game so
too
make the final effect an immersive
experience that could make you believe
monsters actually roamed around london
