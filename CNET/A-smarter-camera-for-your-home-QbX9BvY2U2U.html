it and right now we're taking a first
look at a new product it is called the
butterfly it's a smart home camera
basically it's a camera that is
intelligent enough to know when to
record went to not when to capture
what's happening in your house and also
to snap pictures of pets and also
operate as a security device to you know
know when someone other than you or your
pets and family and friends are in your
house it's a very cool device and right
now we're taking a look at a prototype
of it as you can see it's very small it
connects over wireless connection to
your home internet and also will reach
out to different devices in your home
such as smartphones and tablets you can
also access the camera and what it's
seeing over the Internet in any location
as long as you have an internet
connection so the butterfly is going to
be 199 for early adopters essentially
the company is trying to start a
crowdsourcing almost like a Kickstarter
like crowdfunding campaign via its
website and this device should be
available by January 2015 so essentially
this device is envisioned to be a
mash-up between the nest thermostat and
the Dropcam baby camera devices that you
see deployed in people's homes that have
been shipping for a while but this
device is actually not envisioned as a
sort of an always-on just camera that's
operating 24 7 essentially it has a
microphone it has sensors built in such
as a heat mapping ir device which will
enable it to basically know what's
happening around it and understand you
know when it should be operating when it
should be recording it can also snap
photos say if your kids if you're doing
something goofy or your pets you know if
it hears them barking it can tell the
difference between a person and your dog
your cat and you know sounds like a
pretty interesting device now one thing
that's nice is that the app which will
enable all this smart technology and
control of the butterfly is
supposed to be available for iOS devices
first but Android should also be
available soon after that what's also
nice about it is that it is wireless and
has a rechargeable battery built in so
you can put it pretty much anywhere you
want you can set it up as a you know
anti-theft or a you know security device
camera right by your door if you're
going on vacation or you can even you
know just set it up you know discreetly
on a bookshelf somewhere and you know no
one will actually see it or perhaps
it'll go undetected it's a very
interesting device we expect it to you
know hit stores hopefully by January of
2015 and they're having folks this has
been a first look at the butterfly smart
home camera</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
