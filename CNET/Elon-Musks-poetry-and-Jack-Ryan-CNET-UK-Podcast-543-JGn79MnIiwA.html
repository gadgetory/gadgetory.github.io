and we didn't know it plus all the
latest gaming news it's all coming up on
the scene at UK podcast hello and
welcome to the latest episode of scene
at UK podcast I'm rich Turner home and
I'm joined by Katie Collins how you
doing Casey I'm very well great very
good thanks yeah we've got a lot to talk
about this week so let's crack on first
of all this is probably a subject close
to your heart women it's official
women's pockets are too small there's
been a study done about the size of
pockets in women's jeans women's
clothing specifically in relation to
smartphones in the size of smartphones
and whether you can fit an iPhone X in
there or a samsung galaxy and most of
the time you can't so 100% of the time
with men's front pockets could
accommodate an iPhone X but only 40
percent of the time could a pair of
women's jeans accommodate an iPhone X
and it actually drops to 20 percent for
the Samsung Galaxy and the Google pixel
photo only five percent of the pockets
tested of women's jeans could handle
these gargantuan phones now Katie you're
a woman yes as a woman tell us how you
feel about these results well I mean I
think that this it's an issue firstly
that's very very close to my heart and
being a woman that wears jeans a lot and
but I actually think this has been a
problem for decades and it's just really
coming to light now because our
smartphones are so big if
smartphones hadn't got bigger than
perhaps we never would be discussing
this which I think would be a terrible
shame because it's really about time
that women's pockets got the attention
that they deserved in the news 3 the
bucket and Tosh tag yes and you know
this isn't just a small pocket issue
there are a lot of women's clothes don't
have pockets at all and let me tell you
how inconvenient that is and I saw a
meme recently online which basically
said how do you know if a woman's dress
has pockets and the punchline was she'll
tell you I remember once I was at a
wedding when someone iDisk
I know
discovered they had pockets that
someone's no that is nice dress and and
they were oh yeah thanks unless they
were kind of like swooshing it about
they discovered pockets they were oh my
god
it's got pockets and we almost have to
stop the wedding to make it like the
father the bride was mid-speech stop and
say nose and gentlemen this woman is a
woman with pockets and she's very happy
about it yes I treated myself to a
birthday dress the shoe and the thing
that I was most excited about was that
it had a huge pocket I could have so I'm
actually using an iPhone 8 plus which is
slightly bigger than the iPhone turn and
it's the same size size screen but the
the actual body of the phone is bigger
and so I could but I could easily fit
maybe two I reckon I could reckon I
could fit two phones in each of the two
pockets I could carry four phones well
points columns that's what they call
yeah you've got a backup for your backup
yeah
is this one of those cases you think
we're like obviously late you say for
years women have been carrying stuff
around like like makeup and that kind of
thing yeah and no one's really addressed
this pocket issue but suddenly
smartphones come along they're a thing
that men understand do you think this is
the thing that only comes to the men are
only taken seriously because because I
think that it's it's definitely kind of
brought it to the forefront a little bit
more hmm
but you know I I would personally love
the option to sometimes be able to go
places without a bag that would be a
really really lovely thing you know you
see plenty of men on nights out or just
kind of just kind of nipping to the
shops or whatever and just being able to
yeah put their phone in their pocket and
go I want to be able to do that
you know it's I think it's this is a
feminist issue fair enough yeah I should
have you know it should be a fundamental
right that I should just be able to go
places without a bag should it's it's
human rights that's all we're talking
about so yeah so let us know how you
feel about the whole pocket issue our
phones just too big or a pockets too
small I think that's kind of the
fundamental question becomes technology
or is it somewhere in the middle as with
most things
[Laughter]
difficult defense there so also have
what's happening this week Elon Musk I
mean just there's just every time you
look at what the Elon Musk is up to
there's just more stuff that you did not
expect to ever be dealing with so fresh
from his his bizarre Twitter round with
his alien Banks he has proved he's been
getting into poetry yes so this was this
happened yesterday it's yesterday was
exactly two weeks from the date that
must kind of teased on Twitter that he
might take Tesla private and earlier in
the day and he hadn't tweeted anything
all day and we suddenly realized that he
deleted his Instagram account without
saying anything right it's just gone
yeah and it's not the first time
Elon Musk's deleted social media
accounts so earlier this year for
example he deleted the Facebook pages
for two of his company SpaceX and Tesla
now we were all a bit mystified as to
what was happening and I got in touch
with one of his representatives no
comment
and I think like I suspect though what I
thought would happen is as usually
happens with Elon Musk is he likes to
kind of be his own spokesperson use
Twitter as his microphone and I thought
oh I'm sure I would probably suggest
that maybe he takes a bit of time off
yeah good thing so was this latest thing
that he's tweeted them
so rather than tweeting an explanation
and all he said was he tweeted I don't
know whether that it was a direction
whether it was read Elliott's notes on
the wasteland or read Elliott's notes on
the wasteland ursin you should read this
or I've just read this right it's not
very clear but he he tweeted a link to
Wikipedia article about TS Eliot's poem
The Waste Land and also a kind of a
short passage snobby later
yeah so I thought I would read the
passage okay
and bring bring the full weight of your
your gravitas and an acting experience
to this well yes I did do an English
literature degree so this is this should
be we didn't do performance poetry but
you know we didn't do - yes spoken word
bit slam poetry coming up for you ladies
and gentlemen okay fleebus the finition
a fortnight dead forgot the cry of goals
and the deep sea swell and the profit
and loss a current under the sea picked
his bones in whispers as he rose and
fell he passed the stages of his age and
youth entering the whirlpool Gentile or
Jew oh you who turned the wheel and look
to windward consider fleebus who was
once handsome and tall as you my word
musk and well so I you know as I said I
did an English literature degree now
yeah but I don't need to because some
wonderful journalist at Bloomberg had a
little crackers there and I think did a
really good job I'm just gonna I'm just
going to we'll try and link to this this
piece in the show notes to give them
their due but they pointed out that it
has been a fortnight since Elon Musk
tweeted his that he had he had funding
secured today to take Tesla private and
so you know he was saying he as in the
poem he says a fortnight dead I know I
mean obviously he's still alive but I
mean who knows what he's been going
through some private turmoil in that
time on Musk's head it's one of the
great questions about time yes
absolutely yeah I mean will one day
we'll figure it out yes yeah well yeah
though fascinating stuff and if you have
a favorite piece of poetry that applies
to a particular tech
billionaire eccentric then let us know
is there a piece of there a particular
poetry or Limerick that goes back to the
way the Elon Musk then the wasteland
will that will have to wait maybe I
should start a column on that I think
this stimulus I think we should start
poetry corner in this podcast I think
you know if you're a big fan of the
poetry then we can we can do more of it
you know Katie's poke turn it to full-on
Katy reads poetry podcast and I'm okay
with that yeah I think I think that's
good I'm getting a thumbs-up from across
the board yeah I'm sure I'm sure
there'll be some comments on YouTube
suggesting that we don't do that there's
always some comments on YouTube
suggesting that we don't do things that
it's never stopped us before
right so so yes so moving on and so
something that said that someone
mentioned actually was that that
particular piece of poetry that lends
its name to consider fleebus Philebus
the the is that he said I hope it is
yeah which is platter which is an en
banc sci-fi novel that's going to be
turned into a TV show by Amazon which
leads us rather tortuously and
roundabout yeah it was a bit it was a
bit bit labored but I mean I'm gonna run
with it
Rick brings around to Amazon's latest TV
show Jack Ryan which is based on the
famous Tom Clancy best-selling series of
novels and the character Jack run who's
be seen in movies before you might have
seen the the Alec Baldwin movie hunt for
October with Sean Connery you might seem
me to Harrison Ford movies about Jack
Ryan you may have seen the benefit one
the Chris Pine one but no one really
likes to talk about those and after all
those movies they're trying to make Jack
Ryan into a big TV show and I watched it
and it's okay oh yeah it's I mean so the
thing is it's it's gonna be on Amazon
very soon it's I think it's the 30th of
I will tell you that admit the 31st of
August so not not long and it's it's
okay the the problem is it's really
really generic when Tom Clancy's novels
were written he was like a real master
of this kind of geopolitical spy story
this kind of like nations and terror and
terrorists kind of groups at war with
each other and kind of globe-trotting
stories about these kind of these these
smart analysts and and it was it was you
know he was a real master at that story
and
Jack Ryan character who is this like
office desk jockey who's kind of dragged
into these conflicts and was kind of was
really well realized in the novels he's
like the smartest guy in the room and he
can sort of be drawn into action but
it's a very good see it's all about the
politics of these situations and they
were really really good and yeah they're
absolutely they sell by the they sell by
the aircraft carrier form but the
problem is when Jack Ryan put on screen
sitting at a desk or working on a
computer doesn't quite translate on the
screen quite so quite so well and to be
honest it just doesn't really grab me as
a character and and it doesn't help that
this particular show it just doesn't
have anything particularly unique about
it like you've seen everything in this
show before there's a lot of stuff of
like guys with beards like following
other guys with beards through African
market places and like frowning and
saying like we he's made us and then
kind of jumping into jumping into cars
and and and and chasing around after
people and and then it cuts to like an
office where there's a bunch of people
in this kind of like glass framed office
looking at millions of computer monitors
going I think you know where's he going
we've lost him you know we're doing
borns on the move and this kind of thing
except it's not a Jason Bourne movie but
you've you've literally seen all this
before and there's very very little
that's new it's very slickly done it's
very cinematic and you know there's a
good chance that if you like this sort
of thing you're going to like this but
it just doesn't have any of the kind of
like fresh angle or you know even just a
slight twist on the formula that stuff
like homeland or you know various other
movies have that are very similar to
this I was I was thinking about this
just last night actually because I saw
it's a totally different genre but when
I was on the tube I saw him a poster for
a new adaptation of Vanity Fair there's
a curry novel and I they made a film of
that I mean it must have been at least
10 years ago now with Reese Witherspoon
in it but I did think you know they
we're especially with these book
adaptations of kind of well-loved series
or well of love books you know I think
if they're gonna do it more than once if
they're gonna redo redo it then it
really has to be something special and
it does have to be something new I mean
there were other adaptations I can think
of that you know I remember when they
remade Pride and Prejudice for example
which also is you know not of this this
genre
the BBC adaptation was so classic so
brilliant you know people still talk
about it with with Colin Firth diving
into the latest mr. Darcy yeah and the
fact that they remade it just kind of
seems a little bit pointless and I I
mean there are things I think you know
the add up the first adaptation perhaps
the technology wasn't quite there like
the way that they adapted it perhaps
could have done with some work like I I
often think of His Dark Materials by
Philip yeah in those novels and they
actually ended up only making the Golden
Compass the first one of the books and
didn't go down very well yeah everybody
sort of said it wasn't particularly well
done and I think that they're now going
to make a long form TV exact location
out of that which I think would be it's
a much better format for it and much
better and it's an opportunity to to
give that amazing series the adaptation
it deserves but unless you're going to
like you say really brings something
fresh and really new to it then I can't
really see the point in really adapting
something yeah yeah well that's well
that's it and this is an amazon show and
the amazon previously have made a lot of
kind of quite prestigious kind of like
quirky shows and they haven't really had
a big hit in the realm of like who lose
handmade tale or netflix is stranger
things and you know they've won a bunch
of awards are transparent stuff but then
they haven't had like a big kind of
mainstream hit and that that's kind of
why they're shifting a bit towards these
kind of big tentpole things so they're
doing they're doing jack ryan but
they're also doing Lord of the Rings and
it's the same it's like you say I mean
it's not like we don't have a definitive
version of the Rings no one watched the
piece Jackson one of the Rings movies
and went well that was good but it could
have been longer yeah so you know that's
kind of I'm kind of wonder what they're
doing and the thing about this Jack Ryan
show is that it kind of wipes away all
of the sort of the the the the the kind
of the surroundings and the settings
from the from the books because it's you
know it's it's 20 30 years later so so
like the kind of Cold War setting is
completely gone and when you take this
character who isn't really that
interesting on his own and you kind of
put him into a very very generic sort of
setup that has been lifted straight out
of spy game and homeland and all these
other kind of
identical spy movies it's it's it's
really difficult but uh as a kind of
like coded to that I'm actually quite
looking forward to the Vanity Fair
because I recently spoke to the visual
effects people who worked on it and you
know wit being a period period story you
don't really think about there being
visual effects but actually there's
quite there's a huge number of visual
effects in it they used them they used a
cutting-edge digital visual effects to
create stuff like some of the things we
talked about whether the Battle of
Waterloo is seen in there in the story
and so they used visual effects to do
that in a way that hasn't been seen in a
period drama before and they also one of
the scenes that we talked about the way
we focus on listing in t it's gonna be
coming up very soon so if you're
interested in this kind stuff look out
for this but they talked about how they
recreated Vauxhall Pleasure Gardens
which is this kind of like bacchanal
and the kind of the kind of exciting
well I suppose so how is the soho at the
time but this kind of you know kind of
like outrageous sort of back an alien
decadent place where people would go to
to entertain themselves and they've used
creating sounds sounds pretty cool but
they've this thing so they've used
visual effects to to kind of build out
the scale of that and do and realize
that in a way so there's gonna be a shot
where you're probably the idea is that
you won't notice that it's visual
effects but there's gonna be a shot
where someone walks through this
incredible lively teeming set and then
walked into a hot-air ballooning and
flies up and the camera stays with the
balloon and it's all done to visual
effects so that's something that you
wouldn't see years ago so that sounds
pretty cool so if they you know if they
can if they can bring this kind of light
you know new and new sort of generation
of filmmaking to it and that's and
that's very exciting I'm not sure that
Jack Ryan does that I mean like I say if
you're into your spy stuff then yeah
it's it's it's pretty you know standard
issue does the job and it's very slick
and cinematic but you know for me it
just didn't have any kind of freshness
or uniqueness to it unfortunately but
yeah so you'll see that on the 31st of
August so look out for that if you are a
Tom Clancy fan anyway and you said
there's something else that you've been
watching recently as well that's correct
so this is obviously one of Amazon's big
rivals in the video
fear yeah which is it's a Netflix
original that was released last Friday
and Netflix when it comes to its
originals obviously it has had these big
hits like stranger things but they're in
in the kind of teens onra they're kind
of you know that kind of high school
genre which has a kind of I would say a
kind of an audience it's teens and sort
of people in their twenties as well and
it has not been doing so well recently
okay so there so earlier the show that
it was released season two of thirteen
reasons why yep which is kind of being
touted as being quite problematic due to
the how it handles the subject matter
which is mainly centered around this
suicide of the protagonist in the first
inning of the first season and so and
the second season didn't go down that
well it it wasn't they didn't think that
they still didn't think that in spite of
the kind of the these warnings that they
post at the beginning of every episode
they still didn't think it was handled
very well and it also just wasn't
reviewed very well right you've got to
be very careful at depicting suicide
especially teens to an audience our team
yes which is an important audience for
Netflix oh yeah and then just earlier
this month they had the series that
they've really really been pushing front
and center I've seen it kind of every
time I go onto Netflix it's always you
know the main featured show they well
they'll be because of the algorithm that
you'd be interested but yeah and and
also every time I search for anything
and you know that thing isn't there or I
haven't spelt it right that is also
sensational yeah yeah yeah so it's the
show is I'm insatiable which deals with
a really overweight girl who loses loads
of weight and it's just been kind of
rinsed really for just being problematic
in the way that it it's kind of body
shaming but also just like being
politically correct in like a million
different ways that you would not expect
in 2018 and so I was really pleased this
Friday when they released a really
lovely film which is an adaptation of a
really popular young adult novel called
to all the boys I've loved
four and it's this is it's a kind of a
teen rom-com it's involves a girl who
basically she she has she has this kind
of these five letters that she keeps in
her bedroom that she's written to the
five boys that she's had crushes on okay
and her younger sister basically decides
that she this that her older sister
needs a boyfriend so she mails them out
to all of the boys that they are written
to gasp yeah and drama ensues and the
the protagonist Lara Jean kind of ropes
in a fake boyfriend to ward off any
trouble right and I I thought this was a
great example of a it's really
beautifully done I really like
cinematically I thought it was gorgeous
mm-hm the the acting was was lovely they
were convincing teenagers which i think
is a really important thing for anything
that you're gonna set in a high school
no Freddie Prinze jr. in sight and it
was just a really sweet kind of film for
2018 very unproblematic and it really
kind of appealed to people online it's
kind of it's sort of the the main the
other main character a guy called Peter
karinski and has sort of become a bit of
a meme on Twitter I've heard that name
yeah and he said because he's he's he's
such a sweet fake boyfriend no why would
you need a real boyfriend when you can
have a really adorable sweet one so it
sounds like a dose of positivity than it
really is and it feels actually funnily
enough it's really PG like it's so kind
of you know there is no there are no all
the things that you think you need to
make a kind of like good popular teen
drama there's no drugs there's no sex
right there's no like like scary hazing
right like kind of darkness to it
there's a little bit drinking but you
know
but apart from that it's just really
it's quite innocent and that in itself
in this kind of year yeah feels just
really lovely and it's really resonated
with people okay and so if you ever just
it doesn't take you too far on the
emotional spectrum either way so it's
not a kind of a tearjerker and it's not
gonna be like you know it's not it's not
gonna be the funniest film you've ever
seen but it's just a really lovely what
rom-com that will warm your hearts if
you ever and then if you ever in the
mood for like you know you need to be
perked up it's kind of put the perfect
thing really and yeah I just think I'm
hoping that this is an example of
Netflix kind of getting back on track a
little bit when it comes to its teen
yeah programming yeah definitely that's
the thing I mean Netflix has a bit of
they produce so much stuff it used to be
that when their original stuff was like
a mark of you know is guaranteed quality
house of cards and stuff right from the
start you know an orange is the new
black when they were like the only two
things they had that was like a hundred
percent success rate yeah and as they
added new shows and new movies that they
were also really you know really high
bar but then the more stuff they turned
out and the more that it became clear
that they weren't really exerting that
much editorial control over it they were
just kind of like throwing a load of
money at some some you know big-name
people like Ricky Gervais sand you know
all these many many people who've
appeared on there and the streaming
service and it just became clear that
like the quality wasn't the quality
control maybe wasn't there and now
they're producing so much new stuff week
in week out that it's nice to know that
yes some of this stuff actually is worth
watching I mean I watched recently there
was another rom-com with Kristen Bell
and Seth Rogen which I forgot the name
of it so I'm gonna go on a cruise we can
edit this scene later but it's it's it's
basically just like an advert for a
recruiting company but it's clear they
all just went on a cruise for a week
what Kelsey Grammer is well-liked father
it's called keiko scramble points to
that and I just thought this is this is
not a rubbish I can't come watch this
yeah but yeah so so yeah so it's good to
see that you know Netflix is possibly
back on track Netflix Amazon trying
different strategies and we'll see how
how
but yeah I mean let us know what you
think of the latest Netflix Amazon shows
if there's anything in particular that
you're enjoying right now then then let
us know and moving on from movies and TV
we can only want to gaming now so this
week is the big gaming event Gamescom in
Cologne in Germany and so if you're a
gaming fan this is the time to check out
the most original innovative fresh
groundbreaking titles like battlefield 5
life is strange - Devil May Cry 5 and
other innovative brand new
groundbreaking titles such as cyberpunk
2077 I can't believe there's been 20
2009 77 fight I mean it only seems like
about a thousand and five hundred I
actually probably stopped after the
first 800 games to be honest but yeah
speaking of cyberpunk 2077 they had an
event at Gamescom where they had special
fake fake beers made specially related
to the game and our intrepid reporter
with a bit of heroic journalism Andy
Hoyle who's normally in this seat he
went out to Germany and he tried all of
them and recorded it in a great piece of
journalism I think that's gonna be the
one that's gonna win all the awards yeah
and that's the peanuts are right there
so he's in the ground in Germany so
we're going to go across live not live -
Andy in games come Andy what's good
what's good you say well it's definitely
not my quite disappointing hotel room
but I believer it you're probably asking
about actual Gamescom launchers the big
news of the show has definitely come
from Nvidia they have got a whole fleet
of new top and graphics cards this time
called the GeForce r-tx 2080 now the big
thing that you need to know about this
is that of course it makes your games
look a bit more glossy and the
performance is generally better now that
is what we pretty much expected but the
are in RTX comes from a term called
retracing now to be honest I didn't
really know what ray tracing is or why
it's important but turns out it's a
really really big deal and it's been
something of the holy grail of video
games basically what ray tracing does is
really accurately stimulate how light
really react to
different objects and different services
in the real world it allows for much
better reflections on things much better
shadows and it's something that can
really give an extra elements of realism
to your games basically a shiny surface
can now reflect anything in its
environment I previously it would only
reflect things that were already on
screen but now I you can sort of move
around a mirror and it will sort of
actually reflect what else is there we
saw a great example from the upcoming
battlefield 5 where like a tank's muzzle
flash when it fired a shot around I
don't know what tanks fire the the flare
that came off that muzzle you can see
reflected in different objects all
around even though the muzzle wasn't
on-screen so it just means that when
you're playing a game things are
reacting in the way that they should do
so you feel a lot more immersed it might
not sound like a big deal maybe I'm not
explaining it in quite the best way but
really it all adds up to a much more
immersive look overall it's the sort of
thing that when you're playing even a
game of great graphics now you don't
realize what can be improved until you
see how it can be improved and you see
what's happening there so that's pretty
cool
I say we saw battlefield 5 we saw what
else did we see a metro Exodus basically
a lot of the big games a shadow of a
Tomb Raider cause this all has this and
it's not just reflections as well the
shadows particularly in shadow of the
team right they are softer they interact
with other shadows in a more realistic
way so as you're walking around the
scene everything just looks nicer it is
difficult to kind of see so I do as you
if we if we aren't already putting
on-screen different demos which are
hoping we have got some examples do go
on YouTube and hunt down different
things there are screenshots all over
the place of of different before and
after versions with this technology
switched on and with it not switched on
all of which makes it a big deal but
it's called Gamescom let's talk about
some actual games so first of all the
thing I really want to talk about the
most is life is strange too because we
don't really see a lot of that
at e3 we do know a lot more about it now
we know that the story is going to
follow 16 year old Shawn and his little
brother Daniel as they escape from their
hometown of Seattle to their dad's old
hometown in Mexico I won't say why at
this point why they're escaping and just
in case you're really trying to avoid
any spoilers although the first 20
minutes of gameplay is available
officially online so you can go and take
a look at that should you want to it
doesn't have to be a really great game
and much in the same vein as the
previous life is strange series in that
it's completely story driven and there
are loads of choices for you to make
throughout and you know even down to how
you talk to your little brother and how
you give these responses to those things
and those choices that you make will
completely determine the how the game
goes and how you interact with
characters as you talk to your little
brother for example you're given options
that I saw to you tease him about things
and you know basically plays a slightly
jerky bigbrother but that will then
impact your relationship with him down
the line and how he responds to you in
certain ways I think that's really
interesting I actually haven't played
life is strange one but I know a lot of
people who are absolutely obsessed with
it they love it it's this apparently
cinematic masterpiece and can really
it's very emotional really brings you in
to the storyline this looks like it
could be a lot more of that but because
it's not set in just one area it's
spread out you're gonna see more things
you're gonna do more things you're gonna
meet more people I think it's gonna be
really interesting it's coming out again
in episodes like the previous one did
and the first one launches I think
September 27th sometime in September and
the other ones will follow sort of six
to eight weeks after that so that's
looking quite interesting I have seen
bit more of cyberpunk 27 27 T 7 that was
like the big big thing at e3 but
knowingly 83 they didn't let any press
or just capture any game footage or do
anything like that so all we could
really deal with sort of talked vaguely
about what we've seen
annoyingly that's been exactly the same
thing here we haven't be able to capture
any footage you have meals taking
screenshots of our own and we haven't
been able to actually play it we I sat
in a dark cinema and I watched about 50
minutes of different bits of gameplay
all I can say is that it does look
fantastic the graphics look gorgeous the
actual gameplay itself looks great you
will have to take my word on all of this
it's a first-person RPG not a
first-person shooter and
a kind of like life is strange it's very
story driven and as you go through
different missions and quests and things
you will have different ways of
approaching them different outcomes from
each mission that will your choices that
you make again will determine how the
game plays later on it's a dystopian
future it's full of cool-looking guns
and swords and biomechanical implants
that you can upgrade your own vision and
it looks really good it definitely it's
it is very dystopian it's a bit it's
very gritty with lots of bad language
but it looks like a lot of fun it looks
like it's gonna be really interesting to
play bro some really cool game mechanics
things like different boosts you can
give yourself as you're going into
certain areas that look like they are
administered by and like an aspirin halo
the character when you need to do
something just puts this thing goes and
brings it in and suddenly they're more
powerful I don't think that's how
aspirin healers work as far as I've ever
been know if they do work like that then
do let me know because I'd like to try
some but more importantly in the game
perhaps are their promotional beers that
they had on their media stand and they
had four different ones and I thought
it's important to try every single one
because journalism so do go take a look
at that if you are interested to know
why I was quite drunk I had a conference
at about 1:00 in the afternoon some of
the things I've played which I think
we're pretty fun I had to go on
elderscrolls blades that is the Elder
Scrolls mobile game which is pretty much
the nearest you're going to get to
Skyrim on a phone at the moment it does
look really nice almost console level
graphics on an iPhone that I saw her
playing on again it's an RPG
as oppa is not as open as Skyrim or
Elder Scrolls online you as you move
around the world there are pretty set
pathways for you to follow but then
you'll find enemies enemies along the
way and you tap in certain ways in order
to take them take them down what's
pretty cool about this game is that you
can play in horizontal mode or you can
turn the screen and play in vertical
orientation we've just one hand which is
really nice if you just want to casually
play a little bit on the bus or it's
you're walking somewhere so you know
don't play games when you're walking pay
attention to where you're going that's
how accidents happen people come on but
yeah it looks really it looks it looks
fun I only played a short demo it's all
we've seen so far we haven't seen
anything new about it since e3 but I did
always want to highlight because I am a
bit of an Elder Scrolls nerd to an
extent I'm constantly playing the other
scrolls online so the idea of having
something which looks really nice on a
phone is pretty exciting for those times
when I can't take Skyrim on my switch
also things I thought really fun
Nintendo showed me a bit of Super Smash
Brothers ultimate again no big updates
from e3 they have lots of new characters
since then but three others none that I
particularly know or really care about
but the game itself looks like a lot of
fun I think what the what the switch
does really really well is that
multiplayer fun game I loved Mario Kart
8 because I can have four people again
in my house all playing games together
whereas I've really found that and I
know it moaned about this on the podcast
before so I won't go into detail but
most games consoles focus on online play
so yeah you can have your Xbox one and
you can be playing racing games and so
if what you're playing against other
people on other consoles in probably
other parts of the world like we've
really sort of lost that social local
gaming where you can have your mates
around crack open a few drinks and and
game together but I really kind of got
that back of marikar tonight I had
people around all the time and we're
playing and we had a really really good
time and I really enjoyed that so I like
the fact that we've got more local
multiplayer games like Smash Brothers
that you can fire up and you can play
short but intense
and just have a lot of fun together
that's really really cool
overall though the show hasn't been full
of news
it really does play second fiddle to e3
e3 back in June is where we saw all the
big announcements that's where all these
games were first shown off and really
ether air Gamescom has pretty much
teamed just like an opportunity for some
of the European press who didn't get to
e3 to have hands-on with games we've had
some tiny little incremental
announcements on on some things but no
major news no major launches the big
thing really has been the Nvidia
graphics card and that is a big deal so
that's exciting that they did that here
because I think they were supposed to
announce it at e3 but decided for
whatever reason to not do the show
itself is open to the public at the
moment I went in yesterday and it was a
seething mass of people in particular
around the booth for fortnight now
fortnight obviously is a global
phenomena at that moment they didn't
really have any big news at the show but
they did have a huge huge stand which
had its own assault course built around
it though as if lines you can go on
walls to climb over there was like a
bucking bronco one of those ride on
things but it was a missile from the
game rather than a bull there were live
live acts on stages including I think I
saw one that was I had to craft a weapon
and I saw yesterday when I was there
there were people in costumes dancing to
AK was barbegal and throwing t-shirts
out into an audience of literally
thousands of people it was a crush of
people all around the booth huge Keys
people came to ours to have a go on
these things really as it did highlight
for me how much of a phenomenon for 90s
because yes I'm aware everyone talks
about it and stuff and it's a really
popular game but until you kind of go to
somewhere and you see all these people
lining up to get any kind of interaction
with the game it really drives home how
big a deal it is and that was kind of
surprising so yeah it's been good fun
and there's plenty to read about games
if you do head cnn.com forward slash
Gamescom you will be able to see all of
our coverage from there and but there's
nothing yet more to come but we are
expecting some more hands-on with some
games and the plenty of new games
launching over the next few months
before before the end of the year
including shadow of a Tomb Raider and
other big titles which I've seen nothing
of a games calm like Red Dead Redemption
- so obviously there's plenty more
gaming used to come so do keep your eyes
on CNET otherwise that is it from me
from the show I am going to probably
tidy up my hotel room and check out but
not before having a little bit more of
those nice German beer so I'll see you
guys back in the studio soon we miss him
anyway so for more information on on
those latest games and watch the
trailers all that kind of carry-on then
just search see Netcom for the word
Gamescom or one word that's games and
then calm without a dot or anything it's
just like one you'll figure it out we've
got a one stop article listing all the
the coolest new stuff so if you--if it
games got 28 the gamescom 2018 biggest
news and games you'll find that there or
if you really want to go in-depth you
can check out our console-based friends
over at GameSpot comm they're not
console based I don't know why I said
they were like console based but they
are people they're human beings and
don't anyone tell you differently some
of them are pcs exactly and yes at
Gamescom and yeah that's it also
speaking of going off to Germany to look
at smorgasbord of cool new stuff next
week we're not gonna be here at the
podcast because we're gonna be over in
Berlin in Germany for yes we'll be going
to Aoife which is biggest tech show and
not Europe's biggest phone show that's
Mobile World Congress which we've
already had this is the tech show so
that means that there will be more smart
home stuff on display and we are hoping
to see some big smart home announcements
particularly from Samsung and LG but you
know lots of other kind of white goods
companies as well so people that make
fridges freezers cookers other things
that you have in a kitchen and hopefully
some cool I'm gonna personally be
looking out for a lot of home robots
that's gonna be my thing I hope for the
show next week
and there's a whole other bunch of press
conferences as well including Sony
hawawa
and honor and I think we might see some
phones from them hopefully at the new
huar way mate which is one of their kind
of big phones of the year so definitely
look out flex we'll have all of the news
live from Aoife mm-hm and if by the way
if you're kind of listening to that and
going are white goods that's not very
interesting this is the one time of year
when white goods are interesting because
what these guys do is they take their
fridges and their microwaves and their
kettles and their toasters and then they
put other stuff in them yeah so you'll
get like fridges with with tablets in
the screens in the door cameras inside
yeah exactly
dishwashers with like a washing machine
in the lid and and a toaster with a like
a Home Hub Rooter in the in one of the
slots and just yeah it's just
fascinating it's crazy coffee machines
and speakers like Wi-Fi connected

need your pasta maker to be Wi-Fi
connected but no apparently you do and
