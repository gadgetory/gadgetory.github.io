and kids even when he's not at home but
he didn't have to pay for a pricey home
security system with extra cameras and
hardware instead he turned a used iPad
into a security camera and monitors the
activity on his iPhone with a free app
called presence which Wayne developed at
his company people power so what we're
doing is we're breathing new life into
these old devices and making them useful
so that you can kind of have your eyes
and ears at home even when you're away
users must download the present app onto
two devices one serves as a camera and
the other monitors the action you need a
constant Wi-Fi connection and power
source but as long as the camera is
working the phone does not need to be in
pristine condition let me check in on my
kids people are using their for kid
tracking pet cams elderly camps if you
have an elderly relative you're worried
about and you don't get to see them all
the time
Wayne got the idea after his mother's
home was burglarized and he realized a
nice security system would run him
around $1,800 and a monthly service
charge the app also allows for two-way
audio and video communication Sally how
you doing
the app can also detect motion like
walking through a door the camera will
record a five-second video clip of the
action and then send that clip directly
to your email schools have even reached
out to people power to use the setup for
added security there's actually this one
school district in particular who has
voted to go out and ask the parents to
donate their old iPhones and so on to
set up these campus-wide security
systems to improve the safety of our
kids people power is working to expand
the apps capabilities so can control
more things around your home like a
radio controlled thermostat and
specialized electric plugs to control
energy consumption in San Francisco I'm
