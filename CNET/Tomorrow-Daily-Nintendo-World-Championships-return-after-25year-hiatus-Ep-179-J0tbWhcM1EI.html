time now is bring you back a
long-dormant championships and get ready
it's Swahili
greetings citizen to the internet
welcome to tomorrow daily the best ski
talk show in the known universe I'm
Ashley sceva joining me as always
punching the sky ready for the weekend
killin amna I'm ready for the weekend is
that a song everybody's okay poor thing
that I'm really got the cool black
jacket on today like you're ready for
your music video debut join the gang
last night perfect perfect totally went
through the initiation process which was
uh I'm assuming a like a food eat like
hot dog eating contest yeah it's just a
fat gang it's great i love it all right
word on that note let's have headlines
Thursday coming off the rails are
heading Thursday we've already jumped
into hot dog gangs okay we have to talk
about Nintendo again this week I know we
talked about Nintendo and universal but
Nintendo just announced their e3 plans
including something that I am so excited
about that I may have actually floated
into the studio and happiness so
Nintendo releases video this yesterday
morning and it was Reggie good ol Reggie
feels to me thinking about what they
could do at e3 and he'd they they just
say what it is they have decided to
bring back the Nintendo World
Championships we have not seen the
Nintendo World Championships since 1990
that is the last time they existed if
you have ever seen the Wizard the movie
of Fred Savage he goes to the Nintendo
World Championships and you play Super
Mario Brothers street so what is this
exactly ok so what they're gonna do is
we don't really know what games we don't
know exactly what the championships
gonna be I'm hoping for some retro
titles I know you were saying golden I
would be a good one I'm saying golden I
would be the one that I'd stomp everyone
at ok fair enough um so we have some
yeah this is some footage of the actual
like World Championships that had that
used to be I'm sure they'll have some
older titles but they'll likely have you
know smash brothers mario kart things
like that they are going to have
qualifying events at best buy locations
around the u.s. in major cities so keep
an eye out for that on Nintendo's
website and they are going to have the
full event right around III on jun 14th
at seven
jun 14th which is its that's Louie three
weeks like I think it's at the end of v3
if i'm not mistaken or no it's the
beginning of you three so they may show
a new game then they very well much just
like they just like they did it the
wizard I hope the prize is still a power
glove i will say that nintendo is a
little late to the competitive sports
market little bit but i feel like
they've got enough of like a pedigree
because of the world championship that
what its gonna just show them our hearts
as long as it's not like it doesn't get
too serious like as far as a competitive
gaming I'm sure objects gonna be in
there optic is gonna join this one of
more popular clans so I think this is
gonna be a really optic really popular
event and and I think kale and I need to
I think we need to enter it I think we
need to go to a best buy and enter the
contest I don't think I'm ready for that
unless there's Goldeneye in which case
I'm gonna stop i'm telling you we should
go and just see what they have because
if we could qualify for some old with
some older games i feel like there are a
few that i could really do great at so
um yeah i think and I'm hoping there's
gonna be different age groups and all
sorts of stuff I am so excited for this
yeah high fives to Nintendo for bringing
us back good job little kid and all of
us is very very excited yes and some
actual real little kids who exist right
now are excited too okay tell me about
this crazy life show this new device is
made by sony so it's legit it's not like
oh it's a concept somebody's trying to
do this it's a Kickstarter so basically
Sonia is introducing this light bulb
that has a Bluetooth Bluetooth connector
in it so that you can play music it has
yeah as a to watt speaker inside of it
this is going so it's about the so this
light bulbs about the size of a regular
light bulb and uses a traditional socket
so this and that has a Bluetooth
connector that connects with everything
smartphones tablets and computers so you
can play music through it I love how
happy this lady is like brushing and
washing the dishes brushing her hair
listening to Taylor Swift good about
boyfriend she's gonna break up with
lonely starbucks lemon yeah so it has a
translucent optical optical design helps
limit shadows from the speaker inside
the ball is 3x
60 lumens in the long face it already
has a launch date of May twenty-third my
own but not here in Japan of course
because Japan needs everything to be
weird uh I want this I want the issue is
that it's two hundred dollars ouch I get
a hue bulbs at 28 that to 23,000 888 888
yen wow I would love we don't I guess we
don't really know if one thing that I
think would be really cool is if they
all connected to each other so if I had
a room full of like Sonos like so no
system yeah so if I if I was just like I
want to hear catch it throughout the
whole house I can just play it and it
just blasted I and my cat runs away
can't imagine how great that would be
they'll be pretty amazing yeah i would
like to combine this technology with
Hugh and so that way you have color
changing lights so that you cannot would
be amazed Kayla killer literally have a
rave in his house every moment of every
day would making omelets Raven none just
I it would be fantastic I think this is
cool tech $200 I I'm like yeah I can see
that like a good bluetooth headset that
no light bulbs what else oh you pay you
know you pay 200 bucks for like a jam
like a jam box or a beats pill or
whatever so this is you know it's
another bluetooth-enabled speaker I mean
it's not obviously not as powerful as
that you can't take it and just anywhere
with you but pretty cool and I've like I
really like this would want it's a
meanwhile in japan it's a meanwhile I'd
love to like set this next to somebody
was like reading a book just like
quietly Oh blast like some dubstep
anyway so very cool all right I good for
Halloween so tell us about this terrible
school okay I like I saw this story and
I thought it was sort of a indicative of
the times but also like a little bit
like oh really um this is a program
called food ography which you know not
unlike phone ography it actually is it
actually is made like it's a class
designed to teach you how to take better
pictures of your food and they made
these special plates that have the high
backs on them which actually I think are
really beautiful i would like to see
stuff like that in restaurants anyway
and then they also have this 360 plate
that spins around it's kind of on a lazy
susan so you can get some cool videos of
a fancy Dancy food when you go
to eat it at expensive places um but
here's the thing uh it so it's from a
car it's from Carmel winery you look
really stupid with their eyes yeah I
know it is ridiculous like oh these
these like super high-end chefs taking
pictures of their food for Instagram is
crazy um so this it's a Tel Aviv
restaurant called khatik and a caramel
caramel wineries the other place and
they're saying this is an actual dinner
experience that is it includes best
practices on taking photos of great food
pictures like taking great food pictures
and they actually have Pro food
photographers come and teach you like so
they come in and they're like this is
how we photograph beautiful dishes and
things like that and it is expensive it
costs a hundred and fifty five dollars
an hour which you know that's almost a
sony bluetooth speaker light bulb for
one hour's worth of time um but I i mean
i really like these plates and I like
this kind of concept of tea I always
loved the idea of teaching people better
for the plates have a built-in place to
put your phone it has a little built-in
slot so you can stick your phone and so
it's not you're not shaking you failed
us mankind you failed it oh and so yeah
they've got all this stuff to help you
take better pictures of fancy food and
like I said I mean I really knows an
hour tho 3 55 bucks an hour and that's
crazy uh ok sign of the times I totally
get it I totally get it and food is all
about presentation like that very trail
like the number one thing but also let's
like eat it enjoy eating food by eating
it ok if this was like twenty dollar or
like it was like on our fifty dollars
for like a day yeah or like a five
course meal yeah not an that I can enjoy
that is some people's hobby some people
only like do their Instagram for yes and
I and I get it's not my thing I do not
like your pictures on Instagram all
ignore it but that's not my thing unless
you take a photo of in and out and then
all and then you're good yeah but
presented nicely make it look good I
don't care if it's all of your face just
do it if it's in your mouth mid you just
yeah alright alright I can appreciate
helping people take better phone
pictures just because I appreciate nice
pictures but i think the
is a little bit pricey a little specific
they want to bring this all around the
world they want to take this experience
all over the place so maybe maybe coming
to a city near you I do knows and if it
does please go to it and expense it or
make it a tax write off somehow don't
experiment tell us yeah I don't expense
address and then tell us how it was
because we're definitely not paying for
it okay so that's headlines we got to
take a quick break we'll be right back
with into it and I have a very special
very special thing it's show-and-tell
again this week I brought something and
I brought somebody who owns a thing so I
made them bring it in but um but we'll
be right back so don't click away it's
tomorrow daily
welcome back to the show we have

have to tell you about what we're
obsessed with this week this is into it

big festival in Alabama it's right on
the beach a complete mix of artists like

I'm excited about hanging out fast have

come back is what we're saying come back
in one piece police officials so beat
that I I will beat that I will beat that
with with this which um is a remote
control but it's not just a remote
control it controls this this is the DJI
phantom 3 oh that's so beautiful
beautiful drone that takes beautiful
video and this is friend of the show
Michael Hobbs drone he picked it up last
month he pre-ordered it I was very
excited and I wanted to tell you guys a
little bit about because i am i'm kind
of obsessed with all the video that he's
been sending me on this is beautiful too
we have footage now I want one yes
that's not him well I'll cut in some of
Mike's foot
chill because he's been sending it to me
on iphone and I want to make sure we
have kind of like a little bit not
iphone compressed footage this is from
DJI this this one in particular is the
advanced model this is the 1080p model
and it's it's a thousand bucks which
isn't bad all things considered oh not
that there's a 4k version for 1259
that's called the professional they want
to include a simulator in this they're
going to in a future update for the app
they're gonna have a simulator so that
if you're afraid to fly it because
you've never flown a drone before yep
they will you can learn how to fly it
without actually putting this in the air
and crashing it into something because
you're terrible at flying and the video
is absolutely great it looks beautiful
it's it's on a 3-axis gimbal GPS
positioning so you can like set it GPS
wise and it'll just hover in the air and
you can control the camera and it also
has this thing which is the big upgrade
over the phantom 2 which is called light
bridge and it's an HD video downlink so
the remote here actually has a spot for
your phone or your iPad and you can drop
that in there and you can actually see a
live HD version of a stream of your
footage or you can actually live stream
you'll love this you can live stream
straight to YouTube really yeah yeah so
this is it um it's awesome and and I I'm
really digging it I kind of want one
really bad but I also just like well I
guess my best friend has one so maybe
I'll just like live vicariously through
through his we just murder him take his
yeah except what I'm gonna do wow way to
bring it down dark he's in the studio he
knows he knows the rest she knows to run
um but yeah so the DJI phantom 3 has is
what I'm into this week and it's it's so
cool and I just it's so fun to play with
yeah yep um so yeah that's it that's
what i meant we're gonna show it off
though right we are gonna show it off
and and hopefully we already have we
listen guys we recorded an intro just in
case but if it if it was a good drone
intro then you know it worked oh ok ok
so this is us unsure that's not really
sure we're about to go and shoot this
drone thing so I full disclosure guys
may or may not work so if you get a
really cool intro to the show today it
worked and if not then ok so that being
said let's talk about you guys and your
user feedback
we got a lot of your feedback no no it
we don't have any um here's why so
remember you guys at home when we said
yesterday that schedules were kind of
crazy around here well we're actually
shooting this show before Wednesday's
episode goes live so uh we don't have
your user feedback for Wednesday and so
what we're going to do is we're going to
come back next week with your user
feedback about the Tesla suit and and so
today there was no hash tag of the day
if you didn't notice and we are just
going to read this awesome email from
one of our viewers who wanted to talk
about Nintendo land and had some really
great ideas all right let's hear it all
right so this is from Jose Jose wrote in
and he said hello guys i submitted one
on youtube already but I started
thinking a little harder and it would be
cool if they included StreetPass into
rides your 3ds or mobile device remember
Nintendo's going to go into the mobile
world maybe the next Nintendo consoles a
phone of the call boy would earn rewards
for writing on rides maybe even have
achievements for riding the rides and
also while in line have different games
you can download and play and at the end
before getting on a high score chart
would display best scores of the day
possibilities are endless you could have
secret areas around the whole park where
you get a different playable minigame
every two hours have tournaments winner
gets a universal exclusive amiibo I
would be amazing I could sit here all
day so let's pray it happen sooner than
later but as long as they do it right I
could wait forever your loyal subscriber
Jose PS i love both of you keeping them
I can't get this I keep getting this
sneaky feeling that it's not going to be
as big everything that first comes out
they'll build up just like they did with
the laker Simpsons things yeah the
simpsons thing but i don't know we'll
see but really the possibilities are
endless and i think you guys have come
up with some amazing ideas that nintendo
should absolutely consider including
because i love this street past idea and
i also love this exclusive amiibo thing
where it's like we get enough points
like in the park during the day you can
go and get like a little exclusiva meebo
i think it would be amazing so great
work Jose I thought that email was
glorious and we will get to your TD
Tesla VR hashtag on Tuesday and I'll
explain why we don't have a real show on
Monday as well
and the second house people hang out
fest and producer logo not being here um
