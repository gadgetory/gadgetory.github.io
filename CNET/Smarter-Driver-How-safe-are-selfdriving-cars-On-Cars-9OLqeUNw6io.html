accidents another 26,000 in the EU vast
numbers unequaled in rate by any other
means of transportation so the main
selling point for self-driving cars
early on has been dramatic reduction in
accidents however in their first million
or so miles of real-world testing on
public roads they've yet to stake a
claim to that hope a new study by
Michael C vac and Brandon shuffling at
the University of Michigan
Transportation Research Institute looked
at the data from the early self drivers
fielded by Google out and Delphi the
inconvenient truth
these early self drivers have a higher
accident rate than their human driven
counterparts here are three more nuanced
takeaways however for the smarter driver
first of all the accidents that
self-driving cars are involved in tend
to be minor and let's face it we've got
to get over this sci-fi ideal that
self-driving cars will never crash and
embrace the reality that they will crash
less often and with less severity
secondly the self-driving car accidents
so far have not been the self-driving
cars fault it's been the other guy the
human oh my god now that will change of
course that these cars propagate into
the real world markets and the hands of
non trained professionals who aren't
official company testers and certainly
the miles driven so far by self-driving
cars aren't under optimal conditions the
current state of cars that rely on
sensors around the vehicle to see and
read every situation really can't pack
and can heavy snow or hail or even a
wicked thunderstorm see that it's ugly
at University of Michigan also point out
there probably some awkward teenage
years ahead when the earliest commercial
self-driving cars will be basically
surrounded and outnumbered by human
driven cars they with their part logic
we with our fuzzy logic it's gonna make
for some unpredictable results bottom
line as we get these early indications
of the efficacy of self-driving cars
toward reducing accidents it pays to
double check the reality of what the
goal is complete accident reduction or
merely a dramatic improvement in
fatalities at least in some situations
