everything google that we can pack
inside of a show let's jump in and
Google might have just leaked out the
first sneak peek at Android n after a
tweet from their Google Maps account
freaked out people with the video that
appears to showcase a nexus 6p without
the standard Android app drawer that
we're used to having it's that circle
with two rows of dots that takes you
right into your apps but it's not in
this video now rumors have been floating
around that Android and might get rid of
it many android oems at Mobile World
Congress left it off their phones and
even the LG g5 has dished it all signs
point to it getting the ax new
screenshots from Android police have
been confirmed to be part of Android end
showcasing a hamburger style menu button
on the top left corner for these
Bluetooth settings would most likely
access a side drawer to the left that
would feature a list of different
options alongside Bluetooth like Wi-Fi
or the sound settings now the original
intentions for these screenshots were to
show off the day and night theme in
android now it's also been confirmed
that t-mobile pre-orders for the galaxy
s7 and s7 edge are already shipping to
customers ahead of the official March
11th release date it's the same s7s that
i said had a touch pressure sensitive
screen last week and obviously they
don't but sometimes I have a brain fart
and I did last week so I deserve my own
come on sung now TouchWiz made a big
improvement with the s6 but these
screenshots shared by daniel martina
show up how far it's come with the s7
and may make this an even more appealing
get for Android users now some of these
images appear to be part of TouchWiz
using an actual material design theme
and it looks awesome so if you love a
pure Nexus experience Samsung has never
been closer this time now the fun
doesn't stop there Samsung's also
rolling out new emojis with Android 6.0
point one marshmallow emoji pedia breaks
down some of the changes including all
new faces even though Samsung really
misses the mark with a rolling eyes one
compared to other companies emojis new
animals like the lion face and unicorn
and others are here and the wind blowing
face for mother nature
you most of these editions come from the
Unicode seven and Unicode eight releases
but the biggest miss Samsung doesn't
include emoji modifiers for diverse skin
tones come on some black emojis matter
and so do asian and latino and you get
what I'm saying but in a weird decision
every one of their people emojis are
white except for the police officer and
dancer that's weird so we are hoping for
an update soon all right according to
Variety Google is working with vizio and
others to make tvs with built-in
chromecast functionality currently
manufacturers that want the ability to
google cast content must use Android TV
but this new development removes Android
TV from the equation the report says
Vizio is rumored to be the first partner
and they are expected to ship TVs as
early as spring the Google TV platform
never took off android TV didn't either
but the chromecast has been a real
success in using a proven formula could
help out both manufacturers and the
goose and if you love robots you need to
watch this but if you're afraid of
robots cover your eyes Google's Boston
Dynamics recently showed up the next
generation of its Atlas robot and this
thing is amazing the new Atlas robot is
5 foot 9 weighs in at a solid 180 pounds
and is designed to work both indoors and
outdoors sensors in its legs and body
help it bounce now look at this thing
scary and cool at the same time so you
know what you two will one day be able
to order your own t800 this amount of
time I'll be back alright that's going
to do it for this week's show you can
email us at Google issues at cnet com or
tweet me at brian Tong thanks for
watching we'll see you all next time for
some more of that Google issues
