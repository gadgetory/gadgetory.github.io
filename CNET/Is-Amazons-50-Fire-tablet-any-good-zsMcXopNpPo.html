right the Fire tablet costs $50 now I
know what you're thinking is it even any
good well there are some good things
about it like it runs Amazon's latest
operating system the user friendly fire
OS 5 Bellini is built for taking
advantage of Amazon's big media library
if you're a Prime member you can stream
and download all the TV shows and movies
that come with your subscription for
free and thanks to a new feature called
Amazon underground you can also get free
game downloads and in-app purchases
additionally there's a microSD card slot
for expanding the storage the fire
tablet also comes in a kid's edition it
cost twice the amount however you get a
kid-friendly case a year subscription to
free time unlimited which gives you
access to tons of free books movies and
games for children and if the tablet
breaks within two years you get a
replacement for free so what's not to
like about it well it's design is a bit
passe the screen quality isn't very good
and performance is on the slow side it's
only 50 dollars so you can't expect too
much that said in comparison to other
low-cost tablets the fire offers more
features especially if you're an Amazon
Prime member but if you can afford
another 50 bucks I'd recommend upgrading
to the Fire HD 6 it's a smaller tablet
with the same software perks but it has
a better screen and faster performance
for more information on why you should
or shouldn't buy the tablet read the
review on CNET i'm zmr blanco and this
has been a first look at the Amazon fire
