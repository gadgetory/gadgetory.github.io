Galaxy s4 is something called I scroll
you can scroll through web pages using
just your eyes or even pause a video by
looking away from the screen but I
scroll just scratches the surface of new
eye tracking technologies that could
change how we interact with all our
devices in the future so when I look at
that asteroid they blow up oh my god
swedish company toby is building I
tracking into video games you realize
you did the whole experience you didn't
actually use your head no I know fellow
mouse yeah I mean did you see my hands I
was sort of like we're creeping up like
I feel like any of your eyes we can get
you a mouse if you go through withdrawal
here and they've made it possible to
control windows 8 all with your eyes
sorry I'm actually have our gaze
interaction for win8 implementation and
so instead of having to reach up and
touch the screen it knows where I'm
looking the other thing good school
hears you notices I'm reading I'm not
scrolling it's actually following my
reading it's scrolling down it's gone to
the bottom of the page okay i'm
selecting the calculator than my eyes
and I'm actually gonna run the
calculator again I'm just gonna tap to
say select but I'm not she not gonna say
eight or nine I'm not gonna press eight
or nine key Wow amazing right okay you
know what I have to say I'm starting
pardon the pun I'm starting to see it
like I'm starting to get the idea of how
this would be super useful and natural
yeah then there's virginia-based LC
technologies this is their eye gaze edge
the idea here is that you basically type
with your eyes the computer translates
the words on the screen into synthesized
speech hello how's it going the eyes can
point very precisely so if we can get
camera technology that can harness that
then we can then turn that into say
essentially the same thing as a mouse on
the screen I asked one of our producers
to skype with jeff cannata to give it a
try hey how's it going it's going well
it's a lovely day a lovely spring day
here in Los Angeles so how's the weather
there funky violence San Francisco for
you it's sunny sunny here so you're
typing with your eyes what is that like
Mars a little bit fatigued but I think
over time you get pretty used to it and
get stronger but it just goes to show
you how cool things are getting now like
I can just look at your picture on the
screen and hover over you right now like
this and I can hang up on you with my
eyes don't hang out loving with your
eyes women do that's me all the time I
think that makes two of us then I
tracking as part of a revolution in
input a future where we will control
devices with our eyes our voice of me a
massage Agathe our hands the
possibilities are endless even our minds
I am exhausted it's not clear yet which
new input technology or combination of
technologies will turn out to be the
most useful or effective for now I'm
just enjoying the R&amp;amp;D phase doing I'm
like asteroid showdown I'd love to shoot
asteroids by looking at them I love the
future go I got that one the duel is on
oh no no no no no I looked right at you
or all that was a big one I remember
asteroid something screaming was it
always this dark your eyes were gone I
can't save everybody hmm
soon's believe it is I see the pigeon
can't stop now can't stop
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
