Start screen Cortana there's one other
really big feature in Windows 10 that it
has relevance to this conversation to
all of you as developers and that is
project Spartan project Spartan products
partner you know I have to admit our PR
team has been giving me and us a hard
time because they say it's not a great
idea to keep saying project Spartan when
that's not really the name of the web
would you like to hear the name of the
new web browser in Windows 10 okay let's
run the video
Microsoft edge is the browser built for
Windows 10 and it'll be available on the
widest range of Windows 10 devices and
for us the name refers to the idea of
being on the edge of consuming and
creating it refers to the developer
notion of being closest to the modern
capabilities of the web and so it is a
browser that end-users will think about
for getting things done for things like
note-taking on the internet for a great
way of reading and consuming content and
it's a browser that has Cortana built in
so it learns the things that you care
about and helps you get things done I'm
not gonna go show any of that stuff
we've shown that before as developers
there are a few reasons that you're
gonna care about Microsoft edge
you're gonna care about the blazing-fast
core technology that's inside it and
you'll hear more about that in a talk
tomorrow you're gonna care that we're
writing it as a universal Windows app
proving out the platform and you're also
gonna care because we're gonna make it
help users discover and engage with your
apps and your sites so let me come over
here and show you some of what we're
doing there and I'm gonna come down here
to the e icon on the taskbar which now
has a completely different and better
meaning that it has for a while and open
up Microsoft edge now the first thing
that I want to show you that's new is
the new tab page that we're adding to
Microsoft edge today an ie the task of
starting a new tab and starting new web
browsing happens over a billion times a
day so this is a heavily used piece of
UI and you'll see here how we're gonna
take advantage of Cortana's presence in
the browser an understanding of you
along with an understanding of value in
the ecosystem to give users a great way
to start their web browsing experience
or to discover other things so you can
see of course I can type to enter a web
address or do a search up here are my
top sites and in some cases there's an
app available for these sites in the
store so we make that discoverable and
available as I scroll down you'll see
here's some featured apps that we're
showing here's a lot of news stories
that are relevant to me in fact my
sports favorites that you saw in Cortana
and my stock watch list in Cortana those
represented right here in the new tab
page that's an example of Cortana
helping to compose this in a way that's
useful to me so that's new tab and we've
been testing this a ton and we're
optimistic about its opportunity to help
people discover and connect with work
that you all do on the web and in apps
now there's another big thing that we're
doing in Microsoft edge that has huge
relevance to you and that is enabling
users to engage with your sites and give
you a shot at starting to write some web
code which you may put into an app via
Web extensions built into Microsoft edge
so I'm gonna show you a couple of web
extensions this is HTML and JavaScript
like web extensions using web standards
that people have been writing for
Firefox and Chrome for quite a while
we've grabbed a couple of these from
chrome with just a few minor
modifications and we're lighting them up
right in here in Microsoft edge so the
first thing how many reddit users do we
have yes come on you must be reddit
users for those of you who are power
reddit users maybe in the some of the
other browsers you've tried the reddit
enhancement suite which modifies the
markup on reddit to make it easier to
find images and scroll pages well we've
brought that to Microsoft edge as I said
with just a few changes so as I scroll
down here you'll see the web has been
altered via this little paw print here
that I can use to expand and then his
little pig nose just kills me too as I
look at this cute image it's not a cat
or a mouse I don't even know and as I
scroll down here you'll see the
neverending reddit modifies the page to
continue to expand it as we go it was
virtually no work to take this from the
Chrome extension store and run this this
is a standards-based HTML and JavaScript
just running here as part of an
extension now another example which
certainly matters in terms of user
engagement up here you'll see we've
added a Pinterest extension to the
browser toolbar and when I click that
this is going to interact with the the
mark-up on the page to show all of the
images that were generated by the red
enhancement suite and now I can find
tons of things here that are incredibly
cute that I might pin to one of the many
Pinterest cute animal
boards that I and I know all of you keep
just for this sort of thing so with
projects part with a Microsoft edge and
the the new support for these extensions
you'll see how we're going to enable
people to discover and engage with code
that you're propping up on the web and
as I said of course you could bring that
into an app as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
