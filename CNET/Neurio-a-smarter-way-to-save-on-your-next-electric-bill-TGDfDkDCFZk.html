I'm CNN's Megan bulletins in a cramped
hallway in my condo looking at neurio
this little black device here a hole
home energy monitor basically this two
hundred and forty nine dollar gizmo
plugs into your circuit breaker and
keeps track of all of the energy usage
throughout your home neurio comes with
an Android or iOS mobile app and a web
app that lets you track in real time
your energy consumption so I literally
walked around my condo turned on the
stove turned on the AC turned off the AC
flips on a fan just to see what
difference it would make and the results
were pretty astonishing I could see
everything in real time it really was
fast and responsive and I really got a
sense of the difference that one single
light switch can make on your energy
consumption aside from just real time
energy consumption information you can
also break it down by appliances but
neurio is currently limited to 400 watts
for energy appliance breakdowns so it
can do stuff like your stove it can do
your AC it can do your toaster a lot of
stuff that generates heat but for
smaller wattage things like your
refrigerator or a single light switch it
can't do itemized appliance breakdowns
but neurio does say that that as well as
integration with third-party products
like the Nest Learning Thermostat are on
the way even though neurio does have
some limitations right now I think it is
a really interesting device that's only
going to get better with time
that said installation is complicated do
not try this yourself unless you are a
very very experienced
ðï wire if you're not I would enlist
an experienced friend or even call a
professional because you don't want to
be messing around with an open breaker
panel there are just all sorts of
hazards here that someone who doesn't
know better wouldn't know about so to be
clear Steve our technical editor did do
all of the installation with neurio just
to make sure that everything was safe
and secure and he switched off the power
to everything before removing at this
panel for this video
neurio is definitely a cool product that
I would recommend but if you're on the
fence I'd stay tuned because Belkin and
a couple other startups are coming out
with products very similar later this
year but if you are looking for an
energy tracker right now neurio is a
solid option and a two hundred and forty
nine bucks it's the same price as the
Nest Learning Thermostat
that's not bad considering that it
provides whole home energy tracking for
