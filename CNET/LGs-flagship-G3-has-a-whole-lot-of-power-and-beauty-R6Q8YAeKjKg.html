today we're going to check out LG's
latest flagship the g3 now the g3 is a
premium high-end LTE device that is as
powerful as it is sleek it features a
bright and vivid 5.5 inch display with
ultra thin bezels this screen is a super
sharp quad HD IPS display and has a 2560
x 1440 pixel resolution and 538 PPI the
handset runs android 4.4 point2 KitKat
and sports a refreshing new user
interface from LG that's clean
minimalistic and flat LG also threw in a
number of its signature software
features like NOC code NOC code lets you
both wake up and unlock your touch
screen with a customizable tapping
motion there's also LG held a built-in
fitness tracker that works in
conjunction with LG's new Android
wearable the G watch now the SmartWatch
isn't necessary to use a health app
however so you could still keep records
of your running or biking workout on the
back is a 13 megapixel camera that has
optical image stabilization and a laser
guided autofocus which we found to be
very apt for taking photos in low-light
environments the camera can also shoot
4k Ultra HD video in addition the 2.1
megapixel front-facing shooter has a
nifty selfie gesture which lets users
start a countdown timer by making a fist
motion powering all these features is a
robust 2.5 gigahertz Snapdragon 801 quad
core processor and a 3 ampere our
removable battery this battery has
wireless charging capabilities and an
estimated talk time of 21 hours as for
its memory capacity the device has three
gigs of RAM and up to 32 gigs of
internal memory but you could expand
that up to 128 gigs if you have a
microSD card currently the g3's on
contract price ranges from a hundred
dollars to two hundred dollars depending
on your carrier and off contract it'll
cost you upwards to six hundred dollars
the device comes in 5 different colors
but some of these variants are region
specific so you're going to have to
check with your carrier to see what's
available in your market
and I'm Lynn and you've been checking
out the LG g3</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
