editor for cnet.com and today I'm taking
a first look at the SMS sync by 50 cent
headphones these are built for listeners
that take fashion pretty seriously and
shop for headphones to match that
lifestyle but it's definitely not the
first celebrity-endorsed headphone that
we've seen in the marketplace dr. dre
set the standard first with the active
noise-cancelling beats by dre then
Ludacris followed up with his soul
headphones but the sings taken one step
further with wireless technology by way
of clear you may be disappointed when
you take them out of the box however
because they definitely don't feel like
they're $400 similar to the Beats the
plastic exterior tends to creak like
crazy even when they're on your head and
the thin plastic connecting the headband
to the adjusters on the side can barely
support the heft of the ear cuffs in my
opinion nothing that costs 400 bucks
should make this sound the idea of
creating a wireless connection to any
music source using this dongle sounds
pretty good in theory but the hardware
misfires again in practice small details
make a big difference in headphones and
this plug feels alarmingly like those FM
transmitters that came out with the
original iPods what's worse is that the
plug tends to wiggle around in the
housing a little bit and that'll likely
create stability issues in the future
and as you can see it's free to just
dangle around here on top of your iPhone
it also happens to cover the power
button as well which is another design
flaw the sinks come in black or white
and some may enjoy the blinking blue
lights on the side I like that you can
actually turn them off if you want by
pressing the track navigation button for
about three seconds those buttons are
also used to connect the dongle to the
headphones by way of clear digital
technology the way you connect them to
the source however is different from
Bluetooth headphones those bluetooth
headphones compress the audio signal to
send it wirelessly so this version will
sound a lot more robust and cleaner than
what you'd ever hear out of those
competing Bluetooth headsets on that
note I should say that I like the way
these sound more than the ludicrous and
the monster beats by dre and it's also
pretty cool that if you do lose power on
the rechargeable battery you can just
connect this cable they give you and
keep on listening getting rid of the
wire though is a pretty good way to
listen to music
the frequency response will definitely
appeal to fans of music with heavy beats
and synthesized tones at the same time
you won't find active noise-cancelling
on these headphones like you get on the
competitions so you may be happier with
those other ones if that's an important
feature for you regardless though 400
bucks is a pretty ambitious price tag
for a device that feels more like a
hundred bucks I'll give clear digital
credit for the lossless audio tech but
SMS audio needs to really work on the
build integrity before they can compete
with other $400 headphones now you can
read all the details in our full review
on cnn.com but that's gonna do it for me
I'm Justin you and you just took a first
look at the SMS audio sync by 50 cents</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
