skiing Yeti mountain which is like a
modern game done with old classic
graphics so you swipe controls just your
thumb going back and forth on the screen
to turn and these early runs are
basically just trying to get to the
finish line and that's easy enough to do
just ski down between the trees and
there you go see but the thing is is
that the way this game works is you'll
just go through run after run in a row
and you have to go between the flags and
the later levels and watch out for the
animals in your way and then you'll
finish a race and then you'll just go
right on to the next one and that's how
this game gets really addicting really
fast as you play you'll get to certain
levels where you'll unlock gear you can
change your hat you have the snow camo
you have the Santa suit the fur onesie I
like racing in a lots it doesn't really
do anything but it's fun this game is
not easy
I've played quick played it quite a lot
as you can tell by the 245 tracks but
now we're gonna have our producer Sarah
play the game just to get an idea what
it's like if you've never played it
before
okay wrong side okay okay okay nice nice
so this game is easy to pick up and play
it's fun but it is clearly difficult to
master</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
