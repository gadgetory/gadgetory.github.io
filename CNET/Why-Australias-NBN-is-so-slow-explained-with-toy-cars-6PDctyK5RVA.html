every time you use the Internet your
connection goes cool potato so why is
your internet so slow and why do you
have that crushing sense of loneliness
every time you're not on Facebook well
we can't help you with that last thing
but there is one factor that could be
affecting your speeds
it's called CVC and we're here to
explain it with toy cars I'm not taking
this out of the box I'd bought it at
Graceland it's worth a lot what is C BC
and why should you care this is the
information superhighway the National
Broadband Network has been built by NBN
the company but NBN doesn't actually
sell you your internet connection
retailers like Telstra Optus TPG and I
don't buy access from NBN and sell it to
you the end user to get you onto the
Internet your ISP or retailer has to pay
for two things
AVC and CVC AVC is the flat rate that
your retailer pays to get you onto the
NBN think of it like the car you drive
on the highway the highest speed tiers
have a more expensive car while the
lower speed tiers have a less expensive
car
the next cost is CBC now that's the fee
that retailers have to pay to actually
get bad with the more CVC then the more
bandwidth that internet retailers get
for their customers retailers pay for
this bandwidth at exchanges across the
country they're known as points of
interconnect like old-school telephone
exchanges they're the place where the
NBN connects to Telstra Optus or TP G's
network and then ultimately to you think
of them like on-ramps for the
superhighway so your ISP estimates how
many people they think need the NBN in a
certain area and pay for as much of this
bandwidth as they think they'll need the
more people the wider the on-ramp the
problem comes when Internet service
providers try to save money by skimping
on CBC
if they haven't bought enough bandwidth
you get bottlenecks every time someone
tries to go online too many cars
not enough room on the road the problem
is you don't know how much CVC your
telco is buying they don't actually tell
you and they don't want to buy too much
so they're hoping that light Internet
users subsidize heavy internet users but
it doesn't always work that way two
people with the same ISP on the same
speed tear could have totally different
experiences on the NBN if your ISP
hasn't bought enough bandwidth at your
point of interconnect everyone at that
exchange will suffer when you all go
online on mass and if nothing changes
it's only going to get worse we're
streaming more netflix uploading more
stupid videos to Facebook and connecting
more gadgets to the internet than ever
before we just need a network that can
handle it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
