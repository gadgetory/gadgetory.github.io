activity that everyone in your family
can participate in and enjoy here's how
you can spruce up the light display in
your front yard this holiday season on
the cheap put some DIY holiday light
balls to get started you only need three
materials one of which is optional first
you need some outdoor string lights
approximately 200 lights per
medium-sized ball you're also gonna need
one inch hex mesh which is also called
chicken wire they often come in two foot
wide rolls and you're gonna need
approximately a 2 by 4 sheet of hex mesh
per medium-sized bowl and finally you
can use it ties to secure the ends of
the light strands to the wire mesh but
it's not actually needed for tools your
own they're going to need wire cutters
or cutting pliers but it would also
recommend wearing gloves when working
with the wire mesh because when you cut
it it leaves it rough edges which can
and will snag and cut your hands rather
easily start making your holiday light
balls by unrolling and cutting the hex
mesh into a 2 by 4 foot sheet this will
make a 2 foot diameter ball the biggest
mistake you can make here is being
stingy and not cutting enough mesh which
will result in a more oval shaped ball
instead of a sphere
once the mesh is cut make a cylinder by
connecting both short ends of the mesh
to fasten them square up both edges of
the wire and find 2 loose ends of wire
that match up and twist them around one
another at their bases to help hold the
cylinder shape now comes the tricky part
bending the cylinder into a sphere this
can take a little bit of practice but
fortunately if you mess up you can just
unbend the wire and start over
hold the wire mesh about six inches down
from the top edge and bend in the top
using your other hand next hold the
piece of mesh that you bent in while
making a pleat with the mesh adjacent to
it in essence you're bunching together
an open end of the cylinder to help make
a sphere when the open end is bent in
place the cylinder on the ground opened
and up and step on the wire to flatten
it and help hold its shape next bend the
opposite end of the cylinder you can't
step on this end to flatten it but try
to flatten the pleated wire as best you
can now the wire likely looks like a
slightly more rounded cylinder not a
ball you must bend and shape it into a
ball this can be tricky but should only
take a few minutes finally it's time to
wrap lights on
around the ball of wire take the female
end of a strand of outdoor string lights
and run it through one of the hexagons
pull it out of an adjacent hexagon to
lock it in place
optionally you can use a zip tie to
better secure this end while keeping the
strand taut wind it around the mesh ball
as evenly as possible for a two foot
diameter ball you want to use between
200 and 300 lights when finished lock
the male end of the strand in place the
same way as the female end but this time
leave just a little bit of slack to make
it easier to plug in hang these balls
from trees on your porch or place them
around the yard just keep in mind that
you will need to run an extension cord
to each ball which can be a bit of a
logistical nightmare but knowing how
jealous your neighbors will be makes it
more than worth the effort</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
