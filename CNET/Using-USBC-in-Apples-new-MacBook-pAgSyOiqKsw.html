one of Apple's new super slim 12-inch
MacBooks but you're not sure what you're
going to do with just one USB C port
well I'm going to tell you how to use it
I'm Dan Ackerman and this is a quick
guide to USB C in your new 12-inch
MacBook now of course you've got this
little plug right here that is USB
type-c it's actually USB 3.1 speed but
with a new shape plug that they call C
there's already an A and a B your most
used to the a1 so you have this little
plug right here and the first thing we
do is plug this cable in and that goes
right to your power adapter that's right
the same plug does power as those
accessories of anything you want to plug
in and the power adapter of course looks
a lot like the one you would get for an
iPhone or an iPad so if you want to use
a mouse with your new macbook you've got
to unplug the power connection you take
one of these little adapters they go
from the smaller USB C to the
traditional USB a shape and then you
take the dongle from your mouse and you
can insert it right in there and now
your mouse is working and that's great
in all but if you want to plug the
battery back in well then you've got to
unplug this and then you go and you plug
your your power adapter back in there
and Apple will eventually sell these
larger power blocks that have multiple
connections on them but you still only
have one port right there in the laptop
the same thing is true if you want to
plug in the USB key and people very
often want to do that so you put your
little adapter in and then you take your
USB key and you just stick it in like
this and there you go and once again if
you want to use your mouse or you want
to plug in the power cable
you've got to unplug this whole system
here now one of the really nice bonuses
however is that if you plug in an
adapter cable that goes let's say from a
USB C to a male USB port then you can
take any of those little battery packs
that everybody is sitting around to
power their phones or tablet you throw
in your bag with you and you can use
that to actually power up your laptop
and you could never do that through USB
before that's one of the nice things
that USB C can do and of course the last
big trick that USBC has is the plug goes
in like this that's
so fairly standard and then if you pull
it out and flip it over upside down it
still fits in and of course anyone who's
taken a traditional USB port and try to
plug it in and had to pull it out and
flip it over because you didn't put it
in the right way the first time and you
can hardly tell from the outside will
appreciate the fact that USB see is
completely reversible
of course this first version of the new
MacBook only has one of these ports I
bet in future generations and in other
products will see two three even more
and then you'll be able to plug
everything in and only have to worry
about having one kind of adapter I'm Dan
Ackerman and that is USB see on the new
12 inch MacBook</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
