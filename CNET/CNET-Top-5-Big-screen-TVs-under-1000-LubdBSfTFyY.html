time you're not screwing around you want
the biggest TV you can afford and you
want something good but in the Venn
diagram of TV's big good and affordable
don't cross over that often
fortunately see this David Katz Meyer
has been keeping track of the best deals
and TVs this year priced under $1,000
for measuring 50 inches and up here are
the top five options starting things off
at number five the LG 60 PA 6500 this is
a 60-inch Plasma TV that takes things
right up to that nine hundred and ninety
nine dollar price it has great style and
runs full 1080p the black levels aren't
great but you get a whole lot of TV for
the money at number four the sharp LC 52
le 640 you this guy's a 52-inch edgelet
LED LCD good 1080p picture quality with
accurate color and a matte screen that
really helps cut down on glare built-in
Wi-Fi and a remote control that has a
big red netflix button sweet but number
three gets even sweeter
it's the Vizio East 601 ia3 a 60-inch
edge lit LED LCD there's only a handful
LED TVs this size for under a grand but
the vizio includes Smart TV apps and
plenty of them you also get a remote
control with a QWERTY keyboard and you
know that Netflix button I was freaking
out over on that sharp this guy has
dedicated buttons for Netflix and Amazon
all right at number two the Samsung PN
51 II 550 this guy's a 51 inch plasma
and has the lowest price on this list at
around $850 very good 1080p picture
quality with solid black levels and
accurate color best of all you get
Samsung Smart TV platform which is the
best in the industry right now and
includes exclusive access to HBO Go and
finally the number one value in TVs over
50 inches and under a grand is the
Panasonic TCP 60 u 50 it's the only TV
on this list with a 4 star rating and
David Katz Meyer says the picture
quality is superb
a word he does not toss around casually
it's a 60-inch Plasma and here's the
catch it's dumb there are no apps no
Wi-Fi no Netflix button they didn't even
throw in 3d instead Panasonic went
old-school and put all their money into
a big stunning screen you want apps get
a Roku so there you go
five solid TVs under a grand be sure to
check out cnn.com for more TV
recommendations from David Katz Mayer

bright rooms and the best five TVs for
picture quality i'm donald bell thanks
