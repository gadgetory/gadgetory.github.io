taking a close-up look at Weill with the
latest flagship phone the p8 now one of
the first things you'll notice about
this phone is of course its design now
this has an all-metal body with these
nicely milled edges that feels very very
comfortable to hold and certainly a lot
more sturdy there's sort of always
previous phones it's only six point
eight milk is really very skinny so no
trouble at all in sliding it into those
jeans as well as this gold color it will
also come in black as well as gray and
the lightest silver color the 5.2 inch
screen has a full HD resolution now that
isn't quite as high resolution as phones
like the Samsung Galaxy s6 but it's more
than adequate for apps games and reading
texts on webpages does seem reasonably
bright and colors seem pretty good too
although we'll look at that closer in
the full review turning on the latest
Android lollipop software although
Huawei has thrown his own emotion UI
skin over the top now that changes
everything from the color scheme should
have font and even down to the app icons
one big thing that changes is there's no
app tray so all your apps are stored
across the multiple home screens around
the back of the phone is a 13 megapixel
camera and Huawei reckons that this has
been optimized to capture as much light
as possible in low-light situations so
if you do like taking photos of your
friends put their stupid faces in dingy
bars this could be the phone for you on
the front of the phone as well you'll
find an 8 megapixel camera which is
plenty of megapixels to capture it nice
and sharp selfies in general the p8
doesn't seem like a bad phone at all it
may not have the high-end specs of the
galaxy s6 but let's not forget that it
does come with a much lower price tag
this phone is due to go on sale in the
next month and will start at 500 euros
which equates to 360 pounds or 530
dollars which is a lot less than some of
those competitors
I'm Andrew Hoyle fussy net and this is
the Huawei p8</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
