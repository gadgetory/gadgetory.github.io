new plus version of audio engines a two
speaker which came out a few years ago
and got high marks from CNET
cosmetically the a2 plus looks the same
but it adds a USB digital converter so
you can plug the speaker's right into
the USB port on your computer the key
thing to note about these speakers and
audio engines step up a five-plus is
that their bookshelf style speakers
masquerading as PC or multimedia
speakers but unlike classic bookshelf
speakers these audio engine models are
powered so there's no need for a
separate receiver or amplifier and you
can use them with any audio source this
smaller model is more stylish looking
than the five series and has a sleek
glossy finish that gives the speaker a
swanky appearance it comes in the white
you see here or black beyond the USB
digital connection what's also new on
the a2 plus is the inclusion of a
variable RCA output which allows you to
connect a subwoofer and the company says
it's upgraded the speaker's connectors
improve the included accessory cables
and redesign the power supply it's
smaller now
which is good luckily the appeal of
these speakers is that you can do
without the sub for their size the two
pluses deliver good type bass and offer
excellent detail and relatively big
sound so they can't fill a room like the
larger a5 plus does since the a2 plusses
digital converter is the biggest change
from the a2 which only had analog inputs
we alternated between listening via the
a2 plusses USB input and analog RCA
connections there was some small loss of
bass detail and texture the sound from
the analog collection and the stereo
soundstage forfeited some dementia ality
so if you're using the a2 plusses with
the computer we definitely recommend
using the USB input
I wouldn't call the audio engine a 2
plus a steal at $249.99 but it seems
fairly priced the big question is
whether it's worth spending the extra
$50 for the enhancements the newer model
offers with the a2 remaining on the
market for now anyway at 1 9999 you
don't get a big bump in sound quality
when moving to the a2 plus but it does
make a small difference when you connect
the speakers via a USB I think I'd
probably spend the extra $50 on the
newer model but I tend to go
with the latest and greatest so long as
they don't have to pay too much of a
premium to do it but not everybody feels
the same way I'm David karna and that's
the audio engine a 2 plus multimedia
speaker thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
