jurors wrestle over Java and Yahoo's
pants are on fire I'm Bridget Carey and
this is your sad update Yahoo CEO Scott
Thompson is being accused of lying about
his education to give him more tech red
in order to advance his career for years
now his resume stated that he graduated
with a computer science degree from
stonehill college but he didn't he only
graduated with an accounting degree in
fact computer science wasn't even a
degree offered when he attended the
college in the 70s this discovery was
made by activist shareholder Dan Loeb
who has demanded that the board fire
Thompson by noon Monday or else he'll
take further actions Young who was
calling this an inadvertent error the
board is investigating how his education
was not properly vetted but this error
has been in his bio from back when he
was president of PayPal and this false
degree is published in yahoo's
regulatory filings the SEC could
investigate yahoo for misleading
investors Cena has learned that the FBI
is asking Internet companies to support
a law that would make it easier for the
government to wiretap websites companies
like Facebook and Google are being asked
to build backdoors into their web email
and online chat services for government
surveillance as we move away from the
telephone system to the Internet the FBI
argues it's just harder now for agents
to wiretap Americans suspected of
illegal activities so the idea is when
law enforcement gets a court order to
wiretap they can move quickly to peer
into conversations on skype apple's
facetime google hangouts even Xbox Live
this has been a law enforcement concern
for several years now but it's up to
Congress to update the law in other news
we're watching microsoft announced that
the upcoming Windows 8 operating system
will not come with media center it'll be
an extra thing you have to buy so if you
go at the store and buy a Windows 8
computer with a DVD player it won't be
able to play DVDs out of the box
needless to say Microsoft is being hit
with a lot of comments on its blog from
unhappy people google has upgraded its
new section to include bigger images
real-time coverage and it will also
highlight comments on the
news from Google+ users and a quick look
ahead to what's coming up the mobile
trade shows ctia begins Monday in New
Orleans the big news is going to be
around software and services expect to
hear more about mobile payments we
should also be hearing a verdict in the
copyright portion of the Oracle versus
Google trial seems like the jury is
having a hard time coming to a unanimous
decision it could be a mistrial that's
