call and click a button to start a video
feed the person on the other side sees
what you aim your camera at and you can
talk to them at the same time the
service is still pretty limited only
available on a handset or two and in 3G
markets like Atlanta Dallas and San
Antonio but it's one more way we're all
getting much more connection remember
when owning a real CD was kind of cool
you'd get it home rip it open and check
out the artwork inside well for some
reason that burned disk with the sharpie
writing on it just doesn't seem as
exciting that is unless you got your
blanks at five inch calm the cds and

dozen styles to choose from with cool
names like sprout bikini club and

coolest kids in town aren't hip to sweat
it out on the beach this year the bike

oh what a ride the bike is sort of like
a human powered jet ski you peddle your
way across water making waves by
impressing your friends the bikes about
seven feet long and weighs 75 pounds you
don't even need a boaters license to eat
bike but you will need some cold hard
cash the bikes go for a couple grand
finally the site you can count right 3

1129 thousands well Jeremy Harper is
counting to a million for all the web to
see on million count com he streamed
live 24 seven counting and he won't
