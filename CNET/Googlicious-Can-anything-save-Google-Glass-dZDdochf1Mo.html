Google ishes for everything google that
we can pack inside of a show now not too
much big news this week but let's get to
it and if there's one product that I've
been wondering what happened to that
it's google glass now we were expecting
some news that a full rollout would be
available by the end of this year but
the consumer launch has been pushed out
to 2015 and recent reports that Google
glass base camps are closing down have
been confirmed by the glass support team
now the base camps located in Los
Angeles San Francisco New York and
London were hubs for people to get
support or where you can try out the
device and buy one now I don't know
about you but I've noticed the
significant decline and people actually
wearing glass at least around San
Francisco I may be seen only one person
in the last six months actually wearing
it now I just don't think people are
using them as much and it's also
combination of developers not coming up
with any killer app for it even Twitter
stopped developing for glass and why
would other devs pump resources for a
user base that is extremely small with
the entry point to purchase beam $1,500
it just doesn't make sense now it's a
great piece of tech that just hasn't
found a practical use in right now its
future looks more bleak than ever now
guys n gals I could be completely wrong
so if you're a glass Explorer or
developer I'd love to hear your thoughts
on this so send me an email at Google
issues at cnet com or tweet me at brian
Tong and we'll post some of your
insights next week I'll write another
platform that still has to give us more
compelling reasons to use it our smart
watches but don't expect to get a
virtual Omega or cartier watch face
anytime soon tour freak reports that
companies like Omega Armani answer Tina
are sending cease and desist notices to
individuals and sites that are offering
digital clones of their watch faces
without permission now swatch is also
part of the group and I'm sorry no
disrespect what's wotcha you probably
need all the help you can get for people
to start caring about your brand again
I'll write a completely legal
modification for your moto 360 Motorola
is now selling versions of its
android-based watch with a slim 18
millimeter band in silver or gold the
silver band moto 360 will cost 299 with
the band and the champagne gold version
will cost 329 both looking very classy
more lollipop news verizon moto x users
are the latest to get the sweetest
flavor of Android to date and really it
is great but owners of the google play
editions for the HTC One m8 and m7 will
be delayed until further notice
confirmed by tweets from ATC's VP of
Product Marketing and an update that
everyone will love swiftkey for Android
has been updated with performance
improvements and support for 12 new
languages available as a free update
through the Play Store and now supports
81 languages total including Bengali
Punjabi and Nepali and I'm pretty
excited about that alright that's going
to do it for this week's show short and
sweet thanks so much for watching i'm
brian Tong it will see you all next time
for some more of that Google Isha's do
delicious</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
