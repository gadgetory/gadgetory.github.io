seabed here at CES 2014 in Las Vegas
giving you your very first look at the
extremely colorful Alcatel OneTouch pop
c9 now this phone I have it in red here
but it also comes in blue black white
teal and hot pink now this is a phablet
phone because it has a 5.5 inch display
it's actually a qHD resolution instead
of a 1080p resolution that you would
expect and that is 960 by 540 inside it
runs Android 4.2 jelly bean but it is
upgradable to android 4.4 kitkat
so by the time it hits markets it will
probably be on that or very close this
phone runs on a 1.2 gigahertz mediatek
quad-core processor
depending on the carrier they could
choose a VGA camera for the front or
something a little higher on the back
you could be getting either an 8
megapixel camera or a 5 megapixel camera
there is no LTE on this it is HSPA+ now
one thing that you should know about
this is that Alcatel usually likes to
price phones pretty low you're looking
at about a hundred $99 for this off
contract which is really great I'd say
it's more of a samsung galaxy mega
competitor than a Samsung Galaxy Note
competitor because of some of the specs
although it could perform really well
one thing I should also say is that I
really am dig in the design 2 of the
colors have this nice soft touch backing
and the others have a glossy finish if
you look to the side you'll also note
that this phone has dual SIM cards you
may not see that in all markets though
you can already buy the pop C 9 in China
and you can expect to see it in other
markets soon not sure if it's going to
come to the US so you'll have to just
wait and see but if you do live in
European countries and other Asian
countries then you probably will see
this phone
I'm Jessica Dahl court for CNET you can
catch all of our great CES coverage at
