excellent color accuracy if either one
then this is definitely the all-in-one
for you
Dells latest version of the XPS 27
really is a great system that I enjoyed
using and I highly recommend it if
you've got discriminating ears or eyes
but it's overkill if you're just looking
to work at home or watch cat videos and
surf the Internet the audio consists of
six visible speakers two tweeters and
four full range front drivers they're
lined up prominently under the screen
but they're also too down firing and two
passive radiators for better bass the
goal seems to be bleeding ear furniture
vibrating loudness with minimal
Distortion a broad frequency response
range and put surround sound
directionality each of which is
difficult to achieve in an all-in-one by
itself much less simultaneously but Dell
achieves and while the 27-inch touch
display isn't quite up to the standard
of the Microsoft Surface studio or the
iMac 27-inch when it comes to pixel
density it's still damn good with
excellent color range and accuracy stand
on the touch model is quite flexible as
well the design of the system is fine
but it does have some irritating aspects
the guts of the computer reside on the
display section like an iMac but for
both aesthetic and practical reasons I
prefer them in the base cables run out
from a recess in the back through an
opening in the stand to connect anything
you either have to contort your hand to
get into the recess and feel or turn the
entire PC around plus the webcam is at
the bottom of the display for a
delightful up nose view</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
