reality right as it turns out virtual
reality doesn't have to replicate the
real world in order to work it just has
to provide the right input in order to
satisfy the relevant sensors and drive
drive the correct inference to
paraphrase Morpheus some rules can be
bent others can be broken for example
many of you will get to experience the
demo of the latest iteration of the rift
Crescent Bay during f8 when you do I'm
confident that most of you will feel
like you've been teleported into a
virtual world like you're literally
there and yet when you're using Crescent
Bay you're looking at photons coming
from pixel strobed at ninety hurts
rather than photons continuously
arriving from real-world surfaces and
lights that works because the period
during which the receptive fields on the
retina accumulate photons is about 20
milliseconds and the structure of those
fields is such that they respond just as
well to the photons arriving in several
short bursts as they do to them arriving
continuously from real-world surfaces
drop the framerate to 60 Hertz however
and those same receptive fields will
start to detect flicker drop it to 10
Hertz and motion will cease to appear
smooth in fact Crescent Bay's display
system differs from the real world in
many ways but by taking advantage of the
physiology of the visual system it
nonetheless produces the desire of
signals to the brain so part of making
virtual reality work is learning how our
sensors can and can't be driven to send
the right signals to the brain the other
less obvious part is learning what it
takes to get the brain to make a desired
inference for example remember this
we were able to get the brain to infer a
face shape in the corresponding head
movement by leveraging the convexity
assumption the same sort of thing is
required in a general sense in order for
VR to work and the key to that is
agreement between multiple senses and
our internal model of reality especially
when it involves feedback loops for many
people the defining moment in the
Crescent Bay demo is finding themselves
on the edge of a long drop the response
is often to grab a nearby virtual pipe
which shows that enough unconscious
inference is kicked in to trigger the
automatic responses that mean the means
of brain believes it's someplace real
why does that happen while the scene
where neo climbs out onto a ledge
outside a building and looks down with a
thousand feet never makes anyone grab
for support the difference is that when
you move your head and Crescent Bay both
the motion your vestibular organs report
and the parallax or visual system report
match the motor signals you sent your
neck muscles and your sense of
proprioception that is your model of the
position of your body and they do so
with low enough latency so that your
brain confuse all those data points into
a coherent model of the world at the
core of this is a feedback loop you move
your head and what you see changes
correctly and with an almost
imperceptible delay allowing your brain
to maintain the same kind of model of
the virtual world as it does for the
real world which then leads smoothly to
further motion that's the fundamental
difference between movies and VR movies
provide similar images but with no
feedback loop for head motion as a
result we've perceived movies as moving
pictures on a flat surface still firmly
embedded in the real world good VR and
contrast isn't perceived as pictures at
all it replaces rather than augments the
real world vr is about driving our
perceptions the way they're built to be
driven if we can do that it should be
completely unsurprising that it enables
us to create new realities if the
technology becomes good enough vr should
theoretically be able in the limit to
create not only any experience that's
possible in the real world but any
experience that we're capable of having
