acer timeline um 541 TG now if you're
shopping back to school time what are
you looking for a very affordable laptop
and maybe something that's like an
ultrabook
the super thin laptops that are popping
up everywhere but are pretty expensive
well
this Acer Aspire is one of the most
affordable ultra ebooks for what it
packs under the hood that I've ever seen
at 779 this 14 inch laptop I kind of
call it a laptop more than an ultrabook
I'll get to that in a sec Carrie's in it
and video graphics a DVD Drive and a 500
gigabyte hard drive a standard hard
drive with a little bit of SSD cache to
make a run a tiny bit faster so what
u.s. makes that different from a regular
thin laptop not very much because you
ditch the standard SSD you add the
optical drive and you add the graphics
into this package and it feels like a
regular laptop and it's heavier it's
about 4.2 pounds but it's thinner than
most other laptops so pretty sleek for
the price a little bit heavy compared to
most ultra books like a MacBook Air and
now who is this for well it's for
anybody who wants to replace their
laptop and get all those features and
not have to give up anything because you
also have hdmi USB 3.0 SD card slot
Ethernet jack so there's no compromises
and this even includes a backlit
keyboard and Bluetooth so you got the
whole kit and kaboodle - maybe blu-ray
for under $1,800 and a performance
really nicely and it has pretty loud
speakers now don't get too excited
because the screen is not fantastic the
speaker quality maybe is not the best
I've ever seen
and the design maybe blends into the
background or you may think it's
surprisingly nice for the price but in
this configuration it really can't be
beat especially if you're looking for
anything that includes graphics like the
NVIDIA GeForce GT 640 graphics that are
in here which perform about twice the
speed of what you would get on Intel
integrated graphics so if you're a gamer
and you want to play some mainstream
games you really can on this now with
the 1366 by 768 resolution display I
wouldn't
call this a gaming laptop because you're
not gonna be able to crank up the
resolution to anything that you would
consider high-end that being said you
could always plug in an external monitor
and you know what
taking that resolution down a notch for
this larger size screen actually results
in higher frame rates and the games
looked really good such as dirt3 which i
played on this weight and size
expectation in a laptop a primer now
what are you expecting exactly when you
look at a laptop like this timeline you
well if you're comparing it to a MacBook
Air you're gonna look at this thing and
think hey that looks thick like a large
laptop but if you're looking for
something that's a full fledged laptop
you're probably gonna look at this and
say hey that's pretty sleek and cool
that's the type of thing I mean about
what you categorize this as an ultrabook
compared to a laptop maybe I'd call this
a thinner top or some sort of an
in-betweener
sort of like the Sony Vaio s now you
know considering all that it packs under
the hood I forgive it and I think it's
great there are other laptops like the
shiba satellite u45 that are about this
size that don't pack as much under the
hood and it all up and this is a deal
that's hard to turn down if you're
looking to only spend about 800 bucks
and get one of the thinnest laptops out
there it feels nice it perform nicely it
does have a few annoying pre-installed
try aware of programs that pop up in
annoy you but what Windows laptop
doesn't nowadays and hey Acer nice job
the time line um 541 TG is a pretty
sleek laptop I'm Scott Stein and that's
my look at one of the best budget ultra
books I've seen to date the Acer time
line um 541 TG</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
