Steven Beecham we made it to episode 100
of the one Apple byte extra crunchy
podcast with your host mr. Brian Tong
one honey
100 went in the right order one I have
to do an opposite way 100 welcome to the
show ladies and gentlemen boys and girls
it has been an amazingly long day we
just did four hours of live coverage of
the Apple event but guess what we got a
show love for extra crunchy extra money
this is our podcast made in an audio
format but we do stream it live to
really get you in guys and gals all to
be a part of the show we had people
amazingly enough because you show love
call in and leave your comments on our
voicemail system which is now empty
because we cleaned it the number is
1-866-376-8255 percent of what we found
out from the leaks happened in the
keynote so we're gonna kind of cover
some of the bigger things and things
that you might not have seen yet or
heard yet and I do want to talk about
when
talks about pricing with the new iPhone
X that's like now after everyone saw the
great specs they saw the screen they saw
the awesome like front-facing sensors
you know the notch whether you like it
or not that's fine though the removal of
the home button the OLED screen wireless
charging it's all there we have this new
amazing processor called the a they call
it the a11 Bionic they chose not to call
it just an A 11 but there's a lot of
technology in here specific chips in
silicon that Apple silicon silicon is a
different type of implant if you know
what I mean but silicon data that they
they put chips that they've made
specifically for this new iPhone really
important stuff so let's talk about this
first of all the pricing we know it's
starting now the 64 gig model is
starting at $9.99 okay
$9.99 and that's nine hundred ninety
nine dollars not nine gigs
that's not $9.99 yeah there's only two
capacities 64 gig and 256 that 256 model
will be 11:49 now I looked into some of
the plans and payments and I don't know
if you can walk along with us Beach
online but if you go to apple.com
and then you go to the iPhone section
there's basically and you guys can all
do this if you want to just click on the
iPhone X and then you can sorry I'm like
I've been talking so long then you can
say oh it's when a models and pricing so
what you want to do is click on that
button over there in the top corner
models and pricing and then you can go
through this flow chart of how much this
phone is going to cost I kind of want to
walk you stay up there top okay and
click that blue button sleep listening
yeah you want to hits like so Beach and
I'm gonna tell people let's just select
an AT&amp;amp;T phone at 64 gigs with a black
finish and it gives you a breakdown of
the pricing the good thing to note 64
gigs click so the good thing to note
here as you do this breakdown on pricing
if you buy the phone upfront for no you
know just on it's
own it will be $999 now if you buy it
through the AT&amp;amp;T enrollment plan is
basically you spread out the costs over
24 months if you add up that total
you're only you're actually paying nine
hundred ninety nine dollars and twelve
cents so if you for the actual product
over the life of that so that's actually
not not that bad not too bad they offer
an Apple iPhone upgrade package where
basically you lock into there every year
you can upgrade your phone the good
thing about that it will it will
definitely cost you more money but it
includes the Apple care as part of it
now now here's this great that is a good
deal now here's the catch though here's
the catch that I have to bring up for
everyone if you buy the phone standalone
or you buy it through the carrier in
installment payments where you are still
paying just $9.99 you still if you want
to and I buy Apple care on all of my
products you still have to pay for that
in the US Apple Care from what we've
seen on different carrier plans is going
to be $199 hmm in addition to that so
we're talking about really $1200 phone
before tax and now we're talking about
something closer to a $1400 phone at the
entry-level
64 gig capacity that's that's a pretty
awesome yeah that's on team so
definitely the Apple iPhone upgrade
program is the way to go but you know
you're spreading that out over a long
period of time which is fine but and
there's no interest there's no interest
on that right there's no just let me do
the calculation really quick so what
they do is they break it down by 49 91
by 24 months and it's basically you get
like a $2 discount it includes the price
of the Apple Care Protection so that's
if you go for the upgrade program so
there's nothing at least here where
you're paying extra just by spreading it
over those 24 months it is direct but I
just want to give people a realistic
look at how much this costs
so if we're talking about one let's say
you want to go large because 64 gig on a
phone like this you need a big you need
more than six they're not giving you a
128 they could they could have started
at 128 we know they could have we know
they could have but they went with 256
that's going to be a 1350 starting
before tax let me see what that it
calculates out that out two times let's
see what are we at are we at eight eight
Ness eight in the quarter or something
something like yeah seven and a half
maybe I'm just gonna put test I'm gonna
be like Generic
and I'm gonna put in eight and a quarter
I think it's actually eight and three
quarters here in California your time
out of phone that is 1461 Wow after
roughly had probably a little more after
tax if you want the iPhone X and you
want to go large so that's you know
that's a little more than ten dollars
per month yeah yeah if you spread it out
over those costs I'm just curious what
people think like how how much are they
how much are they willing to do this I
thought the phone from a standpoint of
the technology yes we've seen it in
other phones like the OLED screen
I think the facial recognition is
ridiculously advanced compared to what
we've seen from any other phone right
now it's not just iris scanning it has a
depth sensor it basically hits your face
with 30,000 dots and then as you move it
around it builds this model of your face
it can detect the difference between you
and an evil twin we just have to see how
responsive it is Apple in the demo room
only Apple handlers were using the phone
we didn't get to see how responsive it
really really is and that that might be
tweaked over time we'll see I don't they
and again one of the things that we
mentioned during the keynote is that we
brought up is they did not show us a
comparison of how much faster it is
versus touch ID right everyone wants to
know how fast it performs a lot of times
the Apple brags is twice as fast as
three times as fast when touch ID first
came out they had the next generation of
it and they said hey it's twice as fast
as previous touch ID and then it was
basically became like instantaneous
almost they didn't give us anything it's
the same speed as touch ID they never
said that so that tells me it's not and
they never said that it was faster
because a lot of times with Apple the
devil's is in
the details of what they don't tell you
yeah I mean you could I can picture Tim
Cook saying you're gonna unlock this
phone faster than ever before you know
something like that and he never he
didn't say anything like that that I
recall he did not say anything like but
we did see a lot of an emoji demos so I
mean right now it's even playing
screaming but that seemed like to be
like the big thing everyone's playing
with well that's what I find and we
touched upon this that's what I find
frustrating is that look I know they're
trying to sell this to a general
audience it reminds me of last year when
they were introduced or when they
introduced iOS 10 they focused so much
on iMessage like that it would literally
took up I think during the course of the
keynote while other features were given
maybe like I mentioned or a blurb the
iMessage demo took up something like 15
or 20 minutes I remember time in it well
here the an emojis demo took up if you
had to break up what time was spent on
what I think an emojis as a segment
probably was featured the longest out of
the entire keynote yeah felt like 35
even 30 minutes and you know this is my
this is my two cents I get it
you've got to show off these features
people are gonna be playing with them in
the stores but show us someone talk more
about the tech they talked about the you
know the different types of processors
they're using dedicated processors
specifically for face ID specifically
improvements in the GPU specific to the
portrait lighting all of these things
but they did they barely talked about
Bluetooth 5.0 fine do they think do you
think everyone knows about all the
advantage of the range and the higher
fidelity and better quality and better
throw put of Bluetooth 5.0 no but they
just put it on the check mark as a list
so that's where I feel like come on guys
like you're a tech company there's a lot
of people that want to know more about
that then they want to know about an
emojis and again I will give props
because I will use an emojis oh yeah I'm
not not gonna use them like that's
that's out of the question I'm totally
gonna use that so you do like snapchat
and like Instagram face filters all the
time is this basically the same thing
almost yeah I mean the only reason why I
don't use snapchat is because it takes
me out of enjoying normal life moments
so like exactly I'm old
cool like that I think there's a
generational there's a point where you
can either and there's some young people
that don't do it but why snapchat so
popular to everyone like documenting all
these moments over life like I can't I'm
not a person that holds my phone up to
capture everything to show people that
aren't even there I hate that yeah yeah
yeah it totally takes me out like
there's moments where snapchat I feel
like is appropriate you know fine take
take a snapchat of your food but if I'm
enjoying like this amazing so like why
do I have to share all these moments
with the world like why why can't I just
enjoy it for myself once in a while yeah
and I think that's a different
psychology I get it people want to be
Bryan's like that's how things have
evolved like oh your life is a brand
we've kind of learned that you don't
have to have an actual talent to be
famous anymore true like that's how that
psychology has changed right you can be
hot and you can be and know nothing but
if you're hot and you show yourself a
lot and tell everyone what your life is
all about because you want us to believe
that your life is the greatest thing
ever that is a different I don't call
that Fame but it's a different
definition of what Fame you used to be
like we used to literally have like
people that were talented that we'd want
to follow it's not the case anymore yeah
so that that has changed as well I'm
just going on my old man ran time not
old old but it's a different psychology
so yeah it's a new generation of people
and you know everyone they seem that
ways to be having fun with their phone
so they're trying to make something
that's fun that everyone could play with
it's like it almost it's a toy like
here's the toy features that we have now
I'm just saying we're your snapchat
followers once ish goes down and you've
got you're down in the dumps like who
are the people that are really around
you that stuff just doesn't matter man
but they're great tools they're fun I'm
gonna get off my soapbox okay
I'm gonna get on my old I'm gonna get
off my rocker chair I did find one thing
that everyone is kind of talking about
and you know we we didn't get to watch
the keynote live cuz we're kind of like
doing everything all at once but I did
see it did any of you notice there was
kind of a mess up where Craig federighi
before he did his an emojis demo there's
kind of a slip up yeah people
talking about it yeah his scream didn't
lock on the swipe and right we're
talking about all these gestures we saw
it in another instance in the demo room
when we were showing off someone demoing
that they were trying to show the
animation I'm swiping up and you're
supposed to hold your finger on the
screen to show all your apps that are
open this person was doing it three or
four times until it actually worked did
it really take them and she was like
swipe and she kept on swiping I'm like
what is she trying to do and then
finally you realize she was trying to
show all the apps that are open was that
in the demo room or during the actual
keene in the demo room and I don't see
that during the demo yeah we saw two
instances where the screen itself with
these new gestures because the home
button doesn't exist may not be as 100%
reliable as a touch ID button again
remains we've seen they can probably
tweet that but clearly it it's not the
same I mean and then when I hold this up
and I push it there's a response yeah it
comes on like what I saw her do was she
held it for a minute and she actually
like had to hold it for an extra couple
seconds and then you could see that a
register and then she was able to swipe
it up so yeah I did totally see that
when it happened so these are things
that are gonna happen I mean you've got
it you want to embrace new technology
it's gonna come with some bumps in the
road yeah yeah the other thing I'm
really curious though how the iPhone 8
and 8 plus are going to fare and all
this because I think the pricing when
you when you just start stacking it up
the pricing of the iPhone X is actually
when you put everything together it's
actually pretty high like people will be
spending actually $1000 for their iPhone
8 as well it's not just after taxes and
fees look the iPhone 8 starts the starts
at $7.99
well after listening to your breakdown
of the pricing like I'm definitely on
board with getting the the upgrade
program you know I mean like it just
seems like such a better deal you know
you are gonna have a $50 payment on top
of your monthly phone bill as well but
in the long run you're still gonna save
a few probably two or three hundred
bucks you know so I'm a fan of it now
wait wait wait how are you gonna how are
you gonna save two hundred three hundred
bucks
well if you're doing the payment plan
your pay
for 850 dollars a month plus your plus
your phone you know your 18 t bill or
whatever you have but when you're not
you're not including the Apple care
coverage you're not in clear including
all the other stuff that comes with the
more expensive phone then it is a better
deal you know well the the price but the
price there the price that are include
is is as if you bought Apple care on top
of it it's just spreading it out over 24
months oh it is yes okay I thought it
was like include oh yeah so yes you're
right it is included but the price is
adjusted to include its included here
monthly pay yeah so if you look at the
two there's like a is there what's the
difference in price like an $8
differential yeah yeah one one of those
does not include Apple care the other
one that's higher priced that is part of
the iPhone upgrade program includes
Apple care and so the cost is actually
literally just the same so you're not
saving anything okay so I'm sorry to
burst your bubble I just wanted I just
wanted to look out for you I didn't want
you to get all like dude I saved 300
bucks and you buy the thing and I'm like
no you didn't yeah I felt like it was
included so I got excited I'm like oh
yeah so the iPhone eight right it has
kind of the glass backing it has it has
a you know a new processor as well it's
not gonna have all the extensive bells
and whistles but I look at that iPhone 8
and I think that's gonna be the top
seller I think so yeah I think that is
they're still keeping the iPhone 7 in
the mix as well the iPhone 6 is still
gonna be available and the iPhone I
believe the S II started at 349 I don't
have the graph of everything that was
laid out in front of us but Apple
although you might say dude I don't want
it $1000 phone the power of the
ecosystem is gonna keep you in there and
Apple has really a phone at every price
point for every person now ranging from
300 all the way to $1000 before tax and
that's really where their brain is at
they just want to get you and keep you
which they will because of this app
called IMS it's cool which we've talked
about so we have that stuff um we're
gonna jump over to the Apple watch I
think in a weird way not a weird way but
the Apple watch was one of those
they put it first I think it has the
potential to be don't let's not over
blow this when I use this word the most
transformative device of the entire
group only because it is now giving us
an iOS device that fits on our wrist
that doesn't that has a cell connection
that has an actual data connection where
we no longer need to use our phones I
when you watch the whole presentation
the demo again you won't be able to do
nearly as much on your watch as you do
on your phone but you know weird way I
think there's gonna be moments where I
want to be connected but I don't want to
have to bring my phone around this and
it's not even just working out or being
active on the go like maybe you want to
go out for a night and you don't want to
have this like huge phone yeah or this
thing that takes you out of these
moments right so look our phone is our
camera it's most likely to be with us
but I kind of like the idea of just
taking your watch and having nothing
else and pretty much still being in a
communication with everyone you need to
be in communication with yeah definitely
like if you're just going on like some
quick errand or something even like a
jog or something real simple of a movie
or something just take your watch don't
have to worry about your phone but then
you know definitely people are gonna
miss the screen you know you're gonna
miss your large screen I'm sure a few if
if there are people who decide to go I'm
just gonna go watch you know no phone at
all I think I think there's people that
are gonna lose their you know what
because they're just you know when you
don't have your wallet I just don't have
your phone on you and you kind of make
Greek out yeah there we've we've been
accustomed to this behavior of having
them with us all the time you're gonna
freak out you're gonna freak out I'm
serious people are gonna freak out so I
like the Apple watch they start its
again I should talk about these release
dates but everyone kind of knows them so
we're just talking about the products in
general right now and not getting to the
nitty-gritty one of the questions was
how much will the data plan be for the
watch now I did some hunting around it's
still early it's literally hours after
Keena after the keynote I didn't see
anything out right but one of our
Watchers and listeners from the Apple
byte nation did say they checked in with
AT&amp;amp;T and they were told that the pricing
for a data plan at least for the Apple
watch that it would be a complimentary
piece to your phone this
again this is not official-official
because the app we haven't seen 18 t put
it out or print it out but we were told
that it would be ten dollars for one gig
of data to your Apple watch or an
additional twenty two dollars if you
wanted to do unlimited data for another
device we know that like there's people
that put multiple devices on multiple
plans and I don't know if that lines up
exactly the same like ten dollars more
per device it's not really a family plan
this is gonna be a separate device Adam
but ten dollars for one gig of data for
the watch I could dig it I'll go through
that one gig like but are you doing the
same stuff on your watch that you're
doing on your phone I don't know if I'm
gonna stream like Sirius radio or
something or you know stuff like that
then possibly streaming music would
would probably be the number one Vegas
hit on the Apple watch from from a data
standpoint 22 so 22 for the data plan
and then how does the do we we don't
know anything how the carrier like the
phone minutes and that stuff work right
yeah they did not say that I've gotta
imagine it'll just I think it'll just
link since it's linked to your same
phone number I think it'll just use the
same minutes pool that's what I'm hoping
yeah just at you know it is there's this
like number sync program that AT&amp;amp;T has
that allows you to put your number on
multiple devices t-mobile has a similar
program as well that allows that same
existing phone number to exist on other
devices and you're from what I gather
when I read it you weren't getting
charged for additional minutes that's
gonna be an extension of your phone
which is exactly what you want and then
you'll be able to have a little data on
it as well I wish the data was the data
was together with your phone plan to you
know another like $22 you gotta pay
unlimited unlimited yeah I think on this
watch I don't think you I think a one
gig I could easily be able to do on a
watch because I'm not watching videos on
it I'm not surfing the net on it
it's just met just don't send me lots of
like an emojis dude that's where it's
gonna add up all you an emoji people are
gonna make it make it difficult for me
yeah so um we have that for most of the
products that they announced other than
the iPhones a pre-order date of
September 15th will be for the Apple
watch
also be for the Apple TV 4k which we'll
talk about in a moment I believe it's
also the same for the iPhone 8 as well
and then specifically the iPhone X will
be October the 27th will be the
pre-order date that is a Friday it's
also Stan Lee Comic Con in Los Angeles
so you can see me out there too I'm on
there we're just gonna go hang out
nothing like nothing official and then
the actual launch date will be November
the 3rd for the iPhone X November 3rd so
it's a you've got a way you've got a
ways to save up that's all I'm saying
you've got time to move your finances
around and save up for that bad boy like
what are your thoughts Beach after
seeing everything I mean where's your
what where's your gut at my gut is that
the iPhone act like what are you gonna
buy how is this your gut is what you
would buy or where you at yeah I don't
think I'm gonna buy when I saw that the
se was like 249 or 340 was like ooh I'm
gonna get that for my parents or
something yeah or my sister but uh yeah
I don't I don't think I'm gonna get the
iPhone Axman I mean I am in the market
for a new phone my phones like 2 years
old I would probably be going for you
know I haven't had the 7 yet so maybe I
could go for the 7 they drop the price
on that I'd like to play with it look at
the 8 play with it maybe see if you know
see if it's like worth it how how does
it feel in my hand how fast is it
there's still a lot of stuff I need to
see before I'm gonna say I'm gonna spend
$1,000 or something right I'm just gonna
ask people that are watching and maybe
you can monitor what people are saying
on YouTube and livestream and periscope
after you saw everything is are you
willing to put down for the X because
the X you know the more I watch this
just because and come on it has the
great features but it's it's really
almost like to the true hardcore
high-end Apple enthusiast yeah you know
when you when you look at at the end of
the day around $1,400 $1,500 or whatever
it is roughly yeah or a close to $1,400
if you want to get AppleCare that that's
really the true enthusiast that loves
the Apple brand and I mean I enjoy it
and I'm honestly I'm gonna put down
cuz a I have to review and it's kind of
like there's a show I do call the Apple
byte so I'm yeah kind of like morally uh
not morally just like obligated to do it
but yeah it's it's a little eye-opener
when you add it like that here's some
reactions from our chat room expense
account that bro I wish not every not
everyone can do that
somebody says not worth it nope sticking
with Android Android in the master race
which is totally stupid iPhone X for
sure yes I might have to break my
contact again but yeah I'm buying the X
256 gigs selling my seven plus and
adding the difference that's smart I
could do that with my ass too yeah my
success I can sell that and use half the
money to buy get a lot of value on the
on eBay for your phones quite honestly
no X 8 plus yes so yeah there's a lot of
people saying they don't want the X I
don't care about it yeah here on the
skipper's I mean you've got you've got a
mixed batch of people that are all about
the X I think it's pretty mixed which is
you know there's not a predominant yes
absolutely I think obviously they've the
thing about it you have to consider is
the face ID and the technology in there
we have never seen anything like that in
a phone the actual technology that is
used for the face a I'm not talking
about the an emojis but just how it
scans your face how it sees your face I
think they were able to tell us a good
story of how it works and then you
realize wow there's a lot of different
things happening here yeah you know it's
just not it's not just I were scanning
in there's other future implications of
this is just scratching the surface of
how that technology can be used like as
the phone grows as developers get their
hands on it depending on which api's
they give people access to it's gonna
it's gonna grow I mean you know you
might be thinking about what what about
the next iPhone the next one is gonna
cost $2000 worried but I think there's
there's good make some people saying yes
no and I'm more than happy with my
android phone it'll be interesting to
see but if I had a call right now I
think the number one selling phone of
this batch based on pure units would be
the iPhone eight yeah I mean that's that
seems to be the chat room is going there
like excited about the iPhone 8 more
than the act so that's what I'm seeing
right it's just there's a point where
you're like dude I gotta eat there's a
point I gotta eat
I live like come on the scanning thing -
looks very like 1984 that's just it was
just a render to show you kind of how it
doesn't know but it's our really looks
like be like a security breach in the
future you know like our identities are
becoming more like more more than
passwords now we're like biometric like
our faces and our fingerprints and stuff
so I don't know like having your face
scanned by Apple and it's weird you know
it's all is the other thing that we
didn't really touch upon wireless
charging Apple again when we talk about
the Devils in the details look at
wireless charging is cool I think that
most people that even have wireless
charging that have had it on Android
most of them will say you don't really
charge your phone that often wirelessly
because it's not as fast as doing a
quick charge like most people like
almost not even most I'm gonna say a
majority of people almost everyone that
you talk about why I'm charging it's
like yeah it's a nice thing to have but
I don't I really don't use it that much
like maybe on your nightstand because
when you go to sleep but when you're on
the go when you're at work when you're
in your car you don't use wire that's
right the only time I'm gonna use
wireless charging was I when I go to bed
really you know unless I have like a
fuel you can have to have like one
downstairs one upstairs possibly you got
you're gonna have to have them in
different parts of your it maybe one at
the office you know so they're they're
betting on people buying more than one
of these air powers what are they called
air power pads they're power pack I mean
there's good just called air power this
is like it looks kind of like you know a
diaper depends and you can drop like
three devices on it they showed the air
pods case that you can drop on it the
Apple watch and the iPhone the other
thing that I didn't I don't maybe I
missed this completely but did they
actually bring up any new revised air
pods I didn't I never say don't think
they blazed over that we saw it on the
air power maybe someone can correct me
but they we know that there were renders
and leaked directly from Apple files of
a new air pod case yeah that had the
power status on the outside and they I
don't recall them bringing up anything
about the air pannu air pod case of
maybe that is expected to come out when
the air power pad is available as well
right so yeah but yeah I didn't see
anything they are people are saying yeah
they skipped the air pods completely so
when did they announce the air pods last
year was it they announced they
announced I met like the late September
keynote and they said that they were I
believe they said they would be
available like by the end of October and
then the end of October passed and they
said it'll be a little later and then
they made them actually available for
pre-order our to order with a six-week
waiting time like in early December yeah
cuz this keynote I don't know if it was
just me or like time was moving real
fast but it felt like Shore like maybe
they they cut that out because they were
short on time or something or you know
like they weren't sure they're gonna
have it ready on time like they did last
year so people are saying that Phil did
mention an optional wireless air pods
case oh he did okay so we we will see
the other thing that I thought that I
expected quite honestly a little more
from was the Apple there's a couple I
guess you could say disappointments the
Apple TV 4k right nice upgrade gets I
really think it's funny how Apple like
explained 4k video and HDR like it was
the first time that any of us had ever
heard of the technology because like the
first time that Apple has ever talked
about 4k mm-hm they're like TV has
evolved from black to black and white to
color to HD and now 4k I'm like okay I'm
4k for a little while now 4k okay and
then there's this new amazing technology
called HD ours like come on like we find
the the keynote is for the general
audience but I think a good amount of
people know at least 4k is better than
HD n is out there and it's not a foreign
word to them I don't know maybe I'm
wrong maybe we're so under this bubble
that I'm not sure yeah I think the last
the first time I saw 4k was at CES like
2015 or something it was before that
yeah I remember actually seeing a 4k
screen from Sony that was a 7-inch or
that they were selling for like I
believe it was $2,500 as far back I if I
had to think back it might have been
2011 2012 yeah it was it was like way
way back yeah that's when we first
started hearing 4k more like what is
that like do you need it and you have to
again to really get the benefits of it
you have to have basically like a 70
inch screen or higher and you gotta have
the 256 model of the iPhone to cuz
you're your storage is gonna fill up
real fast it's gonna fill up so the
Apple TV gets a new they did not bait
sorry
gets a new 8m processor supports 4k
video sports HDR supports both standards
of HD are 10 and Dolby vision the big
thing that we were debating beforehand
they are able to sell 4k versions of
movies for the same price as HD movies
they made that deal with the studios in
addition from what you said beach right
if you have a HD version of a movie they
will get upgraded to the 4k version
that's if it's available on iTunes
that's gonna happen so that was great
but I think the biggest disappointment
that I saw from this entire keynote I
thought that they had an opportunity
maybe to bring it up more and maybe
they're just gonna sit on it but Siri
sir you got no mention like yeah I know
it's the iPhone I know WWDC was supposed
to be a moment for Siri but Siri wasn't
a focus at WWDC either they glossed over
it with like three or four bullet points
of how was getting better they never
showed it in action they never showed it
do more things they like to tell that
it's a more natural sounding Siri which
is true in iOS 11 it sounds more natural
but it it doesn't mean anything it's not
like I'm gonna use Siri more because of
a more natural sounding voice I'm gonna
use Siri more because it actually does
more for what I need and so I thought
hey if Apple 4th TV 4k is gonna be a big
deal maybe there's some more new Siri
integration maybe there's something that
connects to the home pod the home pod
did not get a single reference at all
here there was not even uh-oh we're
getting closer to the home pod release
date it's still labeled as December
we'll see if they actually drop it by
then or not again we'll wait I'm not
gonna be like oh you guys suck you
didn't get it out but we don't know
about that yet yeah maybe maybe since
they have the new Steve Jobs theater
they're gonna do more keynotes or
something they'll have like a special
Siri keynote for it for itself or
something like that
I love this commentary sucks you
our Android users who clearly has
watched the show clearly has watched the
show no iPad news came out of this
keynote so everything stays in line with
that we did see the addition of true
tone displays the new iPhones but
nothing about everyone was asking about
promotion for the 120 Hertz refresh rate
a no promotion from what I saw
unless it's hiding in there in the
details on the iPhone screens as well so
a lot of things I think what do you what
do you what are your for you Beecham
winners losers of this keynote the
winners are
Apple Apple is the winner Bettina no I
mean the iPhone X looks cool the the the
the new cameras people photographers
videographers yeah those are the winners
of this keynote because we're gonna have
some amazing video like the 4k video and
the the Apple encoder like what is it
like they're they built their own
encoder to encode video and yeah exactly
all the word processing onboard
processing that that is gonna be the the
biggest selling point of these camera of
these phones cameras I should just call
them cameras you might as well you might
as your computers so should we go to
some of the voicemails yes alright thank
you guys we got a bunch of voicemails
after the keynote which is really cool
yeah we asked for them and we received
them yes so here we go number one this
is one I'm gonna play for us we go hey
miss Brad is Troy I a huge fan and I
just wanted to say I'm expecting him to
come out on the stage and they're just
fireworks a firework show and all that
stuff today I'm so excited I am gonna be
tuning in at noon my time because I'm in
Minnesota and I'm a huge fan so I hope
you guys were on good show today it's
been the 100th episode excited thanks
yeah there were no fireworks
unfortunately yeah we just wanna let you
know there were no fireworks yeah we
wanted to confirm that there were no
fireworks
no I mean there were fireworks like we
were excited I was room we're honestly
the bottom lies where our brains are
kind of tired from all this yes we were
like kind of brain fried did a long show
this morning but there's no excuse that
is breaking it down there's no excuse
old absorbing processing all this
information no excuse okay next call a
beach and Tom this is a boy Samara from
Atlanta just wanted to give some quick
points on what I liked and what I didn't
like
I phone next I thought it was a great
I'm sorry iPhone 10 what I would overall
I think it's a great upgrade for iPhone
users I think that it they did a good
job as far as honor and anniversary and
the 10 years of the iPhone the actually
the feature I love the most the product
I liked the most was the Apple TV 4k
which they did this upgrade arm the last
for the last generation and I love the
fact that they're updating all the HD
content to 4k for free Apple watch was
pretty much kind of man I'm happy to
have cellular I wish I would have waited
to go ahead and do the upgrade but
overall I think Apple did a good job and
that's right think that that's our boy
Jamel yeah yeah well former artist
formerly known as Chanel 2k but that's
tomorrow from Atlanta love that guy
yeah real quick when I point out people
in chat room saying that uh you know we
have longer battery life two hours tree
so that that is a very positive thing
too because our phones die real quick so
and that's part of them optimizing the
processors and the six cores that are
doing handling different tasks in the
for the a11 Bionic inside the iPhone 8
and iPhone a iphone 10 I can't it's a
next minute like example are gonna make
it X and then maybe apples gonna embrace
that event almost gonna brand it as 10
initially but yeah everyone that called
in or when you think of it do you think
of iPhone 10 no no even when OS X we
used to always call it OS X right oh it
like kind of rolls off the tongue better
than and looks like that yeah remember
what is the most recognizable identical
identifiable letter for branding its X
so when you see X you think X you don't
ten you don't think different yeah you
don't you don't see a v1 and then think
six I'm sorry no I'm just kidding
maybe that's how maybe that's the apples
metagame in this may be different iPhone
10 holy crap
okay next car let's go see a poem lovely
Nia Texas I was calling about the Kino
it was on September 12
I enjoyed the keynote I mean I'm so glad
they updated the Apple TV because I have
a fourth generation Apple TV but I'm
also aiming for Amazon video app and
that's coming when it comes to the
iPhone 10 slash I'm not gonna get it
because next year don't have a very
similar product and also Apple our
students up on the first Jim cake you
know I currently have a 2017 MacBook Pro
but the reason and then on the big 2016
1 is because Apple screwed up on and
landed the tech inside so I like to wait
until the next year until they just fed
the kid things but love this show thanks
Carlos yeah yeah he wants to get the x1
or the 11 or whatever it's gonna be
whatever whatever I told you I phoned
Osakis I want that to be the next phone
I don't even care we don't we don't have
to stick to any conventional naming
systems gonna mean to me I phoned Osakis
yeah the most interesting phone in the
world we have three left in the right
order they're a lot shorter here we go
a song this is calling calling from
Atlanta Georgia again just wanted to let
you know I'm watching the keynote and
your live show on CNET pretty good stuff
guys quick question for you I want to be
the first to ask what he thinks the
naming convention
capice for the next iPhone we got an
iPhone 10 right now
what's next all right see if you can
hear you guys talk real quick
that's okay I heard anywhere else good
stuff guys keep it up so I got this
question right after the Kino I'm like I
not like actively trying to think about
what will they name it next because
honestly they can name it whatever they
want but I think it's actually gonna be
tied as I thought about it more I think
it's gonna be tied to their vision of
rolling out this new form factor the
future of the iPhone for the next decade
which is an oled screen and it comes
down to supply in quantity they want to
have their entire line to be iPhone OLED
screens obviously but they're tied to
Samsung again one of the funniest lines
of the actual keynote was the best
screen ever like made for an iPhone
which is made by Samsung yeah that was
fun they they threw that line out there
like it's like finally a screen fit dive
on yeah like dude what are you talking
about Samsung is making your screens but
what I'm saying is that they want to get
their entire line in OLED screens I
think if they still have an issue with
getting supply of this the quality
screen and number and quantity of
screens the throughput from the
production side if they get enough and
they can make their entire line I don't
see why they would jump up to basically
make this like a 10s 11 but and but if
they have to stay back to LCD screens
still for the next generation of phone I
think that that gives them room to keep
it for the nine but anything that has an
OLED screen moving forward will be an
iPhone 10 or higher yeah right it'll
it'll it will align with that next
decade of phones so it'll be a 10 maybe
they'll do a tennis but they should do
dos equis and then they should do XXX
XXX s and they should do 4 times 5 times
WCW champion 5 X you know a triple H
trim the Luna so if they don't we'll see
it we will see we might see a 8s and a
pest plus we might until but once it's
let all those gonna be X denominations
that's that's what I think in the chat
room I'm seeing iPhone XS iPhone X Pro
iPhone bro super Retina we know we know
the nickname of this phone already the
iPhone expensive expensive X iPhone
expensive yeah okay we got two more
calls let's let's get them real quick
this one's real short uh hello I'm
Michelin from Portland Pennsylvania and
I had a question for this Patong close
the Apple bite I assume you'll bring an
apple to the event tomorrow I like his
little laugh at the end he's off how old
are you again actually people ask me
that same question so I bring it up now
I did not bring an apple to the Apple
event we had donuts hell yeah we did the
bomb donuts hell yeah okay last call
here we go what's going on be Chum and
Brian so I got a quick question for you
guys the iPhone 8 or I'm sorry the
iPhone X is it's something that's gonna
cannibalize the let's say iPhone 7s plus
or iPhone 8 plus or whatever they wanna
call it is it gonna cannibalize their
sales let me know talk to you later
I don't I don't think it's going to it
all because kind of what we talked about
earlier they want you to buy an iPhone
at any price point it doesn't matter
from 349 all the way up to 999 for a
starting price point look if you want to
get an iPhone there's an iPhone for you
at every level and that's so will it
cannibalize their sales no people just
go to a different iPhone it won't they
won't prevent them from buy if if it
prevented them from buying iPhones then
yeah sure but it's not there yeah
they're gonna buy this iPhone either way
there's like a market for each price of
iPhone I feel like you know what I mean
like yep so you're gonna get the cheaper
one if you want to cheap one you're
gonna get the most expensive one you
want the most expensive one and you know
Noah it's typically right
we saw the or at least according to some
analysts beliefs the larger screen
iPhones cannibalizing or removing sales
of the iPad Mini I think that's more of
just really the fact that
the mini has this kind of a niche spot
it was good enough they don't upgrade it
enough and tablets in general just
aren't as in high demand or turnover
nearly compared to phones but you know
with when you're saying phone a phone
it's not gonna cannibalize anything yeah
I think they're gonna be just fine yeah
and that's it man that's all she wrote
that's all she wrote guys and gals there
will be plenty of aftermath to this I do
want to tease we our brains will be
working but this next we're gonna have a
special episode and a special guest on
Friday if it all comes together if it
doesn't be Jim you can just cut this
part out okay but you're all what are
you doing
Bloomberg's mark gurmann really the
scoop machine is going to be our guest
this Friday we're gonna have a
one-on-one interview with them we're
just gonna talk about all things some
will be about the keynote some won't be
we're gonna just have a free-flow
conversation with them really
interesting intriguing person who has
been plugged into really every major
Apple rumor and story for at least the
past four or five years easily breaking
news so he'll be on our show we can't
wait to talk to them but until then
ladies and gentlemen boys and girls you
guys can call us again with your
thoughts and your feelings about this
all 1-866 to 6:38 name where you're from
get your comments and until then we will
see you all be safe take care peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
