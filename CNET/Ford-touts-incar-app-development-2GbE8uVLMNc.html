and the automobile is now open for
business with this program we have done
everything possible to make it easy to
work with app link to get started just
visit developer for calm and sign up
everything you need to know is explained
on the site from software and sample
code to agreements and licences we
encourage everyone to log on and start
thinking about the types of apps that
can bring customers valuable content
while keeping their eyes on the road and
their hands on the wheel we generally
look for apps in the categories of music
and entertainment news and information
networking location and navigation
health and wellness and personal
productivity now while we can't write
down all the rules for appropriate in
vehicle app usage there are some types
of apps we can't accept we will
instantly deny any apps that attempt to
display video content or rich imagery
when connected to the vehicle apps that
require extensive text or reading of
text on the in-vehicle display and
absent involve playing games once you
have a great idea for an app you can
take advantage of the most comprehensive
set of resources available from any
automaker the software development kits
for iPhone and Android documentation
sample code test procedures tips and
tricks blog posts an online forum and
the staff of for developers to help you
out we'll even make a technology
development kit available it's basically
a sink in a box so you can test your app
even if you don't own a Ford vehicle but
I'd be happy to sell you one over the
next few months our team will be
releasing even more tooling such as a
software Emily emulator
self-certification tools and debugging
options to get you developing even
faster
the ford developer program site is
available to all developers globally
first in english with other languages to
come if you have a great idea but you
don't want to develop your app on your
own you don't have to the ford developer
program will connect you with jake apps
are approved app development house once
you have an app built you can request
distribution rights at which point your
app will undergo rigorous testing to
ensure that it works as intended it
meets our criteria for safe driving
provided your app passes in the first
round of testing all of this can happen
at no cost to you if you need help you
can use the dev site to engage our
testing partner set a calm we know there
are a number of options out there but we
believe developers can be more
successful using the app link API more
than any other available for automobiles
why it's simple you develop on the same
high volume mobile platforms as usual
we're not asking you to learn an all-new
platform it's easy developers have
integrated the API in a matter of a few
days it's high volume and global there
are more than 1 million cars on the road
and more coming this year in markets
around the world and there's help we
have a dedicated team dedicated to help
you with questions that you may have
about the SDK and getting an app to
market in fact today we are announcing
the addition of nine new apps to our
ecosystem and they're all with us here
