reality glasses they have one display
that floats here in my eye and there's a
touchpad on the side so it's kind of
like Google glass five he's also connect
with Amazon Alexa so when you have voice
control you can tap in all sorts of
services that you would normally use to
say control things in your smart home or
around your home here at this convention
hall
apparently the connection isn't working
so we can't even test that but it's
supposed to work the display allows you
to browse a couple of games there's
Firefox on here there's a tank demo
there's some music and other controls
you're meant to pair bluetooth
headphones to this this doesn't have
audio but it does have microphones and
the idea of this is really to explore
not just the heads-up display but how
voice AI works with something like smart
glasses so I can shoot I can see it
right now it's floating right here in my
eye and it can turn around I can shoot
things while having the image float here
is exploding perfectly right in front of
you
it will square screen on this I I can I
can tap in control here and she tanks
there's also a camera on the music's
played so I can look around see what I'm
shooting in tap just like Google glass
like Google glass returns
in order to navigate you swipe in you
tab or you could use two fingers to
swipe to exit back to the main menu it's
not meant to be an immersive experience
like augmented reality and mixed reality
that you might have been seeing recently
that's similar to VR this is really a
heads-up display so it's about that big
in my eye
Amazon's opened up Alexa to work with a
lot of things wearable and even in smart
glasses so you could probably expect a
lot more things like the blade to come
in the future but this is the first one
in a pair of smart glasses that we've
seen and the blade is not going to be
cheap but it's going to be available
soon first to developers and then to
others you might want to dive in and try
using voice controls with augmented
reality in a heads up smart glass but
whatever reasons they want</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
