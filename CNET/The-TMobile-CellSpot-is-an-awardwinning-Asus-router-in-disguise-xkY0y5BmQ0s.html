personal cell spot from t-mobile but
before that take a look at this one
right here this is the
rtic CTU router from Asus
so your different don't be lying we
actually the same device that's right
the cell spot right here it actually
just a rebranded version of these Asus
router right here and that's a good
thing because this I so here is one the
best routers on the market and for more
on this one check out my other full with
you Barry now let's go back to the cell
spot at this one why hit a to do own
band Wi-Fi router on the 5 gigahertz
frequency band it can support the top
Wi-Fi speed of up to 1300 megabits per
second and on a 2.4 our band up to 600
megabits per second that's why it's
going a see 1,900 product now this is a
gigabit router with for land port on the
bike for white clients and one one port
right here for the internet connection
and also have a USB port right here etc
etc the deal about this one however is
the fact that it comes from t-mobile the
question is why
well that's something called Wi-Fi
calling it basically allows smartphone
to make call voice call and send receive
text messages using the Wi-Fi signal
instead of the cell signal as long as
the phone and the carrier support Wi-Fi
calling you can do that through any
Wi-Fi network as long as is connected to
the Internet but t-mobile say that the
cell sport here come with technology
that make the voice quality of Wi-Fi
cooling better compared to other routers
on the market and that had to be the
truth because this one here it is one of
the best Wi-Fi router now in my testing
the Wi-Fi calling work out great I
tested with this iPhone 7 right here I
mean the Samsung Galaxy s5 right here
and I was about to make call at the
place where there was no cell signal at
all take a look here I'm gonna turn on
the fly mode and then I will turn on
just Wi-Fi so the cell receiver is now
off and
and with a call to my iPhone 5s right
here there we go it works
hello and texworks - basically it looks
exactly how you use the phone normally
but in this case so you actually can use
t-mobile phone here oversea without
roaming without paying extra as long as
you use Wi-Fi calling to talk somebody
living in the u.s. or somebody who's
also use Wi-Fi pulling on t-mobile now
as part of code part I find Wi-Fi
calling to be almost the same as when I
use the phone with a regular cell signal
basically people on the receiving end
still don't know what I'm talking about
with what I call myself all the time no
miscommunication no heart filming is a
win-win and speaking win-win this router
here is one it's not because it is a
great router and also because it's free
that's right well there's a $25 deposit
but still this is an outstanding deal
well as long as you a t-mobile customer
now for more on this router here check
out my full review at cnet.com it's
basically a great deal with no catch at
all but don't expect to change the way
you sound up they're gonna work I know
because I'm dumb go and this has been
the first look at the personal cell spot
from t-mobile</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
