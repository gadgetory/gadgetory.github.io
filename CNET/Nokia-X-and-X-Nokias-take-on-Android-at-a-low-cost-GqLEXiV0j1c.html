is at last and Nokia phone powered by
Android is the nokia X but is it a
smartphone revolution or too little too
late so it's powered by Android but you
really wouldn't know it and that's
because nokia has heavily customized
this phones interface it looks a lot
like the windows phone interface that
you find on Lumia phones it's made up of
these big colorful tiles now those tiles
can be moved around and resized again
that's something borrowed from Windows
Phone and if you swipe to the right here
you get what Nokia calls your fast lane
this shows you your recently used apps
as well as notifications unlike Android
there's no dedicated app tray where you
can see all your apps so if you want to
find something specific you have to sort
of scroll up and down and that might get
a little annoying the other big question
hanging over this phone is apps now the
biggest advantage of Android is access
to the Google Play Store which has so
many apps in it but this doesn't have
that Google Play access instead you'll
have to find your apps using Nokia's App
Store or third-party app stores Nokia
tells us that if you want you can
sideload apps but that's a little
adventurous and we don't think most
people will want to bother with
something like that Android developers
will have to tweak their apps if they
want them to be available on the nokia X
and Nokia also has final say over what
appears in the App Store it remains to
be seen then whether this thing has
enough apps and whether it'll get them
quickly enough to really tend us away
from other android phones but Nokia is
aware that apps are important it's
loaded this thing with some of its own
apps and some of Microsoft's as well so
you get Nokia's here maps Microsoft
onedrive so that's the software but what
about the hardware this is a 4 inch
display it has an 800 x 480 pixel
resolution if I spin it around on the
back that's a 3 megapixel camera there's
no front-facing camera though which
might make video chat a little more
awkward it's powered by a dual-core 1
gigahertz processor now on paper that's
not a very fast ship but actually this
thing feels pretty smooth to use the
design is classic Nokia Lumia it's got
this chunky frame and it comes in loads
of different colors now as well as the X
you also have the option of buying the x
plus which is almost identical except it
has slightly more memory and it comes
with a microSD card in the box so the
software leaves us with some questions
but one thing we can't really argue with
is the price this thing goes on sale
immediately and it's only going to cost
eighty nine euros with the X plus going
on sale in a few months time and costing
99 euros what do you think of Nokia's
take on Android do you like this new
interface or do you think it should have
stuck with something a bit more familiar
