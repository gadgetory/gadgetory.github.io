spacecraft and a seven-year plan to
learn everything we possibly can about
mercury like how did our solar system
form what's the deal with Mercury's
magnetosphere and why is the first child
in the solar system always such an
overachiever I'm Claire Reilly welcome
to watch this space from the CNET
studios in Sydney this is your weekly
guide to everything on earth you need to
know about space and tonight
we're looking at Pepe Colombo the
mission that says well if we're gonna
send a mission to mercury it might as
well have a flippin sweet name Pepe
Colombo is a joint European Japanese
mission to investigate the sun's first
and no doubt favorite child
mercury think of it kind of like a
spin-off of the original Columbo TV
series but in this case the detective is
a four thousand kilogram composite
spacecraft flying towards mercury on a
mission to solve the ultimate whodunit
who done formed our solar system and how
it done happens the mission is actually
named after Italian mathematician and
engineer Giuseppe Pepe Columbo who first
explained Mercury's curious rotation
pattern it spins on its axis three times
for every two orbits around the Sun
because it is such a show-off
now nASA has been to Mercury previously
first in 1974 and then later with the
messenger spacecraft which entered the
planets orbit in 2011 how did that one
end again it ran out of fuel and crashed
down on the planet's surface
yikes but we haven't seen much of
mercury since then it's kind of like our
neighbor two doors down you know we know
it's there but we like to avoid eye
contact especially when we're taking out
our recyclables on bin nine Pepe Colombo
is a joint mission between the European
Space Agency and the Japanese aerospace
exploration agency or JAXA the ESA has
been around since 1975 but JAXA is a
relative baby in the space game it was
formed from a group of other agencies in
2003 but it's been busy since then
launching satellites and sending
spacecraft like the Hayabusa to to land
on asteroids which it's done Chiti three
times now the ESA and JAXA no doubt
looking across at NASA with its moon
landing and its 60th anniversary thought
the Americans can't have all the fun so
they joined forces for bepi Colombo
and because there's two space agencies
involved and no one wanted to fight over
the spaceship controllers back here on
earth the Pepe Colombo mission actually
includes two spacecraft ESA is mercury
planetary orbiter or NPO and Jax's
mercury magnetospheric orbiter or MMO
double your fun on the weight of the Sun
the spacecraft were launched on October
20 2018 onboard the ESA built mercury
transfer module that's a mouthful but
think of it kind of like an RV that the
two spacecraft are gonna hitch a ride on
to get to mercury JAXA brought the
snacks and ESA brought the music which
is why we can only assume that they're
going to be listening to Kraftwerk and
the final countdown is hey it's been
going through a real glam rock phase
recently probably why they want to go to
mercury together the two spacecraft will
tell us more about Mercury's geology and
craters the extreme conditions it
encounters on its elliptical orbit and
the origin of its magnetic field and how
it interacts with solar wind and then of
course there's a question of whether
mercury has a solid or liquid core or
whether it's filled with some kind of
delicious honeycomb more importantly
like any child that's never moved away
from its overbearing parents the mission
will also study how mercury evolved
being so close to its overbearing stage
mum of a star the Sun because the sun's
overwhelming embrace is so darn hot Pepe
Colombo has state-of-the-art
high-temperature coatings and insulation
the MPO also has a radiator to help
avoid overheating while the MMO will use
a special spinning technique as it
travels helping the spacecraft to stay
cool while it's twirling twirling
towards freedom and ion thrusters will
help Pepe Colombo push back against the
Sun's gravity pool because mum I need
some space but why do we care about
mercury anyway I mean it's not like
we're gonna move there like we are with
Mars right come on ESA in Jackson stop
trying to make mercury happen well no it
turns out mercury is important because
it's so done unusual it's close to the
Sun but one side of the planet is frozen
over why is it so dense and based on the
images that messenger took of wrinkles
on the planet's surface
why the hell is Mercury shrinking
experts say mercury could have
originated further out in our solar
system and that a collision with the
proto-earth or proto Venus could be what
robbed it of so much of its original
rock
so mercury is a wrinkly shrinking little
planet living too close to its parent
and it was robbed of its rock
inheritance when its two siblings got
into a fight when they were younger
I mean some may say that I'm pushing
this metaphor too hard but I think we've
nailed it Benny Colombo has a busy few
years ahead it's set to fly by Earth in
2020 before flying by venus flying by
again flying by mercury six times geez
get a move on Pepe and then finally
orbiting mercury in 2026 and after about
a year or so in orbit that's where the
bat-brella will end but not before it's
told us a whole bunch more about old
shrinky wrinkles alright that's it for
this week's episode of watch this space
will be taking a break next week but
we'll be back on November 16 and in the

it happens I'm Claire i'li for CNET
goodnight and Godspeed
Peppa Columbo new gown I'll count down
is a great song I don't know what other
songs they had but it's a good song I
say nuga this says nougat that's not a
word I'll just change it to honeycomb
Americans of pronunciation nougat which
is why we can only assume they'll be
listening to Kraftwerk and the Kraft
birth Kraftwerk I'm listening to the
craft of work</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
