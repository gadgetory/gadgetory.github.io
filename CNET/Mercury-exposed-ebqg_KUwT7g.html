NASA's Ames Research Center in
California's Silicon Valley i'm joined
by jack lissauer a planetary scientist
for nasa and we are here to talk about
NASA's ongoing mission with the
messenger to explore mercury they are
circling mercury right now as we speak
and tell chef what they're hoping to
find from this mission well two
spacecraft they've been visits to
mercury by one spacecraft back in the
1970s cold mariner 10 okay and that went
by three times but it would always
photographed mercury in the same part of
its orbit and when the same part of the
planet was left so it ended up taking
pictures of a little under half the
surface now messenger went by once in
January of this year at a photograph
some of the parts that mariner 10 saw
and a few new parts this visit season a
different side of mercury and we're
going to see a lot of parts of mercury
that have never been imaged by a sprayed
spacecraft previously what kind of
images are we expecting to see what is
the terrain like on Mercury well mercury
has a lot of craters but there have been
other geological processes the planet
seems to have shrunk over the history of
the solar system and things have fallen
down things have been pushed up as a
result of this and there are geological
features in addition to just the craters
that are saved moreover there's evidence
of previous volcanism in the long long
past and this leaves its sign on mercury
what does Mercury's significance as a
planet in our solar system well mercury
is the planet that's closest to the Sun
class
and it's the smallest of the eight major
planets it's also the planet that is has
the most dense material its may up
substantially of iron and nickel in its
core it scores a larger fraction of its
size than the core of any other planet
and we believe that what happened was
mercury was once larger and it got hit
by something and that's something
knocked off about say twenty percent of
Mercury's mass and it was lighter
material the parts that were in the
crust in the mantle now something like
that happened at a smaller scale in the
case of the earth material was knocked
off earth and some of that went into
orbit and that formed Earth's moon but
because earth is a bigger planet it
didn't lose a lot of materials mercury
lost a lot of material because it's
smaller it has less gravity and it
orbits closer to the Sun so things tend
to hit it at a faster velocity now if
there has been a real gap in exploration
of mercury between the I don't know some
20-odd years why has there been such a
gap in the exploration of mercury well
that's a good question and the reason is
mercury is actually very difficult to
get to you might think that mercury it's
closer to the Sun you just fall in well
we're going around the Sun we're not
falling in and you send a spacecraft out
it's going around the Sun like Earth and
you've got to get it going around the
Sun much less rapidly sir
and the way to do that the best way to
do that is actually slow it down a
little bit get it to have an orbit which
crosses Venus use the gravity of Venus
to bring it near mercury and that was
done back in night the 1970s with
Mariner 10 and it was done again we have
met the messenger spacecraft what kind
of spacecraft is messenger well
messenger is a small spacecraft it has
various instruments the most interesting
ones are cameras and a laser we will be
useful when messenger goes into orbit
around mercury in 2011 to get the
heights of the surface to see how the
big the mountains are how deep the
craters are when these scarfs that
formed by Mercury's contraction will get
also information on the magnetic field
of mercury that was a big surprise of
the mariner 10 mission to find that
mercury has a significant magnetic field
now it's nowhere near as much as Earth
Mercury's a much smaller planet but this
was our first indication that that core
of mercury wasn't all solid like he was
first believed but had some liquid on it
it was just recently confirmed that the
outer part of Mercury's core is liquid
and mercury is generating a magnetic
field in the same way that Earth is and
that's different from any of the other
planets in our solar system so does that
mean possible signs of life or extinct I
think mercury is a little bit too hot on
most of its surface and it also has
virtually no atmosphere but it may help
us understand how earth got its magnetic
field how r magnetic field changes with
and that has effects on life and it has
effects on life unpossible other planets
outside our solar system how common
magnetic fields like the Earth's are but
of course it sends back a stunning
photos of a planet that we don't
normally get to see much of oh yes we're
getting these first hints of what's
going on and we're also testing out the
instruments knowing how to deal with
data so when it goes into orbit they can
plan what to do when it goes into orbit
they can analyze the data more quickly
so these flybys well their primary
reason is to change messengers orbit
they have significant secondary
scientific benefits absolutely well good
to see a lesser known planet get some
love finally and we look forward to the
images that it sends back excellent I'm
looking forward with you thank you so
much NASA planetary scientist Jack
lissauer I'm seen a reporter Kara Tsuboi
