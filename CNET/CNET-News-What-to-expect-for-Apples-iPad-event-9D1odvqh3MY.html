boys and girls to industry veterans are
counting the hours to Tuesday's ipad
event in San Francisco what will and
won't we see Apple's invitation with its
tagline we still have a lot to cover
dropped one not-so-subtle hint Apple
hasn't really changed the Smart Cover in
two years it basically came out the ipad
2 so we're kind of just expecting new
colors they're not really going to go
the same distance that Microsoft is
adding things like a battery or a
keyboard or a trackpad things that make
it more of a laptop just in time for the
holidays the full-size iPad is expected
to get a makeover with slimmer sides as
for the ipad mini apple could revamp its
screen maybe a retina display which has
more pixels in it but at the same size
another possibility is that Apple will
carry over a new and popular iPhone
feature to the iPad line the big unknown
is whether it'll have the same touch ID
technology lets you sign in and bypass
your password with just your fingerprint
that's something that came out in the
iphone 5s last month and kind of has
changed the way you unlock your device's
last year brought the ipad mini could
this year bring an iPad Maxie don't
count on it there have been rumors of a
13-inch sides which would be like what
you get with laptops but I don't think
we're going to see that this year you'll
also need to play the waiting game if
you're watching out for an iWatch it's
too early to start counting down to 2014
or is it in San Francisco I'm Sumi das
