nissan titan are crap they don't sell
even three percent of what dodge ram
sales and of course rams on the
ascendancy so they say it's time to
reinvent this vehicle and they're
forking it in two directions first of
all the newest one is this the titan XD
the XD means it now has a Cummins turbo
diesel available as well as the big v8
but interestingly it's got a different
ladder frame underneath it then the
standard titan little carry on with v6
and v8 gas options now this 5 liter
Cummins turbo diesel is not the same one
that is shipped over to the folks at Ram
it's a different engine family but it's
a Cummins diesel and that's what matters
to truck folks the numbers are good 310
horsepower and of course the torque is
killer 555 pound-feet look out beyond it
there to the a's an automatic
transmission but more importantly to a
different ladder frame than you'll find
on the more garden-variety new Titan
this one's much tougher and that helps
to yield the two thousand or so pound
payload they expect and around 12,000
pounds of towing that's definitely well
beyond the half-ton truck worm heavy
duty is the key here at least 2,000
pounds of hauling and some 12,000 plus
pounds of towing this gets you into the
serious truck realm where they really
want to play with this guy Nissan will
tell you that this vehicle is aimed
solely at the serious truck outdoorsy
American rural customer the same
customer that might look a scam to the
Japanese truck in general I might add
the other interesting angle to their
strategy here is that at the same time
they're pushing diesel and heavy-duty
forward and RAM can barely make enough
of their efficient v6 pickups to satisfy
showroom appetite this guy comes out
late 2015 the XD and then in 2016 we'll
get the other basic Titan carrying on
with the same new look</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
