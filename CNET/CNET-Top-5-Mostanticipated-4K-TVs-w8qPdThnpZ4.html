with four times the pixels of today's
1080p tvs now whether you're convinced
that this is the next big thing or the
next big fad manufacturers are hedging
their bets and coming out with a wave of
4k TVs for fall now personally I don't
know enough about the technology or the
players here to know which of these
next-gen TVs to get excited about so a
scene that senior editor David Katz
Meyer should we allow five of the 4k TVs
coming out this fall that he's looking
forward to the most starting things off
at number five the seiki SE 65 you why
Oh for a 65-inch 4k TV from China's
number one domestic TV brand the price
two thousand nine hundred and
ninety-nine dollars undercutting Sony
65-inch 4k TV by two grand now is it a
great TV we have our doubts but we
haven't seen it yet it's also not the
cheapest 4k TV out there that same
company makes a 39 inch 4k TV for 699
dollars but to really see the effects of
4k that larger screen size is critical
so a 65 inch ER at three grand is a
sweet spot we'd like to see the other
guys try to match at number four the
Panasonic TCL 65w t600 on Cena's current
list of the best tvs on the market the
first four are made by panasonic he also
happened to be plasmas which this TV is
not this guy is a 65 inch led-lcd 4k TV
with a price tag of five thousand nine
hundred and ninety-nine dollars the
claim to fame here is that the TV will
come with hdmi to point out connections
right out of the box everyone else is
promising a 2 point 0 upgrade but the
details are still hazy so if you want
tomorrow's 4k resolution on with
tomorrow's HDMI standard the Panasonic
looks like the way to go that said for
the same amount you could go with number
three the sharp LC 701 d you like I said
before to really appreciate the benefits
of 4k you need a big screen and that's
what you get with the sharp this is the
first 70
inch 4k TV on the market also the first
to get THX 4k displays certification but
if you're tempted to go even bigger Sony
does have an 84 inch 4k TV on the market
for seventeen thousand dollars but I
thought 70 inches sounds pretty good to
our number two TV is one of the least
expensive 4k TVs from a major
manufacturer it's the Sony x850 a the 55
inch version is priced at 35 hundred
dollars here's a TV you might actually
buy on paper it looks a lot like the
sony w 900 series which we already love
only upgraded to 4k but one of the best
reasons to throw your 4k money at Sony
is content Sony is the only company out
there with a 4k video player that can
access numerous 4k films that you might
actually want to watch and the player
only works with Sony products so if
you're dying to see the amazing
spider-man in 4k Sony's going to be your
best bet that being said there are good
reasons to just say no to 4k aside from
the miniscule amount of available
content and the hefty price most people
just aren't going to see the difference
until you get to that 70 80 inch screen
size which are totally impractical for
most people if you want to be blown away
by a new TV technology check out the new
LED TVs these things are gorgeous but
because they're difficult to make and
it's harder to sell people on screen
contrast compared to the lure of
quadruple pixels the 4k hype is going to
drown out one of the best advancements
in the industry but before you get too
bummed out there is one last 4k
contender that I think we should all
rally around at number one the sony vpl
VW 600 es a 4k projector instead of
knocking down a wall in your living room
to fit a hundred inch 4k TV this makes a
lot more sense it's not cheap at fifteen
thousand dollars but it's still cheaper
than sony's 84 inch 4k TV and
potentially you're going to get a lot
more screen size for your dollar hdmi
2.0 out of the box which means faster
frame rates that can keep up with sony's
real flagship product this fall the
PlayStation 4
you pair the two of these up with a nice
screen some call of duty an IV drip a
bulk pack of adult diapers I'll see you
in 2014 if im not eaten by my cats so
there you go five of the most
anticipated 4k TVs we're looking forward
to playing with this fall is at cnet com
for david katz myers full list as well
as Jeffrey Morrison's bracing tale of
why 4k is mostly stupid until next time
I'm Donald Bell you can find more of me
over at top 5 cnet com at number four
the Panasonic TCL 65w to time tap</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
