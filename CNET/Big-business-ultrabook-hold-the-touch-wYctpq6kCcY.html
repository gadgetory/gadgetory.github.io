EliteBook folio 9470 M now we're an
interesting time for laptops because
especially with Windows 8 you've got a
lot of these touch convertible jobbies
all over the place do you get on board
with that or you go with the traditional
laptop well HP is laptop which debuted
at the end of last year really tries to
take the conservative approach this is a
ultra book but it's a large bone one
that's thicker than maybe you would
expect compared to a MacBook Air but
it's got a lot of security features and
ports and connections and it's meant for
businesses so it's got v pro and all
that stuff I mean it's really business
laptop and you can tell because instead
of HDMI there's DisplayPort on here and
that's one of the main port
differentiators when you talk about
business versus a consumer laptop it's
also expensive
this is 1349 for the configuration that
we reviewed that fits in with other
laptops in this category now the
ThinkPad carbon x1 now that which was
reviewed in both a touch and non touch
configuration is about that same price
range and maybe you think about
something like the thinner 13 inch
Retina Display MacBook Pro that gets you
up to an even higher level a lot of the
things that these have in common that
MacBook Pro has a full voltage processor
but these have Ultrabook level core i5
and i7 CPUs four gigs of ram in this one
and 180 gigabyte SSD you can also get a
standard hard drive in this or go the
SSD route which costs a little bit more
now one thing you'll notice that's not
on here Hey no touch that's right
there's a touch free laptop and that's
not so great if you want to deal with
effortless navigating because hey you're
free not to use touch and I admit
sometimes it feels like a bit of a
gimmick but then you better make your
trackpad really really good like MacBook
Air level good because those are great
track pads and the one that this HP
folio has is okay it's not great it's a
glass trackpad the weight interfaces
with Windows 8 software is alright but
at least the four buttons above and
below don't cramp the space much and for
those who love your little rubber nubbin
touch point thing whatever you want to
call them there's one in here
situated amid the backlit keyboard
between the G H and B keys and it works
pretty well
this is only 1366 by 768 resolution
display and it is matte but the general
image quality doesn't look all that
great especially compared to a lot of
higher resolution screens so that's a
knock against it
although the construction quality feels
great lightweight magnesium and aluminum
3.6 pounds which is kind of similar to
that ThinkPad x1 carbon but you know it
feels a little thicker and larger than
your average super thin although
probably weight wise feels like it's
right in that territory so there you go
that's a mouthful I mean I reviewed the
HP folio 13 last year and this is kind
of like the bigger brother to that at
the time I thought that was a great
ultrabook really really stood out
because of its reliability and its ports
but a lot of times gone by I mean what
this has going for it is again extra
ports Ethernet and the fact that say 7
hour battery life so there you go that's
a pretty big honking battery life on an
ultrabook
you like that maybe you want to consider
this but I would say we're in a bit of a
transitional period you might want to
wait and see comes down the pike
including the HP EliteBook revolve which
is a cool swivel screen touch one that I
looked at at CES that's a look at the HP
EliteBook folio 9470 am a business
laptop which you can use to</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
