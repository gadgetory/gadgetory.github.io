inch plasma TV anyway it's got deep
blacks to hdmi ports and y'all love it
coming in at number for the sony
ericsson xperia x1 this phone is
starting to generate iphone ish buzz in
some geeky quarters it's Sony Ericsson's
big move from symbian to windows mobile
and of course it just looks cool up to
number three vipre antivirus
anti-spyware not exactly a gadget but
lust worthy in its own security fetish
kind of way veteran security expert Joe
Wells worked for about a year to create
this new be that combines anti spyware
and antivirus into a hybrid package
faster Viper kill kill sliding in at
number 20 would you look at that Oh

gadget of all let's check in on the most
popular security software don't worry

a rather unusual most wanted this time

out the number one most wanted gadget at
cnet as determined by you is the
Nintendo Wii yep the week you know why

consoles list or something it's
evening but it keeps the little white
magic box interesting now doesn't it the
art of motion sensitive seduction a
study in we lust could make a good
thesis well that's it for this edition
