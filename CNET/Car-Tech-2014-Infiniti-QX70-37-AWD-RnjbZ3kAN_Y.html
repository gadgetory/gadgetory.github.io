crossovers from Germany this is what
they bring the qx70 in v6 and v8
variants let's drive one and check the
tech
now it used to be named @fx
either an fx37 or an fx50 based on
engine size is now all called a qx70 and
then you get a look at the fender to see
if it's a 3.7 v6 or a 5 liter v8
it's an odd mumbo-jumbo of naming but so
be it
these are two row cars in an era when
they seem to RAM a third row into
everything they do not on this one
partly because you see that rounded
pitched button the rear it doesn't lend
itself well to having much space back
there
driver people or cargo beyond that it's
unchanged outside since the 2013 FX era
except for a little change to the face
it's the infinity crossover that most
looks like a Porsche Cayenne and it's
also the only one that has a very smooth
kink at the back window corner you can
spot it that way from a mile away
the rest I'll have something more
squared off now inside our qx70 is a
whole bunch of really cool technology if
the year was 2008 its 2013 and I'm not
giving these guys a pass anymore
let's start with the navigation system
which by the way is optional and
childish I've been looking at this
fisher-price level of animation for too
many years they got to step it up on a
car that's about to price out at 60
grand as you're gonna see at the end of
our video
it is hard drive based and moves along
pretty quickly you've got separate
buttons for destination route and map
which is kind of a kind of a clear way
to break it out but I've got all kinds
of interface issues why is the biggest
button on the destination menu change
region how often do I Drive to a
different time zone versus how often do
I enter a street address so why are your
buttons apportioned that way when I go
to entering addresses or finding places
there's no connectivity here I can't
search to find like I can in BMWs and
Audi's but they instead saddle you with
this stupid looking 3d bird's eye
flyover mode where some buildings are
there and some buildings aren't this is
apparently as the post-nuclear version
of San Francisco and it does absolutely
nothing for me I'd trade that for Google
search every day you can enter your
destinations via voice command as well
navigation navigation please address
voice command is incredibly quick at
this point does
great job of understanding but it parses
everything even the number and the
street have to be said in separate
commands that's dated everything happens
here on the color LCD which you would
think is good but actually in today's
design ethic it's not I've got an LCD
here between the gauges but it's a
crunchy old monochrome as a result the
car does not handoff let's say
directions to this one while we're
keeping media on this one or whatever
other combination I'd like to do the
Germans do that nicely these guys
haven't caught up oh here's my favorite
if you want to go from AM radio to
satellite radio there are no direct
shortcuts you got to do this you have to
hit am/fm 1 FM 2 X m1 maybe you're on XM
3 you've got to go through this rotator
every time they must hate their
customers and once you do settle on the
radio band you want the RDS information
is handled horribly no matter what
station I go do I get this weird mix of
the full RDS information at the bottom
and then a truncated version that does
nothing but waste real estate up here
and worst of all the largest thing on
the whole screen is a graphic of a
portable shortwave radio couldn't you
have used that for information and not
something that doesn't make sense in the
car then there are the cameras worst
resolution you'll ever see in a car just
soft and mushy which is even worse since
there divvying up the screen into tiny
regions for the around view camera in
the evening or if it's raining this is
actually useless I had to get out of the
car a couple times to park the other
night I couldn't do it by this the rear
camera by the way is standard the around
view stuff is optional I just wish they
had some Reds to back it up
infuriatingly the base configuration of
the qx70 does not include bluetooth
streaming that's part of an option
package luckily they were less forgetful
about things like a power glass moonroof
and power liftgate
those are both their standard ok under
the hood because it says 3.7 on the
fender it says v6 under the hood 3.7
liter v6 doing 325 horsepower 267
foot-pounds of torque gets this 4,300
pound beast up to 16 about 6.3 seconds
while delivering 1724 MPG rear wheel
drive or 1622 all-wheel drive a decent
noticeable haircut
there if you get all four wheels Klein's
beyond that every one of these guys has
a 7-speed automatic transmission no
other choice is there and if you want
paddles on that tranny you got to get a
v8 oddly not available on the v6 let's
go for a ride the key to words about the
qx70 our car like that's kind of the
main goal what they accomplished here
they do it pretty well engine
responsiveness is good this is a great
v6 arguably the best in the biz on the
other hand it sounds like a coffee
grinder compared to an Audi v6 in a
competing q5 nothing wrong with the
engine but the level of isolation and
smoothness is like on a different planet
this one's course by comparison I really
miss having paddles which I often don't
think are essential but on this car I
don't like reaching down to the shifter
all the time and grabbing a gear I want
to keep my hands on the wheel and I
think the car was sporting crossover
pretensions like this should have
paddles bass you can get them on the v8
not on the v6 for some reason where's
this car really stands out certainly not
the cabin tech but in its self-driving
technology we have a lane departure
prevention tech on this vehicle and we
have a distance control technology as
well as the relatively common adaptive
cruise control so here in traffic I push
this button on the wheel and I've
enabled DCA distance control Assist and
it is just really good at reading that
traffic in front of me I do not need to
go on the brake pedal and it very
intelligently hits the brakes it doesn't
like I would do it not too late not too
soon not too hard not too little it's a
really well finessed system a little
less so is the lane departure technology
which because this car does not have a
pure electric steering mechanism it has
to use your braking to bring you a back
in from the lane drift so the brakes on
the opposite side of the drift are
engaged by the cars computer to just yo
you back in the line I say that that's
less satisfying because that's kind of a
clunky way to move a car it's better and
more elegant to use the steering rack
when you yah brake a car you're
obviously putting drag on the vehicle
which is not good for its momentum let
alone its efficiency
finally the ride quality is quite good
on this guy I don't ever feel like it's
too mushy to Tippie nor
is it to sporting that it doesn't feel
like luxury they've nailed it pretty
well right down the middle all right as
price our qx70 this 2014 starts at
pretty close to 47 thousand dollars with
destination 1450 more if you wanted an
all-wheel drive and rember you're gonna
take a haircut on the mpg premium
package gets you nav around view cameras
bluetooth streaming chin silly enough
that's a steep forty three hundred bucks
the technology package brings you almost
all the self-driving technology
2950 and if you want that you have to
take something called deluxe touring
which is a bunch of mostly seat upgrades
for another 3300 all in seen that style
you're pushing fifty nine thousand
dollars okay when you drive one here's
how you should check the tech notice the
great car like handling and wonderful
Nissan Infiniti v6 and overall the
interior quality is really quite nice on
the negatives though look at that
technology interface it's really dated
lack of paddle shifters on the v6 I have
no idea why notice those cameras they're
basically video mush and a qx70 has
limited cargo room and of course not
available even a dinky third row so you
buy one of these because you like a car
but you just barely need an SUV</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
