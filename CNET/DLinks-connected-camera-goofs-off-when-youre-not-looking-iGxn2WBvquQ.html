am taking a look at the d-link pan and
tilt day/night network camera this one
hundred and twenty dollar Wi-Fi smart
cam doesn't quite have the same
resolution as its $200 competitors like
the samsung smart cam HD pro the Dropcam
pro or the piper it also has a smaller
viewing angle but it costs significantly
less has no monthly fees and still has
plenty of competitive features so as the
name suggests that big long name there
you can remotely pan tilts left right up
down this camera to look around whatever
room it's in it will make a buzzing
sound when it moves so if you're
checking in on your family and you want
to see what they're up to expect for
them to hear that sound and be a little
bit creeped out as that buzzing sort of
follows them around still panning and
tilting somewhat unique for a DIY
security camera combine that with night
vision a built-in mic customizable
alerts for sound in motion and even a
Wi-Fi extender so you can use the camera
to extend your signal to previously dead
areas of your home and this d-link looks
pretty good especially for 120 bucks
except so the whole idea of a smart
security camera is that you want it to
give you peace of mind when you hope to
spy on your family check this thing can
do that but you also want it to watch
your home when you can't so it can let
you know when something is up the
automatic sound alerts motion alerts and
automatic recordings should do that
except in my testing they worked
sporadically at best and downright
failed a large number of times to top it
off the recordings never functioned at
all the push notifications barely so if
you're going to get Rob do you want to
make sure you have a very patient and
understanding thief
who will kindly wait until you check
your email pull up the browser window
login click on your camera confirm that
you want to launch Java and wait for the
lag to catch up then you can catch
you're very polite and accommodating
thief red-handed otherwise the dlink pen
and tilts day/night network camera
really isn't the smart cam you're
looking for if all you want is live
monitoring sure the single function just
fine but rest assured that there are
many other DIY security cameras out
there that will prove much more
competent at actually helping you secure
your home for cnet I'm Andrew gebhardt

other smart home coverage be sure to
