a look at the Lenovo ideas Center
horizon 27 no guesses for figuring out
that means this is a 27-inch computer
that kind of looks like an all-in-one
but at the same time it's also part of a
new breed that some people call mega
tablets
I call them tabletop pcs because there's
a special spring-loaded hinge in the
back and all you have to do is press
down on the top top edge of the machine
and the whole thing folds down and then
you have essentially a tabletop PC it's
kind of got a very 80s sci-fi kind of
vibe to it and that actually launches a
special Lenovo software package called
aura that acts as your tabletop
interface you can always go back to the
regular Windows 8 screen but I kind of
like this or it's got this jog wheel in
the middle and from there you can access
a whole bunch of games that are built-in
apps photos videos you can even take
individual video clips and you can start
playing them and manipulate them make
them larger and smaller and rotate them
as you go and that's sort of very
Minority Report that's sort of the
hands-on stuff everyone wants to get out
of tablets so here it is sort of written
into almost a coffee table version and
of course you can dismiss stuff that
you're playing with just by flicking
your fingers like that I actually found
it almost more interesting besides
playing games in the tabletop which is
actually a lot of fun you can play air
hockey it comes with some accessories to
go back to the Windows 8 screen and just
use this is a big tabletop PC there's a
lot of Windows 8 apps that come out
really well like this including the big
news app the big news and that actually
looks really nice like this and then
also a bunch of games that I thought
were really good like geared is a good
example and that's a nice tabletop game
or chess I think this is really custom
made for chess or even just simple
things like whether it's really fast
just have kind of weather on your coffee
table like this and you can go back and
forth through it and you can do this on
any Windows 8 tablet or a touch screen
on one but setup like this it kind of
becomes a piece of furniture more than
the computer and I think that that's a
really interesting way to look at it
you're gonna pay a little bit of a
premium over a comparable 27-inch touch
on one for this but not too much right
now this runs about 1699 for a core i5
version 1850 for a core i7 but they're
gonna come to retailers like Best Buy
very soon at lower prices $14.99 for the
core i5 $15.99 for the core i7 and for
that price you're just getting a decent
all-in-one that also has all this other
cool stuff built in I'm Dan Ackerman and
that is the Lenovo idea center horizon
