I'm gonna give you a quick little tour
of Google Music all access this is a new
unlimited subscription part of the
Google Music Service now before you
could just upload all your music onto
google music or you could buy songs and
then play them all the time with all
access this is a paid subscription that
also lets you stream and listen to music
that you don't know so it's a lot like
Pandora Spotify slacker radio so you've
got a radio feature on here and a bunch
of other things I'm going to show you on
this phone but it will also work for
Google music on your desktop now let's
get pricing out of the way its $9.99 per
month but there is a free 30-day trial
also if you get it before June 30th it
will only be $7.99 per month so that's
right about inline with Pandora
subscription service however there is no
free music subscription if you want to
use the radio features there are some
features you're going to recognize from
Google music before like listening now
the basic layout your library and of
course playlists that you've created so
going into the radio mode you can create
new stations based on artists that you
like or your favorite songs some new
things that you can do that's really
cool you can see what's coming up next
either by sliding your finger across the
screen or by pressing a button and
actually previewing what's ahead in the
queue if you don't like a song that's in
the queue you can just slide it away and
get rid of it for good there's also this
feature called Explorer there are some
recommended stations there are some
featured stations new releases there
recommendations for you based on what
you have already listened to that's
adaptive so over time it may hone itself
a little bit more to your tastes there
are on RZA's well and these are curated
by Google employees in the featured
section you can see some top albums for
example some top songs as well and in
the recommended list you might see up to
let's say 20 albums that have been
recommended for you occasionally you'll
see a little pin icon that you can tap
or click and that will keep the music
for later if you choose the option to
save the cue then this will create an
offline playlist and you can just get to
your playlist anytime you want from the
settings
you one thing I really like about the
radio app and about the Google music app
on the smartphone in general it's just
the look in the feel feels very Android
4.0 so it's got a lot of the same
familiar navigational icons and buttons
so you really get to know your way
around pretty easily Google Music all
access isn't free but if you're already
using google music and you're
considering a subscription-based service
then you might want to think about using
it so far it looks really clean and the
library seems deep I'm toxic as all core
prasena this has been your quick tour of
Google Music all access</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
