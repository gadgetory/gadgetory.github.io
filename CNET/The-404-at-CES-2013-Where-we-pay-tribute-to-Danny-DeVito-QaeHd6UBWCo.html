don't know how to work them because I
was born before 1960 66 right anybody
after 66 stay away
you seem to have figured it out pretty
well though especially with your Twitter
presence yes
while only King I really loved you know
from the time it started with computers
and everything I was like you know even
though it was like hitting me myself
over the head with a hammer I tried to
like you know do it
I really dig and I do go I have a
Twitter page is Danny DeVito that's very
unique we've heard about that Queen we
bring that up because we we got to talk
about something going on on your Twitter
profile specifically your Twitter photo
we bring that up on the screen well
first of all what happens like well then
you're a little bit technically impaired
right you don't know how to turn the
picture around but that verse oh I
shouldn't the picture with the photo
booth right on it's on the computer
right you almost look like an eye cries
yourself up I wanted people to know what
is what's the final picture no we bring
the picture back up yeah what does it
say on the card anyway I wrote something
on the card right what is it say oh it
says Twitter it's hard to read it still
it's the address to find you I can't do
you yeah Danny right though I just
wanted people to know that you know you
got to authenticate some way sure
right I and you know I didn't take time
to put a shirt on right yeah that's that
what what happened we're on I take your
work very very brief you know it's been
fun I've been doing it for a couple of
years and my first tweet ever was my
balls are on fire we've all been there
and you know ya know cuz they you know
you want to kind of break the ice so and
then I started when we did our sunny
it's always sunny in philadelphia a live
show which Charlie in the shell wrote a
show and because he wanted to get close
to the waitress we insinuated ourselves
on up you saw it yeah and we did a live
show
and in the show I played a troll yes so
we were on the road and one day I just
said you know they're right there next
to you is it is the foot so I called a
troll foot yes and I started taking
pictures yeah yeah you have to get the
boys oh yeah oh I've learned a lot about
you through the trophy's pictures - I
mean it's kind of a reflection of how
your day is going what you're up to
everyday noam chomsky i was listening to
no yeah a big fan of his and I've
there's lots of really cool pictures
some people give me flak about the
manicure because I don't care about it
but you know it's a lot of fun you fly
that flag proud I can't help but notice
that you're also wearing a pair of Crocs
right now easy access to the troll put
socks on the ideas you have to have easy
access to the foot would be a good
picture to take right so is this one
good in a while we're gonna see an
actual troll foot well it's like you
know like I say is there any way to shut
Siri up no you get her and I say to it I
say will you stop asking me questions
and she goes I'm just and she quotes how
2001 you know something it's a friend
he's a friend of hers I guess so
it's what I do basically I take we're
gonna live troll foot demo right what's
happening all right
it's not in order to do this right you
have to get up okay and you have to go
on the audience side of this bench
okay can you I don't know I mean is
there a little sterile edge for them to
stand on is over there and duck down uh
yeah because I need to take a picture of
the audience yeah because it's a careful
because why don't you go that way all
right I'll go this way
did he listen to me or what wait okay
you go over there
all right this is the way it works go
what go on go on
all right so let me see yeah this is
good this is good you see now I'm not
gonna get that flow going but you don't
mind right here we go wait all right way
now get me on the screen in the back
there you got me back no put me on the
one that's in the back there yeah that
one okay ready
nice one more one more gonna line myself
up because you know it's most important
that I'm in the shot anyway I'm glad
that you're all so interested in
technology because it's better than
being interested in the other thing
what's the other thing the thing that
hurts people what does that have these
big conventions and people go to them
and they buy things that that shoot oh
okay so this is really cool because this
is expanding your mind this is much and
you really you know a keyboard I've
never heard of a you know drive-by
keyboard no that doesn't seem to hurt
his people as much oh sorry technology
well get wild so you have any questions
we do we do Justin yes mr. DeVito a
question no no no no I'll close it but
one of my favorite movies that you were
involved with was a Gattaca my favorite
movies of all time yes
really brilliant guy and that was like
really fantastic lots of fun to do yesin
hawk and you know Jude Law and it wasn't
really it was a cool at the time when we
did the movie it was like just the
beginning of the research genome
research right yeah that was all just
you know kind of happening and yeah kind
of predicted the future of social media
and stalking people online and finding
out so much information about someone
anytime you could like now it's I guess
it's you know the whole thing about you
go to if you
to an airport you got to do all the the
craziness that we're forced to do
because of some nuts who attacked us up
now I think you can do a thing where you
go I mean it sounds big brother II but
you can do a thumb print or a some kind
of thing you go in and you talk to the
TSA and you can get a passport so you
don't have to do all that stuff huh yes
the whole bypass the whole thing I think
it's okay to do I mean like it's a lot
of people will say you know you're
getting controlled and you're you know
but look look at where we are anyway
yeah kind of used to have fun right
what what I'm most amazed by is the sort
of accessibility of filmmaking you're
very accomplished filmmaker yourself
everybody now who has a camera can be a
filmmaker yes what I mean the whole
thing is study yeah it's all like a like
Gong you know like kung fu gongs Qigong
okay like blood flow right yeah so it's
like a study so everything you do is a
study like you guys are learning how to
do this right it's really cool that
everybody can you know take a take a
crack at it you know like get their
their cameras you know the technology
we've got your you got your various ways
to edit movies or things you could take
your home movies and make them at least
like when I was a young man in in New
York I had a super 8 camera sir and I
always took you know but my father was
born in Brooklyn and I went to I belong
in Asbury Park yeah New Jersey and I
went to New York and when I got there I
I did things like to to show him where I
was I I would just shoot little snippets
of film of the you know you get that
little good cartridge send it in you get
it back then I got the little plastic
rewinds and I
but you know you tape it and you put the
put the thing then you get a projector
and when you go back for Thanksgiving or
a holiday of some kind you would show it
to the family
you put a record on you know usually
opera because he was uh you like the
Verdi and and just show him like the
city you know and he could do that it's
really a cool thing I love that don't
you think some things do you think
something is lost because when I
actually went to film school I was the
last generation that got taught to cut
on a Steinbach with the cutting splicing
famous joke you know the girl goes up
for an audition she says she wants to
sing she goes you say tomato I say
tomato you say potato I say potato and a
guy says either thank you very much miss
Levine
that's Levine wait for the punchline
okay so what were you gonna say I'm
saying you know do you think because
people don't have to go through the
trials and tribulations of the belt of
developing film anymore how do you think
that's effective wait you didn't develop
film yourself or in any way no the only
thing different basically well there's a
lot of things different but and you know
aesthetically whatever you feel when you
look at it you say oh god I look look at
you know a David Lean movie or a Kubrick
movie or or you know karasawa or
whatever early film that we've made in
this country and you go that's my speed
I really love that but you know the way
it looks but there so there's lots of
differences in terms of personal
aesthetics and stuff but in terms of
like you know doing the task you know
you still have to have a story Church is
like really important characters and the
characters have to want something right
and you can't short shrift that right so
okay so now you got it you shoot it and
you you're able to edit it you know in
your bedroom or your closet or ever
wherever you want or barefoot or naked
or whatever
you can do it yourself if you learn how
to do the you know you still a learning
process you know whether it's a
steenbeck or a Steinbeck or a or a movie
Ola right
I've made movies proud to say on a
stand-up movie Ola which was what Orson
Welles cut Citizen Kane on I mean it's
not you know it's all about it's
basically about what's inside you know
it's like the heart of it and whatever
it's there what's going on you know and
we're just moving with the flow right so
you don't want to stop the flow you can
tamper with the other stuff sure still I
mean my son just made a movie in New
York that is about young Lincoln like
Abraham Lincoln as a young boy and they
shot it they shot it on film they were
gonna shoot it in black and white but
they couldn't really find a lab anymore
except for one in like I think Detroit
somewhere where they could send the the
black and white footage do or it doesn't
do it anymore and those people don't so
so they they shot in color and they're
gonna desaturate it and make its a black
and white movie so but so you can still
make those choices if you wish but in
terms of accessibility I mean you know
get that little camera that starts
shooting you know it's cutting and
putting it together and you got Final
Cut or you got at avid or you got
whatever you use you know and you got
all the tracks a sound and you sound
effects blah blah blah you can you're
gonna have some fun yeah well you're
really embracing the digital age and we
