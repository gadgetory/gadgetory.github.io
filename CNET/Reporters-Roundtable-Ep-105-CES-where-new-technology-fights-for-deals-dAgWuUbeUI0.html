roundtable the first reporters
roundtable of 2012 and we're doing that
live from CES here on the convention
floor the giant cnet mega booth hey
listen this is a show about gadgets
about big companies sony samsung LG
toshiba showing off all their giant gash
to the refrigerators their Roomba
competitors all that stuff but there's a
whole other side to the technology
economy which is what we normally would
I normally cover back at cnet which is
entrepreneurs and startups and then
little companies that are emerging that
want to someday be the big companies in
the central hall here so what we're
talking about on this edition of
reporters roundtable with two great
guests is how the small fry the small up
and cummers companies that are actually
big now how the small guys get here get
in with the big guys to do it and my two
guests to discuss is really interesting
topic of the technology ecosystem and
how small becomes big our first on my
far left Paul Sloan in the decade at CNN
and co-worker Paul thanks for coming in
of course pleasure yes and Josh Stein
managing partner at draper fisher
jurvetson one of the coolest VCS on Sand
Hill Road Josh thanks are coming in
thank you for having me alright so let's
get started here what first of all is
there where are the startups here I mean
are they in the big hall or they
elsewhere I mean where do you see the
cool new technologies so this year at
CES for the first time they've sort of
created this startup alley that they've
called the Eureka park over at the
Venetian and there's some cool stuff
there it's a little weird to have it
separate from the whole the whole hall
and I've met a lot of great startups
that are not there and particularly said
they didn't want to be there the other
again there are there's some great ones
over there too met a lot of startup
companies that come here for the events
that are not CES the nighttime events
the parties and so clearly there's a big
presence for here from trying to meet
folks like yourself and you know trying
to meet retailers and
distributors it's just they're little
they're they're actually a little spread
around so Josh one of these he comes to
CES where do you hang out well you know
I think we obviously coming to the floor
and meet with big companies you know I
always tell people we back startups but
the big companies are the ecosystem that
which our startups are operating so if
you want to talk to the guys at you know
HP or Microsoft or didn't tell it's a
great place to meet them they're all
here you get to see the products it you
know and then of course there's as you
mentioned there's a lot of the events at
night and fun social things that come
along with CES so are there a lot of
small emerging companies here yeah you
know I think less and the booths I mean
certainly not in the central hall right
now I'm you know you'll see the
occasional one typically the ones that
are selling through a retail channel
like you know the attached like the
GoPro attached cameras things like that
smaller companies aren't trying make a
really big impression on the retail
channel you know more traditional
Silicon Valley startups I don't think
tend to have the big boost but they do
tend to be here while the folks are here
and you're here I mean we got news
indicates that you're taking our not the
only venture capitalist who in there
who's here and and what what's kind of
your mode of operation are you are you
going from booth to booth looking for
things that nobody has seen are you
taking meetings are you looking at in
the Panasonic booth to look for
opportunities for your portfolio
companies how does it work yeah little
all that I mean it's it's a really
efficient place to set up meetings with
people because people are here and you
just block it out and then with the
bigger companies what I like to do is
usually will will have them give us a
tour of their booth so they'll they'll
walk us around and show us all the new
products that are coming out did I get
it I mean when you go to a sharp booth
or something and they're they're doing
deals with Best Buy and Target Costco
and you come along and say I'm a
sandhill the Bay Area entrepreneur
representative do they know what to do
with you you know it varies yeah I it
varies i mean you know we're we're going
over to the microsoft booth later today
and they know the folks over there
really well and last year you can do
that by the way ie exactly the
longer and have apple of course you know
is the big story they're not here in and
yeah Microsoft's last year that'll be
it'll be interesting but ya know they
you know they tend to show us around
it's it's it's a useful thing I mean I
think you know a lot of our companies
want to do partnerships with bigger
companies so having those connections is
really valuable well what have you seen
from from the big companies small
company merge that you think is
interesting you know you mentioned the
camera I've seen a lot of companies
making gadgets for the iphone and making
cameras yeah one of them a robot company
called bro motive and they just this
week closed a big financing round from
tony hsieh former Zappos founder and
stanford university and dammit and
they've raised some big money there make
there's a lot of people making creative
things gadgets that find ways to work
with your smart phones and over at that
hall at the Venetian they all said they
were guys from the apple retail stores
they're looking to suck it up but you're
trying to get in the stores that's their
goal is to get the apple store they're
making things stop it stop it well
you're doing is you're encouraging even
more Apple smart iphone case
manufacturers but no cases and I told
you I tweeted the other day we're in an
iphone case bubble there's just too many
cases it's crazy josho a little word of
warning to people after who have an idea
for a genius case please don't don't do
it thank you if I get it you can take
something way to charge the iphone
without a cord right a bucket you drop
the phone in and it just charges can I
want to know if you've actually made any
deals here or if you've ever made deals
here is that mean yeah you know we've
done a lot of partnerships here in terms
of actually making investments at CES
don't I know I haven't although I had a
near miss of the company that's now
fairly well-known the company that makes
the jawbone headset scum called a lift I
remember meeting them here five six
years ago when they were just a tiny
company you know products weren't
anywhere was still courted product
instead of a bluetooth thing and it
still haunts me that we didn't manage to
find her way to making that investment
because it you know it's obviously a big
company now so that alone keeps you
coming back I'm sure yeah I mean it's
you know it's the one that got away when
it got away the ante all has the wire is
right hey I want to ask you what
particular what specifically you're
looking for but before we do that
we come back when I talk about what a VC
looks for at CES we're going to take a
quick break right now and get into that
in detail when we come back stay tuned
right we are back on reporters
roundtable Paul Sloan from cnet have you
seen any deals get done here I haven't
seen any deals get done though I've seen
some approaches or offers there's a one
company i saw that makes it's a company
called modular robotics and they make
these things called cubelets it grew out
of the project out of them a guy's PhD
thesis actually had a Carnegie Mellon
and they're these toys through these
robots sensor that have sensors and they
react and they think and you build these
blocks and play with them and honestly I
felt bad for all the booths within you
know a hundred yards if not hundreds but
whatever all the boots around them
because people were just like crowding
around this one booth playing with these
things and those guys have sort of been
in stealth mode whenever that gets
pressed they get all this traffic and
people want to buy him and they haven't
had the manufacturing there in from
Boulder and I was there the other day
talking to them and came back to chat
and say hello and he said some guy came
by and just offered him 10 million
dollar investment on the spot which they
turned down because they don't need it
but there's smart money's there's don't
money going after it so when you can see
a booth Josh that is flocked like that
does what does that mean to you does
that mean that it makes good TV or it
might make a good investment does it
does it indicate anything to you yeah I
mean you know sometimes it just means
they have great booth babes there but
yeah you know oh yeah not in this case
they went over to the car show that's a
different story go ahead no you look for
the bus you look after the heat you know
one of the things we always have to
parse out other things something that's
popular is a great place to start it's
also got to be a great business one of
the challenges for us with CES is
there's a lot of hardware businesses
generally hardware businesses haven't
been a good match for venting Apple just
takes too much money to scale not marred
legs are too
hang on a second yeah it takes too much
money you guys are sitting on piles of
cash I mean here's the problem as I see
I'm in for for venture not necessarily
angel doesn't provencher today you can
start an internet company two guys in a
garage with no hardware practically
nothing and upfront services yeah and
it's hard to figure out how to use 20
million dollars in some cases I'm not
sure I'd agree with that I think okay
it's you know what's changed with you
know things like Amazon Web Services
meaning that you know to buy a bunch of
hardware and things things like that is
you can get product market fit very
early so you can know if you have
something where the dogs rating the dog
hood scaling a company really building a
company that still takes a lot of money
I mean you know Facebook would be a
great example right look at the amount
of money that Facebook is raised and
consumed on its path to greatness it's
still less you still to hire a lot of
people the infrastructure costs you know
scale pretty significantly as you get up
there and not having to rush into
monetization is important you know there
you want to figure out what is the
application what is the product really
do before you're forced into doing
things like you know running a bunch of
banner ads but it hasn't be also gotten
cheaper to invest in hardware companies
I mean cover the park components for
hardware getting cheaper production
isn't that much I mean I it's a company
called Dropcam that's here that makes
that raised almost six million dollars
recently they make this home
surveillance camera there this other
prices are going down and down down know
that that's definitely true I mean we
you know you like just as you can rent
servers from amazon now you know
typically you're going to do your
manufacturing through a contract partner
there's still a lot of money gets tied
up in inventory right ironically the
faster the company grows the worse that
problem gets right so if you have a
really popular product heading into the
holiday seasons you know you might have
to spend 100 200 million dollars just on
parts to get the product built out there
hopefully you're going to sell it
through but you know that's that's a
pretty don't out you don't have time to
build the processes to forecast budget
get the deals for Mitt quantity yeah you
know one of the things I've always loved
about software and and you know
particularly now it's software has
become sasses if you make a mistake if
there's a bug you can fix it right then
I mean you know back in the old days
when i was at netobjects a software
company if we shipped the code into a
retail channel in a box and a CD and we
made a mess
it was really expensive to put her hatch
out there I mean there wasn't you know
now if your Salesforce you just you know
hit a button and boom and you can crash
everybody's computer old one yeah talk
let's talk about though as I said before
the back what are you looking for you
come here with representing Silicon
Valley yep and your own firm of course
well what do you look for in terms of
opportunities for from entrepreneurs add
a big show like this you know I think
one of the things I always liked with
looking at the big companies but it's
just getting a sense of what's coming
down the pipe what's possible and also
where are the big guys focusing both
because you can make money by supporting
them are also you know frankly the areas
that they're not focusing on or sort of
a white spaces in between you know I
think this year for me mobile is the
really big story I think you know I'm a
fan of the phrase post-pc mm-hmm I think
you know saying mobile is almost
becoming redundant everything is mobile
you know looking at the hardware I don't
think we would ever invest in a handset
manufacturer or in a company that
actually made the hardware from oval but
understanding the physical capabilities
of the devices is critical as we see
entrepreneurs coming in you know
pitching us on the new services because
every platform shift creates
opportunities application you talk about
white spaces that's really interesting
so it's one thing so if you see all the
TV vendors out there doing Smart TVs
obviously there's an opportunity in apps
for Smart TVs or but what are the white
spaces that you see maybe the big guys
are leaving out where there's an
opportunity for an entrepreneur come in
and put a wedge in well I'll give you a
classic one so a company that I work
with that is on a tear right now is
company called box so box is a SAS
company they make a very powerful
solution for collaborating around
content particularly in the enterprise
yeah so they're filling in a really
interesting white space in what I would
say that where Microsoft has sort of
left a gap in between SharePoint which
is an established product which they
largely sell through their channel which
they have a like most big companies it's
hard for them to radically reinvent it
without a lot of disruption for them and
one of the things that was interesting
for me today was talking to their
SkyDrive team which is their new box
Dropbox like product they've been
working on that for you they've been
working out for years I Lee came out
actually it looks okay but it's you know
it's there really aiming it at the
consumer so my eyes i sat down with the
product
manager I walk through things like okay
how do the how do the access permissions
work for sharing well it's all it's all
individually file-based that's not going
to work for an enterprise right you've
got to be able to do kind of large-scale
macro things at the folder level or at
the group level if you have a thousand
employees and you fire somebody how do
you make sure you d provision is access
to all the content you're not gonna be
able to do that in SkyDrive you know
that's useful for me to know they're
leaving this open space and box has gone
right dinner so Paul you were looking at
all companies over at Eureka park and
elsewhere around the edge of the show
the edges of the show by the way a big
conference like this or 30 100
exhibitors here it's the perimeter the
cheap boost that's where all the action
is cheap seats are the best Paul what
did you see here that you think it is a
white space or an opportunity for for
startups you know that's a good question
most of it is around mobile there are
some people out here who are you know
making apps which doesn't seem quite
like a consumer electronic show but it
is they're serving the gadget so to
speak and I suppose that's sort of what
you're talking about some interesting
plays attempts at new things with
augmented reality that seems to be a big
one there's a few of meant a reality
company that here was a real interesting
one I saw called Blippar that seems to
be this from the UK and trying to make a
presence in the US I don't know whether
this stuff will get beyond just
marketing or whether it will have some
meaningful curtain now there was a
company just to go off on that AR
augmented reality's is it interesting I
mean I did a demo from one of those
events of this giant helmet it's an
Android it's an android computer in a
helmet with that blocks your vision with
lenses looking at so you can overlay the
real world on the AR or vice versa
anyway see we're not going to invest in
that but you are wise but there's
another company here I can't remember
the name view something other that they
have a one on a monocle on a glasses
frame now that projects an image so you
can get the heads up display which isn't
necessarily augmented reality but it
could be is that of interest to you just
at a curiosity yeah you know when it's
tration that is absolutely i don't think
lots of people are gonna be wearing
monocles anytime soon but i think the
what we often see is they could come
back yes i was going to say you know i'm
gonna go on the loose take your
particular surprise
chuckles are not going to be in next
year but you know what we often see is
the first person who has an idea doesn't
get it quite right but it's still the
ideas right right and so what's going to
happen is in a year or two people are
gonna make to us on it and somebody's
going to find the way to make it work in
a way that really works for people you
know you and I met back in nineteen
ninety nine I was building mobile
shopping apps right back on lap phone
you were you were dead on right yeah
teenager I was talking with one of my
comforter I said hey we were you know we
were early wrong as opposed to just
wrong wrong right yeah which is some
consolation but but you see that a lot
where you know the idea has merit and
just we filed out in the back of her
head hey guys let's talk about one of
the alternate way that was there you
know in this bubble of entrepreneurship
but in the early bubble the first bubble
which I covered in 98 99 it was venture
capitalist which was a fair amount of
money now in this bubble we're seeing a
lot of angel fund their angel investors
those are smaller amounts of money yeah
and then there's this new model which is
emerging that one sees some really
interesting products come out of there
including swivel which you covered which
is kickstarter which is the crowd funded
startup quick starter quick kickstarter
indiegogo and other models like that
what do you think of those Paul and Josh
I find it interesting that you're just
using bubble as an accepted its state
that we're in it's the way the world
works there's a boom in a crash and a
boom in a crash wait I don't know but
that's a whole other shell at me there's
bubble bubble let's yes I don't know
that but um look at you know all these
gadgets I've seen that I've mentioned
coming from the phones these uh one
company that made the lens you clip on 4
may turn your foot your phone camera
into wide-angle and go two months all
those things started on Kickstarter you
know they can't get money from you guys
you look at it and say we don't want to
invest in hardware they generally can't
get Melanie from angels they say we
don't want to invest in hardware so they
go to Kickstarter they throw it up there
just just like the modular robots I was
talking about that that raised a lot of
money this week you know they raised I
think it was 150 $20,000 on Kickstarter
those people paid essentially for their
prototype their so-called Minimum Viable
Product they took that and you know six
months later raised a ton of money yeah
so you know I think that's really a
really amazing thing Josh how does that
fit into your ecosystem I think it's
great so you know again I think the most
important thing is knowing do you have
something that
want to buy right and the sooner you can
get to there the better and i think you
know we're seeing more and more
companies that are coming in and they
already have customers they already have
users and they haven't raised any
venture capital you know 10 years ago
you'd raise five ten million dollars for
a software company make sure you you had
product market fit now you can you that
for five or ten thousand dollars I mean
one of the problems in the first bubble
was I did it was that people people
invested in things before they knew if
there was any traction yeah absolutely i
mean by just threw money at it would be
hope and now it's like that's one thing
you want to see you want to see traction
you want to see customers better yet
paying customers and you want you know
and you can prove that pretty quickly
now when your burns low you're so nimble
when you're 3 you know I I tantra knows
all this time don't be in such a rush to
you know expand and get big it's like
you're so you don't really sound in blue
arm you have 34 people you can pivot
strategy on a dime once the burn rate
starts ticking up your burning you know
half a million dollars a month you 50
employees it's actually really hard to
turn the ship at that point if you if
you realize you're pointing the wrong
direction so if you can get the more
data you can get saying we're pointed
the right director before you hit the
gas the better so what other
opportunities we talked about mobile
obviously is a big app economy there
there's an accessory economy what other
opportunities you see here that yeah i
mean i think the you know the the twin
sister to mobile is cloud right and
services that go with the cloud and i
think that you know one is enabling the
other i think you know going speaking
about hardware i would say you know we
never say never in terms of a category
but hardware that's attached to a
service is very interesting right
because then i just look at the hardware
as maybe it's a cost of acquisition or
it's just a one-time thing but that
recurring nature if you're attached to a
high-margin recurring service then i'm
very interested I think the mobile
industry yeah I think that's exactly
right i mean in all the subscription
economy it also doesn't have the problem
you described before if you get the
hardware pretty much right you know you
can keep updating the firmware yeah
totally exactly but I and I just think
that you know that recurring connection
I had a great talk with you know one of
the some of the folks over at Samsung
you know this is a real shift for those
guys this idea that the relationship
with the customer goes beyond the sale
right you know I was sort of tearing
them a new one for how they've handled
android on there
what's you know it's it's they've gotten
better at it but you know the new
version of Android come out and it
wasn't it wasn't always the case that
you could upgrade your device I mean
that's just oh don't start with me I had
sitting right where you are I had people
from Samsung yeah we were looking at the
the Galaxy Nexus which I have the note
which is the next guys up and then the
one after that is 5.5 or so I don't know
whatever of and they were all running
different versions of Android it's crazy
side note here but whatever I think they
had a legend on that now I think they
big guys have fun I didn't pass up
Tuesday but there's a little cloud
confusion too right yeah i mean everyone
is offering their own cloud service and
sort of has this apple type end up
wanting to own the whole chain you know
and it's just like I think the consumers
are going to get totally confused about
which service to use and why you know
that brings up a really interesting
point what is the for the entrepreneur
somebody trying to break into the c/e
economy what is the impact of Apple at a
place like this that is important for
them to be aware of gosh I mean I think
you know Apple really is driving mobile
in my mind I think android obviously is
driving a lot of the mass penetration
but from an innovation standpoint I
think apples driving a ton of it I think
you've got to be aware of what Apple's
doing they control their ecosystem very
tightly which is why it works so well
for the end users but you know we've
seen them pivot and you know it can it
can change models pretty quickly um you
know I I think you have to try and
maneuver around those guys but if you
can work within Apple I mean I'll take a
mobile gaming for example we have a
mobile gaming company that has grown
faster than almost any other company
I've seen this is a company that
generated millions and millions of
dollars in net income in its first year
which is not typical in the software
roller and startup plan you know if you
can these mobile games you can build
them quickly Apple's got all the
monetization built in there and it's
just amazing the company's you can build
mmm I mean can you imagine what this
whole show would look like if Apple
hadn't done what it's done in the last
few years yeah I mean all the ultrabooks
would be plastic and look like right all
the macbook ripoffs which right now
around this beats you all half the
phones would have keyboards on all those
cases wouldn't be here right because
there wouldn't be with the almond if
anything yeah and that's
in a lot of these companies just
wouldn't exist yeah so listen finally a
recommendation if you're going to come
to the show if you're an entrepreneur
you've got a three or four ten person
company you've got a product trying to
get traction how do you best use CES
Paul you want to go first from the from
our perspective the journalism
perspective and then from the funding
the venture prescriptive look most a lot
of the companies that come here wait
right they don't even have much new to
sit to bring but they didn't bring one
little thing new because they know
there's an army of us out here is ready
to coverage cover it so it's a total
marketing you know boom for them they
should just have their messaging clear
and straight and try to make it exciting
and try to show where they fit in I mean
I I walked by half these boots and I
look at them and I don't even know what
they do I mean that's just like basic
101 just you know yeah but you know the
good ones do the good ones get attention
and the good ones make good
relationships here yeah Josh and to take
advantage of the fact that you and your
compatriots are here I'd say the big
thing is plan ahead you know the biggest
mistake I see people Mike is just kind
of coming to the show and winging it
I've you know planned my whole schedule
ahead of time but a lotta but i also
have a lot of open holes for people that
email me and say hey can we get together
so i would say you know figure out who
you wanted me plan ahead set up meetings
and the other thing is you can you know
host events I think one of the best ways
if you want to get a bunch of dc's or
corporate partners set up a dinner you
know and invite people yeah the parties
are where it happens that's where the
holidays happens is a human that you
greatly what did I hear once that the
medium of greatest bandwidth is the
dinner table in and its end afterwards
and yeah and the drinks and we're going
to leave with that Paul Sloan is exec
yet at cnet Josh Stein is a partner over
at draper fisher jurvetson that is it
for reporters roundtable for this show
will be back next week at back in San
Francisco stay tuned for buzz out loud
at eleven o'clock pacific if you're
watching this live and then we've got to
show every hour on the hour here from
