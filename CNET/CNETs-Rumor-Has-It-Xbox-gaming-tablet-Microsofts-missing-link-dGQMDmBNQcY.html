leaving welcome to rumor has it the show
where we round up the week's biggest
tech rumor and then we vote on what
sounds legit and what seems like it
won't ever happen and remember that you
guys can vote on all the rumors with us
keep your eyes peeled for the pole in
the interactive player if you're
watching on cnet you're actually burying
the lede Emily the most important part
about today's show we'll come at the end
a special humiliation surprise first up
HTC is said to be working on a facebook
phone according to pocket-lint citing a
source close to it I quote I refuse to
tell you anything more about this rumor
because we've heard it a million times
Emily don't be a baby just give us the
gist no I will not dignify it okay fine
the gist is that it's an official
Facebook phone it's running Android it
has a Qualcomm chip it's codenamed up
you know what never mind I don't even
want to bother next up the internet was
in a panic this week when the Guardian
reported that Apple would not approve
google maps for iOS The Guardian found
the Google employees were quote not
optimistic but just as quickly as the
rumor gained momentum SI units Casey
Newton slowed it down reminding us that
every developer who has ever published
anything to the App Store as worried
that it wouldn't get approved Apple is
notorious for changing its rules all the
time yeah and remember that in his
apology letter Apple CEO Tim Cook said
that people should use alternatives
Apple maps he actually begged them to
which is why this rumor is probably bunk
yes Apple is trying to distance itself
from google that's how we got into this
mess in the first place but we think
that it learned that was a bad idea
regarding maps our next rumor comes from
android police citing an anonymous
tipster Google Wallet may get a physical
card for you to put in your actual
wallet Google Wallet is the NFC enabled
Pay system that exists on some Android
devices this card however would be
designed to be used when NFC isn't
available as a sort of credit card so
NFC exists to replace your credit card
and this google card would exist to
replace NFC because no one accepts it
it's like a chicken-and-egg conundrum
finally according to a report from the
verge microsoft is
working on an xbox surface tablet citing
unnamed sources of course the report
says that the tablet will have a 7-inch
display and will reportedly run on its
own version of Windows OS I am freaking
out right now because this is so awesome
oh my gosh she's crazy for Xbox the
rumor of a gaming tablet isn't new back
in June documents leaked that Microsoft
might be working on a tablet gaming
device to work with a streaming base
station kind of like Nintendo's Wii U so
this would make sense if it were a
tablet that accompanied the next
iteration of the Xbox like the 720 or
whatever it'll be called so you could
start your gaming at home and then take
it to go like you can do with the ps3
and the Vita if this rumor proves true
but it isn't just a tablet and has
actual controls I will die of happiness
and i will leave the device to you in my
will and we will have to cancel rumor
has it so that you can become a gamer
full-time so what do you guys think is
Microsoft working on a tablet like
gaming device don't forget to vote we're
gonna ask the cnet council what they
think the cnet council is composed of
five editors who cast their votes
anonymously their opinions are not an
endorsement by cnet or CBS Interactive
obviously because these are rumors folks
and the cnet verdict is yes Microsoft is
working on an xbox surface gaming tablet
according to our editors three editors
said yes one editor said no and another
one said oh good that's pretty much our
show everybody please share your rumours
that rumor has it at cnet com or call us
at 1 800 750 Cena and tweet us and tune
in next week for more tech rumors
no strangers to
you know the rules and son
Oh
installer
gonna make you understand
Oh
I</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
