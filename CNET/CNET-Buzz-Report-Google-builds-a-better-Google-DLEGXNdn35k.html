buzz report the show about the tech news
that everybody's talking about this week
it's a google double latte astronomical
mtg's and yeah twitter but first it's
the gadget of the week the gadget of the
week is the logitech harmony 900 which
are normally reserved New York reviews
team called the best universal remote
control we've ever tested yeah what that
means is that it's easy to set up it
looks pretty and it actually works with
all your home theater components no
matter how many you have and it doesn't
like fail to turn on the TV when it
turns on everything else and it can do
this because it now includes RF yeah and
it's awesome and I love the part of my
job is to get this excited about a
remote control fired up and I don't mean
to be a buzzkill but it does cost four
hundred dollars just a little side note
we love it though google is testing out
a new version of google they're calling
it google caffeine and they invited
people to try out its next-generation
infrastructure on a special sandboxed
page now I tried it and I found that the
search results weren't significantly
different from regular Google so
congratulations Google you're already
perfect sorry Bing in other news GM
announced this week that its electric
car the 2011 Chevy Volt could get an epa
fuel efficiency rating of 230 miles per
gallon and then Nissan immediately came
out with the trash talking saying that
its electric vehicle the leaf will
actually get 367 miles per gallon and
you are pathetic chevy volt and you
should be ashamed for trying to kill the
environment like that see but because i
personally think that since my car it's
25 miles per gallon that once you're up
to like 200 miles per gallon it's a
slightly academic argument and i will
take one of each and now here's the
latest on the ill-fated large hadron
collider plagued by helium leaks the LHC
is now set to restart in november but at
only half the and
it was designed for or as the Silicon
Valley com blog cleverly put it it'll
restart as the mid-size Hadron Collider
and at this rate by 2010 or so it'll be
the extremely sorry forget we were ever
here never mind about us just a big hole
in the ground really Hadron Collider
poor thing at least it's probably not
going to kill us all and now for the big
buzz of the week non stop freaking
twitter news twitter seems to be on some
sort of rampage of popularity and pop
coverage this week it was all about how
the wife of twitter co-founder evan
williams was twittering her child birth
and the uk's Royal Opera House has
pledged to perform an opera that will be
written entirely by Twitter users Oh God
and also government documents show that
the military is monitoring Twitter to
see how people react to high-profile
events and to try to engage in damage
control where necessary and of course
the world was struggling to recover from
last week's Twitter outage which appears
to have been a malicious attack launched
by some people in Russia trying to take
down a single Georgian blogger who was
stirring up political tensions on
twitter and facebook and our relief was
short-lived as more attacks hit the
service on tuesday so I'm wondering is
twitter just too big of a deal right do
we all just need to take a break yes yes
it is but it's okay friendster myspace
Facebook Google blogs YouTube news
groups and the World Wide Web have also
all been at some point too big of a deal
all this has happened before and will
happen again and that's the buzz report
for this week everyone I'm Mollywood and
thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
