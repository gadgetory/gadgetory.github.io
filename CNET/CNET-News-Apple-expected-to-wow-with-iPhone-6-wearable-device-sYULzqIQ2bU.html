grows so too does speculation judging by
Apple's fairly predictable product cycle
a new iPhone 6 is a pretty sure bet
there could be two iphone 6s there's
probably going to be a 4.7 inch screen
there also could be a 5.5 inch phablet a
device that's equal parts phone and
tablet would place apple squarely in
samsung territory the new phones may
also offer near field communication or
NFC a technology that paves the way for
mobile payments but could raise flags in
the wake of the recent iCloud hack
you're not going to use your phone to
buy anything if you don't think your
data is secure the event will be held
near apple's headquarters at the flint
center in cupertino where Apple's been
busy building an adjacent structure the
venue also holds sentimental value it's
where Steve Jobs introduced the original
mac in 1984 could that mean a new device
will be born the odds are pretty good
that we're gonna see a wearable at the
show if Apple does trot out an iWatch
it'll need to play catch-up with brands
like samsung and motorola while the
company has performed well in recent
years some say the once shiny Apple has
lost its luster stay up-to-date on apple
