Google home smart speaker let me show
you how to make the most of your new
purchase let's start with a refresher on
the basics the Google home Google home
mini and Google home Mac's are all what
are called smart speakers that means
they respond to your voice commands so
yes they're technically always listening
to you but they'll only actually record
and respond to what you say after you
get their attention using the wake words
those are hey Google or okay Google if
you don't feel like talking or there's a
lot of background noise you can touch
any of Google's smart speakers to
perform some basic functions all of them
have a physical mute button which turns
off the microphone they each have
physical volume controls you can play or
pause music with a tap plus you can wake
up the original Google home with a touch
instead of the wake words still you'll
need to use your voice for most of
Google homes functions all the Google
home speakers make use of a digital
assistant plainly called Google
assistant and it's more than just a
pleasant voice it can actually be your
personal DJ chances are you can just ask
Google to play your favorite song and
it'll agree and start playing if not you
might need to subscribe to one of
Google's compatible music services right
now you can pick from Google Play Music
YouTube music Spotify or Pandora you can
select any of those services as your
default so that when you search for a
song Google will look there first your
Google home also has Bluetooth built in
so if the sound quality isn't up to
snuff you can tell your Google home to
play a song and it can then cast the
song to another better speaker over
Bluetooth you can even set that other
speaker as your default for music
playback so it'll automatically start
playing songs there you can cast music
to your TV too as Google home can also
sync up with other devices through
chromecast streamers if you don't know
the name of the song you want to listen
to you can actually search by lyrics and
Google will help you out or if you're
not looking for something specific you
can just ask for a playlist of a type of
music you can even create groups of
speakers and have google play the same
song and all of them at once to get your
whole house party so Google homes pretty
good for playing your music it's even
better as a personalized
using the Google home app you can train
it to recognize up to six different
voices then sync it with Google Calendar
or Google Maps and you can ask it what's
on your schedule what's traffic like on
your way to work if someone else asks
the same question they'll get a
different tailored response better yet
because it knows your voice you can use
your Google home to shop and it'll
verify your purchase simply by
recognizing your voice you'll want to be
careful with this functionality though
we found we were able to fool it's voice
recognition feature you can also use
your Google home to ask for step by step
recipe assistance you can make calls you
can issue multiple commands at once you
can even broadcast a message to other
Google homes in your house so you can
let the kids know it's time for dinner
without needing to shout with a feature
called routines you can customize your
assistance even further say something
like good morning or I'm leaving and you
can have Google tell you about your
commute play the news or even turn on
the lights and lock the doors in fact
you can use Google home to control quite
a few different smart home gadgets both
through routines and through direct
commands right now Google works with
thermostats smart lights smart switches
smart locks even some cars sprinklers
security systems and large appliances
you obviously don't need to take
advantage of everything your Google home
can do but dive into an area that
interests you and you'll find your new
smart speaker can do a lot more than
just tell jokes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
