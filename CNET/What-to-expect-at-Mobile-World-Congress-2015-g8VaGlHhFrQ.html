Sumi das joining me is senior editor for
cnet Jessica dole court Jessica thanks
for being with us always okay so very
green with envy here literally wearing
green because you have some exciting
travel plans coming up you're going to
mobile world congress in barcelona
you've been to the show a number of
times you've noted the themes over the
years tell us what are the big themes
and trends for 2015 that we expect to
see well we're still going to see
smartphones they are important to the
show but we're also going to see a lot
of wearables just out the wazoo
everybody's gonna have one not much of a
surprise there was there pretty much big
at every major tech show they are
they're getting bigger the companies
that haven't had a wearable look to them
to release their first one might be a
fitness band might be a full-fledged
watch if they've come out with them
before look for more of them okay this
is really gonna be big in addition to
and are they shifting in any way are
they getting smaller is it is are there
have you noticed any unique sort of like
yeah it's interesting um we adherent
cnet have guessed that they're all sort
of be two tiers of smartwatches be
really techy smart smart watches that
are all completely digital yeah and then
once that look more like at everyday
fashion watch but that have very subtle
smarts so not quite dumb watches not
quite smart but somewhere in between
maybe there's a peel to a broader
audience right yeah and definitely more
with an eye on fashion especially with
people who don't like big watches or who
like apostles getting into this game
right exactly so there are a lot of
opportunities here and I think we're
gonna see a lot of these at the show
we're not gonna see as many tablets this
is kind of shrinking and declining a
little bit at CES we didn't see many and
I think we'll see some but it really
won't be an emphasis okay let's talk
about specific products that we think
are going to be unveiled because we we
have pretty good idea at this point
right now this is going to be a big show
for samsung just like last year we
expect that Samsung's going to unveil
the galaxy s6 in two variants the
regular rectangular one and then also
one with a curved edge reminiscent or
very closely related in fact to the
Galaxy Note edge that we saw a paired
with the note 4 okay I'm in September
it's going to be sort of like the
regular one is the mass market device
that probably everyone will get this is
a flagship phone for them and then the
curved one will be sort of niche at
least that's how it's going for the edge
and this is going to be a 5-inch device
so it's not going to be a big phablet
with a stylus that's what the note is
for this one is going to be more for the
everyday person okay so that covers
phones Samsung is also going to probably
introduce a watch yes now Samsung has
been working its way toward a round face
watch this seems to be what people get
really excited about so the rumor is
that we're going to see one of those as
well and it makes sense this is a big
stage it's a big show for samsung and we
think that they will deliver okay so
that takes care of Samsung there are
going to be of course lots of other
other companies their rice give us an
idea TC is having a press conference as
well they use the stage to launch their
own flagship phone we're going to see
the successor to the HTC One m8 we're
calling this the m9 right now um so it
who knows what we're gonna have but it
will be a flagship to rival the samsung
one haven't heard any rumors of any
unique shapes for that okay all right
Microsoft is going to be there as
Microsoft's first year as a phone maker
last year was no Gann the microsoft
bought that part of Nokia so it will be
interesting to see what they do there
now if they keep up with the theme of
the last two World Congress's you will
see sort of entry level and mid-level
devices that are geared toward emerging
markets I would love to see the first
Microsoft Lumia flagship there but with
the windows 10 preview only coming out
around this time and the the full
release coming out sometime in the
summer we might not see that happen well
have enough fun over in Barcelona for
the whole lot of us are staying behind
and we will trust you to keep us updated
on what happens at Mobile World Congress
lead stay tuned Jessica dual-core senior
