cool security stuff but Vivat is doing
something a little bit different that's
kind of exciting for this smart home and
security space so they're actually a
professional security firm so you pay a
monthly fee you sign into a contract
they install everything for you it's
been around for years it's similar to
ADT or a tease digital life as
competitors but more and more security
firms are integrating with DIY devices
and that's really really exciting for us
at CNET one of the things that's new
here at CES 2016 our Vivint is
integration with Amazon's echo that's
the Alexa voice controlled device right
here that actually can talk and control
all of the different things in your home
so there's a door lock they have
connected lighting they have all kinds
of things and you can ask Alexa to turn
on your lights change my temperature to
72 degrees and it also integrates with
the larger Vivint platform so you can
actually use vivint's display panel and
use Alexa to arm or disarm your security
system and even pull up a live security
feed of what the camera is seeing
another thing viven has introduced here
at CES 2016 is the ping camera so this
is a little security camera with 1080p
motion detection kind of your usual
suspects of features but one thing
that's really different is that it has a
little button on the top it actually
lets someone in the home
two-way talk there instead of actually
having it to have a mobile device or
something else that's something we
haven't really seen before
in the connected camera space and it's
something we're really excited to test
at the CNN smart home</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
