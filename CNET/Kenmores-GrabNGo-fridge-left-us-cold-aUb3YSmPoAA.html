front of the Kenmore 26 cubic foot grab
and goes side by side refrigerator now
the idea here is that you can open the
fridge like normal or you can press this
button to open the front panel and
reveal that indoor shelving about
opening the entire fridge now that
approach to indoor shelf access it's
pretty similar to the samsung food
showcased side-by-side that we reviewed
earlier and also the LG door indoor
models in fact this one is an LG door
indoor model because Kenmore rebrands
other manufacturers appliances to sell
it Sears so this is the exact same thing
as what you'd get from LG just with
Kenmore name on it Kenmore sets the
retail price of this white model or the
black one at $19.99 although usually
sells a lot less at Sears can also get a
stainless steel finish for $100 more now
I've got a few problems with this fridge
starting with the performance most of
the models that we've tested from the
brands that do door and a door type
features compromise performance they
don't have the greatest temperature
accuracy in the doors they gets a little
warm on those shelves this fridge is no
different creeping up into the 40s even
when we cranked it down to 33 degrees so
not a good result there those cells are
definitely warmer than you'd like also
from a usability standpoint those
shelves aren't always that easy to get
to take for instance this top shelf I
open up I've got the sour cream sitting
right there and it's not too hard to get
to but if I open the entire fridge is
totally blocked off I can't get to that
sour cream unless I go through the
grab-and-go door I would find myself
forgetting if I needed to open one door
or the other and I was trying to get to
my groceries I don't want have to think
about that as I'm trying to get my food
though as I said this is a 26 cubic foot
refrigerator and it allocates about 16.9
cubic feet to the fridge but I got to
say the space isn't as usable as I'd
like there aren't that many places to
rearrange the shelves too and you only
really can fit tall items on this middle
shelf here or the orange juices there's
no way to get two shelves tall enough
for items like that without taking
yourself out chucking it into a closet
somewhere inside of the grab-and-go door
you'll find this little door that you
have to pull open and shut every time
you're done with it there are little
windows you can grab things out of but
they're really not big enough for
anything substantial you can't get a
carton of milk out or a thing of yogurt
you really have to open this door
every time
that's another step to getting stuff out
of the door a usability quirk that was
driving me nuts during testing was that
the grab-and-go door itself doesn't shut
that well try and shut it it stays open
you really have to push it to get the
clicks shut and that would just drive me
insane over years and years loose I say
other models if you're looking for a
side by side perhaps the food showcase
fridge from Samsung if you really want
to side by side with that kind of door
in door functionality but not this
Kenmore it'll drive you up the wall
thanks for watching check out the rest
