and new tech let's take a look at the
2014 Ford Fiesta in 2011 Ford gave us
the Fiesta model a subcompact it had
sold around the world since the mid 70s
now for 2014 we get an update it's
mostly styling tech in the cabin not so
much under the hood for styling they've
added this larger front grille this is a
lot bigger than on the previous
generation and you can see it has very
similar features to what you get on the
fusion and the focus this grill gives
them a common design language among
their sedans and hatchbacks you see
these big headlights lead out to the
grill it was kind of big Mouse effect
here and going back this car is
definitely less curvy than the previous
generation now this is the hatchback
bottle you can also get this in a sedan
but I like the hatchback a lot better it
looks a lot cooler and it's much more
practical now when I lift up the
hatchback here I've got a little bit of
space here remember this is a subcompact
so lifting up the back there's a room
for a few groceries back here but I can
also throw down the rear seats back here
and that gives me a lot more space I
could probably make an Ikea run or
something like that definitely fit a
week's worth of groceries back here
let's go under the hood and check the
engine this engine carries over from the
previous model it's a 1.6 liter
four-cylinder puts out only 120
horsepower 112 pound-feet of torque it's
not all that special all it's got his
variable valve timing not much else but
he gets this car 27 miles per gallon
city 38 miles per gallon highway now the
more exciting news is that early next
year Ford's gonna come out with their
one liter EcoBoost engine in the fiesta
that's gonna be a 1 liter 3-cylinder
engine and it's gonna put out 123
horsepower and 148 pound-feet of torque
that's lower displacement but a lot more
power than this engine how do they do it
direct injection and turbo charging I
here on the dashboard you see something
you didn't see in the old generation of
the Fiesta we have this big old pod up
here this is a 6.5 inch touchscreen
that's got the MyFord Touch system on it
that's what Ford calls their in-car
cabin tech interface in this titanium
trim model that's standard we also have
a Sony audio
system you'd know that by the stereo
interface here that's kind of unique to
the sunny system you see that on some of
the other cars to the fusion and the
focus they have a similar thing if you
get the titanium trim the Sony audio
system has about eight speakers and it
sounds pretty good the navigation system
is my least favorite part of my Ford
touch it doesn't work very well this
this actually resides on an SD card in
the console here it's a seven hundred
ninety five dollars option and the
problem with it is it renders kind of
slowly I can see the map fill in as I'm
driving which you don't really get with
other systems other systems use
something called dead reckoning where
they fill in some of this information
with your vehicle speed they know what
road you're on so they kind of assume
where you are this one because it
completely freezes inside a tunnel or
something like that there's an
intersection in there it'll completely
lose you and it won't be able to tell
you where you need to go but voice
command also works with this system and
it actually works really well that's
it's again one of the best parts of this
car is if I want to put in an address I
can say the entire string I can say the
number the street and the city all in
one string I don't have to put it in
separate buckets like in other systems
so this is a pretty advanced system as
far as voice command goes problem is it
just does not process too quickly of
course the biggest problem with my Ford
touch is that you can't get sync app
link and my Ford touch in the same car
Appling cos Ford's app integration
system it integrates various app
features into the interface so they're
easy to use while you're driving and one
thing they actually have is Scout
navigation that's an app you can
integrate to get a rudimentary
navigation system kind of working with
the car you don't get the big screen but
you still get turn-by-turn directions
and stuff and there's also more than
thirty other apps that are integrated
with app link but it works really nice
and you don't get that in this version
in the car with my Ford touch but enough
about their like chronics here we've got
the shifter for the 5-speed manual
transmission that's the base
transmission here I'd kind of like to
see a six-speed here but Ford only gives
us five gears the other option is a
six-speed powershift automatic
transmission but the manual and
automatic can get about the same fuel
economy so that's a toss-up like person
like the manual it's fun to drive why
don't we take this one on the road and
check it out
all right as you can guess with a Ford
Fiesta with this 1.6 liter engine
there's not a ton of power here you know
I can slam the accelerator it starts to
pick up but it's a slow wind-up this
isn't a turbo it's not direct injection
or anything like that so it's just not
that fast I'm kind of surprised to find
the transmission gate is really pretty
sloppy it's pretty loose and sloppy
makes for fairly comfortable shifting
but it's just not a real precision
instrument it really puts this car in
more so that the suburban city runabout
are one thing I have found though
driving this car around some mountain
roads having fun with it it does feel
pretty responsive feels pretty nimble I
like that in titanium trim this 2014
Ford Fiesta goes for just under $20,000
that's with the seven hundred ninety
five dollar navigation option but my
Ford touch comes standard in this
titanium trim I would actually take a
step down to the SE model that's 16,000
fifty dollars with the manual
transmission now that you can get my
Ford touch as an option but I would
consider leaving it out because then you
get sync app link and you can integrate
that Scout navigation app so you get
navigation plus all the other apps that
Ford includes with app link</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
