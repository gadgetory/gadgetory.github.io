port from cnet here at CES 2014 I've got
this new iPhone and I've had case that
you're going to want to hear about it's
called nunu and what it is it's very
simply a case for your iphone 4 all the
way up to iphone 5s and for your iPad
Mini or regular-sized iPad what it does
is it cleans your device and in the
meantime it kills off any bacteria on it
got an antimicrobial element built right
into the microfiber inside very simple
and very very nice and easy design and
actually fairly affordable for what it
is it'll cost $45 and right now you can
get it on new views website so for a
little demo I've got my very dirty
iphone 5 right here I'm going to slide
it in then when I slide it out it should
be a little bit cleaner now the
antimicrobial agent is part of the
lining doesn't feel stiff it feels very
soft that's because it's cooked into it
but it's still effective it's supposed
to kill off up to ninety nine point nine
percent of germs just like other
antimicrobial element and it starts
working within 15 minutes but for the
best results you'll leave it in for two
hours now one thing I should mention is
that it might not get the ends priority
of the phone clean and you might find
that it sort of moves things around
instead of wiping it off completely of
course you're going to get all the grime
on the inside of cape and the
antimicrobial lining will wear out shelf
life is probably about a year or a year
and a half there are over a dozen
different colors and three different
types of material to
from so there should be something for
everyone Christine add I'm test gazelle
court and you've been looking at the new
view and antimicrobial and self-cleaning
iphone and ipad case for all the
coverage at CES check out cnet com</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
