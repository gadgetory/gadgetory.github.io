look at the Dell XPS 12 I'll get this
part out of the way first what makes
this a laptop tablet hybrid is that the
screen rotates but right in the middle
like this so you flip it all the way
around to the back and then you have
kind of a kiosk mode or you fold it all
the way down like this and then you have
fairly chunky but still pretty
reasonable tablet and when you're done
that when I go back to a basic clamshell
laptop you just flip the screen back and
you have something that is a clamshell
laptop and like the best examples of
this like that Lenovo yoga 13 doesn't
really compromise that laptop shape that
you should be so used to this is
actually the third time we've seen this
design from Dell originally it was in a
netbook years ago did had a hinge in the
center like this and it was a good idea
didn't quite come together then we saw
it as the XPS 12 one of the very first
Windows 8 laptops and one of the very
first windows 8 hybrids and that worked
pretty well but the battery life was not
great the big difference here physically
this is almost exactly the same machine
is that they've upgraded this to Intel's
new fourth-generation core i series
processors and that gives you much
better battery life so for example the
XPS 12 we looked at back windows 8 first
launched that got about four and a half
hours of battery life made a little bit
more this guy is more than seven hours
to me that's pretty big improvement
especially because they keep the price
starting at about 11 99 that's a little
bit of a premium for the components that
you get but keep in mind this thing is
made of carbon fiber and some aluminum
and again it's got this really unique
flip screen hinge here it's not the kind
of thing you probably use all the time
and if you have no need for it then
there are other ultrabooks they get you
the same parts for less but I appreciate
that every time I see the XPS 12 from
Dell it gets a little bit better i'm dan
ackerman and then is the del x
