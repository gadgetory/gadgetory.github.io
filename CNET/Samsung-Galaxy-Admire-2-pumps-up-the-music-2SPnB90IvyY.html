introduce the samsung galaxy admire 2
for Cricket Wireless this is a prepaid
phone that costs $250 off contract it's
very compact has a 4 inch screen pretty
good pixel density and brightness on
this one seemed a little bit dim on
autofocus sometimes especially indoors
this phone is based off of the Samsung
Galaxy s3 model also the exact same
phone as the Samsung Galaxy axiom on US
Cellular so there are a lot of
similarities has the sort of brushed
metal finish but it is all plastic very
high gloss feels very nice in the hand
slips into pockets it is pretty heavy
though and that's noticeable if you hold
it up to your ear for a long time or if
you're holding it for a while but you
will grow used to it I carry a heavier
purse anyway so I don't really notice it
the phone runs Android 4.1 jellybean
with Samsung's TouchWiz interface on top
one of the biggest most important
software features of this phone is that
it comes with crickets move music
service now you pay for that along with
your rate plan and what you get in
exchange is unlimited downloads for
songs also ringtones that you can make I
think it's really good value
unfortunately the software is a little
stuttery it did halt and completely
crash on me more frequently than I
thought it should so you wear this phone
runs on a 1.7 gigahertz Qualcomm
Snapdragon dual-core processor seemed
pretty speeding there's a 5 megapixel
camera on the back with flash and a
front facing camera as well camera
quality is very solid
I took satisfying pictures that I could
share with other people upload online
and this is definitely a high point for
this mid-range phone then my r2 is also
outfitted with 4G LTE capability but
you're only going to find that if you're
in crickets 4G footprint if not you're
gonna be surfing slow 3G speeds like I
did I'm just a tall court for CNET you
can check out my full review of the
Samsung Galaxy admire 2 at cnet.com
