by thousands puts Toyota back in the
sports car game and put Subaru and
Toyota in bed this one the
groundbreaking Scion fr-s let's drive it
and check the tap well here it is the
car the Toyota and Subaru have been
introducing for years I got sick of
covering this thing at the auto shows
and it's constant pre-production
unveilings the Scion fr-s is the one
Toyota gets in the US and then there's
going to be a Subaru BRZ virtually
identical we'll cover that one
separately the basic concept is the same
though a compact Supra kind of car low
slung really a 2+2 two-door it's meant
to be an affordable little pocket rocket
like Toyota hasn't made in eons if ever
now inside this car you're gonna find
what I think is interesting dose of
Nissan GTR different company entirely
but it's this real kind of gutsy almost
a throwback retro look there's some faux
carbon-fiber here I hope it's not real
not at this price it couldn't be and
everything in here is very machine-like
very mechanical it's a nice change of
pace from what you'd expect in a low
priced car as you can see the display is
very minimal it's a black and white it's
kind of a you know crunchy segmented
character display so I would recommend
an upgrade if you do that there's one
choice you can go with these guys it's
called the bespoke head unit it's going
to give you a color touchscreen it's
going to give you some connectivity
there's also going to be Pandora
streaming built in and get this Twitter
and Facebook updates and Yelp access and
that by the way is a scorching deal at
eight hundred and forty five bucks in
addition this car has one of my biggest
gripes of modern vehicles an overly
compressed speedometer it's the smaller
gauge on the left of the big tach right
there it goes up to 160 which I suspect
is wishful thinking in this car but even
worse than that it's not even a full
circle gauge as a result all the mileage
speeds you're ever gonna be driving are
all wedged in down here at the bottom so
the gauge becomes useless one needle
width is almost five miles an hour then
we have the base 6-speed manual which
makes total sense to me in this car but
you can option this guy into a 6-speed
automatic
now the Subaru Toyota marriage gets most
interesting here under the hood this of
course is a scion product the Toyota
Motor Corporation product but notice the
stamping on the fender well and the
sticker in the door jamb Subaru makes
this car and this is a Subaru engine
it's a 2 liter flat for boxer I mean who
else would make such a thing you've got
200 horsepower 151 foot-pounds of torque
numbers that don't look stunning on
paper but adequate
0 to 60 happens in either 6.2 or 6.4
seconds by most estimates depending on
whether you got the automatic or the
manual and the weights a little
different the mpg is real different 20
to 30 with a manual 25 34 with the
automatic that's a big difference folks
by the way this engine uses another
recent trend in technology a hybrid fuel
injection system a combination of
sequential port injection which you see
on these runners and direct injection
depending on what part of the power band
it's operating now I don't know what the
crash safety ratings are on this car
don't normally delve into that but I do
know this this is the very best car in
the world in which to get a paper cut
let me show you why first of all here's
a little folder that holds the owner's
manual there's a first-aid kit very tidy
one then here in the trunk is a mini
first-aid kit including tweezers and
things for magnifying stuff compression
bandage and more and finally in this
briefcase sized emergency kit you've got
jumper cables a survival wrap more
medical supplies a floating flashlight
and a hose clamp what do they think is
gonna happen while you're driving this
car
okay when the FRS is on the road that's
where you realize the formula works a
lightweight car rear-wheel drive
with the right amount of power not
overwhelming what I notice right off the
bat is this is one of those few cars you
can actually floor frequently and not
get in trouble that's partly because the
suspension chassis handled the power
well and partly because there's not too
much power
now nevermind what you see on paper
there's a broad flat spot from like
three to five thousand rpm maybe a
little bit higher the power doesn't gag
there but it definitely shaves off a bit
and that's part of what gives this car I
think a real tractable feel it's
actually a lot of fun although it's not
what a lot of carmakers go for these
days another thing we noticed about the
FRS is got a real firm mechanical
shifter the clutch effort and take-up is
just about perfect I love this clutch
it's about as good as that in the 911
and that's saying something now as much
as I love the gearbox in this car I've
got to check out the automatic it's got
panels as I mentioned those can be a
gimmick if the transmission isn't as
quick as your inputs on the paddles and
the reason I looking at that automatic
because they talk about it being quite
advanced and this car is the kind you'll
probably have as your only card as a
result it's nice to have a well tuned
Sport Automatic especially with the big
mpg bonus you get in this particular
installation now the car is a little
unrefined it's face but it's inexpensive
and lightweight so you do get a lot of
road noise coming through the engine
noise I like the road noise I could live
with a little less of it doesn't give
you the feeling of quality which a
$24,000 Scion does need to aspire to a
little bit and being a lightweight car
with sufficient power and rear-wheel
drive it really has true sports car
dynamics that's kind of a long tedious
way of saying you can steer with the
accelerator or the steering wheel or
both that's fun
if pricing the FRS is real easy as a
first-year car the options are quite
limited manual transmission cars twenty
five thousand dollars delivered eleven
hundred more for that automatic which I
have to look into and then eight forty
five for that bespoke high-tech
connected head unit I would definitely
do that all in this car has got a lot of
scene that DNA but it needs a little
more oomph around the mid rpm
