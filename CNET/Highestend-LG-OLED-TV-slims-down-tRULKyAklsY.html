CNET and this is LG's best OLED TV for
2016 it is the signature g6 series on
with the 65 inch this TV will also be
available in a 77 inch size it's a flat
TV unlike a lot of the curved OLED TVs
that were in the past and just like all
those other OLED TVs we expect this
thing to deliver spectacular picture
quality since it's the best OLED TV of
the show it's probably the best overall
television that we'll see it CES this
year in terms of picture quality the
OLED TV pitch quality is basically the
same throughout the lineup if you go
down from the 55 to the 65 to the 77
inch and the 4k sizes but the real claim
to fame on this television is its
styling it's extremely thin when seen
from the side it measures only 2.57
millimeters that's less than a tenth of
an inch the catch is that you have to
plug in stuff to this television so it
has a really cool detachable speaker bar
that can be on the bottom to serve as a
stand or flipped up over behind it to
serve as the wall mount so you can put
all those electronics in there and still
keep that really thin form factor that
extra module also provides improved
sound compared to other OLED TVs new for
this year all the OLED TVs from LG's
support dolby vision HD are in addition
to other HDR standards ii also hit 99%
of the DCI color space so again really
good color and black level and contrast
reproduction so again we expect this
thing to have excellent picture quality
perhaps the best we've ever seen another
cool thing about the styling is this TV
should look really close it's basically
mounted on glass itself it's got a glass
border around the edge and a really thin
panel so all told an extremely sleek
look that's a quick look at LG's g6
signature OLED TV CES 2016 I'm David
