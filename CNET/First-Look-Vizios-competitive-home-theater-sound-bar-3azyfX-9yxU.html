to take a look at the vizio vht 212 this
is one of the latest sound bar systems
from Vizio and is currently selling for
around two hundred and ninety dollars
online this is a slickers looking sound
bar Vizio has made yet it has a slim
profile at just one point nine inches
deep and the glossy black finish is
nicely accented by the silver end caps
and the angled metal feet there's our
display on the front which not every
sound bar has and it's nice because it
lets you know how high the volume is or
what input you're on the included
subwoofer is wireless so you can place
it nearly anywhere in your living room
and it's relatively thin to you can
control the sound bar using the buttons
on the top or you can use the included
remote and it's really a great remote
it's dead simple with just power volume
and mute buttons and then you can slide
the bottom out for even more functions
like selecting inputs or even adjusting
the subwoofer level remotes on sound
bars are generally pretty bad but this
one's a winner around back there's
actually a lot of connectivity options
including two hdmi inputs both optical
and coaxial digital audio inputs and a
mini jack input so even if you end up
connecting everything to your TV first
it's nice to have all that flexibility
in case you run out of inputs on your TV
sound quality on the vht 215 is really
quite good for a budget sound bar it
sounds good out of the box but again the
ability to adjust the bass treble and
subwoofer levels right on the remote is
great if you like to tweak the sound it
sounded better than yamaha's y es 101 on
movies and it was very close to hires
excellent spe v40 slim although the
higher sounds a little bit better with
two channel music but still the vizio is
one of the best sounding budget sound
bar systems we've tested so overall the
vizio vht 215 is a stylish sound bar
with a ton of inputs and solid sound
quality especially if you like the
ability to adjust the sound the
competing higher SBE v40 Slim is a
little bit better overall but it's very
close and the Vizio is definitely worth
considering I'm Matthew miskovic and
this is the vizio vht 215
