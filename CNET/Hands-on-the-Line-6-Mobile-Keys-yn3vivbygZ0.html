the showstoppers events in Las Vegas for
the first look at a product that is a
buing here it's called mobile keys by a
company called line six and what it is
is a very portable easy solution that is
completely powered by a bus to this iPad
here this is the first keyboard that's
really bus powered so what that means is
that if you want to have a jam session
on the go this is a really easy solution
here we have a 49 key model that is 199
dollars and it's connected to this iPad
running GarageBand they also have it
connected to this speaker here because
you want to be able to hear you can
connect it to the headphones and just
have your own personal jam session
there's also a smaller model on the side
here that's 29 keys for 149 and here is
connected to an iPhone this is work on
any iOS device or even a Mac or PC and
it works with a wide range of software
so although GarageBand is on here now it
can be Pro Tools or it could be
something that is as simple as a
keyboard learning program for kids
there's a wide range of what you can do
with this is the company also made
something for guitars called line and it
just came out in December this company
also makes devices for the guitar just
this last month they have a device
called mobile and also by line six and
it is an interface for your guitar that
just does all the cool effects for you
and it plugs right into an iOS device as
well the mobile keys are scheduled to
come out in February for cnet.com I'm

Vegas</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
