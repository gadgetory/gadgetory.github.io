transferred from fire TV I bet you're
wondering how I did that
the answer is a combination of Amazon's
echo dot speaker and the all-new fire TV
if you have an Alexa capable speaker
like the dot you can add the little fire
TV box to your television and be able to
control stuff without a remote using
just your voice you left remember state
a key word Alexa and not everything
works Alexa volume up sorry I didn't
find this device but quite a bit does
Alexa launch YouTube getting YouTube for
fire TV you can use the remote to issue
voice commands to so even if you don't
own an Alexa speaker you can run
searches get the weather and perform any
other Alexa tasks just by speaking into
the clicker new fire TV cost more the
existing fire TV stick and both offer
Alexa voice control so the main reason
to get the little box is for its 4k and
HDR playback TV shows movies and videos
from Netflix Amazon and YouTube appear
in the best available quality provided
you have a compatible 4k HDR TV the
difference in video quality isn't huge
compared to standard HD but if you pay
big bucks for a sweet new television
you'll probably want to spring the extra
money for the box fire TV seems a little
awkward hanging off the back of your TV
but they'll generally be hidden back
there so you won't notice you can opt to
plug it directly into the wall for power
or use a USB port on your TV that
eliminates having to plug in but boot up
takes longer responses are super quick
app selection is superb and it's 4k HDR
images as good as I expected the main
downside to Amazon fire TV is the
tendency of the interface to push you
toward Amazon video non Amazon apps like
Netflix and Hulu appear in the recently
used section and you can move them
around you can't otherwise customize the
screen most the feature videos are from
Amazon and there's also a lot of Amazon
promotions overall I like Roku streaming
stick plus another 4k HDR streamer
better than the fire TV thanks it's
neutral interface and TV control remote
fire TV is still an excellent capable
choice especially if you really like
talking to the TV</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
