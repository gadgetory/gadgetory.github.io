connect to your smart jewelry I'm
Bridget Carey and this is your cnet
update you can buy all sorts of items on
Amazon but later this year you may use
amazon to buy a haircut reuters is
reporting that Amazon's working on
launching a marketplace for local
services such as plumbers or babysitters
and this would start off as a small test
to gauge interest similar to the limited
rollout of the Amazon fresh grocery
delivery service now this would
challenge sites like Yelp and Angie's
List it seems amazon has been carefully
testing out this idea because if you
ordered a nest thermostat amazon may
have also tried to sell you a service to
install it and speaking of the nest
honeywell has a new smart home
thermostat that looks a bit similar to
the nest the honeywell lyric is two
hundred and eighty dollars and it
arrives in stores this August honeywell
has a few smart thermostats already in
the market but this model goes back to a
classic round design from the 50s it's a
design that the nest is making popular
again the lyric tracks your smartphone
location to know when you leave the home
and when you're gone it'll switch to an
energy-saving mode and switching from
the smart home too smart bracelets next
month it'll only cost you a dollar to be
among the first to test out the razor
Naboo no not Star Wars Naboo this is NAB
you and it's a hybrid between a
SmartWatch and a fitness band the gaming
company razor is opening up beta testing
on July tenth and it will award 500 fans
the chance to try out this device which
is an accessory for your iphone or
android smartphone it vibrates and
displays notification alerts of calls
and text messages it tracks activity and
it can give someone your contact
information if you give them a high five
that is if they're also wearing one you
can apply to test it out on the razor
Naboo website and there seems to be a
new smart tracking watch thing every
week but if you want something more
unique perhaps you'll be interested in a
smart
ring it's called the ring Lee and this
bling will vibrate to alert you whenever
you get a text a phone call or
notification if your phone is buried in
your purse you probably don't hear the
alerts and ring Lee can help with that
paranoid you miss something feeling so
you don't have to keep checking your
phone it has a tiny light on the side
that flashes with different colors and
you can set different vibration patterns
to mean different things it works with
iOS and Android phones comes in
different stone designs and you can
pre-order it for 145 dollars techy style
doesn't come cheap that's your tech news
update but there's always more at cnet
com from our studios in New York I'm
