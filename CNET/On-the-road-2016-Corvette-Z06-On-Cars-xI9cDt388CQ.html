because the power is oh yeah whew and
are you this is the new golden age of
horsepower but for the most part brawny
cars today do it with much smaller
displacement and a lot more attack under
the hood except with a big vent which
keeps things big let's drive the king of
the big bets the zo6
and check the big American style tech so
what is a zo6
it's basically king of a hill right now
in the c7 seventh generation Corvette
you take what's already an impressive
6.2 liter v8 face car and then you add a
bunch of brawn a supercharger on top of
that v8 a standard 7-speed manual with
rev matching magnetic we illogical
adaptive suspension standard wider
fenders up front to cover way bigger
wheels and treads all kinds of radical
airflow and cooling management around
the body and a steel-reinforced Jesus
bar where the view
use it new 4:16 you've got a front
kerbin chin camera a rear lid that
doesn't require you to slam it it
cinches itself and carplay or Android
auto with carplay out first but you
don't buy a car like this to play with
your smartphone yep I have to play with
a motorized screen instead I can't get
enough of that okay let's get serious
7-speed manual gearbox this is bass but
notice our manual has paddles on the
wheel
those are your toggles to turn on or off
rev matching we'll try that on the road
and the track momentarily now down here
is your mode controller for the vehicle
and it's very simple compared to like a
BMW M car there's weather eco-tour which
is normal sport and track not a ton of
variables around that under the home
menu is something you won't find on any
other car we Chevy MyLink and that's
this the PDR the performance data
recorder which is a misnomer it's a
forward-looking video camera that also
has a data recorder that overlays
telemetry on the HD view forward this is
basically a smart GoPro built in the car
and no one else does it quite like this
and generally around the cabin this is a
mix of traditional and modern cabin
technology a partial LCD instrument
panel but real gauges around it for
other functions you got your touch
screen here of course but a ton of
tactile knobs right below it
now the simplest headline around zo6
is that the engine is supercharged and
here's your supercharger and plant them
right at the top and I mean right at the
top look at this thing it just barely
fits in the profile of the engine bay
it's right here at the height of the
hood gasket so when you add some mass on
top you want to lower it on the bottom
as a result this engine has dry sump
lubrication a very shallow pan below to
keep overall height managed and not add
a bunch of tall center of gravity
killing mass and in between those two
components you've got tougher forged
internals to handle the chaos that this
guy brings upon them and you've also got
stronger better breathing
high-performance heads the output
numbers are a pleasant pair 650 horse
650 pound feet of torque 7-speed manuals
bass you can get an 8-speed automatic I
won't be speaking to you after that
however with that 8-speed in a high
performance package you can get to zero
to 60 down under 3 seconds for this 3500
pounds worth event and should you care
the average mpg is 18 that's not bad for
something that puts out 650 gets there
partly because of direct injection and
very much because of cylinder
deactivation
you never get used to this kind of big
power I'll be honest I'm more of a
naturally aspirated kind of guy I kind
of like that smooth linear feel but this
is just a hoot now we're at the
simraceway performance driving center at
Sonoma a course layout that constantly
reminds you how light and sharp the turn
in is on this car coupled with that
responsive throttle this Vette feels
about half its weight I'm in let's say
sport mode right now and I've got
tremendous power I've got great throttle
ability I do not even miss the rev
matcher when it's on or off because this
engine blips and modulates so
beautifully which is interesting for a
great big engine it breathes very
lightly I would say it's not hard to get
it up or down on the rev clock because
it's a nimble set of internals this
Vette has a perfect 50:50 weight spread
largely because that 7-speed manual I'm
working is a transaxle
not a transmission in other words it's
located at the back of the car instead
of ganging it up all lopsided ly with
the engine at the front of the car nice
gearbox and clutch by the way Corvettes
used to have condom
kind of horsey drivelines in the last
couple generations not anymore
this guy is just easy to drive but man
is there some stuff under there
get the magneto rheological adaptive
suspensions doing wonders of course to
keep me in good shape that's also the
technology that will keep you enjoying
your zo6 on the ride home after the
track okay done up seeing that style of
zo6 is going to start you about 80,000
for with a 7-speed manual it's for the
coupe by the way more for the
convertible then there's that zero seven
additional Performance Package 7,500
bucks I'm gonna pass I'm good here
1,800 for the PDR track recorder with
telemetry laid over the video at a love
back I'm all-in now you're at about
eighty to two out the door the way I do
