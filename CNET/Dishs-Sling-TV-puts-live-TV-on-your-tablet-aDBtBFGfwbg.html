internet video service and we call it
sling television now as most of you know
sling and the sling box have a history
with Dish launched in 2005 sling
technology provides users with the
ability to watch their favorite live TV
channels wherever they have an internet
connection this technology continues to
be marketed on a standalone basis a
sling box by ecostar and the technology
is found in our second generation hopper

top streaming service designed to
deliver live yes I said live Internet
video to tablets smartphones
PCs game consoles and yes even smart
televisions it's portable no long term
contracts all you need is a credit card
and a broadband connection and it's
named squarely at the millennial
audience those 18 to 35 year olds who
represent a market virtually untouched
by the pay TV industry today sling TV is
a brand for this consumer segment and it
offers our new customers programming
that is tailored to their wants and
needs the content offering will include
between 25 to 30 channels we expect more
to come
industry-leading device partners are
also on board with the new sling TV
service and we expect more to come
affordability is the key attribute of
our new sling television service the new
consumer price for sling TV will be
substantially and I mean substantially
below the current linear pay TV
offerings and even less than the
high-priced
internet TV options from our competitors
we expect to launch packages in the near
future that allow customers
to tailor their experience and guess
what we expect more to come this all
adds up to something very very special
live TV which is to say live sports and
news a smaller focus channel lino mobile
