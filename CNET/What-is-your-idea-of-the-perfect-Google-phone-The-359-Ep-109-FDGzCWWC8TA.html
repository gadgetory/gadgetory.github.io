September 20th time for another edition
of the 359 podcast cnet's official
unofficial morning show featuring Roger
Cheng and Alfred a good morning guys
good morning good morning happy tuesday
everyone we've got a lot to talk about
packed show will be talking first google
finally confirmed their October fourth
event we're expecting a a new phone as
well as more details on Google home
we'll also be talking about comcast
confirming that next year it'll launch a
wireless service they tried this before
didn't work so well we'll see if they
actually get it right this time lastly a
story The Alfred wrote about the London
Mayor in town to drum up support to
reassure people that that brexit isn't
gonna have an effect on on tech the tech
world attack hub that is London right
nipple pain pay no attention to this a
giant gaping hole we have from our plans
there you go so as always if you have
any questions leave them in the comments
section or producer Brian will pick out
the best that we will try to do our best
to answer them all whatever you ready
let's start recording and in three two
welcome to the three tonight when we
talk about the top tech news of the day
I'll get the crap we want to throw it
I'm dr. Chang I'm Alfred Inge so Google
has confirmed October fourth as its next
big event we're all expecting to see the
debut of the rumor pixel phone the first
time it'll actually go away from the
Nexus franchise which has really been
with Android it's almost the beginning
so Alfred what do you think that what is
your idea of the perfect google phone
what do you want to see in this phone um
I'd really like to see this phone you
know be affordable seeing that it's the
spiritual successor of the Nexus line
which you know was touted on being
affordable from what I've heard though
this is uh not going to be at the same
price yeah I mean I think they've been
trying to get away from the idea of a
google or Nexus phone as a low-cost
device because of the association at low
cost well good value is it's not quite
on par with the super phones that that
is the Samsung devices or the Apple
devices so and it's looking a lot like
these pics
phones will be more definite more
flagship level devices it's
disappointing because you know I do
believe that you can be affordable and
write a flagship device but I guess no I
think they had a hit on their hands with
the nexus for the nexus 5 these were
phones that were both solid LG made them
very affordable especially if you
weren't looking to sign up for a
contract but they hit at the right time
because people were starting to
understand that they're spending way too
much fun on the way too much money on
contracts that these phones were an
affordable option so I don't know what
what are some of the other features you
want to see I'm really hoping that the
pixel does have kind of a connectivity
feature two laptops right where it can
be docked to it you know with
Chromebooks being able to I mean not
being able to but just moving toward
more android apps yep I'm hoping you
know the the pixel will allow me to plug
it into a laptop of some source and just
run it on that instead windows phones do
that now some of them Ellie is the
higher end ones but of course no one
cares cuz ya don't buy them so moving on
comcast comcast CEO Brian Roberts
confirmed today that starting sometime
in the middle of next year that it will
launch a wireless service it hasn't
agreed with verizon so we'll be using
verizon's network but it'll also augment
the service with the span of local Wi-Fi
networks in its market so I don't know
comcast has tried this before hasn't
worked so well what do you think he
interested I have no doubts and Comcast
ability to you know connect people I
think it's more so there they've got a
really bad reputation as far as customer
service Koecher I mean this is we're
talking about a company here that you
know it has its own Wikipedia article
for criticisms not not a section an
entire article dedicated to just you
know how it's the criticisms against
comcast yeah look it's a it's tough I
mean they've done this before the the
cable companies have tried a couple
times to launch their own wireless
service or you say sprint's network for
the wireless service it's never worked
for whatever reason it seems like
logically would make sense you do a
quotable playwright home home connection
phone internet TV and wireless but it's
never really really never came together
lastly you order story brexit yeah um
well the mayor of london sadik-khan came
to New York City yesterday to you know
basically tell us investors hey don't
worry about brexit there's nothing wrong
with this which so far he's been right
about you know there's been getting the
same amount of investors same amount of
money same amount of tech companies
Lauren is still the best city for you
know tech startups to grow in or now or
now because Briggs exits effects have
not even have not taken place right they
actually had any enacted any of the
process of place to break away from the
zone so it know it seems like he's kind
of scrambling right now to you know get
all these investors and until hey look
there's nothing to worry about before
you know its impact actually happens
yeah we'll see Brett's it's gonna take a
little while for more about these
stories check us out on cnet I'm Roger
Cheng I'm a pro ding thanks for
listening and that's a cut on the
podcast recording all right first and
foremost ghulam thank you for your
interest we aren't gamers the max come
free from work if they gave us the
choice it would be a different story but
yeah we worked CBS i would actually i
don't know for some of us it might be a
story well yeah we ever had a choice
everyone always is like why you guys use
Mackle time cuz CBS gives it to us for
free it gets everybody in the floor for
free and it's not a cause and it's not
by the way it's not because Apple gives
them to us we just buy art as a company
we supply max we use max oh yeah yeah
and be honest we could probably all
benefit from something a little more
powerful on a desktop but we're floating
around with these airs and they don't
cost us a dime so yeah yeah I wouldn't
mind using a surface actually at least
on the road not not in the office maybe
they give them to us to prevent us from
putting games on then that it's probably
that's a really good point yeah I mean
productivity is already pretty low on
the scene at office I wouldn't brag
about that right I really would brag
about that come on I'm kidding I'm
kidding a little bit so what any
questions or comments particular I mean
like the Google is coming up the pixel
phone is I'm sure starting up some
interest we definitely have pixel
anticipation we have some nougat fans
oh yeah yeah yeah um and we have a bunch
of Apple haters go figure sure I'm kind
of interested in the new google phone
although i kind of hate that that
twitter add that they rolled because
it's so avant-garde and vague and uh
hashtag game of phones yeah yeah well
yeah thing i try to do some different i
guess i don't i don't know whatever yeah
it is what it is but I mean it could be
really fun like I'm a heavy google user
yeah I am too as is the rest of the
internet and the rest of this office is
very true very google shop I mean it's
cliche to say but at this point I am
very disheartened by the forthcoming
iphone headphone non jets yeah yeah
coming it's out but yeah this might this
might steal me away yeah but me if your
look if you're a viewer are you is a
google phone attractive enough that it
might lure you away from from your
iphone love especially now after
headphone jack gate and is that is that
a gate i don't know i don't think it's a
gate yet but yeah I mean I had a nexus 5
4 3 years I bought it like the moment it
came out because of how affordable it
rise yeah yeah now that's I mean I agree
that's the most disappointing part is
that this isn't going to be an
affordable phone they tried that last
year with the the Nexus 6p right that
was bad completely stuff that to the end
the year before it was the Nexus 6 i
believe that was Motorola's phone it was
like it was a good jumbo phone and that
one did not well did not deal well
because they priced it at a higher level
they try to sell through the carrier's
which kind of went against what Nexus
has done since from day one really so uh
here's a question yeah I'm really a
question but more of a wish list
somebody wants a physical keyboard again
it looks like which isn't interesting
very makes a phone I I library makes an
android phone but would Google consider
something like that also well read
there's no like market demand the market
is so so nice I mean there there is
market demand but it's just like it's
five people yeah I was one of those for
a while to I I just did not want to make
the switch because it's so easy to type
yeah I know it took me a while to switch
over to a full touchscreen and even when
I had
iPhone or Android device I kind of
missed having a full keyboard i used to
write whole story on my phone i mean i
can still kind of do that but it's a lot
tougher now I just enjoyed being in what
a text while walking because I yeah it
was great although now I know folks your
age who are actually able to do that
sort of blind typing on their screen I
don't know how that even works but
physically they kind of know the
placement of the finger on the screen to
get the right letter you'll get there
eventually grandpa Roger uh I don't know
how probable see now before that
athletes what about what if google
follow suit and that the headphone jack
starts going away and other models
aren't Apple I I would I think that's
gonna be a distinct possibility and I
think USBC Intel's already touted that
that poor as a alternative to the
headphone jack and the reality is a lot
of these companies want to get their
phones thinner want to pack in more for
their phones whether it's battery
whether it's wireless charging features
whatever it is and that headphone jack
is takes a bit of extra real estate and
can be removed so sorry break to you
guys but I think that's that's sort of
the future of where these phones are
going and in related news that would be
a high we got repeat people in the chat
room wishing for better battery life in
general which I think most mobile phones
at this point can benefit from
absolutely um as long as they're not
exploded but yeah no no that's that's
not exactly better but that really no
it's not let me that's the thing was the
note said it was was it was floating
because the battery was really good
though no no well arguably they crammed
in a bigger battery into the phone and
the act of cramming it in might have
triggered the the actual friction that
was setting off the explosion I don't
know I'm just I'm just speculating but
yeah I would agree a bigger battery or a
bigger battery longer battery life
definitely are key for front a new phone
I mean you saw with Apple they they try
to spin it with their processor plus the
bigger battery I still think they could
have done more with that but that's just
me and as far as the a headphone jacks
go if they are removing it for us bc on
the pixel yeah all I can ask is just
just put two ports so people can you
know essentially listen to music and
charge at the same time that's yeah
a big concern you don't have a dongle
that splits it into two things it just
put two ports that you see it on laptops
all the time yep I don't see why and you
know that you can't argue oh it's a
space issue of that because the rest of
is just dead space on right that's
physically I'm either physically smaller
you can easily pack in 203 just go riolu
don't go crazy there cool it yeah man
let's speculate on pricing Oh as a bold
statement I know yeah yeah let's go
let's go crazy let's just start throwing
out numbers price is right a million no
I would say right around the 650 700
mark that's sort of the the sweet spot
for flagship phones the iphone 7 starts
at 650 yeah Samsung's are around the
same price the note 7 was like I think
it started like 800 900 dollars so you
know there's there's a wiggle room there
especially if it's a premium device
right yeah do you think Google might try
to beat the curve because somebody is
saying in the chat somewhere in the 400
to 500 dollar range I mean that brings
it back to that Nexus range i think the
original nexus for five or four hundred
dollars Mike I know Nexus 5 I i bought
mine for around like 250 okay all right
so maybe it's a little too high price of
that but I feel like that is the
territory of like mid-range phones like
you can get a decent $400 phone now and
I don't know if Google wants to be in
that pack I think they want to be they
want to elevate this phone to something
that's slightly better than your
standard ZTE or like alcatel mid to your
phone sorry guys yeah Tala says pixel
laptops were expensive so they're
speculating yeah phone will probably
follow so yeah and the pixel laptop or a
Chromebook was really felt like it was
more like a concept than anything like
you could buy it but it was crazy
expensive and I don't know if anyone
actually really purchase that thing
right like we're just sort of like
here's what we could do with this
super-awesome screen and you know all
the bells and whistles for a Chromebook
but it wasn't really that much better
than a standard Chromebook which costs
what 150-200 dollars no no so here's our
standing wish list for this google phone
no hiss yes no explosions and go Jack
the bar is very low right
a standard headphone jack some kind of
water resistance and moderate price yeah
that's what we got don't think it's
gonna hit all those I think you'll get
maybe three out of five waterproof and
water resistance it's kind of like the
standard now it's kind of a i mention i
mean it is it seems like a standard but
there are a lot of phones out there that
still don't have it right like a lot of
high-end phones yeah like LG still
doesn't do it I mean I think Sony
Samsung and Apple now are the only three
that but yeah I think it's starting to
become like the standard of it you know
I would hope it is it becomes a standard
I just don't I'm not sure if it is yet
or if the industry has got in their
mindset that it should be you know that
it's it's a perk as opposed to a
standard so i'll say what about carrier
deals that's the big controversy right
like willwill next to sorb sorry will
this pixel phone be sold through
carriers will be sold through google's
website through google play which is
sort of the the standard model for nexus
you know a few times they've tried to
sell these things through the carrier's
they failed mm-hmm I blues Nexus 6 the
original nexus one I think so too
carried as well there's a mix and it
just I didn't do well right so I don't
know that's the best I know that was a
big selling point for the nexus 5 that
you didn't have to do a whole carrier
deal with it and I'm locked for anybody
so but the the rub their it's this
dilemma that they have it yeah it's
really attractive if you want to sell
unlocked through google play but that's
vast vast majority of people by their
phones to carriers and that's prom right
like if you don't go through that
channel you're not going to sell a lot
of phones regardless like the next four
or five did relatively well but that
they weren't selling as well as like an
iphone did because they didn't have the
carrier channel who in the chat were
curious how did you get your mobile
phone assuming you have a mobile phone I
don't know maybe many people who don't
at this point but did you get it through
carrier did you buy stand alone as you
get a second hand light it up in the
chat tell us also on the other topic
would anyone want to sign up for a
comcast wireless service no really old
absence nope no all right well know that
heads that conversational
so much hate for comcast there I have
you used them no cuz they're not market
that's i don't i'm not the wireless in
general have you experienced that
company know this i've never been in an
area where i was off yeah I feel like
comcast has only been you know
successful because it's you know this is
the only cable network in your area to
do it all well that's really sorry for
all the cable company yeah but why
they're all saying that's why I don't
think it'll transfer translate over to a
mobile network because you know there's
so many other options where I know why
would I ever sign up for this company
that gets all these negative well if if
you're in the comcast territory I mean
they can offer you theoretically a
bundle of services if you're already a
comcast video and internet subscriber
tack on this wireless service for like
40 bucks extra or something like that
that to me kind of makes sense if you're
if you're a Comcast if you're an
existing comcast subscriber not I don't
think they're winning over anyone new
they're not gonna be like I'm not gonna
switch from t-mobile or sprint to
comcast for whatever reason but if I'm
already a customer maybe I would
consider it if they gave me a break I
don't know we got a lot of people in the
chat who do get their phones through the
carrier trade ins etc yep Austin is
actually a user of comcast xfinity and
has nothing but nice things to say about
it yeah actually let's try to be
optimistic i have not had the best
experience okay i used it I've never
used it either but I know Maggie Maggie
Reardon are FCC reporter as well as
covering issues of cable she actually
had a lot of complimentary thing to say
about the x1 platform and she noted that
like relative to other cable companies
it's actually pretty innovative I mean
that's a low bar you're clear there but
like you know if you're a Time Warner
Cable customer you're probably less
happy than you are as a comcast customer
like I I have had time for games I am
NOT a big fan I'm I'm like barely home
so I pretty much Scott like the bare
minimum that's what I had when I was in
my 22 I have a 50-50 down package with
verizon now because all I do is stay
home and right there's probably a good
point to cut it off yeah we got to move
on you gotta move on thanks everyone if
