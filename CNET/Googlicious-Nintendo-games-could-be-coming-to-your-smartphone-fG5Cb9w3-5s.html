Google issues for everything Google that
we can pack inside of a show now we
talked about how Google glass appears to
be fading last week but Intel hopes to
re-energize the platform with a new
partnership now The Wall Street Journal
reports Intel will equip the next
version of glass in 2015 with the new
low-energy processor designed to
increase battery life and will replace
the current one by Texas Instruments
that lasts around a day Intel's making a
bigger push into wearable technology and
it currently produces the super
fashionable mica bracelet that has
little mainstream appeal intel is
planning to promote glass to industry
and businesses such as hospital networks
or manufacturers where they believe it
can have a stronger lasting impact and
use case now google continues to push
glass as a consumer device but it still
faces the challenges of price privacy
issues and let's be honest it still
looks awkward in casual settings yes
it's still an evolving platform but last
week we asked some of you to chime in on
your experiences with glass Scott
Boswell says he loves his glass for
daily lab work but it's ahead of its
time John writes in that one of the big
obstacles for glass is that Google isn't
currently allowing devs to monetize
their apps and they expect devs to put
it on the platform for free not very
cool and Kimberly and Graham who's an
explorer says where do you get your
information from I wear my glass every
single day
start to finish I'm telling you that you
don't know what you're talking about or
we live in different realities Kim don't
get so defensive I actually get my
information from this amazing resource
called the internet and personal
experiences so yes maybe we do live in
different realities all right thanks to
everyone for writing in let's check this
out Google Chromebooks continue to make
more strides in education according to
IDC and for the first time ever Google
has overtaken Apple in United States
schools now in q3 of 2014 the goog
shipped 750,000 Chromebooks to schools
while Apple ships
and mm the financial time reports that
Google Chromebooks as a whole now
account for a quarter of the education
market thanks to their starting price at
199 fully functional keyboards no
surprise and the ability to manage them
more easily by IT peeps all right
there's a new report from Sam mobile and
don't get too surprised by this the next
Galaxy S flagship phone will be called
and a drumroll please
the councii s6 and a galaxy s6 edge will
also be coming as well all right it's
part of their project zero initiative we
talked about where they're starting from
scratch to reinvigorate their galaxy
line but changing the name won't be part
of it and no longer will you have to be
a part of the cool Club to get one of
the 1+1 phones tatted by them as the
smartphone killer and really one of the
hottest Android phones to come out this
year it's available for everyone you can
check out the website that will have a
special pricing on it for a few more
days for a 16gb model at $2.99 and the
final story that could be big but might
not mean anything I know don't you love
that forties TechCrunch discovered a
newly published pen by Nintendo that
shows the company is looking to bring
some of its titles to mobile devices
through emulation technology on products
ranging from on seat displays in
airplanes and trains and smartphones now
I've been saying this forever how many
people would buy Super Mario Brothers on
a platform for like 5 to 7 bucks
everyone would so we've seen plenty of
Nintendo emulators in the past that end
up getting shut down in Nintendo hasn't
made any official announcements but it's
the story of the week that let's be
honest it got me a little giddy all
right that's gonna do it for this week's
show thanks so much for watching it
we'll see you all next time for some
more of that Google ishes
