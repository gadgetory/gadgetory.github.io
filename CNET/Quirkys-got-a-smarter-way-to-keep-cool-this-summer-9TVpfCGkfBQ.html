standing here beside the arrow smart
air-conditioner from the team at quirky
and GE this is a connected appliance
that will sync with your smart phone
track when you come and go and learn
from your habits in order to cool your
house more efficiently now we've already
tested and reviewed some other quirky
products like the spotter and the pivot
powered genius they also have some other
cool things like a portfolio that's a
smart piggy bank for your kids but this
is their biggest thing yet three hundred
dollars it is a major appliance and it
has some really cool functionality to it
so first off let's take a look at the
design of this thing it looks great it
looks like a very modern and sleek
appliance it's got the nice white face
with the LED display if I turn this
thing on you'll see the bright blue LEDs
that shine and tell you the current
temperature of the room or what settings
are using looks very nice and futuristic
we're a big fan of that my one problem
with the design is that these fans on
the side they're usually accordion-style
they hug the bottom of the little liner
here these don't they're just like a
single panel they are a little flimsy
and they might let bugs in they might
let a slight breeze in I'm not saying
it's horrible you could fix it with a
piece of duct tape not the biggest deal
but still not a perfect design in our
test the Eros is smart features did
reasonably well the smart budget feature
is one that I like a lot you can set the
exact amount that you want to spend on
your utility bill for the air
conditioner each month and then as you
go through the month it'll track how
much you're using and let you know if
you need to use a little less or if you
can afford to use a lot more it's a
great way to keep on budget there's also
that smart away feature that tracks and
you come and go it uses geofencing to
determine when you've gone more than 100
meters away from your home and then can
switch the air conditioner off or turn
it to a different setting and then do
the same when you come back within that
geo-fenced area that's a cool feature
all in all I like this machine I think
that the price point is especially
attractive three hundred dollars for an
eight thousand BTU unit that's pretty
good that's reasonable most other
non-connected not smart 8000 BTU units
or retail for anywhere from 225 to over
300 so 300 for a smart one that works
well I like that the arrow says an 8,000
BTU air conditioner and that's
good for a room of about 350 square feet
per Energy Star standards and it does a
pretty good job in our test it's a nice
cool machine it gets the room nice and
cold one thing to note about this
machine is that the fan does make some
noise if you're watching TV and you've
got on the high setting it might be a
bit of a distraction it's not a quiet
silent type of machine it definitely
wears a bit but I will say that the
compressor the back part of this air
conditioner is pretty quiet actually it
doesn't buzz it doesn't vibrate
it's just that fan in the front that
makes a little bit of noise so if noise
is really important to you you might
want to look for a different unit but
that said for its nice design and smart
performance I give arrows high marks for
CNET I'm right Chris</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
