Huawei has ever made it's a design that
really drew me in first with this phone
it's a slim all-metal design that's got
polished edges and a really nice sort of
micro edged finish on the back I love
this cool blue color as well which
really sets it apart from the usual
black and gray slabs that normally land
on my desk do you be careful about
scratching it though as you can see I've
already done some damage here with only
a 5.1 inch screen the phone is a lot
smaller than most flagship smartphones
around so it's really comfortable to
hold and use in one hand the camera is
awesome - it's got the same dual lens
setup that we've seen on the p9 albeit
with a higher resolution now one of
these sensors takes photos in color and
the other focuses purely on black and
white and both of them do very well the
color shot are rich and vibrant and the
black and white photos have beautiful
contrast and look great
without even having to do any editing at
all beyond the great camera the phone
has got a decent 64 gig of storage with
a micro SD card slot to add some more
it's got a processor that easily handle
any of a tough life through it and a
decent battery that will get you through
most of the day without too much trouble
you won't find any waterproofing on the
p10 though so do be extra careful when
using it around water or taking phone
calls in the rain particularly given
this phone's quite high price however
although the Kwame p10 is a lovely bit
of kit and if you're after a high
performance phone that fits comfortably
in your palm
this phone is definitely one to consider</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
