saying move over Android because there
is a new challenger in town and it's
called a bun to touch it's a new
smartphone operating system for tablets
and phones and it's here to give Android
a run for its money so a bun to touch is
a brand new smartphone and tablet
operating system at work somebody phones
and tablets you can't buy it yet but
this is a demo version that we're seeing
right here on and Google Nexus 4 and
also on a Google Nexus 7 and it doesn't
reinvent the wheel but it's also really
really slick so the great thing about
abun to touch is that every single side
of the phone is active so you swipe in
to to do things so for example you swipe
in for left you've got this great
shortcut menu here with your apps like
Gmail Twitter Facebook the camera the
phone dialer and so on if you swipe in
from the right then you go across the
apps that you've been in there the
camera app for example so swipe in from
the top you get all different status
indicators like your Wi-Fi and so on and
you've also get your messages and the
great thing about this is you can tap on
a message and you can reply instantly
without having to open them open an app
you just say hi how's it going and hit
Send it's it's really really clever it's
really quick so when you're an app for
example the camera if you swipe in from
the bottom and you get a menu of
different settings for example you if
you want to crop or change the color
balance on your photo then you can do
that right here so that's a bun to touch
and I really really like it I'm really
trying to have seen it look out for more
cool tablet and phone stuff from MWC
right here on CNET</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
