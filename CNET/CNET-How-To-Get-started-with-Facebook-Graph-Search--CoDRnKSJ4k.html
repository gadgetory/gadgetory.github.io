Facebook but the interface was clunky
and it was always really hard to find
what you were looking for now Facebook
is rolling out graph search a much more
robust search tool that lets you search
just about anything friends have shared
with you on facebook so the first thing
to do if you haven't already is sign up
for graph search beta which you can do
by heading over to facebook.com / about
/ graph search and scroll down to the
bottom and hit sign up once you get
graph search facebook will alert you and
your navigation bar will morph into
something that looks like this so the
search bar is on the left and all of
your friend requests messages and
notifications are on the right now you
can use graph search to search the web
and if you search for something like oh
how to find lost iphone it'll redirect
you to a Bing search within Facebook but
most of the time you'll use graph search
to search within facebook content so let
me show you a few examples so i can
search for something like photos i liked
in 2013 and all the photos i liked in
2013 will show up but i can also expand
that search make it more specific by
saying something like photos in 2013 i
liked and commented on and the results
will be much more specific so that's an
example of how you can search within
content that you or your friends have
contributed but you can also search
public facebook content so for example i
can search photos taken in san francisco
california and any photo that was shared
publicly and shot in san francisco will
show up now if you click on the module
on the right you can further refine that
surge by defining photos of people the
date the photo is taken and so on
another fun way to use graph search is
to get recommendations so I can search
for something like books read by CEOs
people who are CEOs and a list of books
read by people who are CEOs will show up
in the result
I can also do something like friends who
like gluten-free restaurants the
possibilities are endless and this might
sound crazy but you might start using
graph search to find a date so watch out
eat harmony because check this out I can
do something like men who live in San
Francisco and like basketball and are
over the age of 25 okay so it looks like
this guy is in a relationship so let's
further refine the search and say single
men who live in San Francisco and like
basketball and are over the age of 25 so
as you get started with graph search
have fun with it find a date or maybe
discover a new restaurant in town it
might change the way you use facebook oh
and before you ask don't worry about
your privacy settings they haven't
changed all graph search does is surface
the data you and your friends have
already contributed with that being said
though you might want to go ahead and
check your privacy settings again go
ahead and visit this link for my blog on
that topic for cnet.com I'm Sharon
