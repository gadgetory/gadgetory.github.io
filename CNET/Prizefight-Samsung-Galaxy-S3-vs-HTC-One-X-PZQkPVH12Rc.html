and this is an epic battle between two
of the biggest boys in the smartphone
world
it's a prizefight punch out between
Samsung's Galaxy s3 on t-mobile and
ACC's 1x on AT&amp;amp;T our judges for this
fight are senior editor Jessica Duke it
out dole court senior editor Bryant
boom-boom Bennett and myself we'll take
all three judges scores and average them
out to the nearest tenth each round the
final prizefight score will be an
average of all rounds using the same
system it's a five round throwdown
round one is designed Samsung's Galaxy
s3 brings a sleek and silky body that's
comfortable to hold with its 4.8 inch
Super AMOLED display that looks great
but has a dimmer screen even with the
brightness turned up it still suffers a
little from its plasticky feel but
overall the design here is still makeout
worthy now HTC's One X also delivers
with a more elegant polycarbonate
plastic backside with a solid weight and
build quality
it's 4.7 inch display is brighter and
pops better it's a little more square on
the corners but I can't say I'm the
biggest fan of its camera lens that
sticks out like a big bump
now these phones both look amazing and
we're calling this round a tie at four
point seven points a piece next round is
user interface and controls both of
these phones bring their own flavors of
Ice Cream Sandwich to the table and
Samsung brings a much more tame down
version of its TouchWiz interface that's
less intrusive and we like its look and
feel it's physical button has multiple
functions to bring you back to the home
screen view your current open apps or
activate its s voice feature hi galaxy
now you'll still have the same
customization for widgets but it still
feels a little like a mishmash with
Gingerbread and Ice Cream Sandwich
now ACC Sense UI has always been one of
our favorites and they do it again with
the One X it's real clean and simple to
use
I love the quick access UI for adding
widgets to your homescreen
it doesn't hide androids Ice Cream
Sandwich and they toned down the
animation from previous versions now ACC
takes this round with a perfect 5 and
Samsung gets a 4 so after averaging 2
rounds a CC leads by half a point next
round is features both phones are loaded
with 4G LTE connectivity Wi-Fi Bluetooth
and the same dual-core 1.5 gigahertz
Snapdragon s4 processor but the s3 is
what I call a feature freak of nature
with this memory expansion slot a
replaceable battery because there are
plenty of you who still love that and it
comes with 2 gigs of RAM which is twice
as much as the other guy for the same
price now comes in 16 gig or 32 gig
options but that's not all
Samsung's s-voice allow you to interact
with your phone with voice commands even
if it's half-baked it does work on some
levels good morning also the ability to
transfer data with sbeam works pretty
seamlessly right out of the gate and the
gesture controls might seem a little
gimmicky but I'd actually use the screen
capture swipe with my palm the HTC One X
comes with 32 gigs of storage but no
memory expansion slot and no replaceable
battery it's differentiating feature is
its beats technology that enhances your
music when they plug in a headphone set
or speaker that enhancer the bass and
audio quality now still
but it just can't compete with all the
extra bells and whistles from Samsung
the galaxy s3 takes this round with the
perfect five and the 1x gets a 3.7 next
round is web browsing and multimedia
these phones feature massive displays
that make web browsing with flash
support and multimedia look great
browsing speeds will depend on the
carrier but neither phone had a real
poor experience now both phones bring
eight megapixel cameras with 1080p video
capture but the galaxy s3 took better
pictures with slightly richer colors and
more detail overall by just a hair and
when it comes to watching video you
can't go wrong on either guy but if
you're using headphones Beats Audio will
make a difference Samsung just gets the
edge in round four with another perfect
five and HTC gets a 4.7 so after four
rounds Samsung is now on top and the
final round that decides it all is
called quality and performance in the
smartphone world performance counts and
both phones really feel fast and
responsive when you're moving through
their menus and UI hey don't feel like
you're losing out with either one of
these
now 4G performance was also solved for
both phones in the san francisco area
now call quality in our tests had the AC
c1x sounding slightly cleaner compared
to the s3 but being on multiple carriers
and different areas will affect the true
result but there was nothing glittering
here that would give one phone an
advantage we're calling this round even
with a tie at five so let's average out
all five rounds and in a prizefight
where acc came out swinging
Samsung chipped away and fought back
with three perfect rounds and the
Samsung Galaxy s3 takes this battle four
point seven to four point six and is
your prize fight winner now you guys
really can't go wrong with two of the
best phones on the market right now but
only one can reign supreme
I'm Bryan Chong thanks for watching and
catch you guys next time for another
five five</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
