refrigerators this year including this
slate finished French door models this
is the PFP to 8km que es and it costs
three thousand dollars for your money
you're getting twenty seven point eight
cubic feet of storage space on the
inside along with this temp select zone
drawer that has its own dedicated
thermostat and an auto fill water
dispenser that'll automatically fill up
your glass pitcher or pot without
overflowing autofill was one of my
favorite fridge features last year I
like it in this year's model - one small
bummer though the precise fill feature
that went along with autofill last year
it's gone in this fridge precise fill
would automatically dish out a certain
amount of water like four cups for a pot
of macaroni in this fridge you don't get
that instead you get this running
counter that keeps track of how much
water you're dishing out that's a nice
touch but it's not as convenient as
precise so another change is a control
panel last year you got a full color LCD
touchscreen and this year's model you
get a touch panel that's built more to
blend into that slate finish it's not
quite as fancy as that full color
touchscreen but it still looks good and
some might actually prefer the subtle
approach that fix inside you get 18
point 6 cubic feet in the fridge
compartment that was enough space for me
to fit all of our test groceries inside
along with all six of our bulky stress
test items but it was definitely more of
a squeeze than I'd be comfortable with
in my own kitchen as for performance the
profile series fridge is a good job of
keeping the body of the fridge interior
below 40 degrees but the top of the left
door kept creeping up above 40 and that
wasn't great but maybe not the biggest
deal you can't really fit that much in
there anyway
at 3,000 dollars you can definitely do
worse than this fridge but if you're
going with GC keep in mind that there
are other profile series and cafe series
models available some of which have that
precise full feature some of which even
have a built in Keurig coffee maker so
you might want to check those out before
settling on this one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
