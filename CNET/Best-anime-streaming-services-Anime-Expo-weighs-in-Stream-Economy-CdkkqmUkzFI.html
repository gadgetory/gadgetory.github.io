which is why I decided to come down to
Anime Expo and ask the fans what their
favorite anime is and because this is a
stream economy we're going to take their
answers and figure out which streaming
services offer those shows so may the
best streaming service win what is your
all-time favorite anime it would have to
be fate/zero I'd see one piece right now
because I'm just as Sanji either Tokyo
ghoul or my hero academia
well.here academia my favorite anime is
my hero academia obviously that's a
popular answer today
I really like Soul Eater probably fruits
basket you're lying april Outlaw start
it's a tie between Sailor Moon and
Cowboy Bebop the world god only knows
JoJo's Bizarre Adventure and what is an
underrated anime that you recommend that
maybe not a lot of people have seen I
think people have forgotten about blue
exorcist recently and I really like that
one I'd sail and illustrious death
parade yes okay baskets baskets razor oh
it's called my love story I would say
the world god only knows published
Einstein's game good choice good choice
I like it
now we've got some great answers it's
time to pick those streaming services
against each other out of the 18
different shows attendees mentioned it
looks like Funimation and crunchyroll
had nine and ten shows available
respectively Hulu on the other hand came
up huge with 14 of those 18 shows
available to stream at the time of this
recording but ah Amazon and Netflix you
got some work to do Hulu take your W you
earned it regardless of the winner
you're probably already subscribed to a
streaming service that offers you tons
of the anime options you just might not
know it well now I get to go have fun
