digital slim cordless vacuum hasn't
changed much on the outside but with
each new generation the company makes
his high-end portable VAX more powerful
improving the battery life in the case
of Dyson's latest and greatest model the
digital slim DC 59 animal the company is
billing it as a conventional vacuum
replacement saying it offers three times
more suction power than any other
cordless vacuum on the market battery
life has also improved from about 20
minutes to 26 minutes that time drops to
6 minutes if you engage the max power
button which gives you an extra boost
for those tougher cleaning jobs the
technology driving this suction number
and the vacuum itself is a new v6 motor
that Dyson says is one and a half times
as powerful as the previous motor like
other digital slim models the DC 59
comes with an assortment of attachments
including a detachable long reach wand
and motorized head with carbon filaments
for cleaning hard floors a step-down
model the DC 58 which costs half the
price leaves off the wand and motorized
head Dyson refers to the DC 58 as a
handheld model because it's not designed
to take the place of a conventional
upright vacuum and really is just a hand
back both the DC 58 and DC 59 come with
a combination tool that has a nozzle
that converts into a brush tool for
dusting they also come with a
wall-mounted accessory that allows you
to create a docking station for the vac
of course you want to put that docking
station near a power outlet so you could
easily recharge the unit when not in use
while it appliances team in Louisville
will put this back through its rigorous
testing regime in conducting our full
review I've been playing around with it
a bit and I have to say I'm pretty
impressed I haven't used a more powerful
hand vac and it definitely feels like it
has more suction than the previous model
the DC 44 I did notice that it seems to
run slightly warmer or at least the air
being expelled during operation seems a
bit warmer and doesn't seem to be any
quieter for smaller apartments in other
small spaces I do think the DC 59 can
take the place of a conventional vacuum
it does have a couple of small drawbacks
however all the vac is equipped with a
new one touch bin emptying system which
makes it easy to get rid of the detritus
you collect the bin is pretty small and
fills up
quickly when cleaning dirtier
environments the other more glaring
drawback is the price previous models
listed for 39.99 but you'll have to pay
an extra $100 or for $99.99 to take this
home with you
hopefully that price will come down over
time because $500 is an awful lot to
spend for a cordless vac even the
ultimate one but if you can do without
the extra floor cleaning tools the less
expensive DC 58 is the way to go it's
also pricey at $250 but 250 sounds a
whole lot less than 500 I'm David Carr
