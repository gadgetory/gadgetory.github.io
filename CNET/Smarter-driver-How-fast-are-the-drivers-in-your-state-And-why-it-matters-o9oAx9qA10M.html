the National maximum speed law
it began federal control of top highway
speed and rested that away from the
states he ride it in song and hated by
millions 55 miles per hour was supposed
to save two percent of auto fuel
consumption an amount that is trivial
today compared to the saving as if
technology has a come by 1995 the law
was repealed when we got back to an
interesting patchwork of speedla Texas
currently has the highest road speed in
the u.s. 85 miles an hour on highway 130
between Austin and San Antonio Alaska
and DC they post the lowest at 55
maximum but more relevant to a state's
fastness is the average of all posted
speed limits on its interstates and
highways cars calm painted a picture of
that using day they're from the
governor's Highway Safety Association
Texas is tops as you might imagine at 78
miles per hour average Idaho's postings
are right up there averaging 77 then
it's a tie between Wyoming and Maine at
75 on the bottom and DC in Alaska it was
post 55 and average 55 now since 55 was
repealed US road fatalities have gone
from a little under 42,000 a year to
under 34,000 in 2012 about a 25 percent
decline but that's all fatalities on all
roads if you just look at the high-speed
roads the IIHS says a 2009 study in the
American Journal of Public Health found
a 9% increase in road fatalities on
rural interstates since 1995 those are
the roads where top speed limits are
most often seen they suggest an impact
at 80 miles an hour versus 55 puts a lot
more force on the stuff bouncing around
inside your car namely you and your
passengers it pays to double check the
speed limit but also your speed relative
to other traffic as well as the
conditions of your car the road
and you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
