smartphones at the moment but there's
just one problem they're all absolutely
massive if you are after something
smaller though this one might be worth
checking out it's the Xperia z1 compact
let's take a look so as you probably
guess from the name this is just like an
experience at one but a bit smaller it's
got a 4.3 inch screen it's a 720p
display I'm quite impressed at first
blush with that with that screen
everything seems quite sharp color seem
very vivid as well elsewhere everything
has been kept basically the same as it
is on the z1 so this phone is waterproof
so it should survive a trip down the
toilet and it's got a 20 point seven
megapixel camera on the rear as well
that's a lot of megapixels for a phone
this size of course that doesn't always
tell the whole story about picture
quality so I'll be interested to see how
this actually affairs when we give it
the full review treatment it feels very
slick to use it's powered by a quad-core
2.2 gigahertz processor so I suspect
it'll be able to handle some intensive
gaming other things like that it's going
to be available globally in the first
few months of 2014 Sony tells me that
you can expect this to be a bit cheaper
than the Zed one as well which makes
sense given its compact size I quite
like it and on the big fan of waterproof
phones as well I'm the west road to cnet
let me know what you think and check out
Cesc netcom for more
