around privacy safety and democracy and
you will rightfully have some hard
questions for me to answer before I talk
about the steps we're taking to address
them I want to talk about how we got
here
Facebook is an idealistic and optimistic
company for most of our existence we
focused on all the good that connecting
people can do and as Facebook has grown
people everywhere have gotten a powerful
new tool for staying connected to the
people they love for making their voices
heard and for building communities and
businesses just recently we've seen the
me2 movement and the March for our lives
organized at least in part on Facebook
after hurricane Harvey people came
together to raise more than 20 million
dollars for relief and more than 70
million biz small businesses use
Facebook to create jobs and grow but
it's clear now that we didn't do enough
to prevent these tools from being used
for harm as well and that goes for fake
news foreign interference and elections
and hate speech as well as developers
and data privacy we didn't take a broad
enough view of our responsibility and
that was a big mistake
and it was my mistake and I'm sorry I
started Facebook I run it and I'm
responsible for what happens here after
more than a decade of promises to do
better how is today's apology different
and why should we trust Facebook to make
the necessary changes to ensure user
privacy and give people a clearer
picture of your privacy policies Thank
You mr. chairman
so we have made a lot of mistakes in
running the company I think it's it's
pretty much impossible I believe to
start a company in your dorm room and
then grow it to be at the scale that
we're at now without making some
mistakes and because our service is
about helping people connect and
information those mistakes have been
different in how they we try not to make
the same mistake multiple times but in
general a lot of the mistakes are around
how people connect to each other just
because of the nature of the search
overall I would say that we're going
through a broader philosophical shift in
how we approach our responsibility as a
company for the first 10 or 12 years of
the company I viewed our responsibility
as primarily building tools that if we
could put those tools in people's hands
then that would empower people to do
good things what I think we've learned
now across a number of issues not just
data privacy but also fake news and
foreign interference and elections is
that we need to take a more proactive
role in a broader view of our
responsibility it's not enough to just
build tools we need to make sure that
they're used for good and that means
that we need to now take a more active
view in policing the ecosystem and in
watching and kind of looking out and
making sure that all of the members in
our community are using these tools in a
way that's gonna be good and healthy so
at the end of the day this is going to
be something where people will measure
us by our results on this it's not that
I expect that anything I say here today
to necessarily change people's view but
I'm committed to getting this right and
I believe that over the coming years
once we fully work all these solutions
through people will see real real
differences
Facebook's been served as subpoenas for
the special counselor's office is that
correct yes if you were anyone at
Facebook but interviewed by the special
counsels office yes have you been
interviewed I have not I have not others
have I believe so and I want to be
careful here because that our work with
the special counsel is confidential and
I want to make sure that in an open
session I'm not revealing something
that's confidential
who's there there's one made clear that
you have been contacted you have
actually let me clarify that I I
actually am not aware of a subpoena I
believe that there may be but I know
we're working with them thank you you're
chief operating officer Ms Sandberg
suggested on the NBC Today Show that
Facebook users who do not want their
personal information
used for advertising might have to pay
for that protection pay for it are you
actually considering having facebook
users pay for you not to use that
information
senator people have a control over how
their information is used in ads in the
product today so if you want to have an
experience where your ads aren't you
aren't targeted using all the
information that we have available you
can turn off third-party information
what we found is that even though some
people don't like ads people really
don't like ads that aren't relevant and
while there is some discomfort for sure
with using information in making ads
more relevant the overwhelming feedback
that we get from our community is that
people would rather have us show
relevant content there than not so we
offer this control that either you're
referencing some people use it it's not
the majority of people on Facebook and
and I think that that's that's a good
level of control to offer I think what
Cheryl was saying was that in order to
not run ads at all we would still need
some sort of business model and that is
your business model so I take it that
and I use the harmless example of
chocolate but if it got into more
personal thing communicating with
friends and I want to cut it off I'm
gonna have to pay you in order not to
send me using my personal information
something that I don't want that in
essence is what I understood Miss Anne
Berg to say is that correct yes senator
although to be clear we don't offer an
option today for people to pay to not
show ads we think offering an
ad-supported service is the most aligned
with our mission of trying to help
connect everyone in the world because we
want to offer a free service that
everyone can afford okay that's the only
way that we can reach billions of people
so therefore you can
my personally identifiable data the
company's data not my data is that it no
senator
actually at the first line of our Terms
of Service say that you control and
owned the information and content that
you put on Facebook you don't think you
have a monopoly
all right certainly doesn't feel like
that to me
here's the question that all of us kind
of answered what do we tell our
constituents given what's happened here
while we should let you self-regulate
what would you tell people in South
Carolina that given all the things we've
just discovered here it's a good idea
for us to rely upon you to regulate your
own business practices
well senator my position is not that
there should be no regulation I think
the internet is increasing in embrace
regulation I think the real question as
the Internet becomes more important in
people's lives is what is the right
regulation not whether there should be
you as a company welcomed regulation I
think if it's the right regulation then
you think the Europeans have it right I
think that they get things right have
you ever submitted that's true
so would you work with us in terms of
what regulations you think are necessary
in your industry
absolutely okay would you submit this
and proposed regulations yes and I'll
have my team follow up with you so that
way we can have this discussion across
the different categories where I think
that this discussion needs to look
forward to it would you support a child
online privacy bill of rights for kids
under 16 to guarantee that that
information is not reused for any other
purpose without explicit permission from
the parents or the kids senator I think
that as a general principle I think
protecting people protecting minors and
protecting their privacy is extremely
important and we do a number of things
on facebook to do that already which I'm
happy I'm talking about a law I'm
talking about a lot would you support a
law to ensure that kids under 16 have
this privacy Bill of Rights I had this
conversation with you in your office
seven years ago about this specific
in palo alto and and i think that's
really what the american people want to
know right now what is the protections
of this what are the protections that
are going to be put on the books for
their families but especially for their
children would you support a privacy
Bill of Rights for kids where opt-in is
the standard yes or no senator I think
that that's an important principle and
precinct and I think we should we need a
law to protect those children that's my
question - do you believe we need a lot
to do so yes or no senator I'm not sure
if we need a law but I think that this
is certainly a thing that that discard
that that deserves a lot of discussion
and I again I couldn't disagree with you
more other we're leaving these children
to the most rapacious commercial
predators in the country who will
exploit these children unless we
absolutely have a law on the books and
absolutely scary sure please give a
short answer senator I look forward to
having my team follow up to flesh out
the details of it I don't think this is
like Senator play to get a grip correct
answer Thank You mr. chairman</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
