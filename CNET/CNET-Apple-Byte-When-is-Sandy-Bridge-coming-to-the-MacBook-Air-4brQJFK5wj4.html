the apple pie for all the good and bad
inside the world of apple let's get to
the show now the latest macbook pros
have been outfitted with Sandy Bridge
processors so when should we expect to
see them in the macbook airs according
to hard Mac Intel is just about ready to
launch their ultra low voltage CPUs that
would be compatible the core i5 2537 em
chip is clocked at one point 4 gigahertz
and features a turbo mode reaching two
point three gigahertz it also removes
the need for nvidia graphics since the
graphics are integrated within the
processor now seen it has reported that
revamped MacBook Airs will be updated in
June and this release would enable them
to fall in that timetable so if you're
waiting for a sandy bridge air like I am
then June can't come soon enough noun
other product news rumors plenty of
people were disappointed with the lack
of a camera on the latest ipod nano it's
the same nano use like a watch that
makes you look like a douchebag but
according to taiwanese site apple pro
the next gen nano might be bringing back
the camera check out this picture now i
know we're always a little skeptical
with these types of posts but the blurry
spy cam shot does have a strong
resemblance to the current nanos housing
an apple pro was the first to leak the
redesign nano screen now September is
the time for an ipod refresh so we'll
find out around then now also if you
want to look into the future even more
patently Apple has revealed the big a
has won a patent for an all new hybrid
display port and USB 3.0 high-speed
connector it will use the same 30 pin
connector we're familiar with and it
shows the ipod has being one of the
first devices to use this but it will
also be used on future mac hardware and
if you thought there wasn't any room to
put more buttons on the iphone or ipod
touch the big a has also applied for
another patent described as a smart
bezel this smart bezel would be an
illuminated secondary display that would
show off illuminated indicators on the
bezel and they could morph into various
controls for work and play there were
talks about Apple completely removing
the home button in future products and
this could be the solution to that
alright that's some cool stuff but you
know what's even cooler our iPhone

version for 499 but it's one of the

to address battery and performance
issues and possibly bring the verizon
iphone 4 up to speed since it's still
stuck on 4.2 also a lot of you been
asking about the next release of final
cut pro and according to rumors apples
requiring sponsors of apples April
twelfth meet up for final cut pro
professional to cancel their
presentations so that Apple can have the
stage time necessary to show off the
next FCP now reps from both canon an
avid confirm they were canceled as
presenters but for final cut users it'll
be worth it since people who have seen
the product in action describe it is
jaw-dropping now the loop reports that
Microsoft will be releasing the office
for mac 2011 service pack 1 which will
see some improvements but also bring
support for syncing calendars to iOS
devices via sync services microsoft also
just released the big app specifically
for the ipad with voice search and
mapping functions as well as news
weather movie listings and more and this
