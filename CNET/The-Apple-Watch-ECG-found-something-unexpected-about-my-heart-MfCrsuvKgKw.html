to a 12-lead EKG now I'm gonna compare
the results of this test versus the one
lead EKG on the Apple watch if I look at
my apps now I'll notice that there's now
an EKG app it's these squiggly lines
over here and it's pretty simple to use
I just put my finger on the digital
crown and it starts taking the EKG
counts down for about thirty seconds and
it actually shows it live as it's
happening so we see that you have these
two narrow beats and it intermittently
you have this wider early beat that that
one right there that one right there so
normal normal early normal normal early
and that matches what we see on the EKG
where you have normal normal early and
wide so this would be really useful to
screen for this or to to have the first
understanding that you have these early
beats it wouldn't tell us precisely
where in the heart apart from the fact
that it's coming from the lower chamber
where is this 12 lead EKG that gives us
essentially a fuller picture can tell us
precisely where in the lower chamber
that's coming from and am I going to die
is something wrong with me you are not
going to die
these early beats are very common in
some people they can lead to problems in
the long term but let's take a look at
how this actually works on the Apple
watch an update to watch os gave users
access to two fda-cleared features on
the Apple watch
an irregular heart rhythm notification
and an EKG app exclusive to the series
for both of which could warn users of
potentially life-threatening heart
conditions heart rate is not new to the
Apple watch or wearables in general so
the optical sensor on fitness trackers
or smartwatches essentially uses changes
in light that is reflected based on the
Hulse when the heart beats and more
blood is pumped into the vessels more
light gets absorbed between beats when
there's less blood more light gets
reflected back into the receivers the
Apple watch also uses this optical
sensor to measure heart rhythm and
alerts users when the pattern suggests
atrial fibrillation a heart condition
which can increase your risk of stroke
and other serious heart complications so
the heart rate is the frequency of the
heartbeat over time but doesn't tell you
anything about the pattern of those
beats the rhythm has more to do with the
relative spacing of those beats but to
get a definitive diagnosis the doctor
needs more information we would want to
have an electrical confirmation of a
diagnosis of HIV relation before we
decide on acting on that and not base it
in general on the pulse recording alone
that's where the EKG comes in the EKG or
electrocardiogram uses electrodes to
measure the electrical activity that
results from each expansion and
contraction of the heart the Apple watch
has one electrode on the back crystal
and one electrode on the digital crown
place your finger on the digital crown
to close the circuit and stay still for
30 seconds to get a read so that's
creating the same sort of connection
between your left arm and your right arm
but the results from the single lead EKG
on the Apple watch
which users can share as a PDF with
their doctors gave dr. Marcus enough
information to detect my early heartbeat
and could help doctors reach a diagnosis
sooner and so there's this hope that we
might detect those people who did
otherwise didn't know they had H or
fibrillation and then treat them
appropriately the flipside is that we
recognize there's a risk of false
positive results the Apple watch is the
only direct to consumer device with a
built-in EKG but there are other devices
like the cardio band that let you take
an EKG outside the doctor's office Apple
watch competitors like Arman and Fitbit
are also working to improve their heart
rate monitoring as more tech companies
focus on health care as a way to breathe
new life into wearables I probably don't
have afib but I would have never known
about my early heartbeat without an EKG
and now I might just have to pay another
visit to dr. Marcus to get it checked
out
