mile electric road trip we navigated the
Tesla Model S south from London then
under the sea aboard the Eurotunnel
shuttle we've left the car charging in a
rainy hotel car park in Calais in
preparation for our epic day's drive
down to the town of a ranch meanwhile
Luke and I have gone in search of food
so we've lucked out slightly yeah out of
the cold and into continental buffet
it's not just the electrical supercars
though on this trip is it though and if
we're using electricity for all kinds of
things for example I mean here you'll
see eggs being cooked through the
application of eating and ranking
appliances kills about an hour but every
minute we wait means more range for the
next stage at last it's time to key in
our next charge point 200 miles away the
car isn't keen though and wants to take
us there via another charge points in
Lille we don't want to get stranded so
we trust the car the car it's it's very
easy to drive it's very smooth very
similar to other electric experiences
we've both had I think would that befits
an answer that's fair
yeah it's eerily silent very smooth
accelerations with ghosts away very very
satisfying way and
you could feel the power we can feel it
but with the car requesting a detour we
aren't using it for fear of burning
through our range cautiously we make our
way down the motorway to Lille stop here
for about 20 minutes give it a quick
boost then get on our way you should
have enough power to get to the next
stop anyway but actually it kind of can
but as we cruise down to our next
charger we haven't fully realized the
toll that stopping an extra charges is
taking on our schedule for now it's a
bite to eat a power nap and the
companionship of our animal friends
later - there was - device but it wasn't
because that's the one when we should
have gone from Calais to the charger and
it didn't it took us to a different one
on routes so whether it lets us go
directly from here - dude we'll see it
doesn't the car wants us to make another
halfway stop even though the range
indicator does suggest we could make it
all the way as the detour takes us
further and further from anything
resembling a motorway we start to get a
bad feeling the detour is slow the roads
are slower we're not convinced if it's
worth the trade-off in time it's a
little bit tough really because we don't
know how smart the computer is like if
what is if is taking everything into
account I just missed a turning
I thought that was that's a dirt road we
are now cruising through very rural
France on these tiny little roads how
this happened why is this happened where
are we what's going on we don't really
know where we are I'm hungry
it's going to get dark soon we should
really have remembered that on an
electric trip detours don't just add
driving time they add charging time too
and if the charge your detouring too is
a little out of the way your travel time
can quickly balloon out of control
having topped up the cars charge of a
next stop we make a tough call our
initial plan was to get into orange in
southern France for 6:00 p.m. that it
turns out was wildly unrealistic because
it's now half past six and we would
still have four and a half hours just of
driving time to get to orange from here
excluding two hours of charge about two
hours of charge as well now we are going
to stay in a hotel south of Lian which
is about two hours less time at 10:30
p.m. after nearly 20 hours on the road
and 600 miles traveled
we arrive at our impromptu stop for the
night an Ibis hotel with a charging
station we've made terrible time but hey
we're not stranded and we saw some
chickens tomorrow
Barcelona
if it says we've got a hundred
kilometers spare then we can make them
cause making a new noise</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
