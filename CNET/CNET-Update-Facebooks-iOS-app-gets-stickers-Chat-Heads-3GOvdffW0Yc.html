collection I'm Bridget Carey and this is
your CNET update Google released more
details and specs about the first
limited edition version of Google glass
eye where there are no speakers you'll
hear sounds through bone conduction
technology where the sound waves travel
through your skull to your inner ear it
has a 5 megapixel camera that can
capture video in 720p the battery said
to last a day but video recording and
doing live video chat hangouts will
drain it faster and these early models
will have GPS and text messaging but
only when paired with the Android
operating system 4.0.3 or higher also
users will not see any advertisements
while using it at least for now
all the developers working on apps for
glass have been told they can't have any
ads in their apps
so it seems Google wants to keep ads out
of your eyeball while you warm up to the
idea of wearing a computer on your face
only a select group of developers and
those who entered a contest were able to
get the opportunity to buy Google glass
but here's something Android fans can
order now the galaxy s4 pre-orders have
begun for 18 T and US Cellular and the
phones will ship on April 30th Facebook
updated its iOS app to include shot
heads and a new thing called stickers
it's not the same as chat heads on
Android on Apple these chat icons can
only be seen within the Facebook app and
in a message
iOS users can send these oversized
animated characters called stickers
which are currently free to send social
media always becomes a tool for quickly
spreading information about a disaster
or emergency and that of course was true
for the bombings at the Boston Marathon
what's noteworthy from a tech
perspective is that law enforcement
could be helped in their investigation
by all the photos and videos taken by
the thousands of spectators at the
marathon with smartphones making it easy
to record it could become a
crowd-sourced record of what happened
Boston police took to Twitter to ask
people for video of the finish line and
the
became a resource to track down loved
ones through databases put up by Google
and the Red Cross and these online
resources are important because cell
networks are not reliable when there's a
massive increase in voice calls during
an emergency in Boston shortly after the
attack networks were down but text
messages worked and that's important to
remember if you ever need to reach
someone in a crisis use text messages
text data travels on a different
pipeline than voice calls and if it's
backed up text messages will wait in a
queue to be sent
unlike calls that simply disconnect
that's your tech news update you can
