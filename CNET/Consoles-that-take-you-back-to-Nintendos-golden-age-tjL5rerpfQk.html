this massive cause of coffee table this
is so cool this is actually called the
mega table and it's made my company
called retro between Jews bringing back
all the retro games of your childhood or
your teenage years or however whatever
all of you are and it is a coffee table
that is actually functioning and it's
running a console that can play super
nintendo nintendo and sega more on that
later but but let's look at this table
because it is really cool it is meant
more for a bar scenario it's going to
cost around five hundred dollars
although I mean it's meant to be played
with two players probably while drinking
so think about coordination on that one
times and I'm dead so let's just move on
massive coffee table so cool this is the
actual console that the coffee table is
running out and this is from the same
company retro bit and as I said before
it can actually power the old Super
Nintendo cartridges Nintendo cartridges
and Sega cartridges and it's in HD so
it's a new take on an old gaming device
it's actually running one my favorite
mario karts not the same controller but
let's give it a try oh i'm way behind at
this point
not fair I'm a little bit rusty guys
sorry I used to be so much better at
this but yeah same same feel same look
and feel same frustration of mario kart
let's move on this is actually going to
be available in May of this year for
around eighty dollars the cool thing is
if you did save all these cartridges you
can really use them or just grab them on
ebay I'm sure they're lying around
somewhere let's move on to the shining
jewel the super retro boy so for all you
Game Boy fans it is back in a new form
factor this is the super retro boy so it
basically works the same as a an
original Gameboy but you'll notice it's
backlit and it's rechargeable no more
double a batteries and it actually runs
the same cartridges again if you by
chance save the cartridges of these
games you can use them again or they're
also inta in talks with the publishers
of some of these retro games to see
about re re making some of the
cartridges so let's take a look oh look
at that i'm back back into my childhood
so fun so much better backlit for sure
game changer literally and this will be
available in august of this year for
around eighty dollars as well anyway
