is Steven Beecham producer of that Apple
byte extra crunchy podcast with your
host mr. Brian Tong what's up everybody
hey welcome to the show we can't do the
show without your Beach you know it's
Beach and tonk all right Long Beach in
town all alone what's up everybody
welcome to show it is episode 106 this
is Apple byte extra crunchy our
complimentary piece to the Apple byte
video podcast which I think it should be
dropping in a little bit quite honestly
but we like to you know add on
additional stories that have happened
that are developing it's always changing
every day we try and keep you current
and this is really where we can talk
about all those things but you ladies
and gentlemen boys and girls that are
listening are always a part of the show
we had like over 20 calls or something
ridiculous this week right Beach yeah it
was heavy on the calls and thank you
guys was awesome a lot of good cause so
you did Whittle them down but if you
guys want to be a part of the show again
call us at
who's gonna say three years old that's
really young since the last time they
updated it bro that's crazy man I feel
like almost ever I'd say like every
other week someone asks me on Twitter or
something like what's going on with the
Mac Mini everyone thought we'd see some
sort of a refresh you know it's kind of
a sad it's a sad Apple it's a sad Apple
birthday for the Mac Mini which has not
seen a single refresh you know the
thanks to that the Mac Mini was kind of
like a breakthrough you know it's just
the small tiny device it was like a
full-on desktop computer and I did yes
sir and everything I did have a lot of
friends who owned them and used them and
like lived and died by them you know and
and I'm surprised that they just have
not updated it for three years or just
pretty unreal so we hit we get a lot of
calls and sometimes we do answer
questions within the show because the
topic comes up that you that you asked
us so our boy from our boy faz we think
it's fast not fat but faz from Toronto
asks specifically what's going on with
the Mac Mini well lo and behold a Mac
rumors user sent I'll you know an email
over to Tim Cook and like Steve Jobs did
in the past
sometimes we get lucky he responds and
then these type of the emails are put up
on the net for us to see the readers
name was crore and he asked Tim Cook
straight up like I love the Mac Mini but
it's been over three years now without
an update are we going to see anything
in the pipeline anytime soon
Tim replied and said I'm glad you love
Mac Mini we love it too our customers
have found so many creative and
interesting uses for Mac Mini while it
is not time to share any details we do
plan for Mac Mini to be an important
part of our product line going forward
best Tim that's funny though you like
replied to it and was so like PR it was
such PR speak but I also I also like how
he has adopted the official terminology
where Apple has created their own
language you noticed not in that entire
thing he's never seen never said the Mac
Mini yeah
he just said I'm glad you love Mac Mini
and remember this is a while ago for
people they don't
I believe was either it was Phil
Schiller when it was asked specifically
like how do you say the iPhone or
multiple iPhones he responded that
iPhone is just you don't say the iPhone
you just say iPhone and your timeout
singular iPhone it's an iPhone and if
it's multiple it's still iPhones you
could say I have 35 iPhone yeah that's
how we're supposed to say it according
to Apple
it's singular have 35 are all right
singular and plural somehow my family
owns five iPhone I've owned five iPhone
in my life it's just making us dumber
we're just we're becoming dumber I can't
I can't get over that so anyways the
letter Tim Cook says it's coming it's
also aligns most likely with their kind
of plans for the Mac Pro which they
clearly completely ignored drop the ball
didn't care about and only really
responded if you recall after there was
like a render of what a Mac Pro could
look like and the community and people
started like started talking about it
and getting mad about the Mac Pro and
then all of a sudden apples like oh yeah
people don't really like the the
trashcan Mac Pro we should probably
create a modular customizable one that
professionals like so we'll see what it
comes out but Mac Mini look obviously
this clearly confirms in my mind that
there's nothing that's gonna happen in
2017 and if anything we'll see something
in 2018
three years without an refresh is is
forever in the tech world especially
with computers that's a long time to go
without a single refresh oh yeah big
time
big time so there's your update files
and everyone else that was asking about
we're gonna jump over to kind of keep
you all updated with the latest iPhone
news there's a few stories that have
been popping around the latest is we
have talked constantly about how the
iPhone is expected to be in high demand
and the product and supply won't be able
to meet that we talked about a few
stories where the initial estimation was
somewhere
like fifty million units then it dropped
to forty five and forty and then I think
last week we said estimations have been
pegged at thirty five million units at
least to get out there I believe by the
end of 2017 well a new report according
to digit Times and other sources have
now said that Apple ten suppliers are
reportedly going to be on schedule to
meet at least the 2017 production demand
you have to remember that production
demand is different than consumer demand
production demand is really more of a
number based on how many they thought
they'd be able to produce they would set
that benchmark
whereas consumer demand is gonna be a
lot higher than that and it's still
going to be a hard phone to get so at
least it's not I think it would be worse
if they said that they wouldn't they
aren't going to be able to meet their
production goals that would be even a
bigger problem but according to a few
reports from digit times and others uh
that's not the case the other report
that we have going out here is that we
know that a lot of people are just
waiting for the iPhone 8 and 8 plus
according to Reuters citing China's
economic Daily News the iPhone 8 and 8
plus production will reportedly drop
nearly 50 percent once iPhone 10
launches Wow which is a big this is a
big drop right there's already been
reports that the iPhone 8 and 8 plus
Apple hasn't talked heard they have not
been bragging about its numbers and
clearly this is because most people are
waiting for the 10 although there are
plenty people that are getting the 8
it's just it's not like the 8 is doing
bonkers there were even early reports
that the iPhone 7 is currently
outselling the iPhone 8 but Apple would
not confirm that they also didn't deny
it either yeah so so when the iPhone X
ships they're gonna cut cut production
on the iPhone 8 50% is what that said
right exactly and then that that would
make sense if if clearly the numbers and
the pre-orders tell them where all the
demand is going right then they know ok
fine maybe we have to tweak our numbers
that that's the that's the beauty of
pre-orders at least for a manufacturer
they can kind of then shift and adjust
how they've plotted out or planned for
these 2 for the phone to come out and
what inventory levels they Alec
so there you go iPhone 8a plus I don't
know if it's a shocker per se but that
story just came out in addition with
other iPhone news we know our friend
Ming Chu quo from Kei securities who
drops all types of knowledge and rumors
and bombs on us according to him all I
phone models in 2018 will likely abandon
fingerprint recognition again all phone
models in 2018 were likely to get rid of
touch ID from Apple now according to quo
Apple is going to completely embrace
face ID it looks at it as a competitive
advantage over Android smartphones we we
talked about how Android manufacturers
have been kind of trying to figure out
and sourcing and looking for requests
from similar face ID / true depth 3d
scanning sensors for security purposes
for future phones from Android he said I
think the report was it the requests
were up two to threefold three times
what they normally are Apple looks at
this as a competitive advantage again
we'll have to wait to see how much
faster it is I think if they can make it
almost as fast as touch ID not this year
but let's say in another year so I think
it'll be great
but we will see we we don't have a phone
in our hands right now we don't use it
every day so we can't really say that
for sure but it's but you know touch I
touch ideas still suit like I use touch
ID all the time on my phone still yeah
yeah you know like last week this was
like just a big question and a lot of
stories came out just last week about
that but um so no we're not gonna expect
anything under the screen that's done
not gonna think about that anymore right
that all indications point to that is
not part of Apple's plan all right man
so everyone's gonna have to completely
change the behavior and your phone's
gonna know what you look like and it's
kind of a whole new world and they'll
totally do it because they were they
won't buy another phone you're in the
ecosystem baby you're trapped we're all
trapped in this thing man we're trapped
I do remember a story last week too that
I forget some analysts group
addicted that Apple was like what two
years in front of everyone else in terms
of that technology the face scanning
taking there were two or three years
with it right yep that is correct sir so
mean she quote Ming ching-kuo was the
one that actually put out that article
that it would take around two or three
years for Android to catch up at least
with the technology again the technology
is more advanced from a standpoint of it
is more secure but it hasn't proven to
be faster yet that's where it has to
evolve so like I put I put my
fingerprint on the back of a pixel and
it's super fast I put my fingerprint on
the front of an iPhone and it's super
fast will face ID be that fast all
indications say not really but it's not
slow either right yeah it's also like
the first iteration of face ID that
we've seen so it only improve over time
but I still just the creep factor of
your phone just like seeing you all the
time and knowing it's you it's just
creepy to me but it's no it is creepy
it's it's kind of its kind of creepy all
right here's some I don't know if this
is shocking news we talked about the
foldable flexible phone last week this
comes out from the Korea Herald via the
investor Apple is reportedly mulling the
idea of launching a stylus compatible
with the iPhone believed to be a new
iteration of the Apple pencil now an
iPhone with pencil support could
potentially launch as early as 2019 the
sources say that this iPhone is going to
likely adopt a supercapacitor stylus
type for pricey benefits different from
the Galaxy Notes pen which is an
electromagnetic resonance technology it
needs additional components to be
installed underneath that smartphone
display this supercapacitor type is
actually cheaper to make we don't I
don't know how much more accurate it is
or if the if the accuracy is the same
that then it won't matter if we don't
feel it then it just won't matter we do
know that back induced December of 2015
patents had surfaced from patently Apple
revealing that Apple is working
within a Apple pencil that functions on
an iPhone as well as a wider range of
applications and devices from Apple O's
it was a it basically supported the use
of some sort of a stylus on all devices
we know Apple is exploring this we know
Apple is exploring foldable flexible
phones we know that the bezel is phone
aged is here to stay as well so this is
just it's it what's interesting to me is
that you know we had can you pull up you
know what I always love this it is dated
and times have changed but did you see
that link I put up for the Steve Jobs
video clip let's just this is again from
like Mac world I believe 2007 and this
is how Steve Jobs at that moment in time
felt about a stylus how are we gonna
communicate this we don't want to carry
around a mouse right so what are we
gonna do Oh a stylus right we're gonna
use a stylus No who wants a stylus you
have to give them and put them away and
you'll lose him yuck nobody wants a
stylus so let's not use a stylus we're
gonna you guys the best pointing device
in the world we're gonna use a pointing
device that we're all born with were
born with ten of them we're gonna use
our fingers we're gonna touch us with
our fingers and we have invented a new
technology called multi-touch all right
that's great great this is a funny sound
bite it's so so funny so look it's
hilarious the note is an amazing product
and again this was back in that time
like the note can do so many things that
are fun and it's again it's not for
everyone it's if you want that
experience and you want to be able to
use your phone that way I just you know
Apple has talked so much crap about just
not having a stylus historically even
after SJ and when SJ dropped that
keynote
they've always been anti styles and it's
just interesting how we see this
happening and most likely we'll see one
in the next let's say two three years or
so but I just wonder how their story
will change right yeah yeah like I'm
curious what its gonna be
I'm curious if it's gonna like connect
to the phone or something in or how
they're gonna market it you know
that's gonna be a big thing that we're
gonna that's gonna be interesting is how
they gonna market it to everyone cuz
it's very clear Steve Jobs did not want
a stylist now they're doing it so they
have to explain why and the patent also
not only covers things like an iPhone
but also included a MacBook as well so
when I talk about this stylist
functionality it's across their entire
product line yeah so it's something that
obviously Apple is working on and
they've always been working on it so we
will see all right should we take a
little breather and show some love to
our lovely sponsor let's do it let's do
it all right check this out Apple device

lock down their iPad get off the iPad
locked up it's lockdown login now
alright so check a little icon for you
for all your icon lovers
alright Lissa also kind of keep you
updated this is related to Apple we know
that you heard about that whole crack
Wi-Fi vulnerability over the past week
that everyone was freaking out of
out basically it was a vulnerability in
the wpa2 Wi-Fi standard that protects
pretty much almost I would say like 90%
of people use wpa2 this is like that
password protect password that you come
up to protect your own home networks
well there's a vulnerability that was
discovered and exploits that would
potentially leave any device connected
to a Wi-Fi network that is based off of
wpa2 protection and allow someone to
access things like the traffic on their
access directly files from your computer
in and out data literally everything
emails passwords whatever you can think
of so everyone was freaking out because
of this now companies like Google and I
think Microsoft and Apple are addressing
this and talking about how there are
updates available so what Apple has done
is they have out come out and said they
told I'm ores Renee Richie that iOS TV
OS watch OS and Mac OS betas that are
currently available have addressed this
Wi-Fi vulnerability and they will be
rolling out the official versions of
this to customers soon but it at least
has been available and is addressed with
the betas at the moment so they're not
look this is not this is a vulnerability
that was revealed and it's not like
anyone is using it right now at least
that I know of so don't get all freaked
out and feel like I'm never using Wi-Fi
again you're just gonna have to really
be diligent and updating your router
software and your devices as this rolls
out my assumption is that this fix to
kind of protect yourself from the crack
it's spelled kr ACK if you want to look
it up it's pretty gnarly I'm sure that
these updates are gonna come in like the
next week or two so I just I wouldn't be
too worried about it but if you get
hacked because I said that then don't
blame it on me yeah I think Cena has
somehow choose to like you know enhance
your router like fixing any router
problems you might have but I've been
needing to update my router too and
chain and just if you change the
password I think on your router would
help things a little bit but I'm not a
hundred percent sure on that but yeah I
don't that's not a good not good news
but thanks Apple for fixing it yeah
ultimately this hack can anyone can
access any device on any Wi-Fi network
it's pretty gnarly it's gnarly
it's yeah it's kind of dangerous so just
be aware of what's going on out you know
around us with that
let's also jump over to this story I we
talked kind of about I must have been
like a month ago about how the FCC was
asking or requesting that Apple turn on
the FM radio in their phones remember
that so a new request is now coming out
from the National Association of
Broadcasters who along with the FCC is
urging Apple to add FM radios to iPhones
now here's the trick right according to
Apple
they say the iPhone 7 and iPhone 8 do
not currently have FM radio chips or
antennas that support FM signals and
it's not really clear how simple would
be to add those we talked about how the
actual headphone jack cable that
physically connected to things like the
iPod Nano ended up being the antenna
which allowed you to listen to FM radio
on a device like that that was like the
little square clip-on iPad iPod Nano yes
judge - that's a genius idea loved it
and we joked about like yeah it's
because you got rid you there is no
headphone jack there's a light you know
there's a frickin dongle port now it's
like come on guys so the thing about it
is in tear downs of the iPhone 8 it does
indicate that they use a Broadcom chip
and that chip is integrated with an FM
radio and so they're just basically
asking Apple flip this switch but again
I don't know if whether by instead of
directly going into the port if from
previous old-school iPhones and iPods
even if that is the one of the reasons
why it can't support FM because there's
no actual like legitimate wide-reaching
antenna we know how tricky putting
antennas in phones can be the placement
of it and and then if you're talking
about an FM radio antenna that they
don't want it to take up more space in
that are in their gadgets they'd rather
have the slimmest device with the least
battery possible then then a thicker one
that supports FM radio a headphone jack
and a longer battery life yeah I mean
could they make an
fam antenna dongle or something and
selling like $2 you know I think that
would be a maybe the fact that we have
to ask that question makes me sick be
cool I have a little dongle hanging off
and you like pull out the antenna be
awesome you make it you may well I will
make a Mar I just make a mock-up of it
all right I put the story in the show
because I liked it um there's this new
new app called nude it's available on
iOS and Android but the app is called
nude and it's like called nude the
sexiest app ever or something like that
if you look it up in the app store but
why is this important okay
so check this out this app was created
by two people and really what it does is
it uses machine learning it uses Apple's
API which is called core ml it helps
them assist this and what it does is it
scans through your entire library of
photos it then using machine learning
and being able to identify which ones
are nudes and which ones are not it
actually wraps them securely into like
think of it as like a protected vault on
your phone no one else can look at it
allows you to delete them from both your
camera roll and the iCloud if you want
to but this is all thanks to this app so
are the people at nude able to see all
your nude photos yes this is a great
question very good jump so what's
interesting is because the nude app
itself images are never sent to their
servers or anything and it's possible
because of Apple's core ml API the
machine learning framework so what does
it do right so this core ml the way that
machine learning works for everyone that
may not be familiar this term is right
the brains were in the software but what
do what does the software need to
actually learn they need examples so for
example if someone wants if the machine
learning needs to figure out how many
what is a nude and what's not it needs
to look at
millions of pictures of nudes and non
nudes and the company said that the way
that they did this to teach it and to
get it smarter is they basically have it
scrape naughty sites and porn sites to
then learn what our nudes compared to
what are not nudes oh wow so they're
eyeing it porn to teach you that's funny
yes so then that information is plugged
into their app which is using the core
ml the machine learning and then it's
using that information to look through
your photo collection protect it but it
never gets sent to their servers huh but
then they could also potentially have
analytics on like percentage of
Americans or whoever's using iPhones who
have nude photos on their on their
phones so I mean if they could have some
personal information about you you know
I guess the most they could do is like
pop positives versus negatives right I
mean they don't they don't actually have
the the files themselves but yeah yeah
they could say oh oh based on our app we
know that the average American has blank
nudes but the funny thing is that
someone tested it and if you have man
boobs it does count that as a nude oh no
and boob man boobie is count as nudies
oh no they got to fix that they're gonna
they got to tweak that algorithm the
best yeah if you have a beard yeah and
man boobs it's not a nude well I mean
very cool actually I mean I mean there's
the I've been on the circus a few times
I've seen a lot I've seen a lot of its
San Francisco we see that every day
Oh oh yes we do both so that's red they
should just run that app in San
Francisco they'll get all types of data
that they never even knew existed
totally um the other funny note about
this is that they were promoting the app
at the recent TechCrunch Disrupt
conference and they said that a lot of
people said hey I don't have nudes but
can you tell me more about this app so
anyways you know it's funny because it's
it's a
salacious but there's actually
interesting technology involved with
Apple's core ml that is working to us to
help this happen it's in it's
interesting I feel like I'm hearing the
term machine learning almost every day
with like Larnell how do you apps
everything like it's it's happening all
the time now so computers are learning
everything that we do all of our bad
habits all of our good habits just be
ready man it's the it's an you know it's
just the first part to Skynet that's all
word that's all we're trying to get to
yeah we're just we're just teacher we're
just educating them to get up to speed
with us right like people we we as a
society can't help ourselves but see
what's in a movie and then want to make
it happen in real life like yeah we've
seen it so much it's just the fact like
if someone came up with it in a movie
someone's gonna try and make it in real
life now yeah flying cars tablets
literally tablets like computer tablets
that's Star Trek stuff man yeah I think
the first time any tablet was seen was
in like Space Odyssey 2001 a Space
Odyssey nice oh yeah that's the first
time that we ever saw like prior art to
an iPad there's yeah I sat on a ship
like looking at an iPad thing
so it's interesting I can confirm to you
that if I use the nude app there would
be no positives yeah I'm not taking nude
pictures of myself either man maybe my
wife might know I'm just kidding now
taking pictures of me I'm saying really
funny stories not associated with me but
I shouldn't get into it people are gonna
start wondering okay I don't know why I
said anything that weighs screenshots is
what well now people gonna be like wait
what were you just referring to maybe
I'll talk about another show but but not
today
all right here's the this is kind of a
fun one it was a quote from Eddy Cue I
know we're kind of jumping around all
over the place we're kind of winding
down before we get to her voicemails but
I had clearly had poor organization on
the show cuz I should have put this
earlier but Eddy Cue was recently
interviewed by an Indian publication
called live mint and he was asked
specifically this is the question he was
asked by them
Apple historically has a track record of
with industry to finding products
whether it's the Mac or iPhone or iPod
but over the past decade there's been a
perception that the pace of innovation
and the pace at which Apple has come out
with game-changing breakthrough products
has slowed somewhat what do you have to
say about that here's what Eddy Cue had
to say no way first of all the iPhone is
10 years old that is the last decade the
iPad came after that and the watch came
after that so I disagree vehemently with
that and I think we've been incredibly
innovative that doesn't even take into
account the work that has been done on
the Mac iOS and Mac OS from that
standpoint where I think we've led the
market when you think of the products
that we've built over time you own a lot
of them and you just assume that every
year was a new product but it wasn't you
can't do revolutionary new products
every two months or six months or
whatever they take time yeah he's right
he's right but he's also saying that the
iPhone is 10 years old like the iPad
came after that like and the watch came
after that look when it when he brings
up those is like kind of the the big
three the iPhone was asked under s J the
iPad was under s J the Apple watches
really Tim Cook's baby note I will sell
you for the record I do love the Apple
watch now as a Series three LTE version
only because it fits my lifestyle
specific use case of being able to work
out and still be connected if I didn't
do that
I still think the Apple watch would be
nice ish good but not a great
revolutionary gotta have breakthrough
product it just isn't
and so you know that's what the question
was I think what's really telling is
that Eddy Cue was instantly defensive
about it which tells you that they do
have a complex and they do are they are
hearing this buzz over the past let's
say you know a couple years aren't
innovative like people are saying it
they don't want it to become a reality
in the way that Eddy Cue reacted was
clearly like the knee-jerk like no way
we're not but if you look at the
examples he gave there's where where's
the latest quote-unquote innovative
products they should have asked a
follow-up what about the Amazon echo in
the Google
home why weren't you guys in that space
that's one of the new platforms that is
innovative Apple isn't wasn't in that
game at all they have the home pond now
but again that that's a great example
that they should have followed up with
well you missed that boat you know yeah
I mean it's is still really early in the
Apple watch so I mean it still does have
the potential to be an extremely
innovative product later down the road
like I know they're they're getting into
the healthcare business and all that
stuff so it does have potential like we
might not see it now but we could see it
in the future and you're right like the
the whole Amazon echo home pod thing
there they are behind but Apple was also
the first one that I ever talked to a
robot you know on my phone like was Siri
so you know I I agree and I disagree
with him but they definitely have made
things that I use a lot and it's changed
my behavior I'm talking to robots now
regularly I don't have an Apple watch
but you know he does have a good
argument there well I think the other
thing when I see this argument and I
agree with you but I also would say the
iPhone was a hit right out of the gates
like people were like holy crap the iPad
the iPad was actually kind of poo-pooed
until people saw it like after Apple's
keynote I had so many people that told
me whatever the iPod is a big the iPad
sorry the iPad is a big iPod touch and
guess what once people first picked up
an iPad for the first time they were
like holy crap right like they were able
to get hits out of the gate even the
iPod I owned the very first iPod that
was only made for Apple users that was a
FireWire based iPod and my windows
friends at the time couldn't use it at
all but when I showed it to them they
were all like holy crap this is awesome
but they weren't gonna buy it right yeah
yeah so that to me too to me we haven't
I don't know when or if maybe it'll be
the Apple glasses whenever they come out
but I haven't seen a product right out
of the gate that people said holy crap
yeah this is awesome that's and that's
hard like this is so hard the people
behind this are so much smarter than I
ever be and so I will never claim to be
smarter or ever claimed to be able to
make a product like this but it starts
with the visionary at the top and the
fact of the matter is the Apple watch
was Tim Cook's baby and it wasn't a
visionary it wasn't a one of those you
know amazing visionary like products
when it dropped when it came out people
like okay great it's like it's it's like
a child of the iPhone you know like the
iPhone came out it was so huge it's like
a big wave and it's still crashing now
they're still riding that wave and all
these other products are kind of little
you know little offshoots of the iPhone
really like the Apple watch looks like a
tiny iPhone you know so and I yeah and I
think look I think there's room over the
course of a product for it to vault to
evolve and get a lot better like example
iPad pro that is my that's still
probably my favorite device over the
past year one of my favorite devices
that I guess
well deco was earlier than year but the
iPad pro is a great example of a product
that finally when they decided to look
at the software and create some new
software innovations that made it at
least a special unique product not that
it does what a surface does but that
makes the iPad something of its own it
became exciting again so you can have a
product evolve over its lifespan but I'm
talking about even whether it evolves or
not over its lifespan that initial gut
check reaction when you see something
and you play with you're like oh my gosh
this is amazing like we haven't really
seen that since this SJ days yeah yeah
we're kind of getting that with VR now
we are sort of getting that with VR you
know and it's they stopped a lot of work
to do on VR because people are not
adopting it but we're getting I think I
see I think VR VR is right now in an
inflection point where a lot of
manufacturers made stuff for it like
hardware for but not enough software is
there to support it people are have
their you know companies have the
resources spread all over the place you
know you don't have as many of the top
companies like the top game developers
are still developing primarily for
PlayStation and Xbox and then some on
Nintendo switch but it's not like every
major developer is developing for VR and
that's its biggest obstacle like I have
a PS VR and I'm not you
because there's not enough stuff for it
like it there's nothing that said you've
got to use this so that's more of a
software issue it's always software and
Harvard together but again like right
out of the gates man the software the
hardware for the iPhone was like money
like the software and the harder for the
iPad once people picked it up they're
like dude this is awesome and those are
those are the experiences that we just
haven't really been able to get from
Apple for a while so and that's okay
they're different company I just I want
to where we want to kind of
counterbalance what why Eddy Cue is so
defensive but because it's true it's
true it's just it's day I'm true that's
correct it's true it's damn true all
right um you know what I'm gonna skip
this last story cuz we're rolling let's
just let's go the phone calls beats are
you cool with that is do it baby
thank you all for calling with a lot of
good calls you actually had a ton of
calls and I had to really anyone did
anyone ask tell them it's their birthday
what's that didn't remember when last
week we had someone calling sits over my
birthday and we said happy birthday and
we were worried that people would call
saying hey it's my birthday - once you
wish me happy birthday we didn't
actually know I didn't have any birthday
calls today
well people are honest thanks for being
honest everybody ok here we go
oh I got music playing here we go and
I'm gonna put to move this guy down okay
here we go yo what's up Brian what's up
Beach this is K star from Illinois
listen I got a question about the Apple
watch the third-generation one to LTE
now as far as in your fine friends
feature how would that work with the
watch so of course you have to give
access to someone to see where your
location is at so say if I'm out for a
run with the watch and my phones at home
and someone wants to see where I am with
a show where I am with the watch or what
a show where I am at home so anyway I
look forward to seeing what you guys got
to say and you'll Brian
well you ever in a boy band back in the
day and stuff I know you're always
singing and stuff I mean you got you got
some nice falsetto there whatever but
anyway thanks for the show man and I
look forward to hear what you guys got
to say peace J star hiphop yes sir
everyone's like we
okay store rules okay star so the funny
thing about the whole fie my phone
iPhone whether it defaults your watch or
your phone I actually I honestly don't
know that specifically I I guess I
should try it out the only thing is that
I don't I actually don't use find my
friends cuz I just don't I think if you
have a family a lot more people use it
but for me right now because I don't I
don't use it all because I don't like
people knowing where I am like they
don't have to know exactly where I'm at
all the time it's kind of like I don't
know it's kind of creepy Beach isn't it
yeah it's a little creepy I don't I
don't you like the little creepy I
actually I'm not faulting anyone that
does it cuz I completely understand but
um I'll I'll try it out and see what it
says I'll try it out and see what it
defaults to but then actually that's
hard because I'll be wearing my watch
while I have my phone so I'm gonna have
to have someone else do it
so someone oh that's gonna have to track
you where you are from their phone to
see if it works yes yes exactly that's
that that's the tricky part that's the
tricky part so uh to be determined also
know boyband
but I did do like a lot of choir and
like singing stuff like in high school
and stuff I was one of those guys like
we had like you know like that what oh
okay a quick little story we had like
whatever a tryout group that would then
like you know whatever performance stuff
for like senior citizen homes and like
festivals and stuff we recalled the
variations but one of my friends liked
to call us affectionately the
irritations that's a good one the
irritations what sure alright alright
next call cool next go here we go
hey this is Matthew Paul from Brockton
Massachusetts they love the show guys
there's been 10 iPhones now
Ranko 1 to 10 what do you think and
Brian would you get your shirts those
t-shirts I love them they're fire give
me the website later I guess I got a
show plug and do some love okay so I get
my shirts from a lot of places but the
main spot that I've gone to for years my
friends at design by humans just three
words altogether does
by humans check them out they have all
the crazy stuff a lot of and you're also
supporting a lot of independent artists
that come up with some really amazing
stuff and then I'll you know I'll just
get other clothes from other places as
well but that's my t-shirt spot that's
like one of them and then I also go on
RedBubble like us sometimes I'm just
weird like I'll just search for
something on Google and then if I see a
shirt that I like then I just like oh
that's that's the one I like I'll do
like Bruce Lee shirts and then I'll look
at them and I'll be like oh that's the
one I want and so nice I use this tool
that you might not be familiar with
called Google I hear that's very helpful
in finding stuff okay wait what was his
other question was about was the Beano
rank rank are only icons the ten iPhones
that are out but you know we talked
about this before and there's too many
to rank and we didn't own all of them so
I think Britax Island all of them except
one okay cool so do you want to do yours
first you want me to do mine I want you
to do yours but I think what's fun about
this segment I want to encourage people
that are listing guys and gals we're not
gonna rank we're gonna try and remember
what what we can but I think it's more
profound to rank the top your top five
iPhones okay cuz that'll that'll narrow
it down and I think there's some clearer
reasons why so what we want you to do is
if you guys and gals call us or you can
tweet me at Brian Tong we want to hear
your top five iPhones of all time okay
it's at Brian Tong or you can voice call
in at one what was the number on the
screen 1-866-606-8444 thank
currently half my second least favorite
was the iPhone one because I mean just
it didn't have video there were a lot of
things that didn't have but it was also
extremely exciting when I first got it
right so that's number agree to disagree
on that one okay
okay gotcha number three my third
favorite iPhone was the iPhone 4 because
I loved how you know I just liked how it
looked
it's kind of like in between 3GS and
five so I chose the four just I liked
how it looked I like the size of it it
had video all that stuff my second
favorite iPhone was the 3GS because that
was the first iPhone that came out with
video right so when I got video like I
went I went crazy and shooting video all
the time I think that was like 2009 or
something 2010 second favorite iPhone
just because it was the first to have
video and my favorite phone of all time
was the iPhone 5 because it was fast it
was that new sleek kind of look to and
it was like right sighs it was very
light yeah lightning port it was very
light in my hand iPhone 5 was my
favorite of the top five how about you
bTW alright so let's go back to low so
just really quickly save the list of
your five again you guys get on it so my
top one my favorite number one iPhone
five number two 3GS number four IR I'm
sorry number three iPhone 4 number 4
iPhone one number five iPhone 6 all
right here we go first of all I'd like
to start off with the worst iPhone that
was ever made it was an insult to
Apple's identity the iPhone 5c because
the plastic iPhone it got me mad people
got mad at me for ripping on it it was
completely out of character for Apple to
release the iPhone 5c I had to get that
out alright here's my top five I have
four and then I have a question mark but
I know that in my top five will be the
iPhone 10 somewhere in the top five the
iPhone 10 will land so right now I'm
starting it off as the bottom of the 5
next up the iPhone 7 plus only because
it was the first phone with a duel at
iPhone sorry first iPhone with a dual
lens camera and had that sexy portrait
mode
and it was kind of like the highest
evolution of that whole iPhones 6s like
that design the iPhone 7 plus yeah from
6 to 6 s to 7 plus that would be number
four number three the iPhone 5s
specifically because it was the first
phone with touch ID and I loved touch ID
like it finally brought that
functionality of using your phone like a
wallet that has been in Japan since I
checked it out in 2002 like think about
how long ago that was 2002 they already
had fingerprints we didn't even have
them here until then number two the
iPhone 4 arguably the best iPhone design
we have ever seen from a visual
perspective the glass on both sides in
the metal rim it did have antenna gate
but I loved it from a design standpoint
and my number one my number one I phone
of all time is the original iPhone oh
yeah well that started all the
GameChanger
it still works to this day it was an
amazing phone like I have to say the
best the number one iPhone was the
original it changed my rocked it rocked
my world I'm shocked that your iPhone
one still works man that's that's pretty
incredible
so my order top five from one to five
original iPhone iPhone 4 iPhone 5s
iPhone 7 and somewhere the iPhone 10 so
when you let us know we don't want the
calls to be super long let us know your
top 5 just go down the line like that
and then maybe talk about one that
sticks out for you cool right
does that spare or tweet them out the
other one that I do want to say though I
think that is also should follow along
the lines of a classic phone
I think the iPhone se to me is kind of
like a classic phone you think so yeah
because the size the design it you know
they've modernized it a little bit but
it's not on my top 5 but I think the
iPhone se over the course of the life of
the entire iPhone family will end up
being one of those kind of like iconic
e-type phones because it's basically
like the iPhone 5 right that's the
iPhone 5 model yeah yeah yeah it's like
it's kind of like the every every man's
phone right that up
just put that one out there for anyone
to use it's not super high end it's not
low-end it's it's like the every man
every woman phone I'm Chu yeah I'm
curious what people on the Twitter and
periscope are thinking or saying but
yeah give us your top 5 iPhones that's
awesome that's super fun I like that
right that's it man we're done hey Wei
Wei you forgot one call oh do we have
one more call oh yes this is the most
important call actually I'm very sorry
but let's listen to this real quick here
we go hey Brian
51 this is mine I like your show I
appreciate you you guys do the work and
I just want to talk about bezel-less
actually Apple didn't say anything about
the basalis at the event then why's
there so much buzz around for bezel a
specialist specialist I didn't get that
thank you that's gonna be the new like
that's gonna be a new meme here for the
show man bezel as basileis I'm gonna cut
that out of this of the skillet please
okay thank you for calling that is so
awesome look the whole bezel listing is
really just more of a buzzword across
the industry a screen with no edges to
give you a bigger screen that's the
direction everyone's going that's why
people are pooping on the Google pixel
too because it's not a really a truly
bezel screen I think that's bunk because
the phone is awesome like it's not gonna
stop me from getting that as my second
kind of my work phone my Google phone so
sacrilegious guess what yeah I do use a
pixel for my work phone but my daily
driver is without a doubt an iPhone come
on I'm in the ecosystem I'm locked in
like that so that's why people care
about Basden as bad as bad a nice
business we got to make a remix man as
well as buzz buzz nice cool so that is
it that is all of our calls all of our
stories thank you guys everybody yes
that is awesome all right we'll see you
guys next time remember call us
gonna do for this week stay safe have a
great week weekend enjoy thanks for
