and we are at mobile world congress 2014
taking a first look at the new Yoda
phone this is the new model that has
been just announced at the show and it
is a new and improved device it is a lot
thinner than the previous model and if
you guys don't know what this is this
device on the this side it looks like a
regular Android device it's running
Android KitKat powered by a Snapdragon
800 processor quad-core it's very fast
it's got a five inch full HD AMOLED
display very nice but when you turn it
around on the other side it has a large
4.7 inch e-ink display now one of the
major improvements over the previous
model is that this display on back is
actually full touch so instead of having
to use a strip on the bottom to interact
with the display you can now just touch
you know the screen and interact with
all the elements here as you would a
typical or premium ereader and as you
can tell it's also very thin and one of
the best things is that using the e-ink
display not only can you read it
outdoors in direct sunlight but also you
know impact battery a lot less you're
probably going to see about one and a
half to almost two times longer run time
using the e-ink display you can see all
of your text messages your alerts your
social media everything right there and
you don't have to tax the battery that
much at all the company says that it
will be available by q4 of this year and
hopefully arrive in the US by early 2015
proximate pricing will probably be
around for forty nine euros basically a
premium price for an unlocked smartphone
so there you have it folks you've just
taken a first look at the brand new
revamped and new and improved yotaphone
at mobile world congress 2014 i'm brian
bennett</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
