with the ORAC touch bagless vacuum now
this is a vacuum from the makers of the
classic Oreck XL Pat vacuum was simple
utilitarian had a big pail bag and just
a kind of ugly design unapologetic and
it just did the job this is a lot flash
here it's like auric has finally come to
the 21st century and made a modern
vacuum and I'm really glad they did
because this is a vacuum that we liked
quite a bit at 399 dollars it's
definitely a vacuum you're going to need
to spend some money on I think it's
going to be worth it
the ORAC touch bagless vacuum cleaner
has a lot of great features if you look
at the canister it's not a bag it's a
canister that's a big first for auric
they've always been big about the bag
and now they're going to a canister and
this canister is great it is really easy
to take out it looks great it's got nice
sturdy good-looking translucent blue
plastic when it's time to empty it out
you just hold it over the trashcan and
pull this lever like that and bottom
comes down everything falls out it makes
a nice clean process and then when
you're putting it back in the vacuum
cleaner it just snaps back into place
with ease another great feature about
the ORAC Touch is that it pivots as you
turn it now we've seen this from Dyson
vacuums with the ball base this doesn't
have a ball but it does have a joint
here at the base and that allows it to
turn independently from the bottom and
you can turn really nice and tight with
that works quite well it's very
maneuverable we love it there's also the
fact that the power button and the
brushroll button are located right up
here on the handle and that's great you
don't need to bend over to turn it on
you can use it from start to finish and
never have to bend over so clearly we
are big fans of the way this vacuum was
designed but the true question might be
how well does it suck stuff up out of
your carpets and the answer is it does a
great job it's a very competitive vacuum
when you compare it with Dyson vacuums
with the shark with the Electrolux it
can compete with those heavy hitters and
do a great job and in some cases it's
even the best vacuum if you look at our
Cheerios test just a test of a
lightweight kind of large sized particle
the orc did great it was a really really
effective vacuum it picked up almost
everything it didn't scatter it it
didn't crunch it up too much and it was
Gidi use the ORAC also did great with
pet hair and did pretty well with sand
and sawdust not as well as we would have
liked but none of the vacuums were
perfect - sand and sawdust you get a lot
of that stuff trapped down in the fibers
of the carpet so overall this is a
vacuum that is designed well it's new
virbull it performs well and really we
didn't find many serious weak points
with it at all to speak of this is a
very good machine a very effective
vacuum cleaner and I would be thrilled
to own one I think you can safely spend
the money on it and feel confident that
you're going to be getting a quality
appliance or CNET I'm right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
