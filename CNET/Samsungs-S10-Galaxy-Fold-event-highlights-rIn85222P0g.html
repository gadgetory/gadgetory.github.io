smartphone and a revolutionary tablet
all in a single premium package
what is folded it has a 4.6 inch display
it's compact and perfectly portable but
when the device opens up your world does
too with a massive 7.3 inch Infinity
flex display that transforms the fold
into a tablet thank you thank you it's
gorgeous
now in order to create a brand new type
of smartphone we had to develop brand
new ways to design engineer and
manufacture from the screen to the frame
to every element you can see in touch we
left no stone unturned
one of the biggest challenges was
building the backbone of the device
something that could hold strong even
after hundreds of thousands of folds and
unfolds so we invented a sophisticated
hinge system that allows you to open and
close the galaxy fold smoothly and
naturally and the beauty of it is you
don't even see it the hinges multiple
interlocking gears are hidden giving the
device a seamless elegant look and
that's just one of the ways we carefully
consider the design of the fold we also
gave you four Galactic colors to choose
from cosmos black space silver Martian
green or Astro blue thank you
and depending on the color you choose
you can make it your own by
personalizing the hinge color too of
course sometimes you want a larger
screen and the galaxy folds infinity
flex display gives you a powerful
multimedia experience with immersive
visuals and sound by AKG your favorite
movies come to life in vivid color and
rich audio and the interior screen is so
large that it powers a truly
next-generation experience one never
bhasin never before seen on a smartphone
three app multitasking yeah thank you
these displays work together to give you
a singular seamless multi-screen
experience and the key to making this
possible is called app continuity and
what that means is that you can switch
between the screens without missing a
beat so when you stumble across an
interesting Facebook post on the front
display you can simply unfold your phone
to see all the details on the bigger
screen it's amazing thank you now to
ensure that all these apps run smoothly
the galaxy fold needs unprecedented
unparalleled performance so that's what
we gave it the fold has a
state-of-the-art seven nanometer
processor and 12 gigabytes of RAM making
it one of the most powerful smartphones
on the market
there's more there's 512 gigs of onboard
memory and for the first time on a
mobile device support for universal
flash storage 3.0 which means they know
what it means this means you'll be able
to read data twice as fast as most other
smartphones making it incredibly
responsive now you may be sitting there
asking yourself how did we build a
battery into a phone that folds right
down the middle well the answer is we
built two of them one on each side of
the device our engineers have developed
special technology to combine energy
from both batteries into a single power
source now that is a whole lot of power
and the camera is just as flexible as
the rest of the device in fact it's
actually a system of six cameras three
on the back two on the inside and one on
the front the phone will always be ready
to capture the moment no matter which
way you hold it or you fold it everybody
this is Josh Kim please welcome thank
you
thank you I'm really excited to show
everyone what the fall can do as you can
see if fits perfectly in my hand first
let's unlock it all I have to do is
place my thumb on the side and I'm ready
to go it's really quick we have all the
usual suspects here here are my messages
here's my email and my playlist on
Spotify pretty much everything that I
already do on my phone
exactly I find it especially useful
folded when I'm on the go hey Josh can
we show them how to navigate with Google
Maps sure I can easily pull up Google
Maps but here but here's where things
get really cool I can unfold it and
instantly see the map on the big screen
that's amazing that is amazing so let's
say Josh wants to watch YouTube and chat
with his friend on whatsapp at the same
time and you never know when he might
need to Google something there you have
it the fold comes in both an LTE and a
5g version starting from nineteen
hundred and eighty dollars depending on
your region and carrier and you can get
your very own galaxy fold starting on
April 26th
ladies and gentlemen please say hello to
the gallops s10 plus we're not here
today just to celebrate the last 10
years
we're here to lay the groundwork for the
next 10 and that begins with the galaxy
s 10 we packed an array of sensors and
camera technology right into the screen
itself these essential features are
floating in a sea of individually placed
pixels the result a revolutionary new
display that maximizes your viewing
experience and minimizes distractions
today we're introducing the world's
first infinity o display on AMOLED this
is it thank you thank you
but this display isn't the only piece of
incredible tech built into the front of
your s10 embedded directly beneath the
screen is the world's first ultrasonic
fingerprint scanner
it's really a marvel of engineering to
use it simply press your finger against
the screen where it naturally rests the
scanner then emits ultrasonic waves that
map the unique pattern of your
fingerprint that wave data is then sent
back to the scanner and analyzed by the
phone's main chipset to determine
whether it's a match
all of this happens in the blink of an
eye and it even works in the most
challenging conditions it uses
ultrasonic rather than optical scanning
so the s tennis fingerprint scanner
performs better in bright sunlight and
wet conditions the scanner also protects
your data with machine learning based
algorithms that are updated
automatically just like security patches
and our anti-spoofing algorithm can
identify a fake fingerprint whether it's
2d or 3d now what that means is it's
going to make it significantly harder
for someone to cop your fingerprint and
gain access to your data
the s10 comes in a variety of stunning
new prismatic hues or you can choose one
of two premium ceramic finishes ceramic
white and ceramic black we can't wait
for you to see them for yourselves with
the s10 we're introducing a camera that
lets you capture memories like a pro
with a single device and that's all
thanks to our brand new next-generation
triple rear camera system it's a pro
grade camera that you don't have to be a
pro to use for capturing everyday
moments you have the wide-angle camera
with a 77 degree field of view you can
take amazing crystal-clear photos day or
night and when you need to zoom in the
telephoto cameras optical zoom gets you
twice as close now finally let's say you
come across a beautiful landscape a
professional photographer would change
the lens so they could take a shot like
this one I'm thrilled to tell you that
this photo was taken in Spain with the s
tens brand new ultra wide camera
it's magnificent isn't it at 123 degrees
its field of view matches that of the
human eye so with this camera what you
see is what you get
it lets you capture the full scene just
as you see it all without having to take
a step back
now we've already created an AI camera
that optimizes colors based on the scene
and now we've built on that foundation
by adding a neural processing unit that
makes the S tense camera even smarter
because the s10 can process more data it
can recognize more scenes than before so
let's say you're taking a hike your
phone can not identify everything you
see along the way the mountain flowers
even the sunrise your phone will use all
of that information to help you take the
best possible photo the s10 can even
provide composition tips for your photo
like where to place a subject in the
frame or whether your photo is level
because even if you never studied
photography the s10 did using machine
learning we analyzed the composition of
over a hundred million professional
photos so that the s10 can give you the
best possible advice the s10 is the
first mobile device in the world capable
of recording video in HDR 10 plus
your s10 can help you shoot and edit
exceptional videos it also helps you
take exceptional selfies because of the
significant improvements we've made to
its front camera we've added dual pixel
technology which lets you take better
pictures in low light and significantly
improves autofocus so now you can spend
more time composing your shot and less
time waiting for your camera to focus
and that's not all with the s10 plus you
get two front cameras that work together
to capture depth of field meaning you
can take beautiful live focus selfies
just like these and today with the
galaxy s 10 plus you can get up to 12
gigabytes of RAM and one terabyte of
base storage it's crazy right
that's laptop level storage without the
laptop and if that's not enough it also
comes with our standard microSD slot so
you can expand your memory up to a
terabyte and a half from expansive
speeds
from expansive storage to advance speeds
s10 is like having a supercomputer in
your pocket it's new processor enables
up to 29% faster CPU speeds and 37
percent faster GPU speeds than the s9
let's face it these days we carry around
a ton of devices we've got phones in our
pockets wireless earbuds in our ears and
smartwatches on our wrists it's getting
harder to keep all those devices charged
without carrying around a tangle of
cables everywhere we go that's why we
built the same technology we use in our
wireless chargers right into the s10
transforming your device into a wireless
charging pad it's pretty incredible
you just place a watch earbuds or even a
friend's smartphone onto the back of the
s10 and watch the battery fill up s10
offers a premium galaxy experience with
all the features you've come to know and
love over the last decade the s10 plus
super charges that experience giving you
more screen more cameras and more
battery and the s10 II has all the
essentials in a more compact form factor
so no matter what you're looking for
there's a state-of-the-art galaxy that's
perfect for you we can't wait for you to
meet the s10 and soon you'll be able to
so mark your calendars because it's
right around the corner the galaxy buds
are so cool and there are so many
different ways you can use them these
wireless earbuds deliver a premium audio
experience with sound byte AKG now your
favorite music podcasts and movies will
always sound amazing the galaxy buds
improve the sound quality you hear and
they make sure you can be heard too we
built them with adaptive dual
microphones one on the outside one on
the inside and these mics are smart they
know how noisy it is around you when
it's quiet the outer mic captures the
sound of your voice and when it gets
louder
the buds switch to the inner mic to pick
up your voice directly from you so no
matter where you go or what you're doing
the person will be able to hear you loud
and clear
thank you the galaxy buds are also
designed for all-day comfort there's 30
percent smaller than our previous
version making them our lightest most
compact and most comfortable wireless
earbuds yet and they'll last longer too
we created a high efficient sheets
chipset for the Galaxy buds so you can
take up to five hours of calls or stream
up to six hours of music on a single
charge the Galaxy buds come in abled
with bixby so you can control them with
your voice
you can adjust settings turn ambient
sound mode on or off or check battery
status all with a simple voice commands
you can even use your buds to control
bixby on your s10 just say play my
morning playlist on Samsung music it's
so easy you don't even need to take your
phone out of your pocket and starting
today you can give Bixby instructions in
3 new languages German Italian and
Spanish
bixby even supports British English that
means it can tell the difference between
the Queen's English and my Queens New
York accent the galaxy buds come in an
all-new cord free charging case this
case supports wireless charging for the
very first time and of course that means
you can charge at youing using wireless
power share with your s10
the galaxy buds are smarter more
efficient and better sounding than ever
they look just as good as they sound and
they'll be available starting March 8th
the galaxy watch active is slim and
lightweight so you'll always be
