the amateur how the internet is killing
culture which was written in 2007 he has
a new book called Digital vertigo and
Andrew is here with me today Andrew
thanks for being here Dan it's always a
pleasure
a digital vertical I must say it's a
very well researched in fact it's I
might call it erudite a little above my
head but of course you went to Oxford
and therefore you've got to put in all
these allusions to these famous people
from history but basically your thesis
is that the social web and everything
about sharing is killing society not
just killing culture Wow perhaps I'd go
a little further down the first book I
wrote about the internet killing our
culture now I'm talking about social
media killing our species killing the
species yes you're gonna buy a week is
this an Armageddon story well it's a
it's it's it's a it's a story about
corpses it's built off Hitchcock's
vertigo which is why it's called digital
vertigo and it's a book about
illustrious corpses the corpses of
beautiful women the corpses of
technology companies and the corpses of
people like you and me who have lost
what it is to be human by living so
publicly so explain a little bit more
about the corpses and and how as human
beings we've lost what it means to live
publicly well in Hitchcock's vertigo
which the book is built off
it's a story takes place in San
Francisco all around this where a man
falls in love with a woman who turns out
to be dead and the movies about him
making love to that corpse what I fear
in our social media age is that we're
living like corpses spending our lives
broadcasting ourselves to the world and
we're losing our inner lives within
losing the complexity the privacy
how does a corpse broadcast to the world
that doesn't seem logical
it doesn't seem logical but there's a
lot of illogical things happening in
today's world I begin the book in London
where I'm at the corpse of a late 18th
early 19th century utilitarian for
could jeremy bentham who has spent the
last hundred and seventy years
broadcasting himself to the world so
that idea of corpses broadcasting
themselves goes from Jeremy Bentham in
his famous auto-icon at University
College London to people like you and I
maybe maybe not you and I literally but
all of us who have our Auto icons and
becoming corpses on our Facebook and
Twitter pages now you focus a lot of the
book on on Facebook but let me kind of
go to the end of the book because I good
isn't it well the end is good but I also
think it brings up these points and kind
of them in a way people could probably
understand a little bit better in terms
of contemporary society and it's not a
big to be fair to it is it no it's not
difficult I did actually even if you can
write very well we'll put that and here
some of your writing you say that Reed
Hoffman who was the founder of LinkedIn
and an investor and many other social
networks including Facebook Reed Hoffman
says it's wrong to believe we are social
animals you also talk to biz Stone from
Twitter and and you say that he is wrong
to think that the future must be social
and you talked to Sean Parker from
Facebook and the social network movie of
course that it's wrong that today's
creepy is inevitably inevitably today
tomorrow's necessity and then you say
instead as John Stuart Mill reminds us
our uniqueness as a species lies in our
ability to stand apart from the crowd to
disentangle ourselves from a society and
to be let alone and to be able to think
and act for ourselves now that sounds
like people should be going out into the
woods and chopping wood and living by
themselves and being off the grid well
that's an American that's a typical
American response then I'm not
necessarily sympathetic to say Thoreau
who would argue that we have to leave
the grid and go and live in a shack what
John Stuart Mill was simply arguing that
in a in an increasingly techno centric
world he was writing about the
Industrial Age in a world in which mass
society was coming into being we need to
carve
outer space where individuals can think
for themselves because male argued and I
strongly agree with him the innovation
creativity is driven by the individual
and not by the group so if we want that
innovation in our digital age if we want
people to be able to think for
themselves well why do you why do you
think that that everything is moving
toward a dumb herd so to speak
I fear the social web I see what's
coming into place it's not just Facebook
although Facebook is the center of what
now is being called the the big data or
the web 300 economy a link it can tell a
like economy as opposed to a link
economy we're seeing all around us in
San Francisco thousands of startups all
focusing on the social enabling all of
us on the network to tell the world what
we're thinking what we're drinking is to
tell the world what you think it's also
to get things done for example to be
part of a social network I just read
about that helps you to find a parking
space so is it bad that people would
know that I'm looking for a parking
space no only if you're on that social
network well that's true I'm I'm willing
to tolerate social networks that that
allow us to find parking spaces but it
goes way beyond parking spaces you know
that it goes to our musical tastes what
we're thinking where we are location
networks social location networks like
highlight and glance see and as more and
more people in the world come on the
network we've got two billion now we're
gonna have about five million five
billion by 2020 with 50 billion
intelligent devices we're all going to
be living more and more radically
transparently and I fear that that is
taking away the uniqueness of the inner
world of the human being but how does it
take away the uniqueness let me quote
you again you say that Mark Zuckerberg
five-year plan is to eliminate
loneliness don't you think that's a bit
of an over rotation well it's not at all
I mean I think Mark Zuckerberg has said
very clearly that his goal is to create
a well-lit dorm room in which we can all
live I said he's gone beyond the dorm
room and it's about sharing so if it's
about sharing is sharing inherently
something negative or that has evil
consequences
I don't think it is but I think the kind
of radical nature that Zuckerberg once I
mean I I'm not using the term
eliminating loneliness thoughtlessly I'm
quoting Sean Parker who in his new video
social startup airtime has specifically
said the goal of airtime is to eliminate
loneliness I think don't you think that
that's a bit of an exaggeration from
someone who's a well-known character I
think Sean Park is a very smart guy and
I think if he says the goal of his new
business be speaking more about himself
than about the general partner doesn't
have to worry about Lohmann this is Sean
Parker but I think that's where maybe
you're a little bit off you're saying
that well if all these people are social
socially connected or if you have a
billion dollars like Sean Parker you're
never going to be lonely I think I was
driven I was driven to write the book
because I saw a paradox I saw a world in
which we're increasingly individualized
atomized lonely fragmented where society
is breaking out where the social is
actually quite weak in parallel with the
cult of the social emerging on the
Internet and that's not really you just
ask you this then if indeed that's the
case then how do you account for let's
say the United States Congress being so
inept in terms of accomplishing anything
collaborating doing things more in
concert than in complete opposition is
that is that from an impact of the
social web or from the emerging social
revolution I think we're living at her
and this is why my book was so
historical I think we're living at a a
really a truly transitional moment where
we're shifting from an industrial mass
society to a knowledge digital society I
think the problems with Congress with
our health system with our media system
with the energy system are all part of
that I'm not sure how how the problems
with Congress are connected with my
critique of social media I don't see a
connection you don't see one
I don't think that social media offers
necessarily a solution to the political
crisis in in Congress I write about
politics clearly social media has an
impact in changing ossified systems but
I think that is the point we have seen
changes we had ossified systems such as
Arab Spring although it hasn't turned
out as well as people would like we've
seen how social webs just Twitter and
Facebook are transforming in some ways
the political system in terms of the
amount of information that's available
to people as well as the amount of noise
I would accept the fact that social
media is having a transformative impact
on politics or Kandice certainly in the
Arab Spring in Russia I reported on to
CNN the Occupy movement the London riots
but what I fear is that the fragmentary
nature of social media the fact that it
isn't really social isn't resulting in
coherent political movements look at the
failure of the Occupy movement look at
the London riots look at the failure
really of the the Arab Spring to become
an Arab summer and as it now seems to me
to be an Arab winter look at the failure
even the resistance in including but you
look at this photo saying it's the
failure of social media to have an
outcome that would be preferred by some
people as opposed to that social media
provided a catalyst and and continues to
what I would accept that social media
provides a catalyst and I don't mean
there's anything I don't there's no
doubt about that what I would argue
though is then and then many people like
Jeff Jarvis or Clay Shirky or many other
people believe that it's more than a
catalyst and I don't think it is I don't
think it's the Holy Grail I don't think
it's the solution to our political
crisis which I acknowledge exists
whether it's in America or in Europe or
in any authoritarianism authoritative
that unless it sorts out many of its
structural issues now you also seem to
have an issue with Mark Zuckerberg
related to a tiny group of individuals
who are becoming remarkably rich based
on using data and that data and the
product that they produce or used to
produce their their their service is the
information we give it so how do you
relate that to your historical
perspective
well I think that Zuckerberg and Parker
and Sandburg and their they're brilliant
people all of them I think they are the
cream of our generation until actually I
mean all of them all of them I mean that
they're clearly brilliant people but at
the same time they're a new elite when
Sheryl Sandberg's for example says well
with Facebook now we can all become
authentic or when Mark Zuckerberg says
we're all going to live in this
wonderfully well-lit dorm room or when
Sean Parker says we're going to
eliminate learning that's what they're
really saying is that I'm gonna control
all your data no I'm gonna are they
really saying they're gonna control your
day but I'm gonna aggregate all your
data and monetize it in ways to make
myself incredibly rich you have a
problem but what what do those products
those so-called products get in exchange
for offering up all their personal data
or some of it well I think the problem
is that most people aren't aware of the
way these systems were one of the
purposes of this book is to argue that
free is never really free and in
exchange for giving up our data in
exchange for using networks like
Facebook and Google+ which are free we
are essentially handing over our
personal data we're becoming the product
Hitchcock made film Noirs and that's why
I love vertigo so much we're living in a
film noir now we are the fall guy we're
the Jimmy Stewart in the 21st century
movie and people are really disturbed by
that last week I wrote a piece for CNN
and my lad say CNN on CBS of course well
I wrote a piece about all this it got
almost twenty ironically enough twenty
thousand face book likes many but
designed isn't that a positive positive
for who for for the whole system and
there's a you you're you're writing how
Facebook is evil and I don't think
Zuckerberg or Samberg a evil but I think
they are incredibly opportunistic and I
think that we need to push back at that
kind of right so let's let's talk about
this
solutions now what would you propose is
a way so that the individual would have
more say for I would say three or four
parts and this is key and I have a
couple of chapters on this in the book
the first is as individuals we've got to
learn that we need to protect our inner
lives that we need to maintain a degree
of mystery particularly young people but
I don't think it's just a generational
issue ultimately it's up to us and we
can't really maintain a degree of
mystery well what does that mean it
means that when that we cannot reveal
everything about ourselves on the
network because we do away with who we
are as individuals if if if I join in
every network and tell the world
everything I like every come any people
do that Robert Scoble well how many
Robert's squabbles are there in the
world and it's still a very small
percentage of its go seven million
people in the world
yeah but squabbles the future so no
you're saying that the future is people
who like school in other words I want to
broadcast everything I want to be up on
a pedestal I want everyone to watch me I
want everyone to converse there are 900
people of 900 million people almost a
billion people on Facebook now not all
of them of course of Scoble but many of
them are wannabe squabbles many of them
are using this network thoughtlessly
without really understanding what
they're doing until they lose a job or
something else happens there the factual
things they could lose a job they could
be embarrassed they could lose a spouse
and they could lose a relationship with
a child but it goes beyond that I think
this is new territory for the species
we've never lived at a time where we can
tell the world everything about
ourselves and I think that this book and
this debate is about reminds always
there have always been exhibitionist and
I'm not saying Robert Scoble who's a
very well-known blogger and technology
person of yours and friend a friend of
ours I'm not saying everyone doesn't
want to be an exhibitionist in every era
with every technology there were always
people who wanted to step on the stage
and and be seen and viewed and be the
life of the party or be be someone you
know
would be looked up to as opposed to
being part of the crowd there's nothing
different there it's just the tools are
better than there's going to be so
you're done you're saying that there's
no change in the culture that we're not
living in an age of great exhibitionism
that when I write about digital
narcissism in that book that it's always
been the same well if you say putting up
a picture of this or that as
exhibitionism then yes but if it's
simply communicating well because we
have these tools I can put up a picture
I can tell you what I have for breakfast
I can do this to my friends you know
people can choose to view that to engage
with it or not well I think the readers
have to make their own decision I think
you're wrong I think that we are living
in an age where that kind of
exhibitionism is becoming increasingly a
salient feature in our culture and if we
are and there's no point in the book and
then and then I've wasted my time
writing and because it's no different
from any other time in history although
even if it's the same as in any tar the
time difference knowledge it's obviously
different I mean when you have a company
that doesn't really have any technology
of its own that's worth well it was
worth anyway a hundred billion god knows
what it'd be worth today when it has
almost a billion members when you have
this continual explosion of social
technology social apps and platforms in
Silicon Valley I mean that's real this
isn't just any so what is your what's
your prediction for the future but let
me come back just to the the solution so
the first I think is we all need to
think for us of it's not for me to tell
people that they should or shouldn't be
on the network on a sad day or a Friday
or they shouldn't shouldn't be on
Facebook I'm not on Facebook I'm on
Twitter so everyone needs to make their
own decision secondly I think we need to
look at government I think government
does have a role of not a libertarian
and I fear some of the sort of
libertarianism in Silicon Valley so I'm
sympathetic to legislation in Europe
demanding a right to be forgotten for
information for users I'm sympathetic to
the do-not-track legislation going
through the US Congress thirdly I think
there's a great role for innovation the
market is still key so I think companies
like every me reputation.com DuckDuckGo
you're seeing more and more companies
tech companies really interesting
companies driven by the core premise of
protecting privacy and finally I think
technology has
be a solution I like what a Dutch
University is trying to develop
technology which will enable data to
degenerate and I think we've got to as
we live more and more on the Internet as
it becomes the platform for 21st century
life it needs to replicate the world
we're used to it needs to conform to
what we want and I think data needs to
degenerate we need to have situations
where the internet learns how to forget
if we can teach the internet how to
forget than even I will become a fan
even I'll go back on Facebook that's a
promise Marco I've been speaking with
