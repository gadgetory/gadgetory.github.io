letter M or AMG after a five-year hiatus
their flagship is back in our trim let's
drive this 2014 XJR and check the tech
now spotting the new XJR is not too
difficult look for the more aggressive
face you've also got a bunch of arrow
effect stuff around the seal you
wouldn't find elsewhere quad exhaust
tips in the back and vents here on top
of the hood that are yep they're
functional these guys come in two
lengths also standard wheelbase or long
wheelbase the latter adds four point
nine inches all devoted to back seat
legroom
let's get inside now inside an XJ are
you've got these sort of sport buckets I
don't care for them in this two-tone
baseball mitt finish but there's no
accounting for taste
instrument panel on this car is all
video has been since this model debuted
in this generation but it's looking a
little agent notice that it does what's
called skeuomorphic representation of
dials in other words it pretends to be
3d dials there's even this kind of a
chrome effect at the top I there's some
light coming down there that's looking
really old-school just look at IO f7
Apple got rid of that exact same look
not trying to pretend to be physical
objects with video this should go the
same route now the center stack is
cleaner it's squared off it's got nice
large zones and it's touchscreen Jaguar
does not have a central controller the
way other cars do your home menu here
lays things out nicely with audio video
navigation phone the big three that's
where things start to break up though
the response is a little laggy on it not
terrible I think they've improved it but
here it starts to show it's rather poor
interface design for example you've got
am/fm separate from satellite radio well
those are all radio and then you've got
something called my music or sometimes
it's called source well radio and
satellite radio resources why aren't
they in a central menu with these as
well why do I have to hop around so many
buckets and then there's my video isn't
that a source well turns out it's just
DVD so why is there a separate deal for
that versus sticking it under DVD it's
also dated in terms of how you do voice
command for an address navigation go to
address
navigation please say the city name San
Francisco please say just second Street
multiple addresses were canceled so it's
the old-school bucket process where you
got to enter each module at once too
much distraction too much time for me
and there's no connected search no
Google or any other kind of look up on
the internet to find addresses or
destinations via fuzzy logic similarly
as you noticed in those sources there
are no media apps supported here no
Facebook or Twitter though I can
certainly live without those in my car
and I also want to see a revision of the
climate control system as you go and
turn the temperature knobs here it takes
too long for them to bring up the video
display to show your temperature ditto
for the seat heaters you got to hit a
button to get a menu to hit a button to
turn on the C heater which for some
reason defaults to three bars then you
got to minus it out down to one that's
insanely busy now as you can imagine a
car that doesn't do media apps or live
search or things like that also does not
have a lot of automated drive controls
there's adaptive cruise available and we
have passive blind spot warning lights
in our mirrors and that's it there is no
active blind spot tech active Lane drift
tech or collision mitigating braking
technology that will stop you before you
run into something which a lot of the
competitors have now upfront the engines
a big part of what makes an XJ are NX
jr. five liter supercharged v8 goes out
to a one choice only 8-speed automatic
and then rear-wheel drive they don't do
all-wheel drive on these XJ ARS keeping
in the sporty character now the numbers
550 horsepower 502 foot-pounds of torque
on a car that weighs about 4,200 pounds
relatively felt given its size because
it's aluminum structured and that's
gonna get you serious
four point four seconds while delivering
MPG that is not bad
you've got 15 23 18 average let's go for
a ride okay when you get in the XJ all
right push the start button the drive
controller rises to meet your hand
why that's part of the little tech
filigree on this vehicle that they seem
to love drop it and drive you've also
got sport mode which is self-explanatory
and you've also got this dynamic mode
here under the checkerboard button which
really loosens things up so you can get
in more trouble
I'm also going to defeat this eco button
over here that's the auto start/stop
technology and Jaguar like every other
luxury car maker has yet to figure out a
way to make auto start-stop feel luxury
now what you first notice in this car is
not that it has so much power but the
power is so available I love that it's
so rare to find a car with big power but
a light touch love these supercharged
jag v8 rear wheel drive as I mentioned
earlier so you can kind of break the
rear end out a little bit I've got the
track control off of course that makes
it a little easier steering is a little
the light side and maybe doesn't have
quite as much feedback as a lot of
purists would like but I think in a
Jaguar it is an appropriate calibration
measure this guy is different than an M
car at AMG or an Audi S car is the blend
of a luxurious ride quality with a
massive power curve you don't feel like
you're riding in something hard and
Teutonic ever even in the full go mode
that I'm dialed into right now again
kicking the rear end out just a little
bit
this is either an English gentleman's
hot rod for an English gentleman's hot
rod you know the difference now next TR
of course is a rather rarefied model so
it doesn't come cheap 116 is based on
this guy AD 3000 for long wheelbase
which I would do the handling is still
really good and the back seat legroom is
a must in a car like this
then there's 1700 bucks for the
illumination package it puts these blue
rings around the air vents and names on
the sills and trunk I'd skip that all
day long
2300 though for adaptive cruise control
probably a good buy
you're in for a little over one hundred
and twenty one this car is not as sharp
on the track as a BMW
nor is it is refined technology as a BMW
or an Audi or even mercedes these days
but it has a nice blend of really
serious Road ability and a unique Jaguar
luxury Plus you just don't see them that
often</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
