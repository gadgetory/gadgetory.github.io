cnet.com and welcome to Road Warrior
where we take a look at the hottest
gadgets for life on the go coming up the
hot new nokia n80 smartphone a map
loving compact lexus and we'll start
with a couple products from sony summer
press announcements in new york city now
you may have heard of the sony reader
device it's for reading you know ebooks
David karna and rich demuro give us a
quick insight into how it works now I
notice a little bit of ghosting it
almost looks like if you remember the
etch-a-sketch screens but I don't want
to shake it well according to Nick Sonia
uses actual capsules of ink that turn
either black or white and that so that's
sort of the ghost thing you see when it
decides it's going to go from black to
white and there's a little bit of
residue left over but it really doesn't
seem to affect it that much in terms of
actual reading it also reads word and
PDF files and plays back mp3 s Richard
David also took a look at the new high
def DVD camcorder from Sony so you can
take the DVD directly from the camcorder
to your DVD player you don't get the HD
resolution when you do that but you do
get it when you go from the hdmi output
directly from the camcorder so it's a
little bit deceptive and this is the new
ABC HD format which allows you to record
up to an hour's worth of HD video at the
more compressed setting david says you
will be able to play the dvds in
high-def in a blu-ray player or the
forthcoming playstation 3 let's go to
the phones Bonnie Shah has the new nokia
n8 a smartphone that has two cameras
it's also a smart phone so you can do
email and keep calendar appointments and
take notes it's got Wi-Fi and Bluetooth
so you can surf the web and connect to
headset overall pretty awesome device
however there's no US carrier supporting
it so it's going to be a little
expensive so it just be aware of that no
carrier so it's not that smart is it
finally brian cooley takes the lexus
is350 first spin well he would if he
could tear himself away from the map
there's good crisp response to button
inputs you can drag the map rather
smoothly with your finger obviously it's
a touchscreen as well I love this
feature notice these little national
there's Mexico Japan here's China those
are restaurants by cuisine press on the
flag it goes to that particular
restaurant and it gives you the
restaurant name you can press on that
and get information all about it
including a phone number if you want to
call for reservations and of course
because you got bluetooth hit that
button and you can make the call on the
car that map is part of the Levinson
entertainment package only the best for
mr. Cooley well that's it for this
edition of road warrior I'm Tom Merritt
check back next time for more gadgets to
keep you armed and dangerously
productive</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
