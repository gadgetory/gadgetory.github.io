phones impress s once again in addition
to delivering an exceptional camera that
we expect Google added new software
features and a deeper integration to its
Google assistant platform all in a
minimalistic and polished design first
let's start with the camera
last year's pixel had one of the best
cameras you can get on a phone and this
year it's no different it still takes
excellent low-light photos record steady
video and pulls off solid portrait
photos with only one rear lens this time
around though new software aims to
improve your photos the camera
reportedly uses machine learning to do
things like look for smiles and open
eyes to choose the best shot and it
combines several photos to put together
super detailed zoomed in pictures Google
also improved the cameras low-light
capabilities but this specific feature
isn't available on the phone just yet
other new features like a second
wide-angle front-facing camera motion
autofocus tracking and adjusting the
blur on portrait mode all helped to
elevate your photo taking abilities
Google's digital voice assistant
assistant is embedded thoroughly into
the overall user experience as well
there's about a billion ways to access
it including squeezing the phone's edges
and if you don't launch it its prompts
come up anyway in some inevitable
fashion the most compelling new feature
is call screen which answers calls on
your behalf as a conversation unfolds
between assistant and the other line you
could see a transcript of the
conversation in real time and decide
whether or not to block the call or
answer it it's totally freaky but I find
it useful if it means I don't ever have
to talk to a telemarketer ever again as
part of its well-being initiative the
pixel gives you info about how you're
spending your time on the phone it lets
you limit app usage and turns the screen
to grayscale around bedtime to reduce
eyestrain
all of these features are wrapped up in
a refined design the pixels don't look
as premium as the new iPhone or Galaxy
phones they don't feel as cheap as their
predecessors
the pixel three is one of the most
comfortable phones to hold in a hand and
small tweaks like the slimmer bezels
elevate the aesthetics the pixel three
excels notch is deep and you could
especially see it around the
notification icons in the end though I
got kind of used to seeing it and
there's a strong possibility that Google
will release an update that lets you
hide the knotch
altogether the phone is still
water-resistant and it doesn't have a
headphone jack the upside though is that
for the first time ever it comes bundled
with wired USB type-c pixel buds
plus there's wireless charging FYI
preliminary battery testing for
continuous video playback on airplane
mode put both files at around 15 to 16
hours which is on par with this year's
iPhones but it doesn't quite edge out
the galaxy s 9 and Note 9 it's true that
they're not the most luxurious looking
flagships and the extent of assistance
capabilities can be a little unsettling
at times but with their brilliant and
easy to use cameras plus extra perks
that come from being a Google phone like
unlimited photo storage and timely
software updates the pixel 3 and 3 excel
are top-notch and they remain one of the
best Android phones you could buy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
