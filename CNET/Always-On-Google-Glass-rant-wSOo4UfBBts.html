glass project there were a lot of
naysayers and mostly what they said was
you'll look stupid wearing them okay I
was one of the few who was in favor of
Google glass I thought it would be
awesome to have a permanent heads-up
display with mapping and Twitter and
information in this kind of virtual
world happening all around you I am
sorry to say that I was wrong it turns
out that Google glass represents a new
frontier in human rudeness inattention
and danger first there's the human
interaction factor I mean I'm walking
down the street but I'm living in a
virtual parallel world where I've like
got my Twitter and my facebook and my
maps and I don't even care cuz I'm a
ghazal and I personally refuse to ever
have a one-on-one conversation with
someone wearing Google glass I'm just
bad enough that everybody gets out their
phone and starts typing while you're
speaking to them imagine when their eyes
start watering slowly small eyes a
pineapple for life let's buy some pina
coladas and carve out this giant
pineapple is awesome and then somebody
flips on Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch
and everyone just starts okay
then there's the mobility factor people
in San Francisco are actually riding
their bikes around wearing these things
in fact I once saw a guy crashed into a
curb dive into a group of pedestrians
and then look around in a panic for his
glasses his Google glasses does anything
about this seem like a good idea finally
there's the stuff that just should be
against the law West Virginia is
considering legislation that would ban
Google glass while driving the UK is
thinking about enacting the same laws
and I got to say everybody everywhere
should be working on this law there is
nothing about driving while you're
distracted by Twitter feeds and maps and
all kinds of other crap that is a good
idea is like a disaster waiting to
happen
now I'm not trying to be anti technology
here I love the idea of Google glass I
don't think they look stupid I think I
look kind of cute it's just that when
they come about think we also need
self-driving cars and a whole lot of
self-restraint so I'm thinking the world
is not yet ready for Google glass ok
