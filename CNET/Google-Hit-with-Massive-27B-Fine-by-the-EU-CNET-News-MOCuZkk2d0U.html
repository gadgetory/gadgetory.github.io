billion dollar fine by the European
Union
it's the biggest antitrust penalty the
EU has ever given to a single company
and totally eclipses the 1 billion
dollar slap on the wrist for Intel in
2009 Google breached antitrust rules by
favoring its own comparison-shopping
service if you ever wondered why Google
Shopping links would appear at the top
of search results and rivals much lower
down the page you saw this practice
firsthand now under the EU rules it's
not illegal to have market dominance but
if you are a big company you're not
supposed to restrict competition this
ruling came after a 7 year investigation
and the commissioner said quote Google
abused its market dominance as a search
engine by promoting its own
comparison-shopping service in its
search results and demoting those of
competitors unquote Google now has to
stop the practice within 90 days
otherwise it faces penalty payments of
up to 5% of the worldwide daily turnover
of its parent company alphabet and this
could just be the start of the search
giant's troubles because the EU is also
investigating Android if Google is found
to be crushing competition by forcing
Google services to be pre-installed on
Android phones
it could mean even more fines I'm Alexis
