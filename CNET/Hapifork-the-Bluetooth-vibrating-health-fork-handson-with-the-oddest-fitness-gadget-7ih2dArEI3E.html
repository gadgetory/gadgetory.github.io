Bluetooth vibrating fork it's called the
happy fork you may have heard about it
cuz for over a year it has been talked
about in the news and we also talked
about it at last year's CES and it's
finally around via Brookstone and it
costs $100 what does it do
tries to get you healthy by timing your
bites with Bluetooth and an
accelerometer inside this Fork
that's true it pairs with your
smartphone and you sit down in a meal
and you take your fork with you when you
type your bites in a regular meal just
swap out your regular fork and take your
app before this thing is dishwasher safe
it has a little pop out here you can
make sure not to immerse this part of
happy for it but you can put this part
in a dishwasher and this part has the
accelerometer and the battery and it
connects with USB and you can plug it
into your computer and sync happy fork
with the rest of your accounts so you
can know how you're happy Fort progress
is going what you have to do is you have
to use special happy fork actions to
work with the accelerometer they prefer
a downward jab with your fork and then
lift up to your mouth I know you eat and
you chew and then if you take another
bite within 10 seconds you think you're
eating really fast or vibrated because
I'm eating too fast I should slow down
and not eat so fast if you wait 10
seconds then happy fork is happy am I
staying here for a while chew my food
and swallow and go for another bit of
whatever you can eat it hmm
happy happy fork doesn't care what
you're eating you could be eating steak
or mac and cheese or giant fork falls of
a fat or vegetables or whatever and it
will still just be measuring your bites
remember you can fit on this fork counts
as one happy for it
timing loop and when the fork makes
contact with your mouth it completes the
circuit between metal and metal to tell
you whether you've made a bite where but
it's really just a timing thing maybe
you want to sit down with the
nutritionist
and time your bites you could maybe use
well these for a few minutes and know
how long it takes for you to scoop up to
your mouth do you want to carry one of
these around all the time at two parties
and have a strange fork in your pocket I
don't think so but apparently happy Fork
thinks it's an interesting solution $100
is a lot to ask for what is a pretty
gimmicky piece of health tech happy fork
is available now at Brookstone it's an
interesting idea when you think about
using a motion to time your bites but
putting all that into a fork and paying
extra for it this is where wearable tech
has to take a stand unless you like
Bluetooth ports</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
