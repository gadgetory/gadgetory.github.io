cyclists golfers and me regular people
who want to get healthy the band came
out last year and introduced heart rate
tracking all the time at GPS the ability
to track sleep and a lot of apps that
added communication features including
some poor tonic connected stuff if you
had a windows from this is the new band
and what's different well mostly the
design before it was a little stiffer
now this wraps around my wrist feels
more comfortable the batteries now
tucked underneath and this has a curved
screen so nice curved Gorilla Glass and
its supposed to be better for wet
fingers I'll test that some other time
plus it has a barometer so you can check
out elevation which is important for a
lot of people to work out the rest of it
is not that much changed it seems 48
hour battery life like before but the
differences are really about a an
evolution its banking that if you have
one of these before you'll still be able
to use a lot of the updated Microsoft
software that also exists on the
Microsoft health app because a lot of
what the band does is cloud connected
it's trying to track and guide your uses
and your habits to be a little more
helpful day to day as that evolves will
be interesting to see how much micro set
bang can be like that the band comes out
knocked over later in October for $249 a
little more expensive than the first
band but it feels better and hey it's
not that much more than before how this
stacks up to a very large growing field
of fitness trackers and smart watches
that are also fitness trackers lot to
test out but very few are making the
types of coaching and lifestyle claims
the Microsoft is I'm Scott Stein here
with the new Microsoft band</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
