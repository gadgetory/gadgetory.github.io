recording your screen with both video
and audio
Amaya Zak turn today I'll be showing you
how to use sound flower to record system
audio while you're doing the screen
recording on Mac OS 10 let's say I
wanted to grab a quick clip from a video
to use in a presentation later Vimeo has
a selection of Creative Commons videos
the video we're about to show you
requires attribution to be used and it's
by Hadrian Genest if you've got a modern
Mac you've got a built-in screen
recorder in QuickTime 10 to start a
screen recording do a spotlight search
for QuickTime Player then click file
then new screen recording and hit the
record button you can select the whole
screen or just an area of the screen to
start recording if I try a screen
recording with quick times built-in
player here's the result
I get a silent video to capture the
audio it's time to use sound flower
sound flower is a free piece of software
from Mac OS 10 by cycling 74 it makes
your computer think sound flowers an
audio device like your headphone jack
which means you can route all of your
system audio through it download and
install the software sound flower does
require you to reboot your system after
installation for it to work
now what you want to do is send all of
your system audio to sound flower and is
going to feed into QuickTime Player
well relaunch QuickTime Player and start
a new screen recording click the down
arrow and select sound flower to channel
as the input after that Launch System
Preferences and go to the sound settings
go to the output tab and select the same
sound flower - channel option as you did
in QuickTime Player if you've got audio
notifications popping up from Facebook
or Skype that audio will also be
captured here so be careful about that
let's go back to that awesome Vimeo
video you'll see the audio meteor
pulsing as now quicktime player can hear
the audio plane then start your
recording while this is going on you
won't be able to hear the audio to
monitor what's being recorded you'll
have to change your output audio back to
original settings when you're done then
play back the video just recorded and
there you have it recorded video and
audio thanks to QuickTime Player 10 and
I'll flower Amaya's Akhtar for more tips
