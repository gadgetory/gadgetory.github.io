arm it didn't show an arm there and then
that computer is one that's designed to
take user code as opposed to the code
that's running in the robot why don't we
bring out the robot sure let's let's
actually see it in action
so here's spot Minnie and Seth Davis is
operating it it's not running
autonomously right now although many of
the control functions are running on the
on-board computer Seth is a guy that you
never actually see in the videos but but
he's in every single past video there's
been set or someone essentially doing
Seth's job controlling the robot in
these videos that we've seen this week
are the first time that this has really
been demoed autonomously that's right so
as I said this is a platform the arm is
an extra cost option that you can take
off and that white box is a computer
that really we're only using today
because it's got a better radio than the
standard radio and in this environment
where you all have cell phones and Wi-Fi
it's sometimes a challenge to get that
working so this is using a spread
spectrum radio that makes it easier the
robots on the directional when it came
out it was using a different number of
different walking gates it's on the
directional so Seth can just using a
joystick steer it around and he'll will
will have the robot out in the lobby
after the talk and if some of you will
get a chance to drive and let me just
show a few things on there there's
cameras here there's two sets of stereo
cameras and there's also one on the left
you wanna turn what turn it in place so
there's also one back here there's a
butt cam there's another one on this
side is that is that a trademark named
the buck and we should we should mark
the head on that the joints this is all
electric so even though Atlas has
hydraulics it's got a quick disconnect
battery underneath which you can't see
here and again the arm which has similar
technology to the to the legs
one of the things we love to do is show
that you can stabilize the hand while
the body moves and this looks like a
kind of a show-off trick but really this
is important if you're gonna do
manipulation in the world you want to
think about how the hand moves and not
worry about the body and I can do that I
can touch Brian over here on his
shoulder and I can move my body all
around and still my forces between me
and Brian er are pretty modest and so
we're building up that to do mobile
manipulation and and other tricks so
we're not doing autonomous control but
you'll see that the sensors can be used
to go over simple obstacles so the robot
is looking ahead and seeing these and
using quadratic programming in order to
plan its foot steps so that it goes over
smoothly you can see it it arches the
body up a little bit in advance there it
missed the the thing a little bit you
want to go over sideways this is riskier
but for you so that because we have
camera or you can go backwards if you
want if because we have cameras on the
side it can see the box and step over
you notice that the back leg stepped up
and the front legs didn't in that case
thank you sir thank you spot
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
