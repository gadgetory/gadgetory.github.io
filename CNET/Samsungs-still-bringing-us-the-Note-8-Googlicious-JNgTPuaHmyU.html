welcome to Google issues for everything
Google we're talking about we'll get to
that pixel phone but our top story is
all about Google's latest headset
ambitions now back in July and gadget
reported that Google was working on a
dedicated headset that blurred the line
between virtual reality and augmented
reality we know they already have their
daydream VR headset that works with
their pixel phone but a new report says
this future headset they're working on
will now integrate eye tracking and use
sensors and algorithms to map out the
real world space in front of the user
now think of this as something similar
to a mixed reality device like
microsoft's hololens which yes is badass
plus Engadget sources also say mobius an
AI company being acquired by intel will
supply the chips that help with motion
tracking and positional awareness for
this headset also reports say this
headset will not require a computer or
phone to power it it will be able to
stand on its own the drum also reported
that a device recently passed through
the FCC described as a wireless virtual
reality device with the director from
Google's VR group listed as the contact
so Google isn't done on the product side
anytime soon now the goop's just
announced an all-new product called the
jam board they call it a collaborative
digital whiteboard that's connected to
the cloud for sharing ideas in real time
through their G suite it's this really
stylish rolling design it cost six
thousand dollars for a 55 inch 4k
display touchscreen that you can draw on
erase and move things around now you can
sign up for the jam board through
Google's early adopter program and it's
a pretty slick piece of hardware for the
workplace
they've also hit a homerun with the
Google pixel phone reviews across the
board from last week have given it
praise thrusting it into the
conversation for the best Android phone
to date it has the industry's best
camera ever in a mobile phone unlimited
photo storage uploading the Google
assistant and a sleeker nougat those are
just a few of the things that have
separated it from the pack and make it a
legitimate rival to the iPhone and I
have to reiterate this is just Google's
first phone effort where the software
and hardware is controlled by them it's
lack of serious water
is one thing that holds it back with an
IP 53 rating that's good for splashes
but youtuber Harris cray craft decided
to put it through a variety of tests
including submerging it for 30 minutes
in a bowl of water and you know what it
survives it might make you feel better
now and it shows that it's better than
officially advertised but don't try
swimming with this any time soon ok
let's talk more about that camera and if
you wanted to see how good its 4k video
footage looks filmmaker Matteo Bartoli
put together this gorgeous looking video
that use no special lenses or gimbals to
study the footage color correction was
applied but the answer to any questions
you might have
yes the pixels camera is legit and for
Android users who want to get a taste of
the latest Android flavor the Developer
Preview of seven point one is now
available for the Nexus 5x 6p and pixel
see again this is a Developer Preview so
it won't be optimized but users can get
a feel for some of the new bells and
whistles that the pixel has and we can't
really do a show without more fallout
from the entire Samsung Note 7 saga the
latest report from The Wall Street
Journal details how Samsung made a
rushed decision based on incomplete
evidence to start a recall issue the new
phones with the replacement battery
which then led to the killing of the
note 7 all together on top of that the
wireless industry trade group
CTIA told The Journal that Samsung was
the only manufacturer that relied on an
in-house certification instead of using
an independent lab like everyone else
does samsung has still yet to identify
the actual cause of the note 7 fires but
says they are working around the clock
in their investigations so how does sham
Tsung excuse me Samsung hope to make it
up to customers now well Samsung still
has plans for a Galaxy s8 and a note 8
and in an official statement they have
said customers in Korea that stick with
them and trade their note 7 in for a s7
can then trade up for a Galaxy s8 or
Note 8 in the future through an upgrade
program now users will only have to pay
half the price of a galaxy s7 device
instead of the full amount before
upgrading to the s8 or Note 8 it's you
know one way to keep people around but
bottom line the note line will go on and
the note is
not dead all right that's going to do it
for this week you can always email me at
Google Isha's at cnet.com or to me at
brian tom thanks much for watching we'll
catch y'all next time for some more of
that Google issues Google issues</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
