first person on the block to have a 4k
laptop well then here it is i'm dan
ackerman and this is the toshiba
satellite p50 t one of many toshiba
satellite p50 systems but this one in
particular is the first shipping laptop
with a 4k screen that's 3840 x 2160 that
is the highest native resolution I've
certainly ever seen on a laptop screen
even though we're seeing better than HD
higher than 1080p that means on a lot of
laptops now that usually tops out at
3200 by 1800 so why were you want a 4k
screen on the laptop well maybe for
doing a lot of video editing and you're
one of the few people who's not doing it
on a Mac that's certainly a good reason
if you're working with really high
resolution photos you can get the entire
photo on one screen frankly 4k video is
kind of fun to watch if you can find 4k
video clips and movies and of course
taking games and cranking them up to 4k
resolution is a lot of fun you do have
to turn down the graphics options quite
a bit even though this system does have
a dedicated AMD graphics card so i tried
games like like skyrim try games like
titanfall and if you get it up to that
4k resolution you have to turn the
graphic options way down to low still
kind of chugs a little bit but it's fun
to see if you turn down the resolution
obviously you get very good performance
and we tried some 4k video clips and
they look fantastic there is of course
not a lot of 4k video content out there
YouTube actually has some the sum came
preloaded on this netflix is starting to
show some stuff in 4k but that's not
going to be available for these
streaming pc version of netflix just yet
hopefully soon so a 4k laptop is one of
those things where the the uses for it
are going to come in the future if you
want to get the hardware first lenovo
has promised a 4k system this is the
first one we've actually got our hands
on if you want to be the first guy on
your plot to say you have it well if you
have 1799 to spend then you can have
those bragging rights I'm Dan Aquin and
that seats have a satellite p50</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
