MOTO z3 this is the latest Motorola
phone to work with Mont and Motorola and
its partner Verizon have a very special
mod in mind one that will support 5g
data speeds correct with that modes'
device is gonna be available to be
upgraded to a 5g network which is gonna
be available next year that means that
it's gonna be much faster than 4G LTE
which many of you actually are using
right now so the funny thing then is
that the phone goes on sale August 16th
there is no 5g in the phone that will
only work with mod and there are no 5g
networks that's not gonna happen
until early 2019 so in the meantime you
just have a phone that runs on the 4G
network and then even when those
networks do start kicking up it's not
gonna be all over the country it's gonna
be one market at a time so what do you
do with the phone in the meantime is it
still gonna be valuable that's the
question that I think buyers are gonna
ask so let's talk about the specs this
device has six inch screen Super AMOLED
which is pretty nice besides if he has a
snapdragon 835 which is last year
processor it's kind of hard to argue
that is the best processor since there's
no drag on a 45 is available in many
flagship devices besides this it has
four gigs of RAM and 64 gigs of storage
which is pretty average for the market
right now and what about the cameras on
the back so he has a dual 12 megapixel
cameras but now one of the lenses is
actually black-and-white which is pretty
nice and then you've got that 8
megapixel front facing camera and you
can still take portrait shots on the
back right correct that's pretty good
that's some average in many ways we'll
see how works in the real life but it's
good to see alright there's still no
headset jack but the box will include a
dongle so that you can listen to music
using the USB C port it splash resistant
it's not water resistant and if you want
wireless charging of course you've got
to buy the mod to do that so what else
do we have on here we've got Android 8.1
Oreo and one thing that I always really
like is it's got the ability to actually
use just real navigation and replace
those controls on the screen have you
played around with it yeah he's very
similar to iPhones in many ways and to
Android P also a little bit ugly so he's
probably getting a little bit confusing
with Andrew P
coming up pretty soon I don't know what
Motorola is gonna do in the future but I
think it's pretty confusing right now
okay so I'm holding it in my hand we
don't have any mods on this it has that
typical feel for me where it feels like
it's missing something
what do you think about the design I
think it's very similar to the Motor
City play another Motorola devices
what's nice is the disk range you know
it has less bezel which is more modern
more attractive for smart I agree but
for that you need to have a different
finger print sensor what happened this
year well they put it on the side it's
kind of like this trough cutout it's not
a button and I actually really liked it
I liked it on the Moto XIII play and you
just kind of it's it's a very natural
fit if you're right-handed your thumb
just goes right there and it unlocks
really quickly so I do like that another
difference from last year's model the z2
force is that at the screen material
right correct now is breakable he has
got Gorilla Glass through he actually
doesn't have Gorilla Glass 6 which of
course is less resistant than the new
generation that Cornyn announced this
year and the z2 force also had sort of
the coating on top of it that was
supposed to be unbreakable it scratched
I dropped it 26 times and you did see
you know somewhere around the corners
and things like that but it never did
break and it's interesting to me that
Motorola is pulling back from that
promise and I think some of that might
have to do with a trade-off of keeping
the costs down this right now seems to
me like a mid-range phone it's not gonna
go against the iPhone 10 or the Galaxy S
9 and as you say think Motorola really
is betting on 5g what's your if I don't
take away well I would say that we need
to wait for fugly exactly to see how
well it works but for right now I think
it's a great device maybe for the price
but it's competing with the one plus six
which it has a newer processor it has a
similar price so we'll see what happens
yeah and of course we can't forget that
there are other flagship phones coming
right around the corner we're gonna be
looking for the pixel three phones
probably in October a month before that
we've got the iPhone next generations
the 2018 iPhones and then of course
Samsung is going to be announcing the
galaxy new 9 on August 9th so there are
a lot more phones to come and there's a
lot of competition in this space so I
would say we're gonna review these
just stick with us and we'll let you
know how it goes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
