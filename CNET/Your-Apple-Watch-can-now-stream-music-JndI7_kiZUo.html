wear an iPod Nano on my wrist years
before the Apple watch existed I liked
you because I could listen to music on
it and I could also listen to radio
Apple watches latest music update does
add the ability to finally stream music
via LTE or Wi-Fi and it also has radio
there's a new radio app that exists in
addition to the music app so basically
the store's music but it's also a little
streaming Siri activated music player
this is how it works
Apple music on Apple watch actually
operates independently from the iPhone
Apple music app so already if you're
going to be using it before the update
it shows downloaded playlists and albums
and songs that you put on there but the
new update also allows you to browse
your entire music catalog that's in your
iCloud music library and if you're an
Apple music subscriber you can also
access the rest of the music and the
catalogue but to do that you're going to
have to use Siri play the Tron
soundtrack Siri is the way that you
handle any additional requests on the
Apple watch
asking for a particular artist or a song
or a genre play something I like or
anything that you can also do with Siri
on the phone but here there's no way to
type requests you're either going to
have to use Siri or you're gonna have to
go back to your phone now for browsing
music or for other suggested music
there's the new radio app which is where
you can find beats wine and a lot of
Apple's other streaming music stations
that basically act like curated
playlists and there are a couple of
radio stations as well there's ESPN
there's NPR and there's CBS News now if
you want to be able to download stuff
you can't this is only for streaming
you're gonna have to go to your phone
later and plug in your Apple watch in
charge if you want to sync things once
shortcut is that you use these stations
kind of like curated playlists when you
listen to them if there's something that
you like you can hit star or if you want
to add to your playlist you can hit the
plus sign you are gonna have to get used
to juggling two different music apps on
the Apple watch which was a little bit
strange if you're trying to request
playlists they show up in the radio app
but if you're going to be listening to
music in your own collection it shows up
in the music app
and you're now gonna need two shortcuts
to your music apps on your Apple watch
one for music and one for radio which
means one less shortcut for something
like weather even though there are
quirks it actually worked better than I
expected
Apple hasn't made any specific claims on
streaming music and battery life on the
Apple watch but I played music off and
on via streaming for about a full day
and I need to recharge by dinner the new
Apple watch update with music streaming
should be hitting soon it's a good step
forward but you're gonna have to be
patient and you're gonna have to use
Siri play my music</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
