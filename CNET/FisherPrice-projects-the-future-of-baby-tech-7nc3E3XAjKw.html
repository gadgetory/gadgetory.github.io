tough cost-benefit analysis how much
does it cost how much clutter does it
add how long will he use it will even
like it
so a gadget like the fisher-price smart
connect two-in-one projection mobile is
an interesting find it's definitely not
a must-buy product and a seventy bucks
it's a little bit pricey but it's got a
lot of really cool features packed up
its leaves first off you can play music
and various ambient noises here which is
pretty much standard issue on devices
like this but more importantly it has a
mobile that moves automatically and a
projector that shoots images onto the
dome and the inside of the mobile as
your kid gets older you can also remove
the mobile and project the images
directly onto the ceiling instead this
is a cool combination of features that
gives the conventional mobile a much
longer lifespan that plus small touches
like app connectivity a sound monitor
that sends you push notifications if
your kid starts crying and a light to
check on your kid in a dark room makes
this product a great bundle for the
price the smart connect mobile
definitely isn't perfect though I was
disappointed by the fact that there's
only one projection reel so you can't
see different animals on the ceiling or
the alphabet or different things like
that and also you can't use the
Bluetooth functionality on the speakers
to play your own music plus I wish you
could set it up over things like a car
seat or sleeper rather than just a crib
at the end of the day the fisher-price
smart connect mobile really works on
multiple levels especially if you're
looking for a device that just does it
all
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
