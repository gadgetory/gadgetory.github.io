depart like in the tech world go big or
go home that was invented here and go
home means go home and turn off the
lights so how does research in motion
avoid sitting in the dark I'm Brian
Cooley with the top five things the
blackberry has to accomplish in 2012 to
stay irrelevant number five ignite
developer support you've got to get devs
excited welcome whatever app they write
even if it's stupid assign an army to
support them give them great development
tools feed them lunch whatever it takes
but users increasingly see a phone as
the apps it runs and a lot of them don't
even know blackberries have apps number
four get blackberry 10 the new operating
system out the door this new BlackBerry
OS will be based on kunis which is a
very serious OS we've seen it running on
the playbook for example and it smokes
but bb10 was recently bumped to second
half of 2012 that means iphone 5 and 378
new android phones will have come out by
then sporting relentlessly updated
software blackberry could be forgotten
by late-2012 if they don't do something
number 3 whittle down the product line
we basically need a curve for the
cheapskates bold for Bob business and
something cool for the rest of us which
you don't make yet and anything with a
four-digit number as part of its model
name that's a red flag the engineers are
making the product team they're bitches
number to get the message clear and get
it out there with iOS and Android now
the established momentum leaders
BlackBerry has to drop back narrow its
focus and cut through the noise email
security and keyboard that used to be
the big rubric but that doesn't cut it
anymore horizons have broadened and
those things are just basically features
now not a platform IT departments are
increasingly letting us use our iPhone
or Android to connect to company
resources so that all vaunted blackberry
back in has to take its place alongside
a broader set of goodies before I take
you to the number one thing that has to
happen on the black
someone has to get forced in hinds some
meth the new CEO of rim all to calmly
explains that the company just needs a
nip and tuck here and there if we
continue doing well what we're doing I
see no problems of us being in the top
three players worldwide the next year's
and wireless that's like saying Keith
Richards looks pretty good just needs a
little powder we need some frenetic
urgency up in Waterloo the number one
thing that reham has to do is sell lust
they should have made Hannibal Lecter
their CEO now I think about it he had it
right when he said we covet what we see
Clarice you see much consumer lust for
smartphones still starts with the actual
phone even before the OS the apps in the
carrier come to mind there has to be
something shiny and cool the rest of the
industry hasn't thought of now you can't
hire Jonathan Ive away from Apple but
maybe you could kidnap him for a full
list of 10 things rim needs to do in
2012 check out Maggie Reardon's great
piece over at cnet news and for more top
5s like this head over to top 5 cnet com
