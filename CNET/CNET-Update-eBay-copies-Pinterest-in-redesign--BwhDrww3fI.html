Pinterest and you can order toothpaste
to be delivered within the hour from
you're limber laptop I'm Bridget Carey
and this is your cnet update ebay says
that people shop differently online now
so it has completely redesigned its
website to be an exact copy of Pinterest
well there is one difference unlike
Pinterest you can actually make a
purchase on ebay so ebay now curates a
list of featured products with large
images it's called the feed and there's
lots to scroll through so you can get
sucked into a browsing black hole you
can also create a personalized feed with
your interests ebays new look is rolling
out over the next few months but you can
activate it now by going to ebay.com /
feed search results product page design
and personal profiles also got a boost
ebay shoppers in San Francisco can also
try out ebay now it's an experimental
same-day delivery service ebay launch
the app for Apple devices and you just
can get goods delivered within the hour
from certain local retail stores such as
walgreens same-day delivery is also
something being tested at walmart and
amazon mini seems to be the trend e-tech
term now because Samsung just announced
the galaxy s3 mini smartphone and get
this it's called the mini but will have
a 4 inch touchscreen so 4 inches is now
a mini thing really Samsung if you wish
you could watch live TV on your phone or
tablet then you'll be interested in the
new slingbox models that are hitting
stores this Sunday it pulls in one is on
your cable box and let you access the
stream from a computer phone or tablet
the slingbox models start at one hundred
and eighty dollars there's no monthly
fee but the mobile apps do cost fifteen
bucks it's free though to view the
stream from a pc or mac if you're
planning on getting a new windows 8
laptop you're going to get bent out of
shape over how many choices there are
for laptop tablet hybrids lenovo just
showed off some flexible models there's
the yoga the twist and the links the
ideapad yoga 13 has a 360 degree hinge
that can do an impressive downward dog
pose and like many yoga memberships it
doesn't come cheap starting at 11
hundred dollars the point is that you
can flip the keyboard behind it or
use it to prop up and display to touch
screen the thinkpad edge twist is a
little cheaper eight hundred fifty
dollars it can bend back to this tenth
position but it also has a screen that
swivels and if you don't care for your
laptop you do the limbo there's the idea
tab links which has a tablet that snaps
into a keyboard dock it's cheaper it's
lighter and it has more battery the
tablet half has eight hours of battery
life but snap it into the keyboard
boosts it up to 16 hours that's your
tech news update for today you can get
