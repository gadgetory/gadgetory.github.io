vivo next phone vivo actually announced
the concept design for this phone in
February and it had some really cool
features so I'm excited to unbox this
for you guys looking at the box it's
mostly in Chinese I don't really know
what's inside but in the front as you
can see on the right of vivo it says it
has the FIFA World Cup symbol which is
cool because vivo is actually the
official smartphone sponsor for the FIFA
World Cup this year so let's get started
and right here we have the vivo necks
right off the bat I'm going to unpackage
it for you guys it's got that dual
camera on the back and I'm going to turn
it on so you guys can see this display
and so this phone actually is bezel as'
it has a small chin up that's at the
bottom but other than that there's no
bezels it has a six point five nine inch
OLED display and because it's bezel is
it doesn't have space for a front camera
or a speaker on the screen it also
doesn't as you notice have a button for
the fingerprint sensor it is actually
built in the screen meaning the
fingerprint sensor is underneath the
display and we can set this up and show
you how it works as you can see all the
applications on the phone are actually
in Chinese but thankfully the one thing
that we do need is in settings and it's
in English to type in the password that
we've already set up add a fingerprint
and since it's in screen I just press my
finger up to the screen and it sets it
up for me okay and now that the
thumbprint is set up we can exit out
when I put my thumbprint it worked other
than the fingerprint scanner the selfie
camera isn't in the screen as you can
see but it pops out from the top right
here and so if I open camera selfie see
that little piece right there
it actually pops out for you to take
your selfies it's an 8 megapixel camera
and it supports portrait mode so you get
those high quality selfies in there on
the back it has the dual camera setup
with a 5 megapixel and 12 megapixel
camera this is actually the black color
but it looks to have a rainbow effect
when put up against the light kind of
like a holograph it also comes in red
which I would personally prefer but this
is what we got now that we've looked at
the phone let's unbox the rest of this
has a little pull out flip it comes with
a case which is pretty nice it covers up
that holographic like backing comes with
vivo headphones see if I can they're
pretty nice you can put that in the
headphone jack at the top of the phone
put that to the side and another nice
feature is it sets the USB power adapter
separate from the USB cable for charging
as you can see the plug-in is a USBC
charger and it comes with the SIM card
tool this is always pretty nice to pop
out your SIM card if you need to and the
phone comes with dual SIM support
meaning it can hold two SIM cards at
once if you're in the West and keen to
get your hands on this phone you're
gonna have to wait so far all we know is
that it's going to come out in China and
it'll probably roll out in other Asian
countries where vivo has a presence such
as Singapore or Hong Kong as for now I'm
gonna go set up this phone play with it
a little bit and we'll get back to you
with review soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
