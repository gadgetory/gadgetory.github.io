personal meeting with the Xbox one X
also known as Project Scorpio Microsoft
says the One X is the most powerful
console on the market and from a real
estate standpoint it's the smallest Xbox
they've ever made it's actually
surprisingly compact but only slightly
smaller compared to the Xbox one s and
speaking of the s the 1x definitely
takes its design cues from the former
but in an all matte black finish around
back the ports are nearly identical to
the s and there's still one USB upfront
but it's what's under the hood that
makes the 1x so important it's
substantially more powerful in every
category including a custom 2.3
gigahertz eight core CPU and a custom
GPU with six teraflops of computing
power this lets the console play games
like the upcoming Forza Motorsport 7 in
4k and at 60 frames per second it also
packs in a 4k UHD blu-ray drive and a
one terabyte drive Microsoft is really
leaning into the notion that the One X
is the most powerful console around and
says games will look best on it it will
also improve the performance and looks
of older Xbox one games which means you
won't necessarily need a 4k TV to take
advantage of the upgrades but just like
the ps4 pro the Xbox one X is just a
step-up console it'll still play all the
existing Xbox one games and make use of
the same accessories but price at $4.99
compared to the ps4 pro at 399 it might
be a difficult sell right out of the
gate</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
