and today I have with me the samsung
galaxy s4 Google Play edition by now you
should be pretty well acquainted with
the device given that it's been
available from carriers for a couple of
months now however Google's unlock
variant just hit stores and you might be
wondering what the difference is for the
most part not much physically you won't
see a carrier logo or the words galaxy
s4 on the back in addition hardware
specs are all the same this includes the
same beautiful 5-inch 1080p touchscreen
the same 2.6 amperior battery and the
same quad-core Snapdragon 600 processor
previously seen in the US model so what
exactly has changed them well for one
thing you won't get Samsung's TouchWiz
UI rather this G is for runs the
skinless for point-to-point to jellybean
OS which I frankly find more elegant and
user-friendly you also won't get the
usual slew of carrier and Samsung
branded bloatware just your usual lineup
of google apps like chrome Gmail and
maps this does make a difference in
terms of the amount of available space
you get out of the box true the gs4 does
have expandable memory upto 64 gigs and
you could always uninstall some of the
apps that come pre-loaded but with the
16 gig model at least starting out
you'll get 12 gigs of storage with
Google's s4 compared to about nine gigs
from carrier editions unfortunately with
Samsung's branding stripped away so goes
a lot of cool software features that
some users might find really useful for
instance you won't get those neat I
control functions that automatically
pause videos or keeps the display lit by
sensing your eye movements earlier
versions of the Jewess will also let you
use the touchscreen with gloves on and
it could simultaneously display more
than one app on the screen at a time
these features and many other photo
features for the 13 megapixel camera
won't be natively available on the
handset the 4G LTE device is optimized
for GSM networks like AT&amp;amp;T and t-mobile
and while it's not a nexus branded
device google has confirmed that there
s4 will receive updates as quickly as
any other google edition handset now the
smartphone does come at a pretty penny
however
and while it's 649 dollar price tag
isn't uncommon or even unusual for a
top-tier unlock phone in the u.s. it is
still a steep price compared to s fours
under contract ultimately if you're a
die-hard and Jordan thusi 'used or
someone who wants total freedom from a
carrier or someone who can simply afford
it you won't be disappointed with the
device for everyone else however it may
be more economical to get the gs4 with
the carrier again I'm Lynn and you've
been checking out the samsung galaxy s4
Google Play edition</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
