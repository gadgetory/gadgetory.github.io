for just $49 in the u.s. say hello to
max our biggest and best sound at Google
home ever so today we're announcing
smart sound a new audio experience
powered by Google's AI it allows max to
adapt to you so for example if you set
up a speaker near wall on a shelf in a
corner fairly common places it can
dramatically change the sound balance of
the speaker and make the music sound
muddy and the vocals lose clarity well
with smart sound we automatically tune
the speaker to correct for this effect
using a machine learning model trained
with thousands of different room
configurations what's really cool this
is all done dynamically so if you decide
to move max a few feet it'll compensate
within seconds google home max will be
available starting december for $399 we
worked hard to combine the most helpful
parts of a laptop a tablet and a smart
phone to fit how we use technology today
meet Google pixel book the high
performance Chromebook
and when you're using your pixel book as
a tablet its easiest to show your
assistant what you need help with on
your screen that's why we created the
new pixel book pen just hold the Pens
button and circle an image or text on
the screen and the assistant will take
action when you're browsing through a
blog and discover a new musician you can
circle their photo and the system will
give you more information about them
pixel book starts at $9.99 and I'm
really excited to share an entirely new
type of camera that works with your
pixel we call it Google clips when
you're behind a camera you look for
people you care about you look for
smiles you look for that moment your dog
starts chasing her tail clips does all
of that for you and because the software
is at the core of the camera it's gonna
get smarter over time clip tably coming
