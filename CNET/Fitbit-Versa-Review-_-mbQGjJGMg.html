something that's super hooked in and
deeply connected to your phone or is
this I'm more like a fitness tracker
with some basic functions and
notifications that's meant to be it more
like a laid back watch Fitbit has a new
SmartWatch called the Versa that's less
expensive than Apple watch has a longer
battery life you can swim with it and
also get some notifications I've been
wearing it in San Francisco for about a
week as I've been on vacation and it
worked so has it been working pretty
good the nice thing about the Versa is
that notifications come in kind of like
the old Pebble watch if you wore that
you can check them but you can't answer
to them you can do quick responses if
you've got an Android phone the rest of
it is really by checking time checking
fitness stats starting workouts music is
kind of a pain it's got a music remote
that connects to your phone but if you
want to put music on your watch you got
the side load it from your computer
which is not great or use Pandora or
Deezer I don't know who uses those now
it also has some things I really like I
love the fact that it vibrates to wake
me up on a smart alarm so I can set it
go to sleep and it's got that and I
sleep tracking which is something that I
actually use to remind myself how little
sleep I'm getting the other thing I
really like is got three buttons on it
which are customizable so those buttons
plus a pretty responsive touch screen I
mean the you can customize for quick
starts and that gives you access to all
the basic controls you kinda need one
thing this doesn't have is any ability
to answer phone calls that doesn't have
a speakerphone and this model does not
have contactless payments you can pay up
for about thirty dollars more to get a
special edition that does but be
forewarned Fitbit pay does not support a
heck of a lot of banks including my
credit cards
the other thing this doesn't have is any
sort of voice assistant so if you want
to do any voice setting of timers forget
about it there's no microphone on this
thing fit fit versa also doesn't have
GPS it connects with your phone to do
connected GPS tracking but on its own it
doesn't do any GPS you're gonna have to
get the Fitbit ionic or the Apple watch
does that you on the series three Fitbit
claims four days of battery life on the
Versa but after three days of solid use
it's already almost out of batteries so
I'd say it's a little more like three
days battery life not four it's a it's a
lower key watch so again this is not as
step-up and features as a lot of
high-end smartwatches but with its
ability to run apps and have watch faces
and do a bit more than your average
Fitbit and the fact that it's waterproof
something a lot of fitbit's don't have I
really like its overall feature set I
think it's the best Fitbit that's out
there and a two hundred dollars is not
too expensive if you like the design and
you like the way that feels I would
recommend going for it but stay tuned
because we're going to do a lot more
workout testing with it including
comparisons against the Apple watch
Fitbit says just enough to be an
everyday good watch for me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
