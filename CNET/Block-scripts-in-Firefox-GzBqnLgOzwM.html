not talking about the ones that appear
in forums from trolls like they'll fill
your bed with eels I'm talking about
things like malware cross-site scripting
attacks clickjacking a lot of these
attacks work by injecting scripts into
webpages that you don't even know are
there and you can give yourself a
modicum more protection by running a
Firefox plug-in called
no script no script blocks all scripts
from running until you authorize them
here's how to get it go to
addons.mozilla.org and search for no
script install it like you would any
add-on once you have it installed look
in the bottom right corner at the little
s with the cross out symbol clicking on
it brings up a submenu that allows you
to choose how to handle scripts on the
page you're looking at
the safest way is not to allow any
scripts you'll never fall victim to code
that doesn't run but some sites won't
work without script so the next safest
thing is to temporarily allow only the
scripts you need and/or trust a lazier
and slightly less safe method is to
temporarily allow all the scripts on a
page the next more convenient level but
also next less safe is to permanently
allow scripts either individually or all
for a page this becomes necessary if you
want to take advantage of things like
maybe your bank's website or Google Docs
where you don't want to constantly allow
scripts every time you launch your
browser although it does make those less
safe if you permanently allow scripts
from a site you're putting your trust in
that site that it will never allow
itself to be infected by a malicious
script the very worst thing you can do
is this one globally allow all scripts
you might as well just not run no script
at all at that point if you've allowed a
script on a page and you change your
mind about it you can always choose to
forbid to start blocking it again
running no script means you're going to
have to do a bit more thinking about the
pages you surf to it was enlightening
when I first started running no script
which of my banks and utilities worked
just fine without scripts and which
became disabled if nothing else no
script gives you more
control over what risks you expose
yourself to on the net for that reason
alone I run it I'm Tom Merritt CNET comm</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
