there have been people who listen to
them way too loud I'm Donald Bell and in
today's how-to I'm gonna show you how to
set a volume limit on your iPhone iPad
or iPod and for parents how to lock that
setting so your kid will just have to
deal with it now before we start and
head off and do a hate mail frenzy I'm
probably gonna get from teenagers all
over the world let's take a minute to
acknowledge why people listen to these
things too loud most of the time the
problem is that music is being pushed
through cheap headphones that came
included your kid probably loves bass
and these cheap earbuds are terrible
reproducing low frequencies unless you
crank up the volume to full blast
so to lessen the sting of locking down
your volume or your kids volume make it
up with a headphone upgrade scene that
has a list of 22 great options for under
$50 and for some of you it'll be like
hearing your music for the first time
alright I've said my piece here's how to
lower your maximum volume using an
iPhone or iPad or an iPod Touch plug in
your headphones and get some music going
and raise the volume up to the maximum
level you're comfortable with next make
a note of the volume level which you'll
see down here across the bottom for me
is a little over halfway on this iPhone
now go back to the home screen then tap
Settings and then scroll down and select
music next tap the volume limit and pull
down the volume slider to the maximum
volume level you decided on then tap the
back arrow until you're back to the main
menu now when you turn the volume level
all the way up it shouldn't sound like
it's gonna blast off your ears anymore
but if you're worried that your kid is
gonna go back in and undo the changes
here's how to lock down that maximum
volume setting with a password head back
into settings but this time tap general
and then select restrictions next hit
enable restrictions at the top of the
page and enter a four-digit password and
then re-enter it one more time just to
confirm now if you want to inflict some
real pain you can use the same menu to
disable access to all sorts of features
and apps but all I'm interested in here
is at the bottom where it says volume
limit
tap that change it to don't allow
changes and then back out all the way to
the main menu now be sure to remember
that password that you created because
you'll need it again if you ever want to
undo those changes or if you ever want
to add extra restrictions because your
kids a real jerk more tips like this
head over to how to cnet.com and
seriously don't forget to upgrade those
headphones I'm Tom Bell thanks for
