cnet.com and this is a quick look at
Bowers &amp;amp; Wilkins $400 p7 Wireless which
came out in 2016 is one of the swankier
wireless headphones available I like the
wired p7 and this model looks a lot like
that one and has the same excellent
build quality and premium design with
leather covered ear pads and a sturdy
metal infused headband in case you're
wondering even though it's wireless it
does come with a wire in case you want
to go wired and you will get a touch
better sound using that wire
what's likable about these headphones is
that after a little break-in period they
offer a tight seal around your ears
delivering good passive noise isolation
but they don't put too much pressure on
your head while they're characterized as
mobile headphones they're fairly beefy
weighing in at 318 grams or 28 grams
more than the wired p7 weighs the
headphones fold up but not flat into an
included Halfmoon shaped carrying case
battery life is rated at 17 hours of
playback that's very good but not
fantastic for this type of full-size
over-the-ear wireless headphone I didn't
have any trouble pairing and repairing
the headphones with an iPhone 6s in
Galaxy s7 edge overall the headphones
were a pleasure to use ro bluetooth
headphones sound quality's excellent
there's lots of bass and the headphone
definitely goes deep but may lack a
little bit of punch for some folks hours
and Wilkins headphones tend to be a
touch warmer and more laid-back than
some models from Bose Sony and
Sennheiser in this price range if you're
a detail hound this one may not be for
you that quibble aside the p7 Wireless
is an excellent wireless headphone that
has the look feel and sound of a premium
wireless headphone it certainly
recommendable it does face a lot of
competition in this price range and I
can't tell you it's my clear choice over
the Sennheiser momentum Wireless Bose
QuietComfort 35 particularly if you're
looking for something a little lighter
with active noise-cancelling
capabilities</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
