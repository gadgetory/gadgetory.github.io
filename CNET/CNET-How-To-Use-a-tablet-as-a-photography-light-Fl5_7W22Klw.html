one of these why not combine their
powers together to make some cool photos
I'm Lexus avedis from seen it and in
this tutorial I'm going to show you
three creative ways to use your tablet
as a photography light the first is
light painting which produces light
streaks and shapes in your image now you
can use any light source for light
painting but an iPad or a tablet is
really useful for this because of the
large surface area find a dark room or
even shoot outdoors at night then grab a
tripod and set your exposure on the
camera if you want tips on studying your
camera exposure check out the full text
tutorial on cnet you can display all
sorts of images on your tablet screen to
make shapes spell out words or paint
blocks of color in your long exposures
some apps that make your life even
easier include softbox pro for ipad and
soft light for Android softbox pro even
comes with a bunch of different shapes
and colors so you can set the screen
accordingly not only is a tablet great
for light painting but it's also a
really useful backdrop if you like
taking macro or still life photos then
find an image to display on the screen
and then place an object in front of it
turn up the brightness and then use a
shallow depth of field on your camera in
order to slightly blur out the
background remember to only use photos
that you have the rights to use or
Creative Commons images you can also
place a smaller object on top of your
tablet and display an image so it looks
like the floor is glowing now I'm going
to show you a third way to use your
tablet as a creative light source and
that's as a softbox you'll need a
subject and possibly an assistant to
help hold the tablet so you can get in
the right spot there's plenty of apps
available that can act as a DIY softbox
like the ones i highlighted earlier but
it's just as easy to display a pure
white image on the screen those are just
three creative ways to use your tablet
as a light source for your photos if you
want to check out more tips and tricks
