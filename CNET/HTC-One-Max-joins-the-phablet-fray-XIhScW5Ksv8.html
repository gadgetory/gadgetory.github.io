tossed a good all court with cnet this
is your first look at the HTC One max
the HTC One max is undoubtedly part of
the one family of phones except that it
has an enormous 5.9 inch display 1080p
HD quality on that so it's going to look
clear and bright won't be quite as pixel
dense as the HTC One there are some
differences with this phone other than
the size for one the power button moves
over here to the side there's still the
IR blaster up top though and another
move the back cover is removable there's
a little sliding lock on the Left spine
that will help you unlock the back of
the phone the battery is still embedded
the 3300 milliamp battery in here but
you will get access to the micro sim
card slot and to the micro SD card slot
beneath you'll have up to 64 gigabytes
of external storage to play with one of
the most interesting new features is a
fingerprint scanner on the back of the
phone that's what this black box is
right below the camera module it will
support up to three fingers either yours
or somebody else's there will also be a
backup pin required when you use the
fingerprint scanner so the scanner
doesn't work you will still be able to
get into your phone the max runs Android
4.3 jelly bean and is the first phone to
ship with Sense 5.5 you get a few extra
editions with this version of sense
including customizations to blinkfeed
including being able to turn it off like
the HTC one that came before there is a
4 megapixel ultrapixel camera on the
back with flash and there is a 2.1
megapixel front-facing camera as well
under the hood you've got the same
processor that's in the HTC One in other
words a 1.7 gigahertz quad-core Qualcomm
Snapdragon 600 chipset
I don't have pricing for this bad boy
yet but it should be coming to verizon
and sprint in the US in time for the
holiday season I'm Jessica Valcourt for
