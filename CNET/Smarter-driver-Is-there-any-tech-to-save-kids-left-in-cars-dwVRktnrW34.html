that weren't even moving
51% inadvertently left in their car by
their parents 30% were playing in the
car became locked in and 17% were left
in their car by folks who presumably
were just going to be a few minutes
unclear to some parents and pet owners
still is the speed at which the inside
of a car heats up even on a mild summer
day with temperatures in the low 80s
that car will get to heatstroke level in
10 minutes or less so that whole thing
about I just was gonna pop in the store
for 10 minutes takes on a whole new
gravity looking at that nest thermostat
on your wall or the fitness band on your
wrist you would think there has to be
some sensor based technology out there
to prevent these tragedies but there
isn't as recently as July 2014 the
National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration says flat-out there is no
recommendable technology to prevent
leading kids in cars not for a lack of
looking nitsa tested 18 prevention
systems that range from pressure and
weight sensors that detect a child in
the back seat to warn proximity sensors
that alert you when you get too far from
your child to simple reminder bracelets
that are the equivalent of tying a
string around your finger in all and
it's a pronounced the entire category
inconsistent and unreliable
offering at best a false sense of
security
now Volvo had a concept car called the
FCC that envisioned a comprehensive
detector in the vehicle to figure out if
there were people or animals left inside
but it was a concept never gained in
production
they did however do a reduced version of
that technology for a few years that was
the Volvo personal car communicator it
was a smart key fob that tied into a
heartbeat detector in the vehicle
supposedly could tell you if the
boogieman was sitting in the backseat in
a dark parking lot as you came back to
your car it didn't last on the market
very long and it wasn't able to detect
children anymore
Ford and Intel just unveiled a concept
technology called mobi that places
cameras all over the car's cabin for a
variety of purposes including
customizing settings but omitted is any
specific goal of child detection some
cars now come with a so called
wide-angle conversation mirror and that
lets you see the entire back row better
also consider putting your purse laptop
or some other must take item in the back
seat with your child and when it comes
to animals it's not enough to just crack
the window you should know this by now
dogs and cats don't sweat like we do
just a little through their paws and
their noses so for them it's about
having a moderated temperature and
access to full fresh air in other words
not being hemmed into a vehicle so I'm
afraid to say the best technology for
dealing with this issue is right now no
technology it pays to double check who's
left behind in your car and for real
safety make sure the answer is nobody</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
