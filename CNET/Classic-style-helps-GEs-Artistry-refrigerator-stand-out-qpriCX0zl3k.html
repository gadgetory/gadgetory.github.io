looking at here is a bottom freezer unit
it's got twenty point three cubic feet
of total space and it's in GES
artistry line all the appliances in that
line are designed with this sort of
retro feel designed to harken back to
the days of yore
so it's old-fashioned both in its
appearance and in the fact that it
doesn't have a lot of frills or features
if you spill something on this top shelf
you better expect to spend the rest of
your day cleaning water off of
everything I mean it's gonna drip
everywhere on every item of food on the
shelves beneath beneath the drawers on
the bottom but you'll know not to do
that next time won't you by keeping
things simple the price stays down 1204
something that looks like a designer
appliance is really really good now I do
have a small wish list for it I really
do like spill-proof shelves and I wish
these were spill proof I also much
prefer on any bottom freezer unit that
the freezer pulls out as a drawer as
opposed to a hinged door and the basket
in there even feels cheap and you have
to have the door opened all the way just
to pull it out at the default
arrangement you also don't have a lot of
vertical space for tall items so you're
gonna need to move those shelves around
a little bit pulling them out of place
is easy but putting them back you might
think they're secure but you'll walk
away and they'll come tumbling down
because the back side of the hooks
aren't properly in place but you
probably won't end up moving the shelves
all that often and this fridge actually
fits a surprising amount of food we
packed in both our normal items like
milk jugs and our larger pizza boxes and
casserole dishes into this fridge
compartment all at the same time and to
top it all off this fridge performed
really well the FDA recommends keeping
easily spoil herbal foods below 40
degrees and almost every compartment but
the lower bin on the door stays below
that 40 degree mark and at the coldest
setting everything stayed above 32
degrees where foods gonna start to
freeze and again below that 40 degree
mark it was really good for its
performance with a wide range of usable
settings it sold
fashioned simple none of these frills
but it backs up that style with nice
performance and a surprising amount of
space for more be sure to check out my
