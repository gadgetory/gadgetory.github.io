schoolers but the s80 is getting a
makeover it is time to admit that the
s80 and a CT has become far too
disconnected from the work of our high
schools the new test rolls out in 2016
and will focus on practical knowledge
such as more commonly used vocabulary
and core math skills the college board
also announced an exclusive partnership
with online learning site Khan Academy
to offer free materials to help students
prepare for the s80 we're not in the
game of hey you know when in doubt pick
C because statistically you have a five
percent chance more chance of getting it
right we're not into this this
gamesmanship we're more in let's make
sure you have really really solid
fundamentals for students studying for
the current s80 Khan Academy has
launched videos that break down hundreds
of actual questions from previous SATs
the move puts Khan Academy in the
territory of princeton review and kaplan
companies that offer test prep courses
costing hundreds of dollars it's also
partnering with the White House to help
increase college opportunities for
lower-income families a lot of students
just don't understand how to navigate
the system how much does it cost how do
you apply for financial aid what essays
do the are the university is looking for
what scores matter how do you prepare
for the standardized tests peter wang
used khan academy to study for advanced
placement exams while in high school i
couldn't rely on kind of a parent
resource I didn't have that traditional
route Khan Academy really allows you to
kind of just do it on your own pace at
your own house Hwang is now a junior at
Stanford University looking back he
credits his academic success in part to
Khan Academy in Mountain View California
