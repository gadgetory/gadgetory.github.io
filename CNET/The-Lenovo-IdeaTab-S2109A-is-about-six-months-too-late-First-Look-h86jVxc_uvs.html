to have s 2109 a it looked like a heck
of a bargain it's a 10 inch tablet with
a useful number of connection and
expansion options for only three hundred
and fifty dollars sounds exciting but
then I pull that excitement rug right
from under you by mentioning that the
tablet market moves fast and what may
have seemed like a great deal even six
months ago isn't so much compared to the
competition of today hi i'm eric
franklin and today i'll take a first
look at the lenovo ideatab s 2109 a
lenovo is a 10-inch tablet running
android 4.3 with a very iPad like 43
aspect ratio and even more specifically
an ipad 2 like resolution of 1024 x 768
what this gives you as a more square
shaped tablet that lenovo made fairly
thin and pretty like compared to others
other things Lenovo made this seem here
that actually feels more like a crevice
and comes off as kind of shoddy as for
ports the idea tab sports a microSD slot
micro HDMI and a micro USB port there's
also a volume rocker a 1.3 megapixel
front camera and four speakers on the
back inside it houses a dual-core omap
cpu which I know dual-core get you all
excited but seriously it's not all that
great launching apps is fast and screen
transitions are actually really smooth
but sometimes when you're navigating
through menus there are some of what i
call unplanned pauses also app download
speeds were a lot slower than other
tablets in its class and while the
screen was responsive the vast majority
of the time there were instances when i
spent like 10 seconds attempting to
swipe the lock screen open most movies
run smoothly including some 1080p files
but one of our test vids that runs like
butter on most tablets was a stuttery
mess here Riptide achieved playable
frame rates but I gotta say when I don't
get those Tegra 3 specific effects I
kind of miss them
the camera is lacking in quality to say
the least but does at least include head
tracking the Lenovo is a good tablet and
$350 is an appealing price till you
start paying attention to what else is
out there when I started doing that it
became really hard to recommend it there
are clearly better tablets out there for
just a bit more money once again i'm
eric franklin and this is in the first
look at the lenovo ideatab as 2109 a</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
