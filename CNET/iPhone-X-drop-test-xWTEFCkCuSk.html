the iPhone 10 the last thing you want to
do is scratch it or drop it so we're
doing it for you we're putting the
iPhone 10 through some durability tests
to see how well it holds up I've a set
of keys here for our scratch test which
are probably gonna be your biggest
defenders whether in a pocket or in a
purse and this is an iPhone 10 in space
gray I also have a silver iPhone 10 just
to see which one is most noticeable I'm
starting with a Space Gray and I'm gonna
go in right under the iPhone sign and
I'm really gonna go really strong on
this all right I'm putting a lot of
pressure on these phones right now
honestly I can't see any scratches on
the back it survived the keys so now
we're gonna see if they survived the
sandpaper if you happen to have it on a
rough surface starting again with the
Space Gray iPhone
so that made some damage on both phones
and as expected it is more noticeable on
the Space Gray I am gonna go ahead and
retire the silver one for now and focus
on what you actually want to keep safe
which is the screen I'm going in with
the same key with not too much pressure
on the top left-hand corner next to the
notch and it didn't make much damage and
let's try the sandpaper now oh yeah you
can definitely see the damage I didn't
even press that hard on the sandpaper
now let's take it outside to do our drop
test the sidewalk is where most phones
come to meet their doom probably from
about pocket height so that's exactly
what we're doing now starting off screen
side up it landed screen side down but
it actually hit the back of the phone
first so I can already see the first
crack on the back of the phone look at
that there's a fracture on the corner of
that glass back let's turn it around it
looks like the screen is okay the screen
survived but again it hit the back first
and it cracked at the first drop and
there's another fracture up here it's
tiny so I haven't noticed it at first
but there's a tiny pressure on the other
corner and already a scuff on that
stainless steel frame Wow so we already
did some damage on the back of the phone
now I'm gonna try to have it land to
screen side down
so I can already see that the back of
the phone is cracked even more
there are spider webs all over going
through the entire back of the phone
that wasn't there before so we did some
damage on the back and it did land on
the front so let's turn it over I'm
scared to look oh yeah definitely a lot
of damage mainly on the bottom of the
phone and I have the feeling this is
where it hit first you can see over here
this was probably the first point of
impact
it's a pretty deep blow there's actually
a little bit of glass coming out as I'm
touching it right now and then there's
another bump over here and just some
fractures all along the bottom of the
phone I hadn't seen that at the
beginning but as I'm playing with the
phone you can notice another fracture
right here running across the screen up
here kind of going nuts right now
there's one more fracture and I'm going
to turn it off because I think I can see
it better when it's dark yep there you
go
well that's the rap the icon ten can
probably handle your everyday wear and
tear but dropping it without a case is
out of the question we learned it only
takes one bad drop to break the glass on
this phone now is it more fragile than
past iPhones that's tough to say because
none of our tests are scientific but the
higher price will make dropping this one
hurt a lot more</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
