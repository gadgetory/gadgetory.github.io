scene at New York podcast studio it is
May 17th and we are ready to kick off
episode 229 of the 359 podcast my name
is B V G and in the house today I've got
Alfred Inge and Joanie soles Minh and
sorry we're a little late today because
we're getting ready for Google i/o have
you heard of it it was like small
startup so seriously like normal humans
call Google yes
io is for true passionate followers
which are readers I'm watching so yeah
so they'll be probably talking a lot
more about Android Oh today which I
found out is not the same thing as
Roboto so I've just learned about that
and we'll also be talking more about the
wanna cry ransomware because it's still
one of the worst ransomware attacks in
the world and the hacker group that
basically released the NSA tools that
helps to fuel the spread of wanna cry
resurfaced after missing for about nine
months so we'll be talking about both of
them on the podcast today so stick
around and we'll be back to join you in
the chat in three minutes and 59 seconds
from 3 to welcome to the 359 on malphur
dang I'm Joanie Sussman Google's i/o
conference kicks off today at 10 a.m.
Pacific Time which we've got full
coverage of that you can check out on
cnet.com you can expect a lot more
details about the next update to Android
which they called Android Oh hopefully
that's for Oreo they're also going to be
revealing what they're bringing to the
table of Google home virtual reality and
all the other millions of things that
Android is on so John you know knowing
what we know about Google and Android oh
what's on your wish list for Google i/o
why definitely want to I mean everyone
wants to know what candy um I was going
to be but I think a lot of people are
interested in Google home and Google
assistant how that's going to right now
are in a world where the echo and Alexa
are the assistant in the home that's on
everybody's the tip of everyone's tongue
like Google home hasn't really been able
to penetrate and
take over where echo is just kind of
like rocketed into popularity so to be
answered to see what they can offer that
will be able to supplant I mean what
updates do you think that they'll need
for Google home or like the Google
assistant to effectively compete with
Amazon's echo like lineup they have like
seven of them that right and there's one
Google home I think well part of the
problem is that Amazon benefited from
the store like the echo system that it
has cool has a giant echo system but
it's just so fragmented in a way like
you know what I mean like it what do you
know you don't use five chat app search
is a really important thing but it's not
a thing you want to do with your speaker
and that's the thing that Amazon is I'm
sorry that Google is best at so do you
think that they need to add other
features like the side search kind of
like calling like what Amazon did a few
I don't think it's about volume its
volume of features I think it's about
figuring out what it can do better than
Amazon can giving people one reason why
they're like I can't do that on my echo
yeah I remember they had a cool feature
it was like kind of like voice
recognition so it would know your voice
profile based on I mean I thought that
was something that would like take on
the vehicle like really proficiently
just because like based off of like
calendars you can only have one right
now in Amazon echo whereas Google if it
recognizes your voice and tell you like
what your events are versus like what
maybe like your kids events are that day
yeah and with music too if you want to
listen to music that's tailored to you
then when your husband or child ask for
listening to music that's tailored to
them it shouldn't be the stuff that's
further yeah I know my girlfriend hates
it when I'm on her Spotify on echo
because Grey's ever discovered weekly so
yesterday the hacker group the shadow
brokers resurfaced for the first time in
months after they wanna cry ransomware
outbreak so in April they released an
NSA exploit that allowed the ransomware
to spread as fast as it did and in their
resurgence warned that there would be
more leaks in a data dump of the Month
Club starting in June so it'd be based
off of a subscription model and they
compared it to like this is like a wine
of the Month Club I think of it as like
the Netflix of brands more well no
because I can't just keep going back on
it and they've also mentioned in the
past that
care what people do with their leeks so
even if I if it was like just me that's
subscribed to it and I got all the data
dumps if like it would most likely go
public because we would just publish it
online or on these like databases where
people can get access to it they said
that you know they have more exploits
coming for Windows devices routers and
browsers they've also said that they
have exploits for Windows 10 devices if
you notice the wanna cry virus spread
basically off of old outdated and
machines but this one they're saying
they have you know exploits for the
latest Windows Device so they're going
to be releasing more details on that but
security experts that I've spoken to
have said it's doubtful that they have
Windows 10 exploits considering that all
their stuff that they stole from the NSA
was like a few months ago not a few
months like from like a few years ago
what it means is for you know consumers
is that you're more exposed yes
basically like even if you were
protected by not having the most ancient
possible Windows version out there this
means that you're more expected all
right well if you like these stories be
sure to check us out on Tina calm mal
mal for ding I'm Joni Salzman all right
Joan you got me thinking when you were
talking earlier about the echo but the
echo ecosystem yeah
and Matthew the echo system if you just
have bad pronunciation Matthew in the
chat says yeah all right fine
Matthew in the chat saying he's had a
less than favorable experience with his
Google home for a myriad of reasons from
the actual voice recognition literally
like the pitch of voice it struggles
with sometimes um do you think this is
going to be a hot ticket at i/o this
year Google general yeah yeah it last
year and because I think these companies
Google and Amazon in particular have
talked about how voice is the next
computing platform like we're we've been
through this period where mobile is the
thing that's dominated the transit the
transformation of our cultures and of
how we communicate and how we understand
the world and blah blah blah their
argument is that voice and artificial
intelligence is what's going to be
driving
next phase that's going to be the next
major computing platform and so home is
a big part of that for them Google
assistance a big part of that them so I
imagine is going to be a centerpieces
here to can imagine how it couldn't be I
mean it's where everybody's talking
about even though Amazon's got kind of
leaps and bounds ahead of everybody at
this point that's yeah standard yeah it
how smart can you make your home yeah I
mean but the thing is I think that's the
reason that it's appealing to most
people echo in that sense is because
it's not how smart can you make your
home it's how easy it is to use for a
limit like very specific things like
everybody uses echo for music timers and
whether than maybe traffic like it's
four things and it does really well and
I'm sure Google homes can do those maybe
it can't I actually haven't used Google
home I don't know if you guys have tried
it I had trouble using it well yeah you
had a test yeah really frustrating
setting it up with our Wi-Fi but to be
fair like our Wi-Fi is a little
different than me and interntional Wi-Fi
mine Evan yeah so I don't blame the
Google home for that but I will say it
was frustrating I was worried about the
the echo dot though or just like
Amazon's echo in general I don't know
like how widespread the adoption like
really is like I'm like the only person
in my friend group that has it and the
only reason why I got it because like
only fifty dollars and I work in you
know just feel the words like I should
know like how these work and like why
like you know why people are talking
about them so much like I suggested them
to my friend because I really liked it
and really I don't know why I need this
you know that's kind of the thing where
it is probably going to be the future at
some point I think people probably had
the same mentality when it came in like
the first iPhone or like the first
smartphone was I why would I need my
phone go online no I think that was a
mentality with mobile phones maybe not
with iPhone because Apple is such a
follower like you know what do they call
it fast follower or they take something
that's already become like a thing
that's got traction and make it perfect
give the old Apple spit-shine yeah
exactly
um but I remember I mean when mobile
phones were becoming popular a lot of
people were like why the how do you need
to reach me all the time yeah kind of
like I still say that to people so yeah
Josh in the chat thinks that Google
needs to add an echo dot yeah confit
that's what I'm saying like if they made
one that was like $50 I guarantee you
like like that comp
gap in between like Google and like
Amazon on this would would like clothes
like so quickly yeah because the problem
is they're not in enough homes and you
know not gotta up the D competition yeah
and the thing is like at that price like
you can't justify to somebody like why
they need this for their home yeah
unless they're like already got money to
blow otherwise it's just like that's
again like I said that's the only reason
why I bought the echo dot like it was
like $50 I don't like them yet I mean
that speaks to one of Google's previous
like homerun hits from an IO which was
when they first don't filled chromecast
you get it for $35 you can get a year of
Netflix free I think or was it three
months of Netflix weeks you basically
like they're basically giving them away
for it for free and those things became
ubiquitous yeah you look like in six
months you gonna you look at all the
Google things that have like caught on
from like IO that like are late hit and
then you look at the price tags on them
and like that's obviously like a huge
factor on it like even yeah like Google
cardboard which was like free in some
cases and like five dollars if you like
really wanted one and I see them like
everywhere they're like given out at
like 7-eleven and stuff but yeah
chromecast - that's like my go-to like
birthday present - yeah it's 35 dollars
but like it's like so helpful for people
right there's nothing like pejorative
about having a product that's priced and
cheaply if it's not a bad product like
Apple's special and Samsung is special
with their phones because people have
already realized that it's worth paying
hundreds of dollars to them it's worth
not paying hundred dollars for the later
downgrade you know what a real that
might be kind of cool for for like if
Google did want to come out their
version of like an echo dot hmm so you
know the chromecast like audio where you
can just plug it into a speaker and it
turns it into like a Bluetooth speaker
right if they're a little make something
like that but like also make it like a
smart speaker mm-hmm that would be like
yeah really useful and what I mean
I enjoyed the Google Play experience
that ecosystem I subscribe to it I use
it I've used it for years there's like
cloud backup my massive library yeah I
would love to be able to take my entire
to go on a thumb drive right more or
less like that's kind of how they
because that's the thing like I like you
said like the Google ecosystems like
perfectly fit for someone
that where it's like if you have YouTube
bread or if you have like YouTube TV I
would not be able to do that from like
my echo to my chromecast because they
don't like to play nice with each other
but if if Google had something that was
like around the same price point and
then I already have my chromecast and I
already have my Android phone and all
these things like they would all work
together so well and then as opposed to
like oh you can't do that because Amazon
doesn't like YouTube like that kind of
it's just frustrating
it sounds like David in the chat wants
Google to go ahead and skip an Amazon
step and go right to the the echo show
and put a touch screen on knowing no
you're sure I'm just you already know I
didn't feel about this but I'm just
going to say it again where like I still
think that's like one of the weirdest or
like dumbest decisions on Amazon's
and it's a smart landline it makes no
sense no yeah but their phone was pretty
bad too I mean yes we did which is not
what at that point it's not one of the
words because I've had so many bad yeah
it's I think part of the reason is that
it's look if you have $230 to blow then
go ahead sure like you can like video
chat with your friends but you know what
else you can video chat with your
friends on yeah a laptop a phone that's
I think there another failure was the
Google glasses yes however Jer Jerell
I'm I apologize Jarrell in the chat is
asking he wants the Google glasses back
what do we think about that all right
while we're at it calling us everybody
else what's your wish list for this year
we're just kind of burned in time
because the stream is about to kick off
and then we're going to send it over to
our team in San Francisco and they're
going to lead the charge on that so we
appreciate your being here with us as we
all kind of collectively speculate well
what does he want Google glass in like
the same form factor though like those
little weird well I want Google glasses
back well the thing that's I mean one of
he kind of alludes to a point made me
that he's not trying to make but I'm
going to just extrapolate sorry but
Google glass never really got a shot
like it was only always just a
development product like it was never
even though you could order them and you
could be whatever they call them
explorers like you could be an explorer
with Google glass yeah Emily a trial
program yeah it was a trial program from
the beginning and when they realized
that they were the trial was like
crashing and burning
they never made it a consumer product
like a legit something that you could
just go out
Iram art of your life one of my
professors like was part of that little
program and I tried it out for a day and
it just you just like imagine trying to
talk to somebody or there's like looking
like yeah at the top left corner the
whole time and like they're not talking
to you or they are talking about they're
not looking at you and it's just like it
hurts your eyes it hurts to like talk to
other people I don't know if they're
going to bring it back that it has to be
a completely different form factor
because the way it is now with like a
headband with a little like shard of
glass on the top corner like just did
not look cool at all yeah but I think
that a lot has changed since then I mean
that when did google glass come out that
was two years ago three years ago a lot
has changed since then I mean it's only
been two or three years but in that time
like VR headsets didn't exist until
about a year ago as a publicly
accessible product and people look still
look dorky with her wearing VR headsets
but they look less dorky now I just want
VR head touch to look cool like ski
goggles looked cool in like the 90s when
people would wear them like up top here
without like Webber Magnum oh yeah like
Method Man did that all the time and
Redman and it was so cool that's
subjective I just want the VR like just
in that fashion I think we were getting
a bit of a hive mindset going on in here
at Simon Cross seems to agree with you I
said he says I need to be able to
connect a set of speakers to both my
chromecast and chromecast Audio then I
can go the go hole home on audio at home
imagine Sagi oh jeez I lost it I lost at
Google seems just uh seems to stay with
only one form factor unfortunately I
agree with Alfred that they need a
cheaper Google home I think they are
largely on the same page it's like eight
things that's why I bought the the
Kindle Fire tablet to the seven with the
fifty dollar one just because it's cheap
just give me cheap stuff that works well
that's like that's my like bottom line
like if it's cheap and it works fine
like I'm buying it like he brings up a
good pain point about echo where echo
really fails is that you can't connect
your dots or your echoes to each other
throughout your house yeah not really
like if you want to be playing and I
could be wrong but as I understand it
you can't be playing like if you're in
your bedroom and you're playing your
music on that echo
and you go down your stairs to your
kitchen you want to just keep playing
that oh you can't do that with with
Amazon product expression which is
really frustrating I think for a lot of
people may be awesome though is it the
same with Lana to that you have it
follow you like yeah and they're like
why can't she just do that that's one of
those things that I think normal
consumers maybe there's a technological
reason why it's really difficult or
maybe there's a reason why they don't
want to do it economically it's better I
don't know if I could like where the
music as it plays back on your head and
I don't know just aside uh yeah that'd
be really cool if Google came out with
something like that like like a phone
for your head phone heads phone heads
yeah that'd be really cool that would be
my gown like that I would spend easily
like two three hundred dollars for those
if you like Coneheads we have to wrap it
up soon because uh the getting ready to
kick off the i/o coverage in that in our
SF office but I wanted to bring up I
think josh has an interesting point here
in the chat Google can take the market
that snapchat tried to start with the
spectacled I'm assuming he's falling
down on the lines of the Google globe
with spectacles those are specifically
only glasses as thing was only captured
yeah with Google glass they had all the
bags and then some it's like we're going
to you can see maps on and you can watch
you can get text messages on you know
all these things whereas respectable is
like just capturing so that's the thing
like you didn't have to like look
outward at any direction like you looked
at indirection you want to record glass
like you have to look at like what
you're trying to see on the little
screen so that's kind of like the
awkward point of it but a lot of changes
yes so I think people are more accepting
of smart glass now and I think and make
them look cool like this like snapchat
that was spectacles yeah also subjective
but yeah I think I think they'd have a
hit if it like actually looked decent a
couple of quick wishlist notes for the
upcoming i/o from Michael Brown in the
chat revamp Android TV and new Android
wear features I'm interested it's
interesting how much I'm seeing about
the Android wearables in the chat right
now and not a whole lot of specifics but
a lot of chatter about where they could
go with that and that would be an
interesting angle for them to take
Michael also says Google should expand
on its plan on messaging more messaging
yeah let's have 200 apps to chat with
people so we got in here in this office
we have hangouts and then we're using
slack and then we're also
getting text messages Walkman well no
there's like Google's like just Google
there's like our duo hang out it sounds
like there's a Winter Soldier hello
duo hang out god yeah that's my point
that they have so many of these asian
cars but with with wearables i do think
that it's really cool that they're
trying to bring like more elements of
google assistants who like their
smartwatches
if that seems like the perfect place to
add it it is perfectly to have it for
sure yeah all right we got to cut it off
because they're going to start kicking
things off over in San Francisco thanks
everybody for hanging out with us early
today speculating about the upcoming i/o
stick around here they'll be starting up
the new stream in just a few minutes and
then it'll be kicking it right over to
the Google coverage streaming it right
from CNET YouTube livestream so on so
forth and thank you all so much want to
send us out Alfred I definitely do
anyway thanks for checking us out again
if you like us the 369 podcast is
available on iTunes
TuneIn stitcher SoundCloud Feedburner
Google Play Music and of course cnet.com
