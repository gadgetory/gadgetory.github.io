Oprah is in let's get to the core of
Apple news and rumors starting right now
$1000 is more than most people are
willing to spend on an iPhone according
to a report in The Wall Street Journal
the company has increased orders for its
cheaper iPhone ahead of the next launch
event now the original plan had them
ordering the same number of units across
the board of the expected
second-generation iPhone 10 iPhone 10
plus and the cheaper iPhone 10 meaning
Apple is expecting budget-conscious
consumers to choose price over high-end
features like a dual camera and better
screens now one of the main reasons for
the massive price increase on the 10 at
least according to this report are the
oldest screens which Apple has to
outsource to Samsung and LG the cheaper
iPhone 10 or iPhone 9 or whatever it is
we're calling it these days would look
like an in-between version of the 10 and
the 10 plus as shown in these mock-ups
by Japanese blog site macro takara it
would have a 6 inch LCD screen aluminum
frame and single camera priced at around
six hundred and ninety nine dollars so
let's not pretend for a second that this
is a cheap iPhone but rather the
entry-level price for every iPhone
before the 10 but here's the kicker it
may not be available until November just
blame it on the knotch
according to a 95 Mac report they're
having a hard time cutting into the LCD
panel causing production delays for this
model only but the article actually
cites a sketchy Korean report so take it
with a grain of salt but enough with the
rumours here's something I can say for a
fact Apple is serious about creating
original content how serious
Oprah serious that's right Apple has
signed on the talk show mogul to create
original content as producer talk-show
host actress queen
it's Oprah the bigger question here
though is what Apple is planning to do
with this content Steven Spielberg JJ
Abrams Reese Witherspoon Jennifer
Aniston and a slew of other big names
are also on board but we're not exactly
sure for what and they might not either
but according to recode it could be one
of three options one a
subscription-based service like Netflix
but cheaper an Amazon Prime like bulk
subscription which would include
services like Apple music and Apple care
and lastly it's gonna give you the
content for free yes you heard me right
Apple is actually giving something away
now in this scenario it would be to feed
the TV app on iOS and TV OS so it would
likely come with advertisement but still
or it could be all of the above we may
have to wait and see because Apple is
not expected to launch anything until
spring of 2019 at the absolute earliest
at least according to this report it
seems like we're not done unpacking iOS
12 features and unlike me emojis this
next one could literally be a lifesaver
this week Apple announced a new feature
in iOS 12 that would automatically share
your location with emergency dispatchers
when you call 911 now this would allow
dispatchers to more accurately pinpoint
your location and send help faster Apple
said the location information will only
be shared when you make the call and
only the responding 911 center will have
access to this data and you can always
opt out in the settings but why would
you now it's not clear whether this
feature will roll out in the official
iOS 12 launch or if it will come as a
later update but Apple did say it will
be getting to users by the end of this
year 25 years ago this week marks the
official departure of John Sculley as
CEO of Apple after a series of bad years
for the company the former Pepsi exec
was behind some of the most memorable
marketing campaigns and product launches
in Apple's history but he was also one
of the main
reasons behind Steve Jobs resignation in
1985 now as we all know Jobs eventually
came back after Scully left and turned
it all around but legend has it he never
forgave Scully and that's it for your
Apple update but come back next week for
more news and rumors on the apple core
also let me know how you want to see
Apple roll out its original content hit
