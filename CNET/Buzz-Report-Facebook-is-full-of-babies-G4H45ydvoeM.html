buzz report and now for the gaps of the
week the gadget of the week is the HTC
athena otherwise known as the HTC
advantage x 750 one now the athena is a
like a device it is not quite a complete
computer but it kind of has this laptop
like design with a qwerty keyboard right
here it's maybe like a little bit more
of a smartphone although obviously it's
very huge it's got a 3 megapixel camera
so you know it's better than a camera
phone but it's not as good as like the
nokia n95 5 megapixels has Wi-Fi and gps
and 3g support so one up on the iphone
and it comes with this leather case that
sort of makes it look like a purse or
like a paperback book with one of those
dorky covers so you know it's just like
the thing I don't know I think I kind of
love it it's kind of like a three-legged
dog and now for the news Facebook is
everywhere this week first security firm
sophos did a study and tricked facebook
users into giving up sensitive personal
information sophos created a fake
profile named Freddie Starr and invited
200 people to be Freddie's front
apparently 82 people accepted and most
of them gave up some personal
information in fact 23 of them gave
Freddie their phone number or home
address and then you have Freddie did
Freddie when blabs the whole world about
it talking about how he could totally
steal his friends identities now that
they gave him so much info Freddie sucks
man you just can't trust people on
facebook oh speaking of facebook now
that the site is open to everyone it's
really taking off in popularity but some
of its original inhabitants aren't too
happy about that in fact one of our
interns here at news com wrote an
article this week speculating that old
married people like me I guess are on
Facebook because they're either trying
to regain their lost youth or they're
just plain creepy
but you know there is a lot of pressure
to be young in the social networking
space I mean one of the most popular
people on Facebook right now is
apparently this unborn baby who's the
Geezer now Missy CBS has invested in an
online Talent Search show called big
shot the show will air only on the
internet but with CBS now owning a fifty
percent stake it's expected to get why
distribution on sites like AOL the hope
is that the show will provide yet
another way for young marketable
internet stars to get famous in the real
world well I think we can already
predict a winner and finally yahoo is
more popular than Google this according
to the annual American Customer
Satisfaction Index for the first time
consumers said yahoo is their favorite
portal just beating out google that's
gotta hurt in other news google has
announced that it will pay anybody ten
dollars to scope out local businesses
and get them on google maps oh this just
in Google is now more popular than yahoo
I'm Hollywood and the suspend of us
report thanks for watching
it's okay little buddy I'll take you
