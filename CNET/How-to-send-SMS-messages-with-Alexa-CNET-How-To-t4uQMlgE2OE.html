other echo users and placing voice calls
with your Amazon echo you can now use
Alexa to send text messages to your
friends and family however there's a
catch it only works with Android phones
running version 5.0 and newer and Amazon
explained that there is no plan to
expand to iOS anytime soon still here's
how you set it up start by opening the
Alexa app on your Android phone then
open the conversations tab if the app is
up to date a pop-up should appear
explaining the new SMS feature to have
to go to my profile if you don't see
this pop up or you accidentally close it
don't worry it's very easy to get back
to your profile and find this setting
tap the contacts icon in the upper right
corner and select my profile under
permissions
tap the toggle next to send SMS to
enable it tap ok then tap allowed to
give Alexa access to send and view SMS
messages like voice calling with Alexa
this feature will let you text most
us-based numbers excluding 9-1-1 you
also won't be able to group message or
send MMS
an SMS with Alexa differs from the
previously launched messaging feature
and that this isn't echo to echo
messaging and it's not sending voice
messages instead these are text to
speech text messages with recipients
will receive on their phone from your
phone number this also means you will
not receive messages and they will not
be read back to you on the Alexa speaker
to send a text message with Alexa simply
say your wait word and then you can
either say send an SMS or send a text
message and you can also tag your
recipients name on the end of that
command by saying something like send an
SMS to Cori or send a text message to
share it for more Alexa tips and tricks
and other how to's be sure to check out
