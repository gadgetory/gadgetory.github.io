November 13 2014 welcome to the 404 show
my name is jeff bakalar i'm joined by
iyaz Akhtar Esquire and then our own
Nunez as I area over there on the board
audi looking stylish why they get your
eyes fixed um I'm getting new contact
lenses soon you change your pert your
prescription no it's the same but it was
you know every year you gotta get a new
one I hate it yeah I wish they could
just give me new contacts but what about
why don't you use the permanent ones um
I get really lazy with like taking them
off and I end up sleeping with them and
since I only have one I that's like
really bad right some just like give me
the disposal once I could just toss them
out exactly you gotta hold on to that
good I exactly he needs innocent laser
to the other one just to get it done she
doesn't bother with this nonsense what
laser the good one of the bad one good
wishes will make don't think you lazy
the bad one yeah just like it won't work
though I'm playing with house money yeah
it's uncorrectable I'm impossible to fix
what in this day and age even leaving
what Lacey really yes with modern Bionic
technology up well thanks a lot captain
depressing nothing could be done for you
they said only if someone donates an eye
so if you guys want to volunteer oh
there you go that's that changes
everything mean impossible that's the
only possible unlikely but very possible
that why i don't think i want someone
else's eye though what see ya yeah I'm
with you man yeah I would think if I
have like someone else's liver mm-hmm I
would somehow consume a piece of their
soul yeah and then be possessed by them
yeah but the rest of my days you think
it'd be like a total possession you
think it'd be like a partial possession
everything to be sick of partial I think
lately mostly involuntary movements you
know things that'd be fine that's what I
worry about that's like the real things
I worry and what I mean that seems like
a completely fun part of the day like
why'd you do that oh it's my liver yeah
I knew I know you can just blame
everything you do on that too like oh
that's my demon liver
my bed every night of its own uh yeah I
it's amazing like I stuff is amazing I I
have a stigmatism I don't know if you
can correct that with laser can you I
don't know either to my left eye sucks
arm but it's not the worst thing I got
glasses and whatnot but I'm always I
always wonder like what must have
happened before eyeglasses like imagine
300 year when were eyeglasses invented I
don't know I don't know friggin okay
five all the things i know i'm wearing
them i didn't research I also don't know
what belts were invented I'm wearing a
belt no oh my god people's pants falling
down is nowhere near as important as
seeing clearly ok ok so imagine you're
like a caveman or something right done
you're done there's you you have no
chance whatsoever like think about the
blindness person you know i got like
Steve Guttenberg right he says it really
thick glasses right how screwed yeah
what needs right like you got you you're
just like doing that Frankenstein Ian
sort of like feely touchy thing to see
where you're at i just say be hyper
jumpy man just do that like a tiger
space and you're done I just think if we
saw any blob whatever it may be if it's
movie he's just jumpy and it's not until
the other caveman's like Steve it's me
Steve it's me and then he's okay right
that's how was the blind would survive
on earth or sky you try the tiger
petting probably was guilt it's amazing
to me that like shitty vision hasn't
evolved out of us because it's not our I
guess is not a hereditary thing it's not
passed down through DNA I guess it is
well then what the hell well that means
people survived oh which is we gotta
stop yes I'm killing off exactly people
who have problem with their eyes should
not have children it's creatures I mean
it's super fixable so in the modern age
is not a problem but think about it man
you had if you made it to 12 you were
defying the odds well yeah those that
that too or you just accepted the world
you're like I guess the world blurry
here you go eyeglasses were invented
between 1268 and 1289 in Italy okay so
we're talking like a
hundred years it's a long freakin time
that's a long time man all right
interesting a little fun fact little TI
l today got some tributed a um this is
funny story from ARS technica one of the
FBI's most wanted cyber criminal is a
bad dude okay super bad guy turns out uh
one of the passwords that this that this
criminal cyber mastermind was using was
the name of his cat was his cat-like
name like something with awesome
characters 28k is like mr. Mixel put
sick note with like asterisks in like
parentheses nope it was chewy chewy 123
reminds me of that scene in Spaceballs
one two three four five really sounds
like you the most sought-after cyber
criminal your password is chewy one two
three yeah that's no example to set for
the other cyber criminals of the world
is this guy's super confident you think
he was like nobody will ever catch me so
doesn't matter what my password is or is
this this guy's an idiot of a different
kind of style I don't know man it's I
think it's like the Super Man Thing were
like that dude like like uh Alan
Cummings character in Goldeneye I'm
invincible like you just have this
complete misconception well let the
Riddler like you'll never figure this
out Batman Batman always figures you out
many ways every freakin time you have
yet to be successful and you still try
this yeah a chewy 123 never been a
riddle where he's like still noodling it
he's like Batman's been busy for three
weeks what you been doing oh the Riddler
actually got him this time he just
thought it was just couldn't quite
distinct white rappers rap his bat wings
around instead of like trying to you
know seek the Riddler down you just SAT
and thought about it yeah in that like
atlas pose right or so yeah thinking
thinking about all right yeah thinking
man that was the glue the balance that
she's holding the riddles like this is
like all the riddles heavy its way it's
me ok that was pond tacular
so yeah cybercriminals I mean come on
have the decency to change your password
to something alphanumeric that's like
not a word not your cat not your direct
of course it's his cat scanning have a
dog cat a cat you think that kappa
believe i don't think there's one hacker
that's got a dog they're busy there too
but probably what it is if you're
worrying a backing it always be
suspicious of cat owners cuz they have a
cat because cats are low-maintenance
they're up to something else this is
yours a few of goldfish just like look
the hell out yeah yeah you know they're
super low-maintenance pets those people
are selfish get to know so people have
horses trustworthy oh my god they have
to be kidding got allows of dollars
baloney absolutely I know I'm right we
proved it I think I think yeah this is
this is this is now true forever this
must be done and if you have a horse
trustworthy if you have a cat you're up
to something suspicious as hell we've
got a calico um all right what's next my
computer froze uh we got your online
stores are changing pricing depending on
how you shop all right thing about this
what's going yeah so this was a story
that uh kind of came out a while ago
remember when um there was there was a
little bit of evidence that i think it
was orbits or one of those travel sites
was changing the price of a flight uh by
sniffing out what you were using to
browse the site so if you had a Mac odds
are you might be a little more well off
so they would bump up the price a little
bit for you because you were browsing on
a Mac but for the guy with the pc oh
he's the common man he's a groundling
let's let's make it more affordable for
this guy and uh this story here in Wired
that came out this morning is all about
online stores changing their prices
depending on how you shop not
necessarily how you how you appear like
what your identity looks like to the
website but more so um your habits and a
lot of it is using cookies and
demographics like your zip code and
stuff like that all sort of playing
along into this confusing Al Gore
them of price fluctuation where these
prices are personalized to a particular
shopper and the article goes into all
the research that's been done and uh
people who tend to to uh view stores
through a mobile device have this have a
different experience someone who's on a
desktop device they're bringing in the
psychology of it all and having that uh
impact the final price is your offered
this is really depressing and irritated
it's the way it is man well it's a brave
new world out there if it clearly is an
evolution of of online shopping I mean
you can't get mad at it because it must
work oh no I think you've made man i'm
gonna give engines i cannot stand
booking flights i can't stand in hotels
because the search you run like on you
know monday eight it's not the same at
monday at ten so everything shift is the
same same freaking search terms
everything changes prices go through the
roof and then there was i was looking at
at the article though says there's no
one-size-fits-all solution so you're
basically screwed no matter what you do
because all the services are different
yeah so what this is is some fun doom
and gloom but thursday it's i mean
there's no other way to spin it brother
this is how it is so basically buy some
cheap stuff I mean look again never add
something to your amazon cart and then
you go back a day later and it's like
this is decreased in price by a dollar
so at least they tell you that right
it's strange you don't know what forces
are at work that changed it it just
happened or maybe it's like this free
marketing we're like the price it like a
stock market where like the prices
fluctuating you're like oh well milkha
seven cents cheaper than it was
yesterday do you want it like an
explanation on it amazon like do you
want to know what i would like some
backstory that be interesting i'd like
that little leg that says okay the
reason why we had a good on down yet
passing the savings along to the
consumer like Bessie had a good quarter
the guys who did all this research go
into more detail here's someone that
kind of stood out to me is like more you
know mystery sort of strange things
happening so there are times when the
people doing this were able to see other
forms of price discrimination on some
websites but were unable to get the to
the root cause of that price variation
okay so like for example on sears
when they would do like rental car
websites they would try out different
browsers and different platforms it
would log in log out they couldn't tell
why the price was changing it just was
they couldn't discern a pattern which is
weird that there's at Leeds any educated
person to guess well maybe they're just
like randomly spitting out prices those
like that PT game like that if ya I
figure we figured out how this works
like ad there's no nothing special screw
you either way they speculate a little
bit but I think some of it too is like
hey you know and they go into it uh with
the talk of cookies they say the cookies
aren't necessarily a bad thing because
if you arm you know if you go to a site
like cheap tickets or orbitz users who
are logged in will Awful's often see a
members-only price that would on average
saving around twelve dollars on
something like a hotel but if you clear
your cookies and then you search you
wouldn't be logged in necessarily and
you would miss out on that discount
there's other things too like cookies
can kind of tell you like this guy's on
Twitter all the time or this guy's
whatever and that might be a deciding
factor as to how the algorithm treats
your IP and says all right well I as
won't shut up on Google+ about his deals
that he gets yeah by me let's save them
a couple bucks and maybe hill hill hill
you know shout us out that'll definitely
have a Google+ my google plus guns yeah
because that's where all the social kids
are right now everyone's rockins google
plus RL do you feel screwed by this yes
it's just not depressing animated
nothing we could do about it other than
like buy some chief computers and and
really crappy phones to book our stuff
on and hope that they'll take pity on us
you're gonna like fake poor it you're
gonna be like go get like a LG something
or other not a g3 but like you know like
an old G to know G if you're an old G
you're gonna get the good prices
obviously yeah that's the way I'm gonna
make sure that I'm gonna miss set my
browser using a user agent spoofer be
like okay that's ie5 I'm obviously
clueless I'm running IE five so either
than you think they're gonna charge me
more or less no more because you're so
close that you wouldn't know if you're
getting got me my pcs really old my
p might be old enough I've saved money I
guess now cuz then I if I see that I'm
like this guy I could do anything that's
rich in it like I'm with him make sure
that i infect your computer um our
bodies a geek calm put up a story about
a ridiculous PlayStation TV peripheral
what the hell is this thing all right so
from the picture you can see that it
looks like a playstation portable as a
big screen looks like a Vita is what it
looks well there's actually a
PlayStation TV locked in the back so it
makes the PSP so the PS TV that's
regional TV it makes the TV portable
into basically a giant version of the
Vita bright because the TV version is
the home version of the portable it's
like reverse engineering yeah what
essentially the PlayStation TV was meant
for this little box it's like a roku
plugs into your TV and it acts like it's
a vida so you can do Vita stuff on your
big screen TV at home but what this does
is take that thing and turns it right
back into a vida which is clearly the
dumbest thing you could possibly do cept
what's a larger screen in the Vita right
this is a 1024 x 600 so don't care you
get seven inches of screen great you get
five inches on the Vita itself now you
get to get to the price its 22 bucks
it's 200 without the PlayStation TV so
it costs the same as the Vita off the
bat in a slightly cheaper than that dude
is it yeah feat is probably like 150 now
what was that she that it is really
makes no sense it's just it's turning a
non-portable system into a portable
system where does this come I kind of
like this no this is so stupid i like it
it's but i mean the thing is i think i
like the idea of a console becoming
portable but this is a portable that
became a console that became portable
that's the way it gets stupid i have a
weird sort of fascination when they do
when they turn like a ps4 into a laptop
like you've seen or the xbox one but
this is this is just like I it doesn't
make sense why it would happen like this
I was wrong about the price of the Vita
though man on Amazon it looks like it's
still 250 if it is eating 250
still well maybe that's a special kind
of Vita I don't know me or they just
they just know you're into games so that
hey moose up the price if I search it'll
be like 50 bucks so we create your voice
an add-on item for you this is really
terrifying yeah I don't get it but um
it's a thing called eka vita 7 by the
way if you want to buy one of these is
called deck evita seven cool you can get
yourself a portable version of a
non-portable thing all right way no I
found a different one oh I'm sorry so
you can get a refurbished betta for 170
that's not great or you get the limited
edition Borderlands 2 version 4 200
that's that's yeah there you go it's
cheaper alright finally would we got
wolf man wolf man we got wolf man coming
apparently according to I think was
deadline Digital Trends has a report
about this Universal Studios plotting
their next move universities has a lot
of monsters Frankenstein they got
Dracula and wolfman looks like 2017 this
is the time we're gonna get a new
wolfman movie so ok I never saw no I'm
not familiar with Wolfman it's like an
old-school horror classic right you've
never seen wolfman or like any of like
the belly is like Nosferatu that's like
a bat vampires bat vampire guy that's in
the same vein as like the campy yeah
black and white how do you like stop in
the water cuz you're so much more on
cultured than I am I understand that the
like as long as we got that everything
is like that the holes you have in your
head when I do certain things are just
so gaping know how do you not know the
universal monsters i do i know them well
Dracula's not Nosferatu first of all you
know the same sort of thing it's not the
same thing so you got wolf man who's
never had a cool movie well that's the
thing so you don't even know that
Wolfman hasn't had a cool movie they try
to reboot it with life is this guy
there's nothing cool about him he looks
like he looks like will ferrell okay so
that being said obviously it looks like
a startled will ferrell this is probably
not the look you're gonna see they
rebooted this in 2010 with benicio del
toro it totally take a real i kid you
not man they actually bother to try this
Universal every couple years tries these
are not good brands Dracula Dracula fine
it's like a timeless sort of thing
breaking someone yeah that you think
will send all of a sudden gonna have a
new one that's like amazing and alas no
a lot to the theist in Nero's version
right the Mary Shelley's Frankenstein so
that they keep trying over and over okay
it's not working well no a 13 year old
doesn't give a about Wolfman I
asked a 13 year old will he'll tell me
to go F myself Wolfman really i'm seeing
avengers ever ever these up thor and all
that it is it just it's just the look of
the wolf minutes driving you nuts no
I've actually think there's something
charming about this guy it wasn't being
with well right he seems like a nice and
he's just like Oh what I didn't know you
were here is what i buy him a drink yes
I getting out with Wolfman San up
Wolfman I have a friend whose last name
is wolf I just call him Wolfman but it
has nothing to do is he deserve a movie
that's my question 2017 a guy did the
Wolfman okay it's the basic monster
movie guy turns into a werewolf with
this moon we're beyond basic like look
man I'm not even i'm not even i'm not
even picking sides you know we had
godzilla just happened like this year
right okay like godzilla brand is so
much more relevant how was it how was a
giant freaking monster relevant compared
to a wolf I need you to notice everyone
listening to this right now foot must
agree with me there's no way if you were
likewise has a point wolf made up don't
know a handful then I never said Wolfman
is any good I tried to get the Wolfman
but guy who is this thing that never
went away it always was relevant you
can't just resurrect Wolfman and be like
I might work again it didn't four years
ago and God said most people didn't
really like this Godzilla if he wasn't
in it Roderick one that one was
hilarious one people are kinda on the
fence about it people but they'll be
another one in 2020 did not have a
violent reaction to it this is just like
ripping branding hoping it works but
what man is my pride man i have tried to
watch wolfman they're better all their
open making like a Betty Boop movie
which they are doing that Universal
vision is better if they're better off
doing it you think
will do better than a Wolfman I will bet
you real American money one dollar
America no we're not doing we're doing
like a hundred dollar no I don't think
so come on lawyer lawyer up well then I
wouldn't do anything good i should when
they shut up in with your look at a
lawyer up i'm gonna shut up it doesn't
matter what right be quiet all i'm
saying is let's sign the contract write
it up hundred-dollar i don't know if
that's legal in this state pal don't
matter that's what I care but can't have
a contract that's only legal subjects
you know that right that's like saying
hey can you kill this guy you like yeah
let's sign a deal for this and then you
don't do it do you think I can sue you
Aria you know what he's doing right now
is acting like a lawyer now and you're
and you're getting you're just you're
trying to distract I'm take us away from
the point at hand that Wolfman will do
better than Betty boob now it will it's
gonna happen this is assuming this even
happened to you I bet you asked a
hundred people outside which have you
heard of Wolfman or betty boop betty
boop will slaughter Wolfman okay i'm
gonna get so many confused people cuz
they're gonna be like a good number of
people have no idea what I'm talking
about with either one right put moat but
the people that do know they will know
Betty Boop more often than they know
then the Wolfman yeah the wolfman the
wolf like I barely know what that is now
how is that possibly know what it is cuz
you see like archive footage what about
teen wolfy ever watch teen wolf to you
but that's not Wolfman it's a Wolfman
version right that is that that's not in
the cannibal course not of course yeah
we know wolf teen wolf that's okay with
you Michael J Fox so is that what all it
takes with us to be okay your Teen Wolf
Man we're cool boy a teen wolf is fine a
wolf man is dumb so as long as this
person's is adolescence you're happy
wait what was it was american werewolf
in paris is that fall into this i don't
think it does i think we're just talking
about Wolfman yes Bryant I mean he's a
werewolf ray is a world I feel like
werewolves had their little run all
right well that'll different cuz then
that's like you know why right exactly
why light and stuff is just called The
Wolfman so like it's easy werewolf this
is throwing you i think i think you're
trying to change think you're trying to
change the rules of our little we don't
even
an arrangement yes we do arielle as my
witness as Arielle in the recording in
the wav files will show you everyone
listen to the shows like they're doing
their own bet based on our bed that's
right we're gonna hagas has some action
on I can't wait to the Vegas odds of
Wolfman first getting a movie Greenland
don't forget now so I it's already
definitive this is it could be right
because universe has got a movie coming
and it's probably the Wolfman I think we
were talking with the the brainstorming
sessions for eaten alive yesterday I
think it's the same kind of stupidity
when it comes to making a Wolfman movie
like yeah that's a good idea to do that
again sure okay so we're on the same
page then oh no I really think it's
gonna not do we're very well but Betty
Boop i think is gonna be worse i think
baby who's gonna do okay depends on who
they get to play her right if it's like
ska Joe it's over open okay true it's
all about the casting yeah over that's
true I thought that Benecia del Toro
could have worked with the wolf man is
didn't work yeah i'm not i'm not going
out on a limb here I'm I think I'm being
pretty conservative I'm pretty sure
Betty Boop's can be like a CG character
nomadic ish as long as skotos coming out
of her mouth like that voice it's gonna
be fine okay so slow Joe's like the wolf
woman Bennett's got a deal okay there we
go that is it that's all it took is as
long as it's scarlett johansson playing
the wolf man or wolf person yeah that
would probably save the damn franchise i
think i think we would resurrect there
you go now you got an answer we don't
want a teen what we teen wolf is fine
wolf man is bad right wolf woman would
be different yeah cuz we don't have a
lot of those you are correct there we go
I bet you like Twilight don't you I've
never seen what about an altered beast
the movie arise from your way
yeah they need to put me on the
marketing so when they turned him into a
wolf think this is a part of the movie
where you're tuned out we turned back
into a dragon i guess i'm paying
attention again third beast you son of a
gun dropping that on look at that I know
he's like I know what I'm doing alright
