roundtable i'm rafe needleman in San
Francisco this week really interesting
show how do you throw away four billion
dollars here's one way by a lot of
spectrum you can't use that seems to be
what LightSquared has done the company
bought access to satellites and a chunk
of spectrum and plan to create a whole
new wholesale wireless network but the
FCC said this week no way your planned
use of spectrum interferes with GPS the
FCC withdrew the waiver it had
previously given the company to allow it
to operate and now LightSquared is
sitting on what appears to be a toxic
asset not only can it not use the
spectrum but the FCC ruling means that
no one else can use it either or can
they what's happening here and how will
it affect you the user of a wireless
device that is never fast enough that's
what we're discussing today with two
great guests both cnet people first in
New York Roger Chang who is our
executive editor on in the New York
bureau covering all things wireless and
New York Roger thanks for joining us
that's traveling me and Maggie Reardon
also in New York a senior writer also on
the mobile and wireless beat Maggie
thanks a lot for joining us from your
kitchen studio ok it's good to have you
guys with us this has been such an
interesting story as it's been
developing a lot of people of course
don't know about what's been happening
with light squared because it's been
there haven't been any consumer products
yet so to bring us up to speed Maggie
what is or was LightSquared kind of the
executive summary version well
LightSquared was going to build a
nationwide 4G LTE network and they
weren't going to sell service directly
to consumers but they were going to sell
service to other service providers like
Sprint or even some retailers like Best
Buy leap wireless was going to be
another one of their partners and
through this network then these carriers
would be able to offer 4G services and
so it would offer a true competitor to
AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon in terms of next
generation 4G
wireless so that any provider could have
worked with with light squared and and
had would have been able to compete with
with AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon hopes a wholesale
a wholesale competitor to the existing
carriers and it was a satellite base
yeah um well yeah that not necessary and
enforce at alight services but the
waiver that they were getting from the
FCC was so that they could use
terrestrial or land-based only
communications and years ago the FCC had
okayed that you know but but the wuff a
the rules were written whoever used that
spectrum also had to provide some kind
of satellite service to but that's
expensive if you have to include
satellite radios in your devices that's
going to be really expensive so it's not
cost-effective for any of lightsquared's
partners to have to do that so that they
wanted to have it just be a land-based
service and the GPS folks didn't like
that is that okay that's what we're
going to get into before we get into
what happened here I want a little bit
more background what's the big deal
about this I mean we've got a pretty
good coverage or at least building out
coverage is being built out on the major
networks AT&amp;amp;T verizon's networks do we
do we need this Roger our consumers can
consumer wireless grow as as it is
growing without light squared or do we
need something like that to give us
additional bandwidth it's debatable
whether or not it's needed but it's
definitely wanted and the FCC has been
pushing for this I mean the industry has
been complaining about not having enough
spectrum to go around and here you are
you've got a bunch of spectrum that with
a company that was willing to invest and
build a network and it just failed
completely so yeah no I think there
definitely is a need verizon AT&amp;amp;T yes
they're building their LTE network now
but it's I think it's important to have
another competitor I mean the more
competition that's out there the better
it is for consumers right well that's
the argument yeah AT&amp;amp;T is trying to
fight with buying it t-mobile but anyway
yeah sorry Maggie go ahead yeah I was
going to say I mean right now um we've
got two major carriers that that hold
most of the wireless spectrum out there
and what we're seeing you know of course
18t was not allowed to merge with
tmobile but now there's talk that
they're going to acquire more spectrum
from someone like dish so I think what
we're going to see over time is that
this duopoly is going to get stronger
and LightSquared was really the only the
only company that could have offered
some sort of competition and
LightSquared itself I guess wouldn't
have been so much a competitor as the
other providers that it would have
allowed to be able to compete with AT&amp;amp;T
and Verizon because if those guys
control most of the spectrum that can be
used for for this wireless broadband
then you know there's nobody else that
has enough money to invest in building
their own network or even acquiring that
spectrum so let's line up the winners
and losers in this thing so first of all
who was funding LightSquared this whole
venture harbinger capital which is a
hedge fund that's run by Phil Falcone
okay so there was a new player in in
them in the comma space he has is a
harbinger in other space companies in
this area no this was actually they'd
actually reduce their holdings basically
just light squared so Falcone was
betting basically everything on this
service okay so we've got a new player
coming in here trying to release a build
out a new network that say if you have
you're making an e-book or tablet or
something or some wireless device or say
the nest or some thermostat something
and you want it to get you want to get
it on a wireless network now you can go
to this new company and buy wholesale
access from them right right that's
that's the big dilemma right there
because right now if you're if you're
building that connected thermometer dog
collar whatever you have to go to AT&amp;amp;T
and Verizon and there's a fairly lengthy
process to approve
and make sure it's clear for the network
so it's a costly effort and kind of
makes it difficult for those garage
startup companies to actually get
involved with this okay y squared would
offered a much easier option right so
I'm just trying to line up here how the
the battle lines were drawn because it
looks like to me that on the one hand
you have a new company trying to break
into a business that is pretty much
controlled by two major players so you
could see where AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon could
lose out with you know a lower-cost
easier to access competitor but then you
have this wild card come in the GPS guys
saying no the light squared terrestrial
use of GPS of frequencies adjacent to
GPS will make GPS unreliable what was
the role of the government which runs
the GPS satellites in well the
government agency with artist GPS
satellites in dealing with the
government agency that runs the airwaves
the FCC in basically putting the kibosh
on the whole LightSquared proposition
well that was really it was the the GPS
industry you know encompasses lots of
players right so it's some of the users
of GPS are also government folks and the
FCC actually doesn't have control over
them or their spectrum or what they do
but anyway basically the GPS guys they
don't like anybody coming in their
neighborhood and using any services in
fact when ultra-wideband was was coming
on and the government actually wanted to
use ultra wideband GPS complained about
that too in the industry so but because
the government wanted to use ultra
wideband they just said you know no
planes are not going to fall out of the
sky and we're going to do this anyway
and the problem really is is it's not
that LightSquared's its signals are
going outside of its its defined
spectrum bands i mean it's it's doing
everything that it's supposed to be
doing the problem is is that the GPS
folks have receivers on their devices
that can listen in to these other things
so it's for example
well it's like if your neighbor is
having an argument in their house
they're allowed to have an argument in
their house you know and but if you're
if you're have a hearing aid it's like
turned up so high that you can hear
everything that's going on in their
house and you're going to complain about
it because they're too noisy well that's
not really fair because you're allowed
to do whatever you want your house as
long as it doesn't sort of bleed over
into your neighbors but if you're going
to have you know a receiver that that is
tuned so so high that you can hear what
else is going on in your in your
neighbors area it's just not really fair
so that's kind of what's been happening
okay with GPS now there are two angles
are I want to get into and the first one
is how light squared bet billions of
dollars on being able to do what it
ultimately found out it could not do did
it not know that it would have this
problem with I'm not going to say GPS
interference but with it with the well I
will say GPS interference because it did
they not know that they were going to
get slapped down because of the VBA ssin
to the GPS band and possible
interference Minh how could you not know
when you put millions of dollars into a
company's this process has been going on
for for more than 10 years and all along
the way a you know the FCC has granted
them the licenses they it's granted them
you know the okay to use terrestrial
based so they've gone every step along
the way and GPS has you know filed some
things saying that they were not sure
about this but they didn't put up a big
fight until last year when it became
really clear that you know with this FCC
waiver that LightSquared was actually
going to build this network was I think
they were going to do just mess around
it's it's gone unused for a really long
time so I think GPS was just hoping that
no one would use you know it's kind of
like again you've got a house and you
have two lots on either side of you and
you just sort of hope that that nobody
buys that land and builds a house on it
and then when you find out that you know
they've actually gone in
while the plans to build the house then
maybe you start complaining Roger well I
mean the plan was for a light squared to
work with the GPS initiator developed
filters and basically remedy the
interference issue the problem was the
GPS industry was supposed to have these
filters in place only they never really
put them in why not they just in and
let's be let's be clear when you say
when we say the GPS interested on we say
the wireless industry we're talking
about verizon AT&amp;amp;T I can kind of picture
I had what that industry is when we talk
about GPS is a little bit different the
G the GPS industry when the satellites
are run by the government and developed
for the military and the commercial
applications I mean we've all got GPS
receivers in our smartphones and now
more and more in our cars but the
commercial application seemed to have
come much after the government to the
military application so what is the GPS
industry and who's behind this Brett
this attack on the use of these these
bands I should be more specific I mean
they ninety percent or a vast majority
the GPS devices that are out there
including the ones on your phone work
fine with the spectrum actually they
have the necessary filters but there are
there's a small subsection of these GPS
devices a lot of them which are on
government devices actually that don't
have these filters and really generally
pay attention to this mandate that FCC
had probably because the FCC doesn't
have any jurisdiction over the
government I want to stop there and just
point out the the weirdness of this that
the FCC a government agency charged with
managing our airwaves can tell private
industry how to use the airways but this
government agency can't tell another
government agency the military or the
DoD or whatever right what to do with
the airwaves that the government agency
a is responsible for which I just think
is bizarre I'm just saying go ahead
please yeah no it is I mean that and
that's one of the biggest reasons why
this thing failed I mean a lot of them
are it's a lot of government devices and
government you know if it doesn't work
from government devices then it's not
going to work for anyone it is bizarre
and it's not done like that speaking of
government devices oh yeah we lost
Maggie there for a second
curse you airwaves a bitch is on Wi-Fi
are you on Wi-Fi I am I wife
LightSquared is beaming all of its
unused bandwidth right into your
apartment we could some of that light
squared bandwidth I know we really could
this eat this is why we're doing the
show guys wheat LightSquared fix it make
it worth be nicer to the FCC buying gift
baskets you messed up Maggie go ahead
please yeah well I mean sadly the FCC
you know they wanted this to happen this
is all part of this is 40 megahertz of
spectrum which is not insignificant I
mean that the FCC has a plan in the next
10 years that they want to free up 500
megahertz of spectrum to be reaction
door reallocated and used for wireless
broadband and now you know and they had
a target of freeing up about 300
megahertz by 2015 and they're already
two years into the plan and they haven't
freed up anything so this was a
significant chunk of spectrum that they
wanted to see going to use and it could
have gone into use immediately so it's
it's really unfortunate that it's not
it's it sounds to me like the the FCC is
getting there ended up looking like the
inept company or the inept operation
here because they couldn't free up
spectrum that would have been good for
industry that it almost looks like and
other people have written this is hardly
an original observation that the GPS
testing set up the whole thing that
ended up putting the kibosh on the whole
LightSquared thing was influenced by the
18-team verizon lobby like that's got to
be very popular conspiracy theory I
don't think did it honestly though I
don't think it was verizon and AT&amp;amp;T this
was the GPS industry who have a lot of a
lot of pool in you know as Roger
explained in the government and the
thing is is AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon didn't even
have to get on board with this the part
that they were upset about was the
waiver process they feel that if the FCC
is going to make exceptions for
terrestrial only use of spectrum that's
banded for satellite they need to make a
ruling and they need to have a rule so
that everybody is playing by this
rules instead of doing it on a
case-by-case basis and just granting
waivers mmm so that's what I was said
about that was one of the problems with
this Waverly yes you say basically
granted this one-off waiver to
LightSquared are the previous owners of
for the spectrum but they did really
clear it with the GP industry they just
sort of slapped that they did actually
know that that's that's where it's kind
of a little bit false the JPM industry
had 10 years to comment into in fact
it's kind of ridiculous in a way the FCC
could have just said yes they didn't
have to be a conditional waiver they had
already gone through the process of
making sure that this was all going to
work that there were already rules in
place about the filters for the GPS
industry they could have just said you
know go ahead build your network GPS
industry you know you've had ten years
the process is done figure it out they
didn't they sort of you know coward I
guess to to the pressure and I think you
know not until probably the middle of
the year did anybody think that GPS was
going to rally such support and they did
I mean they killed this from a political
standpoint this isn't necessarily a
technical thing and people will argue
with me they'll say oh you know but
planes are gonna fall out of this guy
that's not actually true now i want i
want to get on to one one thing here
about this testing that l that
ultimately helped put the nail in the
coffin here there have been reports
Maggie you wrote a story saying that
LightSquared claims that the GPS tests
which showed interference where either
rigged done in secrecy or somehow
irrelevant technologically wrong can you
comment on that before we move on to the
bigger picture here what's going to
happen going forward yeah you know
LightSquared had a lot of issues with
the testing for one the GPS industry
picked out which devices should be
tested some of them were obsolete or not
even in use anymore and also the way
they determine which you know whether
something had interference or didn't
have interference they said you know the
interference that made this unacceptable
for this testing was interference it
could only be detected in a laboratory
and in real-world cases it wouldn't
affect the operation of the devices so
you know if that's true I think they
they have a point there you know I think
there's certainly a way to design a test
and interpret results that can get you
the results that you want and I think
that's how they feel this testing went
down and it was done it wasn't open
testing wasn't like request for comment
request on the result it was done by
some committee who then released the
results as a kind of a fait accompli
right yeah right and part of the testing
was also done you know with the help of
agencies in the government who have an
interest in in this because they have
GPS devices so again it seemed a little
bit skewed just I'm having a hard time
understanding what the GPS industry such
as it is stands to gain from blocking
adjacent use spectrum is a funny thing
nobody you know it's it it's a scarce
resource and everybody wants to hold on
to their licenses everybody's afraid of
interference who owns a spectrum license
and the GPS industry over the whole
history of their of existence they have
not liked anybody around their spectrum
because they don't want any interference
it's again you know somebody who who
builds a house in the country and they
don't want to have any neighbors and
then they get really annoyed when people
buy up the property right around them
well you know it's not their property
and somebody has a right to sell that
and build on it same here you know GPS
is using 24 more megahertz of spectrum
but they want about 40 or 50 megahertz
on each side of them cleared so that
you're using up a total of 100 megahertz
of spectrum is buffer you know in in the
grand scheme of things that's just not
that's not tenable I mean we need to
free up more spectrum for people to use
and you know right now
about five hundred and seventy two
megahertz of spectrum that's allocated
for broadband mobile broadband use today
and we want to free up another 500
megahertz so 100 megahertz there that
you want to keep you know just to
yourself is a lot so in scheme of things
how much of the investment in light
squared went to acquiring spectrum make
almost all right so the question is can
light squared go back to the government
from whom they bought rights to use the
spectrum and say give us our money back
I think the more like a su that's one
yeah okay all right moving on um this is
what a mess man so we have this national
broadband plan 2010 broadband plan how
was this part of this and can we believe
that the FCC can be effective now in
managing the growth of wireless in the
distribution of spectrum licenses after
what's happened with LightSquared Roger
I mean how do we feel about the FCC's
efficacy moving forward no I mean Maggie
wrote a great piece on this yesterday
and I mean it's no I mean answer's no
it's the politics has sort of got in the
way of freeing up spectrum that's badly
needed in industry and yeah at least
with the light squared example it just
doesn't look good it's a it's a bad
first step for the FCC first step Maggie
I mean what were ya I'm een there's
other there's another chunk of spectrum
that that nobody's really talked about
it's it's this about 90 megahertz of
spectrum that the Department of Defense
controls and you know that didn't end up
in this this latest spectrum bill that
was tacked on to the payroll tax cuts
there's going to be auctions for for
spectrum and so 90 megahertz which was
sort of earmarked for four to be freed
up and is controlled by the Department
of Defense is probably not going to be
used because the FCC doesn't really have
the power to go in and tell DoD you have
to you know move on this quicker you
have to move your your people around and
get on to different spectrum and use
this more efficiently we need this for
commercial use so that I think is is a
big
problem in our spectrum policy is that
the FCC only controls commercial
spectrum each government agency that has
its own spectrum controls what it does
with that spectrum and if they don't
want to give it up and as I've explained
nobody ever wants to give up their
wireless spectrum even if they're not
using it so yeah so it becomes a real
problem for commercial use all right so
what's next for LightSquared's customers
or partners sprint was doing a deal with
them freedompop which is founded by the
skype guys what a companies do who were
kind of hoping to be able to access a
new new swath of broadband what are they
going to do well one of the big winners
here is clearwire this clearwire was
served in the middle of repositioning
its business it now it's starting to go
into become a full wholesale provider of
LTE services right now they use a
different 4G technology called wimax but
they're undergoing sort of an upgrade to
move into LTE to eat sore more in line
with verizon AT&amp;amp;T offers and so I think
Clearwire's a big winner because all
these companies like Best Buy or lead or
Metro whoever wants to get LTE capacity
can now go to clearwire because
clearwire is opening their doors up to
basically anyone else who wants to least
time off their network and we have a
story up about what dish is going to do
now or dish looking to the FCC for cues
based on what happened in part with with
light squared what does it mean for a
company like dish that's that again is
trying to figure out how to navigate the
the spectrum with the light square deal
falling apart how do you change
direction if you having are having to
deal with this issue and bring out new
consumer devices hopefully right well
dishes in this is in a really good
position right now with LightSquared
spectrum sort of team toxic dishes sort
of the next best piece of spectrum and
it's very similar to light squared and
it's got that sort of satellite
characteristics and requires the same
kind of conditional waiver and that's
what they're looking for right now
they're actually looking for a one-off
waiver and sources have told me that
they don't get that waiver that's when
things get interesting they
either sell they sell the AT&amp;amp;T partner
with t-mobile or they could just sit on
that spectrum which one really wants but
it's actually kind of a smart move
because the spectrum goes up in value
basically just sit on it and some
eventually someone's going to come and
you know scoop it up for a higher price
yeah the spectrum goes up in value every
time the FCC said puts a ruling out that
says that a company can't use the
spectrum if they have than all the other
direction by nature goes up in value
until the spectrum you're sitting on the
same thing happens to you that has
happened to light squared so it just it
seems to be like they're a lot of really
big bets going on here and I want to
wrap up by asking what this means for
you and me for consumers who as I said
at the top of the show we're frustrated
we're paying a lot for bandwidth and
bandwidth is diminishing because there
you know the what's the percentage i
read in the last couple years the use of
wireless broadband has grown by
something like twenty thousand percent
or more it's just exploding everybody's
going Wireless everybody wants more
speed more services more streaming and
we're running out of bandwidth so what
is the future what's the FCC going to do
what our company is going to do who's
going to win who's going to lose what
simple question well I think the first
thing we can expect is that the network
is going to get more congested so that
means that you're going to have probably
poor quality service than what you have
today they're going to be stricter data
caps so if the network's get really
crowded then you'll probably see AT&amp;amp;T
you know maybe lowering their data caps
I mean who knows the or maybe we'll see
carriers restricting the time of day
that you can use your your wireless data
like for example maybe you know at peak
times it'll cost you more to to use your
data versus if you're doing it at a time
where there aren't a lot of people using
it so I mean we could see a lot of
things like that i think that the
carriers themselves are going to have to
get more creative about how they use
their networks so they're going to have
to find ways to shrink their their cell
sites because the whole thing here is
we're talking about when the data is in
the air right but but your day
isn't in the air very long before it's
somehow hits a wired network and gets on
some sort of like hardwired fibre
broadband connection in the ground so if
they can shorten that distance between
from your phone to one of their wired
connections then they can save some
bandwidth so they might have more Wi-Fi
hotspots and we're seeing new technology
coming out new standards to make that
easier and make it more of a seamless
process for consumers so I think we're
going to have to see a lot of different
things going on but you know if growth
usage continues on the path that
everybody says that it's it's going on
then you know it's going to be a problem
in the future if we can't get more
resources allocated to to these services
mmm Roger I mean I agree with Maggie
this is bad for consumers you're gonna
see higher prices you see poor service
and that's just going to be the reality
that'll i specially as we get to three
years out the sec is really still
dragging their feet on the spectrum
issue then it's gonna be a problem for
the carriers could be problem for us mr.
family I feel like it's not it's not
even an FCC that's dragging its feet the
FCC is trying its it's the political
process it's congress yeah you know so
like for example there's a bill before
Congress right now in the National
Broadband Plan as I mentioned they
wanted to get to 300 megahertz of
spectrum by 2015 so the guy who wrote
the Broadband Plan Blair Levin I talked
to him he said you know all all I
expected from Congress was just a
one-line bill authorizing you know
auctions boom then we're done and we can
get into it because one of the ideas in
in this plan was to take unused spectrum
from TV broadcasters they could
voluntarily give up their spectrum and
they would get a cut of the proceeds and
you know spectrums are wildly popular in
in Washington because they generate a
lot of revenue billions and billions of
dollars so because they generate too
much revenue and you know the u.s. is in
a real revenue crunch right now it's
become highly
sighs so instead of just having a
one-line bill authorizing this it's been
tacked on to other pieces of legislation
that have been very controversial and
then there's been a lot of infighting
about how the spectrum auctions should
be designed should the FCC have the
ability to to write rules so that
certain companies don't come too far
ahead in in spectrum for example I mean
the FCC really doesn't want verizon an
80 to have too much power in the market
because that then we don't have
competition and that's not good for
consumers so there are ways that they
can design the spectrum auctions so that
those powerhouses don't get all of the
spectrum so that they leave a little
room for some little guys to potentially
get in there and you know there are some
obviously 80 for example doesn't like
that so it was lobbying pretty hard to
have some very harsh rules set upon the
FCC not to be able to do that so then
what that does as we've seen in so many
other things in Washington is there's
just deadlock nothing nothing happens so
here we are two years into this plan and
getting spectrum I mean authorizing an
auction is is one thing but it can take
up to 10 years to get the rules written
to identify exactly which spectrum
you're going to use to clear that
spectrum and then to repurpose it and
have it ready to be used so I mean we're
looking at a really long process here
anyway and the problem is that it's
become so political we can't even get
started it's frustrating to say the
least worked up about it I can tell you
I feel like I wanted to do it Jon
Stewart on this thing but this is a kind
of a complicated and really messy and
very unsatisfying resolution to what
should be something that is for the
benefit of all I'm just going to say
this when my son or your child can't
stream their sesame street over the
iphone that you have there and they're
crying blame the DoD and blame the FCC
I'm just saying you guys when where the
politicians that's what I'm together
actually to be perfectly honest I I
don't
think that the big players AT&amp;amp;T and
verizon are that their hands are clean
in this whole mess because of so there's
so much money on the table they have so
much to gain by controlling the spectrum
hmmm that's just oh absolutely and when
you're in control I mean you don't want
to give up any of that control right I
mean it's it what's disheartening for
someone like me like I cover technology
i'm not a Washington person I'm not a DC
reporter and every time I'm you know I
start talking to people about these
issues I mean they tell you one thing
you like on background I mean so many
people on background we're telling me
you know like at the FCC and other
people in government were like yeah I
mean late squares getting a raw deal I
mean what can we say it sucks it really
sucks but this is the political process
this is Washington once you get
politicians involved this is what
happened I'm raising my son to be
economy to be a congressman he's gonna
fix it all because too late for me hey
