jacket this is from the Ministry of
supply it's a smart jacket that connects
with Alexa and can heat up automatically
and keep you warm in cold weather I'm
talking with Gahan who's one of the
founders of Ministry of supply and who's
letting me wear the jacket before it's
available we built this jacket with the
idea of putting a smart thermostat in
there so it can detect basically your
body temperature the outside temperature
and even if you're walking you're
running and or just standing still at a
bus stop and from there we can change
the power so sitting a bus stop will
give you full power if you're walking
briskly you don't want to overheat so
we'll turn the heat down like how is
this powered yeah so it's just by like a
standard USB battery pack so you just
plug it in and it instantly turns on so
it's already looking for your motion
your body temperature so basically you
just walk outside the door it'll turn on
I have a phone in my pocket that
controls the jacket and then I've got a
battery here that's connected and this
this hooks in yep you take the battery
out and you just like keep the plug in
the jack you just look in the jacket you
can wash it like you can wash it it's a
completely machine washable okay you
just take the battery oh yeah and how
does it heat up like what is what's
inside this jackings I feel something
yeah it's kind of making me feel like
I'm starting to feel a little warm yeah
yeah so basically we've got three carbon
fiber heating elements one in the center
back and two in the inward pockets okay
if it's cold out you just put your hands
in your pockets and you'll feel the
warmth from those heating pads and those
are basically just turning the power
from your battery pack into heat that
you can feel and it gets up to 135
degrees but that's basically like when
you're holding a nice warm cup of coffee
our application you just tell it I want
it warmer or cooler and that's all you
have to tell it and basically from there
it learns your preference so you know if
it's you know fifty five degrees and you
want to be a little bit warmer we'll the
next time we see that temperature give
you a little bit more heat there's a
power button here yeah yeah do I need to
press that you know something that's
critical this is just to turn the jacket
off if you don't have the phone on you
or anything and you just want to turn it
off completely
do you imagine other smart controls in
the future with Alexa yeah what's really
cool is you know the way we've built
this you know we in the future have
other developers build other skills for
the jacket like what like what would you
do I you know it you could you know
build into your morning routine like
Alexis start my morning routine turn on
the espresso machine and then preheat my
jacket we ship with a 10,000 milliamp
battery so that will give you actually
about four and a half hours at full heat
so if you were just running that heater
on the full time you'll get about four
and a half hours but because of the
machine learning but we actually find is
that you only need heat when you step
out the door or you're waiting at the
bus stop and so through that intelligent
control we can actually get to about a
week of usage on one battery charge exam
it feels pretty comfy this is a lease
it's a completely waterproof breathable
shell so it's time to keep you dry in
the snow it's wind proof and we've got a
insulation in there as well so if the
even if the battery is off you'll still
be stay quite warm so but it's got great
four-way stretch as well so what is that
what is it made out of yeah so it's
really cool it's made out of recycled
polyester that's been infused with
coffee grounds for odor control so it's
a thing with jackets most people don't
wash their jacket all that often so they
want to bake it so it can stay fresh
even through that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
