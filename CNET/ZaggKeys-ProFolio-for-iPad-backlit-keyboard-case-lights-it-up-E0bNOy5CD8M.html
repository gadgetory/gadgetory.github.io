grow on trees okay I've reviewed a ton
of them already and it was only a matter
of time before we looked at the zag pro
folio plus keyboard case for the iPad 2
through iPad 4 what this does at other
keyboards lack it's a simple little
thing backlighting there's been no
backlit keyboard case that I've seen
other than this and hey if you're a
knight typer this is a dream come true
if you're not a knight typer you really
don't need it because you're paying up
for that feature this is a 1:29 keyboard
case and you know if you get the zaggy
folio without this it's $99 if you look
at any other keyboard case that's in
that premium territory it's pretty much
$99 so you're really looking at $30 for
backlighting now if you're again if
you're really into conditions where you
wish there was a backlit keyboard on
your iPad that's gonna be worth it and
what's really kind of neat about this
one is it turns a variety of really cool
LED colors so you can have your own mini
rave with the press of a button they
range from red to blue to deep blue to
green and and they look nice and and you
can see the key as well and the keys by
the way do feel really nice that's
always been a big appeal to zags entire
lineup of keyboards sometimes they look
a little functional and pedestrian but
they actually perform really
competitively with everything else
that's out there as a case though this
thing feels while kind of slim a little
bit low on features that I've seen in
other ones recently there's only one
angle here it's not adjustable and also
there's no magnet dock you don't really
need the magnets but you look at the
Belkin ultimate keyboard case I reviewed
recently it had three different
positions and they were magnetically
connected which was really neat plus
that one automatically turned on and off
once the magnetic connection was made
this one you have to flip the switch
here plus when you're not using this in
keyboard mode what are you gonna do with
it do you want to fold it well you can't
really hear you're kind of stuck with it
like this you could kind of fold it over
into a stand mode like this but other
cases I've seen allow you to fold it
flat and do a little bit more without
having to pop it
out of the case it feels nice has a sort
of a a leatherette feel it's a soft
rubbery plastic on all sides looks fine
doesn't look that sexy but you're not
buying a keyboard to look sexy you're
buying a keyboard to do work the zag pro
folio plus again get it if you want
backlighting if you don't go somewhere
else
I'm Scott Stein and that's a quick look
at the very functional zag portfolio
plus keyboard for the iPad 2 through 4</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
