Bridget Carey and this is your cnet
update between the online sales on
thanksgiving black friday cyber monday
they should just start calling this
cyber weekend because black Friday has
become a huge online shopping day online
sales for internet retailers surpassed 1
billion dollars for the first time on
the day after Thanksgiving that's
according to comscore online shopping on
thanksgiving was also up thirty two
percent from last year so next time
maybe you could just get a great deal at
home instead of fighting for phones at
Walmart like in this video posted on
youtube amazon is always the top online
shopping spot for cyber monday deals but
other popular online destinations our
ebay followed by shopify next up are
amazon's websites zeppos and quincy
that's according to tracking agency Deep
Field and we're doing more shopping on
our mobile devices paypal and IBM
reported seeing a huge influx of mobile
shoppers throughout the Thanksgiving
holiday weekend in fact a large majority
of people shopping on tablets we're
using iPads but what are we buying
tablets are more popular now than
laptops and a recent report from NPD
displaysearch further proves this so
basically we're buying iPads with our
iPads there are several factors playing
in like how tablets now are cheaper
Windows 8 is designed to work on tablets
and companies ordered more to prepare
for a tablet gifts surged this holiday
as for other big tech items the new
furby and skyliners are hot sellers and
nintendo sold 1 million game systems
over the last week which includes
400,000 we use systems 300,000 of the
original we systems and 500,000 portable
3ds and DS systems and for gamers paying
fifty dollars for a yearly PlayStation
Plus account you can now add on Sony's
music unlimited premium membership for a
dollar a month it's normally ten dollars
a month for plus members Sony's music
service has 18 million songs streamed on
computers and mobile devices and it
offers the ability to listen offline
if you're traveling for the holidays
here's a few apps to keep an eye on
packing pro in the Apple App Store make
sure you don't forget anything with a
pre-trip to-do list and the packing list
and you can choose things from an
exhaustive pre-made list it's one of the
reasons the app costs three dollars and
when you check something off it syncs
with your other devices that also use
the app but if you're more about
documenting your travels check out hip
Geo it's for Apple and Android it's a
free app that creates a blog for you to
post your images videos text all tied to
your geolocation it's pretty much an
easy-to-use blog tool that's your tech
