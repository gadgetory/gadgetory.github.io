blackberry fans had anything to get
excited about but there's some big buzz
now there is in fact people were super
interested in the recent blackberry 10
announcement and the introduction of two
new phones this is really meant to
resurrect the company and make them a
player again yeah and we'll see inside
this box we have their first touch
screen phone running blackberry 10 OS so
this is the z10 I'm excited I know we
have some others phones to compare it to
the iphone 5 of the nexus 4 where it is
oh this is pretty much a child hablaba
take that oh yeah we got the white one
and that's got some pop to it does good
out of here it's thicker than I would
have thought oh ok so in the box we have
an apple charger and it has the little
blackberry style thing right there okay
what else presumably the battery ah yes
yeah that's in a way it could be that
light this is thing is not waste nothing
I know here pop that in there see ya it
has the snapdragon chipset so we have a
little odd for that with a cool dragon i
got our little uh blackberry talking
headset cuz everyone does that who has
blackberries right they all walk around
with the headset and then they hold the
mic up to their mouths I don't know why
that's such a pet peeve for me but it
kinda is and then we have to remove them
with our little charging cable mini USB
which I do like to see there we go
pretty big pretty big collection of
manuals here I mean now that we've now
it feels like a cell phone like a normal
phone oh yeah okay that makes a lot more
sense oh it's coming on though so you
can see it's a pretty similar size to
something like the nexus for the iphone
5 as a comparison iphone 5 of looking so
hilariously small i think every time I
see a new phone I'm just like why have
nothing so dinky it's a good-looking
phone yeah okay while we wait for this
guy to turn on let's do
some of the specs the blackberry z10
comes in two colors black and white it
has a 1.5 gigahertz dual-core Snapdragon
processor its 4G LTE ready depending on
your carrier and of course it runs the
new blackberry 10 operating system the
display is a 4.2 inch LCD display so not
the biggest we've seen but pretty good
resolution 1280 by 768 the camera on the
back is 8 megapixels and the front
facing camera is 2 megapixels the rear
camera is capable of 1080p HD video
recording there are 2 gigs of RAM on
board and 16 gigs of storage but it does
have expandable memory upto 64 gigs in
terms of ports you have micro HDMI and
microUSB plus of course a headset jack
it has an 1800 milliamp battery now
that's not a huge battery so i wouldn't
expect great battery life blackberry
says you'll get up to 10 hours of
talktime and 13 days on standby this is
a touchscreen phone with a virtual
keyboard somewhat of a departure for
blackberry the cost is 199 dollars on
contract or five hundred ninety nine
dollars unlocked I gotta say coming out
of the box I mean it's almost a letdown
that it looks so much like every other
phone it really doesn't have that
differentiate earth at you're accustomed
to from blackberry and Laura it just
looks like every other phone on the
market so we'll just have to see kind of
how that OS works out and how well they
have managed to button it all up it
seems a little sluggish first impression
but maybe you know more use would be
different</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
