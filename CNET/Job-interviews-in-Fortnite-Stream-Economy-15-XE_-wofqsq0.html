about the biggest news across movies TV
shows and games and tell you what you
should and shouldn't be watching let's
kick things off with an update on the
James gun situation in an exclusive
Variety reported earlier this week that
Disney is holding firm on its firing of
guardians of the galaxy writer director
James Gunn the exclusive claims there
was a meeting between Gunn and Disney's
studio chairman alan horne but that the
decision to let gunn go after some
off-color tweets resurfaced wasn't
getting reversed look I'm not here to
tell you whether or not I think Disney
firing James Gunn is good or bad right
or wrong you can go to my Twitter for
that and we can talk about it what I
want to do today is I want to speculate
with you about where James Gunn might
direct next and I have some good ideas
obviously the first and best fu to
Disney would be for him to go to Warner
Brothers specifically DC now I don't
think James Gunn's sense of humor and
his sensibility is right for say a
Superman or a Batman movie but I do
think and I am so proud of this that he
would be perfect for the Booster Gold
and Blue Beetle movie that is currently
in and has been in development hell for
the last few years at Warner Brothers I
mean it's right there he's friends with
Nathan Fillion Nathan Fillion could play
Booster Gold hands down it would be
amazing
so that's my choice if he decides to do
superhero movies maybe he wants to go to
the smaller screen well if that's the
case I think he would be incredible
directing a season of a show like Fargo
or true detective prestige TV is super
hot right now and an anthology series
like this would give James Gunn the
opportunity to spend an entire season
developing characters and he's already
really good at doing that in a two-hour
movie so I can't even imagine what would
happen if he had an entire season of
television to play with lastly maybe he
says none of this is for me I want to go
back to making weird serve out to our
movies like slither and super which were
super super cool no pun intended but
honestly this is a very James Gunn move
to so and it would make me excited to
see what he would make especially after
he's been part of the Hollywood machine
for the
few years also he could get picked up by
Netflix Amazon or even Apple who might
swoop in and make him an offer he can't
refuse
either way all of these options sounds
super exciting to me and I'm really
curious what you guys think James Gunn
might do next but any way you slice it
James Gunn if you're out there and you
are watching get paid this is money
let's just give it all the James Gunn
that's for you buddy all right another
exciting employment news Star Trek has
found its Spock we already knew that
Spock would be making an appearance on
the USS Enterprise after the events of
comic-con a few weeks ago now we know
that actor Ethan Peck will be suiting up
as everyone's favorite Vulcan for season
2 this is the part of the show where I
have to tell you that Star Trek is owned
by CBS CBS is CNET's parent company
there you go full disclosure but I'm
happy to drag a CBS show if it's not
good like I'm still angry about the
ending of How I Met Your Mother
God that was garbage ok back to the
topic at hand is this good casting news
okay Ethan Peck well it's kind of tough
because on the one hand he doesn't have
a whole lot of breakout acting roles
credited to his name so he's done some
stuff on Madame secretary Gossip Girl he
played Patrick Verona on a 10 Things I
Hate About You TV show but on the other
hand on the other hand this guy Ethan
Peck is the grandson of the legendary
actor Gregory Peck who you might know as
Atticus Finch in To Kill a Mockingbird
he won an Oscar for that by the way so
acting is in his blood and that seems a
little bit exciting he also has the
approval of a very important demographic
and that is the family of the original
Spock
late great actor Leonard Nimoy so Peck
posted a picture to his Twitter with the
family all doing live long and prosper
and he said it was an incomparable honor
to be playing Spock so I feel really
good about that and I think that next
season is going to be really exciting
he's gonna be playing a young Spock this
takes place before the events of the
original series so I think I'm gonna
give this casting my blessing go
Ethan Peck live long and prosper so it
looks like we have an employment theme
happening on this week's show and that
brings us to our final story of the week
which is your fortnight skills could get
you a job an entertainment agency in
Europe called dare dot win is hiring a
creative team for a six month long
contract internship in Paris and it's
conducting interviews inside the
insanely popular battle royale game
fortnight so is this super dumb or is it
kind of genius well a few caveats here
number one dare not win is getting a lot
of press for this move which is really
convenient considering one of their
clients is playstation they're only
doing interviews on playstation network
too by the way so a really great job
there and secondly there are creative
agency this is literally their job to
generate buzz and Jinna press which I
feel like I've been swindled in some way
by reporting on this right now but let's
just talk about the idea of how this
works so they say if you want to try out
for this job or if you want to interview
for the job you have to add them on
PlayStation Network then they'll set up
a time with you and then you will play
with the Dare dot win team in fortnight
uh I think this is a great idea I'm
gonna be honest here because plan for
tonight is an excellent way to see how
you handle number one pressure number
two playing with other people and three
playing against other people so if I'm a
job interviewer and you do not accept
responsibility for maybe your teammates
death in a battle royale you're probably
not gonna accept responsibility at your
job when something goes wrong and it's
your fault so I like this a lot and I
have seen a lot of people adding things
like guild leader and the like to their
resumes for years at this point so this
is an easy extension of that and in fact
I'd like to see lots of different jobs
add multiplayer gaming components to
their interview process and really at
the end of the day I think we should
just drop everybody in a fallout 76
because that's where we're gonna find
out who everybody really is that's true
uh you know guys there was an item
making the rounds on the internet this
week that mark Searles felt very
strongly about and here you go
James Bond James Bourne died that I sell
by this Jim's people are pissed off
cause they ain't yourself was gonna be
