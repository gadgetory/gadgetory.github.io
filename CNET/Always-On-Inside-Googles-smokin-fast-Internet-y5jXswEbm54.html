the Kansas City Chiefs delicious
barbecue and the beginning of Google
Fiber Google's promise of internet
speeds
a hundred times what the rest of the
country gets let's check out to see if
it's really the case
teach me on Google Fiber as a concept
what is it and why do I want it sure so
the average American internet connection
today is 6.7 megabits per second so with
Google Fiber we're offering 1,000
megabits per second and we think that
not only will this let people do
everything they do today faster and
easier online but it also has
implications for the future the web you
know will let people develop the new
applications that will make the web
better and faster going forward and this
is important faster broadband is good
for everything from mapping to streaming
video to video conferencing hi
I'm C I'm definitely seeing some
blurriness when you know when you move a
lot but you're super smooth and clear
exactly it is right this has huge
implications for emerging fields like
telemedicine if you can video conference
without latency and share huge files at
the same time you could have virtual
meetings with doctors who could send you
x-rays while you talk or any student
could take any class anywhere and then
of course there's things like smart
energy grids connected devices and all
the things we haven't even thought up
Google Fiber and gigabit ethernet is
great for consumers but it's also
transforming Kansas City from a business
perspective and at the center of that is
the Kansas City startup village which is
a series of three houses like this one
behind me where all kinds of
entrepreneurs are gathering and creating
a real community let's check it out
do you really see the next big company
coming out of Kansas City I mean are we
gonna get a Google size company coming
out of here I think that's completely
possible yes the biggest benefit is
probably we get a glimpse in the future
for what everyone's going to have right
so if we get to gear technology towards
what people are going to have is an
advantage just a little time in the
Google Fiber space made me a believer
I'm wandering up and down Sunset
Boulevard on Street View in Google Maps
this is basically my neighborhood in LA
and this is something I would never do
at home on my PC because it takes so
long to load all the images and you look
at something else that's a high image
content on the web something like the
Google Art Project now pointillism is
something that you can only really
appreciate when you can zoom up close
and really see the detail of the
brushstrokes I'm sold on this so my
visit was almost over but I had to know
when can I get it unfortunately no
matter how many times I asked Google
wouldn't say do you guys have plans to
expand beyond Kansas City or even in the
city so when can I have this in Los
Angeles I want to know how it's gonna
happen when give me a date I mean is
there a timetable for trying to get this
into other cities or I mean is there and
is this something that I can cross my
fingers for do I have to is it gonna be
my kids that are having this or am I
gonna be able to get it in you know in
the next few years I mean from Google
like I said we've got a lot of work to
do here we don't have anything to
announce I mean I think we would be
interested in talking to other
communities in the future perhaps bottom
line if you want Google Fiber you're
gonna have to move to Kansas City to get
it
I want it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
