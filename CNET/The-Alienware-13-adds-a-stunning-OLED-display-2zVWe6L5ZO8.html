there there were more powerful gaming
laptops out there but this updated
version of the Alienware 13 has
something almost no one else has
yet in OLED screen using these super
bright super clear display technology
now founded only the highest end big
screen televisions just like on big OLED
TVs the effect here it's pretty stunning
as OLED gives you bright colors and deep
nearly invisible blacks if I were buying
a new TV today there's no way I wouldn't
make the extra investment in an OLED
model for a laptop even a gaming one
it's not as clear-cut but it's still a
great extra feature to have the NVIDIA
GeForce 965 M graphics card Ensign fine
for mainstream gaming but it won't do
virtual reality for that you can
actually add the sold separately
Alienware graphics amplifier which
attaches a desktop graphics card to a
proprietary port in the back playing
games on this OLED display look great
it's hard to go back to a regular old
LCD after this but it's also not as
finely tuned as the best OLED TVs which
can cost many thousands of dollars it
lacks the fine tuning controls of a
high-end TV and the screen itself is
very glossy and picks up good amount of
glare the bottom also gets pretty hot
when lap gaming which is something
you're only likely to do with a smaller
13-inch laptop and while battery life in
general was decent when gaming off the
batteries we didn't even hit 90-minute
but for an eye-catching new technology
that's hard to find
Samsung HP Lenovo each offers single
OLED PC product right now and none for
gaming the price is surprisingly modest
starting at $12.99 in the US this is the
first OLED gaming laptop we've seen but
hopefully it won't be the last
