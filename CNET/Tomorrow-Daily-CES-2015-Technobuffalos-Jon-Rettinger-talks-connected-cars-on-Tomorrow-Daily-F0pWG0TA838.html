2015 and we've got two more favorites to
tell you about new virtual reality tech
that actually lets you run into battle
or run away from battle if your main and
LG has a flexible television that goes
from flat to curved and it is looking
real good just like us oh yes tomorrow
daily
the Internet's welcome I know hi back
Peter blurry back they're not paying
attention to us welcome to tomorrow
daily the best geek talk show in the
known universe I'm your host Ashley
together join me as always the man the
myth the legend the the VR enthusiast
I'm still kicking add a story we're
still we're still excited Kayla not
enough chaos it going me it's good oh my
voice will be gone by tomorrow so this
will be the last show that we do here
rental words any fun way um a better
sponsors yeah we should talk about so
our LG was crying out there sponsored
the show this week they were kind enough
to let us borrow the LG G flex and kills
been carrying it around and you you were
telling you a very interesting feature
do that but ya know uh it's it's
incredibly durable it's self-healing
they're saying you so you can kind of
like if you put it in your pocket with
like your keys and stuff like that it
won't get all scratched up like a bad
see and also I know that it can like
yeah you can hold on watch camera follow
me follow down falling down to the table
smack squishing oh you can you can
literally squish it yeah do CPR on it
and it's fine breathe yo breathe oh no
it's really cool so thank u del G are
you can check out we have some we have a
first look for it over on cnet and you
you can enjoy that and learn all about
the LG G flex and thanks again to LG our
sponsor for this week really appreciate
ya thank you hit it I got to carry
around a g3 which was also very cool but
enough of that we have some fantastic
tech to talk to you about so we're gonna
hit the headlines uh so again day 3 for
us out on the show floor for me the one
thing that I saw that I thought was kind
of cool and also looked a little bit
like Geordi LaForge from Star Trek okay
is the avegant glyph the otha gan glyph
I like so we have some video of this
check this out so it looks like a pair
of headphones right right but it's
actually you can watch movies with it
it's got women there's your eye pieces
just like those viewfinders you had when
you were a kid yeah it's like that right
so that's the that's the working
prototype but the actual ring it wrong I
know it it's like it just looks like you
put your headphones on weird but it's
really cool cuz you can plug it into any
hdmi and I really really like that it's
really really neat you can you can do
all cut you can watch it with anything
that has hdmi out so and even like
iphone so if you have the adapter you
can just plug it right into the heads
it's pretty cool you're not really
annoying real real life that's pretty
cool I want to see annoying real life as
we say so what are what have you seen
around the show floor that has been so
interesting to you going with my sort of
like party thing that I've had every
single one I had the pong beer pong pong
robot I picked the Pico brew which is a
beer but like a home brewing beer
automated system where it's busy just
put all stuff in there and you should a
button and it like bruise you up some
beer and you can work here named it
yourself yet you are now your own beer
brewer and it's it's it's very it's very
simple they're saying just toss a bunch
of stuff in there it comes with a little
keg and you put in the water you put in
it you know every all those little
ingredients and then hit brew and then
you go you know not party and then you
come back and your party it's uh it's
two thousand dollars which is which is
pretty steep and I should start a
business right yeah or something your
own micro brewery but it was a
Kickstarter project which is always it's
always it's always you know it has a
little bit more heart your starter
project and it's apparently the
Kickstarter that will do is the
second-most funded food Kickstarter so
there you go Congrats ekobrew you don't
have time for that you also told me that
we're aside from our second story uh you
also kind of like have been able to see
the show floor a lot more than I have
yeah so um you told me about we're big
virtual reality family on Tamar daily we
love our chorizo you got to check out a
product that I think it has a lot of
potential yep I would you know virtual
reality you know is getting better and
better in the headset but how can we get
more involved with it yeah well why
don't why don't I have someone who's the
only person that's better at video games
than me me let's check it out yeah
thanks me now look virtual reality is a
big thing this year but how do we step
it up well by actually taking steps in
virtual reality so did check this out
this is the omni and believe it or not
it makes it so you can walk in virtual
in a virtual reality space using any of
the virtual reality headsets that come
out
let's let's see how this thing works you
ready so now because I'm a pro MLG
player I'm not going to miss any shots
all right here we go come on wall I
don't think so maybe their head I don't
think so oh yeah headshot headshot got
it got it got it easy so as you can see
you're actually walking you're not like
you're not going to sit on the couch I
mean like the we promised a lot but this
is a this is actually getting up as you
can see never missing a shot the Omni is
using these track pads of the trackpad
there's trackers on this shoe here that
are tracking your movement and then
there's little on the bottom here it
makes it so you can kind of glide along
the bottom of the Omni so there you go
as simple as that and of course the
harness the harness is just here to hold
you in place you don't run all over your
living room and step on the cat and
stuff like that one of the things that I
was really impressed with with is of
course you're like you know you're
running around you're going to get a
workout yeah you are there they're
saying that if you play for an hour you
burn about 400 calories it's incredible
cuz I that's that's more than I work out
in a day and a week and like a year and
last year too oh there's me running oh
my god hurry
so you they said you can walk run and
you can even sit and you can use this
with any game that has a gamepad with
their virtual reality on it so it's
pretty much any game so there you go
that's the Omni by virtue x it's uh it's
pretty amazing again like I said 499 if
you buy it now so anyway I gotta hurry
back to the booth so that guy is going
places I think I should hire him to host
the show oh I think it's good all right
no but what they were telling you them
the most interesting thing was you know
a lot of you know indie game devs or
whatever are taking games that we
already have team fortress 2 call of
duty and putting them in the virtual
reality headset in certain ways they
were telling me at the booth they're
playing team fortress 2 with the omni
and like you know as the pyro doing
spins and doing like pirate like a spy
checks and stuff like that it was great
I wish a lot like to purchase too well
we'll ask them later maybe ask after the
after the show floor closes we can sneak
in and can ask me all play doh ok but
it's pretty cheap it seems pretty cheap
not bad I thought it would be a lot more
expensive for a big it is I didn't know
that the gun doesn't come with it oh
okay well that's fine well I use my old
NES gun yeah weird I ok so we have to
tell you guys about this really awesome
TV that I saw down on the show floor I
went and hung out over an LG and I'm
really skeptical of curved televisions
like I don't know I don't know like a
daisy seem kind of gimmicky to me I seem
like the 3d of but then later I am kind
of a hater on curved TVs I'll be honest
so but I saw LG 77 inch curved to flat
television it's actually flexible it
moves so we have some b-roll of this
check this out it act like it's going
from her to flag it's gonna break it is
the weirdest thing to see in person if
you haven't seen on a highly recommend
you go buy the LG booth and watch this
thing in action it it is so cool and
honestly it's just one of those weird
candy things about technology where it
has zero purpose whatsoever besides
maybe like you have some extra people
who need better viewing angles in your
house you gotta go flat but man it just
looks really cool and I just wanted for
bragging rights and if you can't make up
your mind if you want to flat or a
curved
switch back and forth you got the best
of gold work I've got both anyway yeah
yeah of course of court and then we get
on our yacht and drink eyeballs and sail
away into the end of the sunset on that
note sailing away into the sunset we're
going to take a quick break we'll be
right back with techno buffalos jon
rettinger and we're going to be talking
about cars and a little bit of kid tech
and then of course your user feedback so
don't click away tomorrow daily
max is tomorrow daily once again the
best geek talk show in the known
universe we are here we have a guest
somebody that aren't very familiar with
John render TechnoBuffalo calm one of my
favorite tech websites besides cnet we
have to pay for that kind of endorsement
well like check i hope i get my chat
soon checks in the mail um so you're
here with us um how was your show bin so
far show has been incredible busy it's
like a it's a complete blur for
everybody here but it's been fun it's
cool to see the new trends in cccs
change kind of year-over-year every year
it's something new and it gets bigger
that's the crazy thing new things come
in I mean cars replace what Microsoft
used to be here you know 57 years ago
and new trends are are coming new
technologies and the 3d printing food
yeah we talked about that yesterday 3d
bringing the food we love tech West
that's all the weird stuff that makes us
happy so okay we wanted to talk about we
I know you love cars a little bit of a
car guy John's Laveau car got so um you
have seen some really cool connected
cars at this year's show starting with
the Mercedes concept car ridiculous so
if you guys didn't get a chance to see
it the only head of here for one day
went back on day tunes excited to see it
and the car just driven off so this
thing looks like if you could draw it
it'd be an oval with just wheels at the
bottom of it it's part of their vision
for 20 30 which is coming up not that
far away it's coming up yeah yeah yeah
so first totally autonomous but not the
type of autonomous where it'll like you
know stop you in traffic and you still
have to drive the kind where the seats
actually swivel 360 degrees you can sit
and talk to the person behind you well
the car is going take you right like now
six screens all around you actually the
screens projecting cameras from outside
so it looks like there's no nothing
there which is weird I would really
weird me out i think but also it when I
saw it I thought to myself it looks like
one of those luxury yachts but on wheels
and I feel like I feel like kale and I
and you just need one like and it also i
heard it drove itself away yeah which is
just like i got by CES and it just drove
off
connected cars really ask you guys so
let's say Kenta cards coming out on the
road you see one or an autonomous car
rather and you see it and you know that
car's autonomous are you gonna maybe
just break a little bit in front of it
and see what happens like it start the
car wheelies you're gonna test a car out
on the road I mean I would hope that you
would do that like in a test track
wouldn't that be doing a public service
by figuring that out trying to make
somebody crash yeah yeah using the bear
whereas I would move completed I see it
coming and I move out of the way maybe
pull over dropping all the way off of
the freeway I'm slathering my hand in
hunting is offering it like please bear
come bring it up that seems risky um
okay so and then the other car that you
mentioned that was of interest was the
VW Golf touch so tell us a little bit
about that cuz I didn't get to see this
okay so it looks like a regular motor
trend car of the year winning VW Golf
except totally controlled by touch and
gestures and voice as well so everything
where there'd be an analog knob or even
something digital like a touch
controller like you see in Cadillacs cue
it is a hundred percent touch and
gestures in your voice remember when we
tried to set up the new kinect for xbox
wanted yes I mean what could possibly go
wrong we're talking your car so cool
thing it yet what's that you wanted to
speed on she wanted to speak you want to
crash through the barrier great let's do
that like this about that feature sorry
I can't do that David it's just like
crashes right through it's like the
touch panels are need control things
like your air conditioning and stuff but
if you want to roll down your windows I
mean you make this gesture you want to
pull back your sunroof you kind of push
back wait you actually have to make this
just we're going back to doing this now
alright fair enough he went like this so
the idea is that you can keep your eyes
forward and not having a look for strike
points to change a radio station or
anything like that and also hope is
probably know the passenger in the car
like says to me you're looking yeah
cranking your crank in your car at the
other side it's like you turn on some
music well I guess you do this get a
dance party going what am i doing
like well how ridiculous is everyone
gonna look when we're in these cars and
you're like okay so I've been my
convertible I got rolled down the
windows and put the top back in your
like this like it looks like the current
everyone's like what's with the crazy
person inside that convertible it was
like when people first got Bluetooth
headsets you couldn't tell they're just
crazy or talking to somebody you know so
and then also you're a a relatively new
dad I am a real na proud proud new dad
very adorable baby don't congrats yo
give it up for a gear up for Nate man
give up for babies babies all right he's
kept this kid alive for over a year so
that's what I give her credit despite my
best efforts very good um so you were
talking to me about a product that you
felt was actually really underserved and
under covered here at the show and there
are a lot of parents out there that
watch not necessarily tomorrow daily I
don't know I don't know I don't know who
our main demographic is guys I'm not
really sure yet dad's um but you
mentioned something that I thought was
really fascinating which is kid case so
Kip case is it's like parental controls
full parental controls for for the ipad
mini it's launching with a lot of stuff
feel like the oled tvs and connected
cars get all the top stories there's a
lot of really cool tech that sort of
flies under the radar so what this does
I have older nieces and nephews you put
this thing on your iPad Mini and you can
control how long the kid is using it for
it's like listen you did your homework
you get an hour and a half of iPad time
then it shuts down shuts off they've
worked with Apple to make sure it's
completely compatible its license it
will shut off you can reward your kid
with more time let's say you know they
want to help make dinner clean up the
kitchen get another 45 minutes on the
iPad interesting and is it controlled by
like your app like oh maybe on your
phone or how do you control it control
it through the iPad interest and they're
working on a suite of apps that'll
automatically integrate as well so
learning apps if you do you know
seemingly like games that are rot your
brain you only get ten minutes get a
half hour if you do educational side
it'll unlock it'll unlock more time
which is really really kind of cool it
should be watching somewhere in q2 q3
ish and then for the ipad air line a
little
I saw that I was like this is useful
this is something I think every parent
can relate to and he put him in front of
a TV or tablet in the job and she just
goes and also you know it be used her
fool me for me when we started doing the
show and like kills on his iPad and then
I'm like Kelly only get 10 more minutes
we got to shut this down we got to get a
show going here and I hate this tag I
don't like I don't like those on stage
well um thank you so much we're gonna
we're gonna keep going into our user
feedback but tell everybody before we
get into that how we can find detector

feedback we got a lot of really good
stuff we asked her our viewers to send
us the hashtag TD WTF to tell us what
their favorite kind of really weird
stuff was around CES cuz there's a lot
of it that was a missed that was a
mistake I think it was great because

stuff but interesting oh wow so yeah I
can hear your your brain waves as music
through bluetooth if the mellow mind
headsets really interesting and then um
