360 degree cameras before but this one
is slightly different because it's
streaming in 3d it's called the hablo
it's a lightweight camera unit that does
all the processing stitching and
crunching inside the unit there's no
external control box that you need to
worry about it's got 6 200 degree
fisheye lenses it is shooting 4k at 30
frames a second and once you've
connected it to a network like your LTE
network if you're out and about you can
then stream out live to the app itself a
slightly different in terms of how they
want you to be this content now hope
they wants you to look at it in its own
app rather than through a third party
platform like Facebook or YouTube that
does 2d 360 streaming the thing is with
the hub low as you put on a VR headset
and then you can actually use the camera
in the phone itself to have this kind of
semi augmented reality view where you
see this stream at the top and at the
bottom you can see a Bluetooth keyboard
if you want to purchase it separately
and you can chat with the broadcast live
in real time now the hablo is going to
be available on IndieGoGo for around one
thousand dollars when it launches and
the retail price will be around twelve
hundred dollars when it goes on sale by
the end of q1 is what the company tells
me and they also said that the post
processing is available if you want to
output that stream to 2d and put it out
on Facebook or YouTube for later in
theory but they weren't able to show me
that but the actual experience of
watching that weird hybrid side by side
of having the keyboard at the bottom and
the livestream at the top of the VR
didn't make me feel kind of nauseous but
it was really cool in this very little
lag at all which is different to some of
the other live streaming platforms out
there at the moment</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
