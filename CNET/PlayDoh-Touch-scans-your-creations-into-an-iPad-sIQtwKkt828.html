that Plato has bro 60 year old brand is
getting its first iOS app and a new
connected Play kit called Plato touch
and it's kinda sorta a scanner for kids
the $40 set includes mini tubs of dough
a lot of shapes to play with and a shape
to life studio surface that you put your
creations on a new app for the iPhone
and iPad is a game world that feels a
little like LittleBigPlanet meets Spore
tap in the game to scan and what you
make and your little things come to life
Wiggly eyes and limbs and all the 3d
scanning trick is pretty clever and even
allows for near 3d objects it works with
things that aren't playdough - like your
MetroCard but Plato touch isn't a
repository for kids scanned things at
least not yet the game mixes creations
or uses included shapes to unlock
characters and easter eggs but it
doesn't save a gallery of your favorite
shapes but imagine if it could and allow
kids to scan and edit their ideas into
movies and even art as bro sounds open
to the idea in the future based on a
conversation I had right now it'll be
available exclusively in Apple stores
and launching in other stores next year
as augmented reality cameras get more
capable ideas like play-doh touch could
become a hint of where 3d scannable
future lies not just for grown-ups
but for kids</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
