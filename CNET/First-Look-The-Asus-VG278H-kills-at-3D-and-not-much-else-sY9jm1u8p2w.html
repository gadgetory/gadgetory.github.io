Nvidia 3d vision kit require four
components to work properly 3d glasses
an Nvidia graphics card a compatible
display and this a separate USB
connected 3d emitter but while all four
of those things are still required some
manufacturers have figured out how to
make the process a bit more streamlined
I'm Eric Franklin and today I'll take a
first look at the Isuzu g27
8h the VGA was one of the first 3d
vision compatible monitors to feature a
built-in adjustable 3d emitter it also
comes with Nvidia 3d vision kit two
glasses the glasses feature a light
boost technology making 3d images appear
brighter than the first gen tech did the
new glasses also don't squeeze your head
quite as tight and seem to block out
more ambient light but other than the
emitter there's really nothing special
about the VG's physical characteristics
it includes screen height adjustment
until but sadly no pivot their
connections include HDMI DVI and VGA and
trying to actually access those
downward-facing hard-to-get-to inputs is
frustrating the OSD array feels pretty
clunky to use uses the menu button as
the inter button and under certain
circumstances ignores a fact that there
are up and down buttons that can easily
be used for navigation movies in a
theater preset pushed a bit too much
green but I found a nice color balance
by using standard and lowering the green
games are a bit too foggy and drab under
the game preset I think it's best to use
the scenery mode instead where images
stay vibrant and the contrast remains
high if you want to cut down on the
amount of motion blur some games have
you can turn on the 120 Hertz refresh
rate option you'll see much less
evidence of motion blur than traditional
monitors especially when panning around
games under 3d have very little ghosting
even when the 3d effect was turned all
the way up games look brighter too than
other active shutter 3d solutions I've
seen however when text appeared on the
screen my eyes would get confused for a
bit and the effect was ruined until my
eyes were able to readjust the VG does
3d
and this is coming from a person that
doesn't appreciate 3d the way I'm sure
most movie and video game companies out
there would like me to normal games and
movies performance is also good
I wouldn't call the monitor badly built
but I wouldn't go out of my way to say
it's well built either the 27-inch
monitor cost $600
that's pretty high for a monitor that
doesn't do much beyond 3d if you're
considering buying for my final verdict
check out my full review once again I'm
Eric Franklin and this has been a first
look at the a sous B g27
