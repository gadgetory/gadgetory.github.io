the Beats Studio wireless over your
headphones this model looks nearly
identical to the company studio / ear
but the big difference is it includes
not only active noise canceling but
Bluetooth technology which allows for
Wireless trimming from any Bluetooth
enabled device that added feature cost
something of course $80 to be exact and
this headphone retails for a lofty 370
995 I tested the studio wireless for
several weeks and came away really
liking it sound wise it measures up well
against some of the top Bluetooth
headphones out there and it's a big
upgrade over the older on ear beats
Wireless that's the one with the smaller
ear cups that's based on the solo design
like the studio over here this is the
new reimagined version of the original
studio these new models are lighter and
built more sturdy they also boast softer
ear cups as I want to wear this model
for long stretches without a problem and
it worked well as ear muffs during the
cold season they will get a little
steamy in warmer weather and it's worth
noting they do leak a little sound if
you play them at high volumes Beach
doesn't talk up the noise case on this
model all that much because at the
default setting it's not very strong
that you will hear a very faint hiss
when you music isn't playing you can
ramp up the noise canceling by pressing
the remote button on the side of the
headphone when you're turning on the
headphone but that heavier noise
cancellation is it for music listening
it's really just for silencing the
outside world in fact you can't listen
to your music in this mode in any case
as I said the headphones perform very
well for Bluetooth headphones the smooth
natural sound and good tight bass this
plump but not over emphasized like it
was with the old studio model battery
life is also good you can get up to
about 20 hours at more moderate volume
levels and a set of LED lights near the
power button lets you know just how much
juice you have left
and finally the headphone also has a
built-in microphone so you can make
calls and the call quality was good in
my tests the big question of course is
whether this is worth three hundred
eighty bucks it's hard to say it's a
very comfortable headphone it sounds
good and folds up into a more compact
girge that you can easily stick in a
backpack or even a coat pocket
seems well-built and has held up well
for me over the course the month that
I've used it in the gym and on my daily
commute it's lighter more comfortable
than the parrot Zeek which cost $400 and
arguably sounds slightly better that
model does have some extra features but
I think I'd pick this one over the
parrot it's a really nice bluetooth
headphone that I have no problem
recommending if you can deal with paying
a premium for the beats brand I'm David
Carr noise that's the Beats Studio
wireless thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
