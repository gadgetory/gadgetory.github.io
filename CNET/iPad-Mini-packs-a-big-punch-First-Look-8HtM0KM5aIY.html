iPad day the smallest in the iPad line
the iPad Mini has been announced and
this is going to be available on
November second it is 7.2 millimeters
thin very very thin and feels extremely
light it's got a 7.9 inch display and it
starts at 329 now that's maybe higher up
than some of the doorbuster tablets that
are out there but it packs an a5
processor it's got facetime HD it's got
optional LTE for configuration starting
at four hundred sixty dollars and it's
got a thousand 24 x 768 display that
matches the iPad tues but the text seems
a lot more crisp and readable
comparatively because the displays a
little smaller it doesn't feel like a
Retina display but it certainly feels
readable for for email and feels more
readable than it would on an iPad to a
lot of people going to want these a for
the price and be because of the fact
that it's more affordable and it comes
in black and it comes in so in aluminum
with the field that sort of reminds me
of the ipod touch 5th gen and there were
variety of smart covers that fit it as
well pre-orders start imminently and it
will be available alongside the new
fourth-generation ipad which has an
upgraded a6x processor so these two are
going to be available for the holiday
season and this seems to mark the
resetting of the next generation of the
ipad lineup i'm scott steiner mrs. they
look at the new iPad Mini
