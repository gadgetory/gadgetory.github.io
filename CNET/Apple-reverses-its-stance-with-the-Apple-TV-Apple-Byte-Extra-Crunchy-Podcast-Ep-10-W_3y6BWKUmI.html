shout out brush are you ready yep from
the top of the CBS interactive building
in San Francisco it's the apple byte
extra crunchy with your host Bryan Tom
Oh boom there goes a sound we're here
live in living color welcome to apple
byte extra crunchy everybody this is the
show where we expand upon the topics of
the week the news the latest happenings
always plan to talk about with Apple now
we just want to let you know off the top
of the show because sometimes i forget
the phone number you guys can cause
because this is an interactive show the
show is all about us but all about you
more than anything else 1 800 61 62 63 8
we can check your voicemails we don't
take live calls yet but that's how you
can communicate with us tell us how
you're feeling about iOS 9 how you're
feeling about the upcoming iphone 6s the
ipad pro the apple TV anything that has
kind of come up i think a lot of people
will be wondering what's going on with
iOS 9 for the show just there i'm going
to use their personal issues what bugs
have you guys run into we want to know
the bugs yes like things that even may
not be bugs but bug you yes for example
Steven Steven you've talked about this
earlier today while we were setting this
up yeah so the the new update if you go
and if you make a video on your phone
just you know everyone makes videos
constantly the new play buttons are very
tiny and they're up in the top and the
top there's like a little bar along the
top but they're just really small and
they're hard let me see Regan so if I
can flying to find it for people that
are listening is a video my son's
normally you be able to press pause and
play just by directly tapping the center
of the video yes like now Aaron looks
pretty basically my phone it's over in
the top you can't see but in the top
right-hand corner it's like a tiny
play/pause button that they put their
it's tiny do you have to have tiny
fingers it's almost like you need like
an apple pencil
oh my gosh I just hit me how much is
that a hundred and ninety-nine
ninety-nine ninety-nine cents 99 bucks
my man but it's really small and it's
out of the way of your fingers that was
the first problem I ran into I was like
wait this is if I'm gonna have to like
you know try to find this button each
time it's gonna be a pain in the butt
that is a pain in the button yes so we
have iOS 9 we know that people some
people over the air had issues updating
over the air most people said be Tong
plug it into your mac i did when i got
home oh okay you know not when i'm at
work yeah yeah cuz i don't i don't want
to back up my phone and put all my stuff
on my work machine yeah so we had that
that's kind of par for the course but
people are also talking about how with
iOS 9 to complain about some apps are
crashing on their iPhone and their iPad
and a lot of times when this thing rolls
out it can be a combination of hardware
apps and the new oh I OS update and
typically they'll release another kind
of update / patch but it's the way it's
almost always been I almost expect that
now these days right you know it's never
gonna be flawless out of the gates yeah
I haven't haven't had any apps crash but
yeah it is you know there's always
little issues people like to wait a
couple weeks or until after apple
patches some of the problems before they
do their update but I did have a friend
on Facebook say my phone's broken now I
did the update it's locked up doesn't
work anymore well I will say some
devices like my original iPad air i do
not have the ipad air 2 because there's
no reason to get it it runs slower
really it's it's a little you can tell
it's not as smooth and that happens
right with Apple hardware a lot of times
they say oh here get the latest iOS but
then if you have maybe a phone not a
year remove but maybe two years removed
it never it never runs as well yeah you
always are like it's it just doesn't
it's not going to I did have a little
fight with cereal I coast it's a little
different now to get to Siri you know
and usually hear that boo Boop that's
why I know you're not more right so I
was kind of like wha took me a little
second to you know us to see the Serie
prompting more it's difficult we have
which was helpful right he's there all
first world problem I know like
like dude that play button in the corner
oh my gosh I can't live ah I can't leave
have you seen that one there was like a
Bulgarian no yeah I can leave um reports
from mixpanel which is kind of a website
that pulls up the analytics says that up
to this point I'm as of this day event
we're around 48 hours after the release
iOS 9 adoption is over twenty percent
iOS 8 adoption is pretty high as well
it's obviously dropped a blue line if
you're watching this has dropped but iOS
9 adoption kind of creeps up but it's
pretty much on progress and on track
with while we sing with iOS 8 when it
first came out also for people that
didn't know by now Apple has delayed
watch OS to this is because they found a
critical bug within it and they weren't
willing to release it to the public
which i think is a very good thing that
is a good thing like thanks Apple my
whole statement on the show is let's be
honest how many of you people are really
using your watch that much like no one I
don't think I don't think there's a
single person out there maybe you can
call in 1 800 what is that a number on
you remember number 61 62 63 8 okay
beautiful yeah that was people you can
also email us at the apple byte at cnet
com I want to know if it bothered you
that os/2 didn't come out watch os/2
didn't come out it's fine we're gonna
wait you're gonna get your animated
wallpapers I still am going to be the
judge to see if loading native apps on
your watch how much it's going to make a
difference especially how much data will
it still take from your phone to bring
in you know refresh the content we'll
see i'm so used to not using apps on my
phone on my watch anymore that it
doesn't really matter to me how many
sexin seconds does it take for an app to
open know some of them will take 10 to
13 seconds no joke that is in the water
nity the watch feels like an intention
to yourself that the the watch face will
actually timeout before the appt
reloading that bad and then what happens
when it times out does then you
like reef flip your wrist or touch the
screen to bring it back up then you have
to unlock the screen and then the apps
there and you're like why did I even do
what I didn't use this for this that's
funny this precise know this has no
benefit to me whatsoever anyways we'll
find out Apple hasn't officially
released when told us when they're going
to re not rerelease just release watch
os/2 so we'll be waiting it's got to be
pretty soon i'm guessing within the week
and then just another quick software
point itunes 12.3 arrives they fix some
bugs the background that we pretty much
won't see that much but the big issue
here is they've added two factor
authentication to kind of verify who you
are not only through just like a
password prompt but your phone as well
that allows you to be safer where
whatever you're making purchases on the
itunes store which is a good thing that
is good for that just do it it's not a
big deal um we kind of want to show you
also because we're waiting for the
iphone 6s and they are pictures of the
iphone 6s packaging we've kind of seen
some leaked out but they on the blogs
and on the internets they have a kind of
a arrangement of all four packages I'm
you know what sticks out to me is that
there's only one there's only one black
iphone now yeah like that is weird all
white we get a racial here but it's like
black I phones matter like the reason
why I'm not getting any color other any
I'll first of all don't I don't want
rose gold no but how cool would have
been to make a black iphone with gold
won't they make like a navy dark blue
one or something a black gold that would
be awesome would be sick yeah be like
Run DMC and said they put a white on it
again this garbage man that is garbage
black I phones matter I'm just rose gold
here looks come on e I don't like that
it looks like a fish that is paying cook
a salmon that is salmon looks like
salmon examine its pink man this is
stupid pink alright um other products
that we can't wait to see developers are
now receiving their Apple TV units for
testing purposes at WWDC
they had a lottery for people who heard
ivette devs that wanted to obviously
build their apps on the platform some of
those devs are now receiving their kits
it only cost them one dollar for
shipping they're obviously bragging
about it and rubbing it in our faces by
saying look at my new apple TV blah blah
blah so there you go it's out in the
wild but some of these developers are
gonna have an issue I don't know if you
um how much you gotta seen this story
Steven but did you hear about what
they're doing with the remotes and the
controller thing yeah and I saw like an
article that said this remote is gonna
take down the ps3 and xbox that's like
what it's the definites crazy so what
Apple did is at the keynote at their
September announcement they talked about
how it will support third-party
controllers which is awesome because of
us do these m-phy controls that are
pretty much an Xbox controller
third-party work with games so you're
going to really be able to create and
play a lot more complex games but then
Apple just recently reverse their
decision and said the minimum
requirement is that it all it has to be
able to function on the apple remote
this new Siri remote and it can also
work on these third-party controllers
hmm that's so that's lewd that is
horrible like you can't limit it you
can't build the same games on an xbox
ps4 style controller versus what you can
on that Siri remote yeah no way and it
just would it would feel different it's
just different yeah so that's that
that's that yeah you also need the
rumble you know you need to you need the
vibration of the vibration fade by you
need all that stuff need all that good
stuff so Apple is reversed that as well
and then just a quick footnote the ipad
mini 4 people are starting to kind of
break them apart it really got a two
second mention the keynote we're gonna
be talking about it longer than Apple
even did at the keynote but the tear
downs confirm it has now a smaller
battery it has an a8 processor and 2
gigs of ram it's basically an ipad air 2
shrunken down to size okay so there you
go that's why it was not friend center
at the apple event right there yeah it
was like it was like a mention oh yeah
we got this really
they showed they didn't even talk about
they showed their breakdown of all the
iPads and it was just the corner there
and they're like oh yeah we got new iPad
Mini yeah just just a legend now minor
upgrade to minor minor okay um we
because last week there was like a zoo
here and we have some guests as well we
forgot to do our force touch contest yes
now we do want to mention that although
Apple calls it 3d touch they still still
refer to it as force touch oh yeah okay
I was like putting on background music
for it force touch contest but yeah we
have evidence we have visual and audio
evidence to back up the to back up this
fact this is great send it on its way to
the trash so of course force touch our
free d touches in there's a good catch
there is y'all like cotton mouth yeah
like right I was like for superstition
what it was like Tim Cook was remotely
doing like the death grip yeah he was
doing the Vader grip and course force
touch are freely touches in you almost
choked on himself homeboy almost freaked
out Craig federighi almost choked on
himself anyways we still wanted to show
you the love because you guys you know
added value to this show our force touch
contest we're going to show you the five
entries we got talk about them really
quickly for people that are listening we
won't dwell on them too long and then we
have our society moment of which one we
like right yeah so I actually put the
one that we kind of already mutually
decided on to be last okay good so
here's number one which features mr. Tim
Cook Dewey um do can you see the names
that are on the files that I put there
at alone if not it's ok and I can James
Ellis this is from James Ellis all right
it's a picture of your face ominous face
with the star wars the force touch
awakens logo on top of it in our heaters
ninth of September very scary number two
was from Jay Jason let me have to look
at the display name Jason sand it all
right yeah Jason sand it this is good
one like that I've had yep it's an ipad
with the star wars the force touch
awakens again we have
like Apple watches on there with Chewie
and Leia and Luke okay it's pretty good
neighbors this one is from Mike let me
look at the display Mike one minor
Moines are Mulder Molnar okay yeah it
looks like it i Luke am older Luke
molnar this like this one this one looks
like an apple ad yeah it looks like one
of those detailed stat sheets that you
find on their website Vader's like
controlling an iphone remotely there's
like a find my droid for spool like icon
is really cool that is cool push away
notifications this was actually pretty
good that one is good this one's after
studying a little yeah sure I'm liking
this one I am kind of like a wrong with
you and this is the one that we chose as
the winner the winner winner chicken
dinner Dennis or I'm sorry Daniel I'm
have ever taken melon a mr. Daniel
cattaneo cattaneo iphone 6s now with
Forrest touch it's just Vader with a big
super long I slope looks like a paddle
like he's gonna paddle some we gonna
whack somebody but you're right that is
awesome man okay yes I do feel like the
other one was better now I know I know
maybe we should give them both the prize
I'll work on it Luke and Daniel maybe
let's have that let's have everyone at
home boat actually really okay so this
is what you guys can do you can help us
by telling us which one you think is the
winner send us your emails to the apple
byte at cnet com or just call us and
we'll just we'll just pull it yeah we'll
just pull it my chat on my periscopes
down so I can't see anything it doesn't
matter okay so there's the florist touch
contest and we just had a few more side
stories before we wrap up this one
probably the most relevant to many
people AT&amp;amp;T is changing how they're
throttling unlimited unlimited data
customers who have been grandfathered in
this is a big deal like this surprise me
I didn't even think this was real this
is a hallelujah moment oh that's exactly
what I tweeted hallelujah hallelujah
really so funny man oh absolutely so
their date their unlimited data plan
for a while was once you hit five gigs
five gigs is like nothing five gigs is
nothing it takes a while to get there
though especially when you're streaming
stuff yes still it's like nothing so the
original plan was five gigs of data they
would start throttling down your speed
and also if you're in congested areas
okay they have now increased that
unlimited data kind of a threshold to 22
gigs now yes some of the ears are
bleeding but it's not it's not mine
that's all good we just got to do it um
so yeah that's good that's a big deal
yeah I used to get all these text
messages from AT&amp;amp;T when I was at three
point seven five gigabytes yeah exactly
hey we're sending you a warning that if
you get 25 we're gonna start throttling
you and I were just immediately in my
head i'll just be like wait that's
limiting my unlimited data it was always
unlimited unlimited yes i was very
frustrating and I'm when I heard I heard
Bridget Carey do this on CNN update
yesterday I was like yes if you're gonna
get those messages anymore it feels more
unlimited yet limited yeah because you
definitely felt no this is the slow down
I would get it in around the end of the
month I would get it like two to three
hearing somebody I have a slingbox I
watch a lot of NBA basketball when I'm
on the go yeah and it was like what yeah
super annoying this is awesome that's
great great that's that's great Thank
You AT&amp;amp;T I might stick with you that
might be the motor stick with you in the
first times in my life that I'm actually
like happy about what a cell phone
carrier did it but the funny thing about
is it was something that we should have
had in the first place exactly and I
know there's many lawsuits yeah there
are people who felt the same thing that
we should they're like let's just
increase it to cover our butts yeah just
in case this comes and gets us back
people never get there 22 gigs no way no
way 22 gigs is pretty hard to do over
mobile you just have to be looking at
your phone constantly for like
constantly streaming look like video
yeah this YouTube video specifically
okay Apple cars we know it's a big deal
we know they're there we know they're
coming up all reports say they're coming
in 2020 reports of surfaced that Apple
is actually working on
a new and a better be advanced mapping
technology at a research and development
center in loon Sweden Sweden so they had
an acquisition of c3 technologies that
kind of helped to integrate their 3d
flyover maps at at the time everyone's
like oh cool 3d flyover it's a cool
presentation feature you're never gonna
use it with your friends and then we all
know about the maps debacle and we know
how Scott Forstall was pushed out and we
know how Apple maps is still behind
Google Maps and we'll quite honestly
always be behind Google Maps but they're
working on a they're working on
something they just got they just got
transportation like buses in subway know
like last week you know they sent us a
memo right right did you get that there
was actually like an alert that's yeah
guys now includes public transportation
I'm like oh awesome thanks because I sty
I'm never gonna switch from google maps
sorry so we have that but then the also
other kind of fun nugget here is from a
report from The Guardian that reports
that apple meat has recently met with
California DMV officials to discuss a
self-driving car basically their
executives met at the california
department of motor vehicles they met
with let's see here self the department
self-driving car experts bernard Soriano
DMV deputy director and Stephanie
daughtrey chief of strategic planning
there are all co-sponsors of
California's autonomous vehicle
regulation project a lot of these rules
and laws that are going to be put in
place people believe will end up
becoming the NAT the nationwide standard
for autonomous vehicles this is still
very early but think about this apple's
talking to the DMV how long has google
been actually developing and working on
these things they have a fleet they're
on the road every day if you drive
around the mountain view area palo alto
mountain view there around my
neighborhood now everywhere you see that
you see them yeah we know Apple has been
throwing out their own kind of apple
vans but we know who's ahead in this
game definitely Google because I mean
they already had Jerry Brown signed the
legislation to allow self-driving cars
in California and those big historical
moment and we're totally lucky that we
live in California hell yeah where we're
going to have cars
driving us around we'd have to do
anything we can sit and drink his
hangouts yeah drink be merry be
happy just chill just chillax also
recent reports say Google is ramping up
their self-driving vehicle production
they're not going to put them on sale
publicly yet there it's going to be
privatized right now so it's not like
you can go out and buy one in the next
few years but this whole self driving
car thing the fact that like you said we
got to see this phenomena as it grows
and builds and as it happens and yeah
will pretty much be one of the first
exposed to it in a normal living context
that's exciting it's very exciting none
I can't wait it's super cool so there
you go that's what's going on with Apple
in their cars they're playing catch-up
but it's to me it's weird that I get the
idea of Apple doing a car but doing a
self dry us you know autonomous vehicle
self-driving car yeah seems like wow now
you're really like I don't want to say
desperate it seems a little desperate
like just work on your own car yeah p
with Tesla so they're doing a regular
car in a self-driving car yeah I mean I
mean I wonder if there would be like if
it's gonna be a regular car with an
autonomous upgrade or something you know
what I'm saying cuz yes it seems weird
for them just to make the leap straight
to autonomy have no they have no driving
experience in the field they're hiring a
lot of people from Tesla from general
motors from all different fields but I'm
maybe you know what it is they probably
need their self driving cars for their
campus comes to be so damn yes the
cameras I people will get lost they
don't know where to go yeah it keeps
wanderers or right away from like the
top secret areas that's what it could be
for it's gonna be a weird day when a car
drives up to us and tells us you can't
be here get off the apple campus get off
my lawn get off also um one quick
footnote at the end for Apple fans quite
honestly I'm gonna check it out because
it's in my parents backyard in cupertino
Apple is reopening their headquarters
their company store the only store it's
on campus and it sells Apple merchandise
so like Robert Scott cool pens watches
they actually had an apple watch before
the Apple watch was the Apple
why yeah so this is on campus it's
called a company store I'm gonna go
check it out it's at ten a.m. tomorrow
and Saturday oh nice the main thing
that's going to be different about this
is this is a reportedly going to be the
first store that is completely designed
by jony ive oh wow so it's going to have
its allegedly supposed to have his
design influence he's the head of all
design apple corporate period so it's
supposed to have a fingerprint on it
might be a preview of what we might see
in future Apple stores I don't know I'm
gonna find out probably scope it just
see what's going let us know if when you
walk through the door his voice like
welcomes you welcome to the apple store
hello Steven welcome welcome welcome to
the apple store we've identified you buy
the iphone you have in your pocket
welcome Steve please enjoy the mentioned
dice he there they also will be selling
actual apple products there in the past
they they had some computers but they're
gonna be doing everything for my pads
two watches so there's going to be not
only branded merchandise but actual
products there tomorrow tenia I hope
there's not a line oh there's gonna be a
line you sir you can count on a line man
telling me like what okay what time do
you think I should go there though man
it opens at 10am I'd get there like play
nine yeah I was even thinking like 830
yeah you know would be cool is if they
have like retro apple shirts like stuff
like if i go through apple mouse if i go
at eight thirty and sit on the damn
concrete as a grown man for a company
store I mean I've have to go put up a
tent I just want to go there just to
report on it honestly like yeah I think
it's gonna be great you're gonna shoot
some video so yeah all my own gonna hand
hold it okay gonna do anything for Cena
like post anything on you do post up
maybe I'll know bring me back some
footage we don't like employees just
randomly having access to our suggestion
posting videos hmm pondering wondering
all right guys very inside baseball
