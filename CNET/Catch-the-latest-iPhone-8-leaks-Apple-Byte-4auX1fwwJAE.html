the Apple bite for everything good and
bad inside the world of Apple let's get
to the show and we start with the iPhone
but not the iPhone eight rumors we're
talking about the original iPhone now
the next iPhone will celebrate its 10th
anniversary and iOS chief Scott Forstall
who was fired after the whole Apple Maps
Tabaco remember that he gave a rare
interview at the Computer History Museum
in Mountain View where he talked about
how the iPhone came to be and it's not
really what you expect the iPhone had a
very circuitous route by itself it began
because Steve hated this guy at
Microsoft that that is the actual origin
of it and it wasn't built cuz he was
tarted to like be old by this point uh
and he came back one time after seeing
this guy and that guy was talking about
how Microsoft had Saul computing it
solves like net uh
like a laptop computer or they were
going to do laptop or tablet computing
and they're gonna do with pens and he
just like shoved in Steve's face the way
they were going to like rule the world
with their new tablets with their pens
and Steve came in on Monday and and
there was a set of expletives uh and and
then it was like let's show them how
it's really done
it's like the first thing is they're
idiots you don't use a stylus you know
it's cumbersome you lose it you're
always like picking it up and putting it
down you were born with ten styluses yep
that sounds like the SJ we know forced
all said originally before the iPhone
was ever discussed Steve Jobs wanted a
tablet with capacitive touch and
multi-touch I remember one of the first
demos of this you walked into a room
there's a giant giant table there's a
projector on the ceiling and you can
like you see a photo or something on on
the table and you can move your finger
around the table and it would move the
photo super cool wouldn't fit in you
know your your bathroom much less your
pocket or your your you know baguette I
guess let's have
it uh but the moment you saw that you
knew this was the way to go like that
was that was cool now in another cool
nugget he said the iPhone came about
when he was eating lunch with jobs and
they noticed everyone around them using
their phone and Steve said do you think
we could take that demo we're doing with
the tablet and multi-touch and shrink it
down to something big enough or small
enough to fit in your pocket could be a
phone size with that same touch
technology so I went back to the design
team and and they they took and carved
out a little corner of it and made this
very simple demo pretty sure his boss
who did it and bosses is one of the best
and he made saying it was a a simple
list of names and you would with your
finger you would drag along and probably
add the rubber banding at all I'm just
magical you dragged along and you tap on
a name and it would slide across and
reveal the card so phone number email
you tap on a phone number I would say
calling wasn't calling wasn't doing
anything but it said calling uh the
second you saw this demo you knew this
was a future there was no question this
is the way that a phone had to behave
Steve saw it and said okay put the
tablet on hold let's build a phone now
there's plenty more from the interview
that you can check out on the computer
History Museum's facebook page or
youtube channel with lots of other great
stuff there ok let's get to the latest
iPhone 8 chatter Reuters reports
component orders for the iPhone 8 are
creating shortages of DRAM and NAND
chips worldwide making it difficult for
competitors to secure their own supplies
LG has been forced to push orders
through earlier by month and component
shortages are responsible for limiting
the production of the Nintendo switch so
all of you Nintendo switch fans still
waiting for yours you could blame Apple
now the demand is expected to exceed
supply until sometime in 2018 and Sony
is also prioritizing orders from Apple
for their camera sensors as well ok do
you want to see more purported iPhone
parts I know you do the leakers are back
at it again with more shots of the front
panel
I'm from Benjamin Gaskin and even a
video clip from slash leaks with the
iPhone cutouts for the front-facing
camera and other sensors like an ambient
light proximity and a potential 3d
sensing module maybe the final design
will be different but it would look so
much cleaner to make that a single black
bar across the top I don't think I'm the
only one who wants that either
and even website MacRumors has hints of
the purported iPhone 8 showing up in
their web analytics for specific devices
also running iOS 11 you know with
September just around the corner all
right you know who's really tired of all
these leaks Apple in fact Apple had an
internal briefing for its employees
called stopping leakers keeping
confidential at Apple how do we know
this well a recording from it was leaked
online by the website the outline hah
you just can't make this stuff up the
briefing was held for around 100
employees lasted for about an hour and
was led by Apple's best security and
communications experts now when leaks
occur they hunt down the sources to
relay that info back to Apple
headquarters the briefing also revealed
that in 2016 more leaks had come from
Apple's own campuses versus the supply
chain whose screening of workers is even
more intense than the TSA wait hold on a
second
my phone just went off in yeah that's
another story about leaked iPhone 8
parts ok let's run through some quick
bytes we showed you some AR KITT demos
last week but I'm stoked about this one
IKEA is building an AR app of their own
for AR kit that will let customers
choose the IKEA product they want to see
and how it looks in their room before
it's purchased the app will support
between 500 to 600 products at launch
and guess what emoji update Unicode 10
has beneficial e released with 56 new
emojis that will likely be coming to iOS
later this year possibly in an iOS 11.1
update since they most likely won't make
it in time for iOS 11 so get ready for
puke-face vampire and a fortune cookie
and takeout box are coming soon ok let's
turn back the clock and go back to the
days of the Sega Genesis some of you
watching right now we're not even alive
back then the Sega forever collection is
coming to
and Android starting this week or you
can play classic games like Sonic the
Hedgehog altered beasts or fantasy star
11 for free with ads or just two bucks
to get rid of them now new titles will
be added every two weeks they'll support
iOS game controllers and will come with
iMessage sticker packs stay with me now
say it check out and before we leave I
just want to throw this to the Apple buy
nation for their tweet of the week Chad
M tweeted me with what do you think
great gift for the wife don't do a bro
do not do it alright that's it for this
week's show you can email us at the
Apple by that cnet.com or tweet me at
Brian Tong base what you're watching

of the Apple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
