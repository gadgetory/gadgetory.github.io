cylindrical own work no matter where you
are
that sounds really appetizing
cylindrical omelets I'm sorry it's not
omelets were too flat the beauty of this
is that the way that the omelet actually
comes out is quite remarkable but and
what do you mean by remarkable yolks
okay I can't wait right now we take some
nonstick cooking spray yeah don't forget
this into the chamber and now I just
poured it yep the light is green so it's
ready to go
alrighty so how long do we wait we wait
about six minutes okay
and so it started frizzing up it doesn't
look that appetizing it looks like a sea
cucumber pooping see this is a little
inconvenient you know what do you do
when the egg rises you hold it up and
give it an encouragement you know I
always wanted my eggs to look like this
I know you did yeah Oh all wrinkly hood
okay I'm gonna I'm just gonna remove it
now I guess that's the only thing that
we can do at this point all that's left
to do here it is so you you think this
way I feel like you should have the
first taste keep it classy
how's it taste the texture is different
okay oh wow it's like rising oh it's a
huge section it's like don't forget
about me yeah well then there's
definitely more cut like biggest
surprise yeah we heard you like eggs
soon we brought you more I think now it
means it's ready okay this one is this
was just a trial a little different Wow
the ending is a little presented a
little bit more better a little better
all right pepper I'll eat this one okay
when you do this okay yeah thanks taking
one for the team okay
so I just I'm just concerned that it is
it just needs a new coat so you know
it's on the TV okay it's cooked it's
cooked you know that ladies and
gentlemen
that's our standard here as long as it's
it's let's you know it gets an a-plus on
coach it gets an F on plating
yeah and appearances
is awful yeah but I mean it did what it
said it would do which is you know cook
an egg and in a cylindrical shape and
pump it up okay we don't pull it out
yeah let it let it do its thing you know
so grower not a shower</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
