couple tenths out there oh my god well
San Francisco we have like the Chinese
black market where people like going
line by them and they're like seldom
second hand um you have that element in
San Francisco but we wanted to show you
guys just to get a scope and yes people
still are waiting in line they enjoy the
spectacle of the iphone launches in
store I mean I like
waking up at midnight and ordering it
from my phone I don't know about you
beach what did you do I haven't ordered
it yet actually I'm thinking about going
into a store and doing it in person
eventually but not in a dip soon yeah
not today for sure yeah I mean there's
there's no rush for you right you don't
you don't really care it's you want to
do it but it's like life though her
phone is like falling apart like her
scream is coming apart its sure Syria
doesn't taught or you can't hear Syria
anymore and stuff like her phone is
breaking so where she is she wants to
get down there ASAP so uh if you want to
avoid the zoo we did want to show you
kind of a bit of the zoo there's
pictures from around the world I think
there's a video from Apple Insider of
the action that was happening outside
the New York store right yeah this is in
New York later today yeah it looks like
a party the Apple employees are standing
in a row and people are running through
the row of Apple employees it's kind of
hard to get a shock there's so much
media there it was all high stakes are
up in paris eiffel what are you gonna do
it I'm still fascinated how the lines
are still really long especially in New
York I mean I know there's it's one of
the most densely populated cities I mean
I can't imagine everyone there was there
to use the iphone upgrade program
because that's the only thing that you
can you know you can do it in store no
it's like an event you know it's like a
rock event now there's the girl who
bought the first one with the blonde
flowing curly hair she reminds me of
keri russell ish uh yeah definitely
right right she got that vibe going on
anyways you know there's pictures from
around the world Sydney we hit what Hong
Kong China South anniversary Sydney is
technically the first place so uh
there's a guy his name was Vitor and he
put his hands up in victory I really
hope that's not his greatest achievement
in life I'm just hoping that people
think there's more to life than that I
know but I don't even have my phone I
don't have my belt like actually this is
my iphone 6s guys you can even tell the
difference you can't tell the difference
I'm just gonna show it to you like that
um so just you know there's there's the
kind of
view overall consensus and I mean it's a
lot of stuff that we have talked about
and I kept on same people three touches
more than just a long press it's going
it's a game-changer to me people are
starting to really see that they're like
the most the reviewers are saying how 3d
touch is so different it's a new UI they
dig it and then everyone of course loves
the camera on the phone oh yeah yeah I'm
excited about the camera you know 4k
it's gonna look super slick man there
was even this a group I think their name
is a riot but it's spelled ry OT org
they shot the first documentary with the
4k camera and they attach different lens
to it and they even put it on a drone to
shoot like a documentary face it based
on what's the documentary called oh my
gosh I found their page right here yeah
it's it's a documentary about um like a
city where people from Haiti during the
earthquakes they basically went there
for the refugees who have to like live
and you know those those kind of set up
homes and it's about a guy who was pain
in the neighborhood and making the homes
look unique and but they shot this
documentary about this man that brought
kind of charm and some vitality to this
area with just the fact that he decided
to paint these buildings oh the picture
of Jill Uzi yeah Jill Uzi sorry I
couldn't remember it off the top of my
head so it's something just you have to
imagine this is all shot purely on an
iphone success with its 4k recording it
it's just insane how far technology has
advanced you know yeah yeah there's this
show on Vice called the business of life
and they did a thing where they
interviewed a bunch of like big movie
studio producers and directors now like
how do you guys feel about directors
making movies on iPhones you know in
saving thousands of dollars and they're
like oh people are gonna do it people
are gonna take these tools and use them
and make incredible stuff out of it so
you know it's very interesting it's it's
really cool I think it's just
fascinating it just you know technology
in the way it's so much more accessible
i remember back in the day when i was
going to school and like to even get a
prosumer level camry how to spend over
3,000 bucks like that's great you know
it's fun super funny is the last Apple
event that we did we have we always have
a live shot out in front of the
full of out in front of the apple event
it was this time it was at bill graham
civic memorial so we had an iphone
skyping us the video so that we can put
up a live shot from outside the event
you know that's how we always do things
when we do these life events and sell so
one of our cameraman he's like a very
macho brazilian camera guy big guy big
guy big guy huge buff guy right and all
the other news cameramen were giving him
crap cuz they're like what is that cab
or you got there man i was at you
shootin this with an iphone he was like
totally embarrassed yeah it was I mean
he had his fun of money he had an on an
industrial-sized tripod yeah mounted but
it looked flawless it looked flawless
yeah the picture came back it was it was
perfect it looked beautiful we heard the
sound so you know what I say don't hate
the player hate the game yeah I say okay
don't hate the player so uh you know 3d
touch being the bagel feature with this
new phone we decided you know we'd like
to have fun with people so we wanted to
give some of that back to you guys who
are listening we asked people on the
street what what if they knew what 3d
touches because you know everyone throws
up these marketing terms these phrases
so um I don't know if you have the video
cued up each bud ready should we do
let's let people listen to this thing
what's up guys brian Tong here with my
feet on the street the iphone success is
coming out so we asked people on the
street what is 3d touch well what it
sounds like is you touch it and it pops
out of the screen 3d touch ah i have no
idea with 3d touches the heart you press
it changes the behavior i check out this
3d touch just pretty cool you know you
adapt it to your phone and it goes on
your wrist and it opens up stuff like
briefly when you press it the app opens
different options before you open the
entire app they could open your phone
without actually touching it I don't
know
sort of weird 3d interaction you keep it
it says oh maybe like the buttons look
like they're phrased it just means that
you can touch your phone really good you
can press certain buttons to make
different things happen either
superficially you can get deeper it does
all kinds of good stuff when you just
touch it oh no you know something might
pop up out of there you know it's the
little feature or something you know I
don't know I'm expecting like a hologram
to come out of your phone and you can
touch it well you can now interact with
apps using a downstate you could press
harder on the screen and it does things
you would probably somehow pop out at
you how would you best describe 3d touch
um events gestures so different type
sensitivities for different gesture
layers you'll hide in my ig pics in my
facebook post and i think it's i guess
you see an image you touch it and kind
of animates itself kind of like a Harry
Potter newspaper it's like where your
finger has like the pressure-sensitive
things and looks really cool for like
gaming it's when you like hold down the
screen and things pop up and you don't
have to it saves you like to click so
your finger is less stressed no I no
clue whatsoever futuristic digital
output on top of your screen that's good
awesome tell you I phone for doing this
I wish I could anyone come on home gurl
asked for an iphone after that she's
crazy what's she thinking she I don't
know you should like that's cool anyways
for the most part people are pretty good
but it's just fun to like CB we'll try
and figure it out there like I have no
idea what's going on yeah it is a tough
name to really get your head around
three force 3d torch for ya used to be
forced now 3d touch all right um so
anyways I hope you guys all love your
iphone 6s is that you have and I don't
at this moment I come sunday i will have
mine unless steven takes it out of my
office it's safe it's safely in your
office it's just stuck to its I'm not
gonna tell you it's tucked away
somewhere ourselves some someone that
someone's gonna try and steal it alright
we just wanted to talk about this I mean
not so great news but also apple is
addressing it over the past we
there were some apps that were basically
had malware installed in them that made
it into apple's app store this happened
a little less than a week ago basically
what happened is that when Apple
releases Xcode to the public their
servers get hammered so what happened is
that a different version of xcode called
xcode ghost as its so affectionately
named was released as well at the same
time a lot of people didn't know that it
was you know a compromised version of
xcode essentially and so people because
they're lazy wanted to download xcode
from a different site they instead
accidentally downloaded xcode ghost then
when they build their apps it had this
malware in it that got into the App
Store that potentially could steal your
personal information you know location
things of that nature now the good thing
is that all reports say it didn't happen
apps have been now cleaned out of the
store they've been able able to identify
it but everyone's some people are like
how could have to let something like
this happen and to me quite honestly it
failed in two steps but right off the
bat developers went to a random site to
download xcode to build their apps so it
was the developers just kind of being
impatient yeah i'm trying to get ya up
first huh that's what they did that was
the first step that was bad but then
fact that i got into the apple store
right and they weren't able to basically
bet it because it was it still looked
like oh these wraps made in xcode but
that wasn't the case so most of the apps
originated from my friends in China of
course of course they're the ones that
are doing this crap we chat is actually
a very popular global chatting type you
know messaging app that one has been
fixed right all they had to do is
basically rebuild their apps with an
updated version of xcode put them
through the store and the malware's gone
so according to like some security firms
approximately you know we know there's
millions of apps on the store but
approximately like 4,000 apps have been
affected but really there's maybe a list
of 25 that were the most popular that
people actually really use and then
those have been taking down as well as
the other ones that have been bounced so
it's it's a to prompt Lulu how fast as
they move on that
like like what was the time frame on
this I'm from based on how the timetable
of everything happened once we heard
about it Apple pretty much started
reacting to it and taking them down like
with within 24 hours easily oh wow it
was a really fast turnaround so you know
they they figured it out but they claim
that no personal data ended up being
leaked and the malware that was in these
apps no one like flip the switch to say
okay start collecting this stuff that's
good so everyone safe it's a little it's
a little scare but you know when
everyone kind of touts like oh we're the
most secure app store blah blah blah
everything can get hacked I don't to
tell that type of stuff it just silly to
me you know yeah I mean it sounds like
they're like on the ball with that and
they took care of it ASAP which is which
is good get it get it ASAP ah cuz I
every we all dodged a bullet with that
absolutely all right absolutely I'm a
Thrall maponya all right just a quick
thing apple also release an update to
iOS it's nine-point-oh point one they
fix some bugs yeah the thing they didn't
do freaking I don't know if you know
this people brought this to my attention
I'm like this is lame but if you have an
iPad and you use apples podcast app and
if you subscribe to excellent video
podcasts like the apple byte or the
apple byte extra crunchy you there's no
way to watch the video podcast full
screen right now in iOS 9 are you
kidding feet there's no button there's
no button that expands at full screen on
an iPad right now that is that is a
major mistake and they did this update
on my own maybe they'll fix it they
didn't fix it and then someone's like
someone wrote me he's like here here's a
fix go into the accessibility options
and then you know there's like
three-finger swipe that you can use to
zoom in and it's a temporary fix but the
bottom line is Apple still hasn't put a
button just to make that video
fullscreen so it's like takes up one
third of your screen it's so stupid so
would that have to be an update with the
operating system overall or can they
just update that app by itself I got
imagine they'd stopped update the app
but it was it was part of you know it's
the latest version of the app
that was I OS not and it comes built in
with iOS 9 right yeah automatically
exactly Wow okay wait that deserves a
hug but what does it hurt wait hold on
hold on I got a deserved a bat Wow I
mean that's you know like the podcast
app is my bread and butter that's what
I'm saying that's what I I help manage
that well you know all the cnet's
podcast feed so that is important for
you and me that's that's trouble this
big trouble little china qui are quite
quite are you know are you male you and
I might be doing this in my garage next
week yeah that's why actually we could
we actually really you guys you almost
secondly are why don't you just walk
down the garage right now I don't want
to do that I don't want to do that all
right um so we got through all that um
apples also shown off we know that
developers that kind of sign up for this
lottery got access to the apple TV like
a developer version i fix it has decided
to tear it apart just kind of show us
what's inside of it there's no kind of
big surprise here we know that there's a
larger hey chip inside there's a lot I'm
not larger there's an a8 processor
inside you know previously found in the
earlier iPhones there's a larger
heatsink they use the same memory
controller that can be found in the
retina macbooks from 2015 so that's kind
of interesting as well some of those
different components but also because
the developer kid is out apple released
the second beta of the apple TV OS for
developers and so a couple new things
kind of popped out of that Steve
trounced myth who's a developer oh wow I
heard a ding in my ear but it's not
sorry I got distracted did you hear that
day I did hear that too i don't think it
was me either no it's me how do i turn
that off I can't forget or whatever
anyways of the TV OS does two things now
the old apple remote still actually
works the new Apple TV which means
there's an IR port on there which means
someone who does those universal remotes
for the home theater they're gonna be
good to go like you could essentially
reprogram it so that it works with the
new Apple TV which people didn't know
that oh that's awesome that's pretty
sweet
all about having one remote man oh yeah
hell yeah and then the other cool thing
is that with this new Siri remote when
you you know in the past you have to
press a button for the apple TV to start
up but if it's in sleep mode instead of
you pressing the button supposedly when
you pick up the remote it should sense
it and then automatically turn on oh
that's pretty cool let's make life a
little easier for you you know yeah they
should do that for the wii remote please
thank you you still play wii oh hell
yeah with your goods oh yeah totally and
then about what controls your TV just
like the Apple this that what they're
talking about the apple thing yep so
it's really easy to get around amazon
youtube all that stuff's on there you
know what about wii tennis man oh we
tennis they still playing that hell yeah
you are I'm talking actually I was
talking about the wii u remote i'm sorry
but yeah i still have wii too and I play
Wii tennis with my son so you have a wii
u I really don't know many people that
actually bought the wii u do yeah I love
it I love it I use it all the time
amazon netflix youtube games you know
all that stuff so it's so you do you
have a you don't have a ps4 you have a
wii u i have a ps3 and wii u i have
every nintendo console that was ever
made your nintendo guys are amazing see
there you go that but now now it all
comes together it's starting to make
sensor but i have the ps4 and I'm not
looking to upgrade to the or I'm sorry
the ps3 and I'm not looking to upgrade
to the ps4 because I just have too many
I don't that's the wrong answer the ps4
is amazing dude well here's the question
can i play the new batman on the ps3 no
okay then I'm gonna have to buy the ps4
that's out of that that that discussion
has been resolved Santa Claus oh wow
this is listening this is Beecham Santa
Claus we know what we know mrs. Claus
gonna get that broom can help him out
yeah honey okay voila okay so check out
this story this is kind of like gossipy
I like this stuff okay so Aaron Sorkin
you know behind the Newsies amazing West
Wing newsroom what what else has he got
under his belt oh the the social network
the facebook movie so good yeah that
movie surprised surprised me so much
what um which one's social
my god david fincher's the director you
can't get david fincher man and his
Aaron Sorkin and him riding together
what they're doing another one right oh
I think so i can't remember though what
did you do you know cover it I don't
know but who did the Steve Jobs when did
Aaron Sorkin right that Terrace for that
Aaron Sorkin wrote the Steve Jobs will
be played home wasn't Fincher that
direct yeah cuz I look like doesn't look
like a pitcher can't remember off the
top of my head who directed it but uh um
I should I should know this I was just
talking about like last week I'm just
brain farting but anyways so this is a
great thing okay so recently Tim Cook
was on The Late Show with Stephen
Colbert and in it they were time out of
variety of issues but he also mentioned
how he felt that filmmakers were being
opportunistic by creating movies you
know biopics of steve jobs because
there's been two already one with ashton
kutcher that terrible hope I mean the
trailer was like I'm never I could have
done a better job out of my bathroom
dude okay it's bad there's also another
recent one that sheds show Steve Jobs
and kind of not as good of a light as
well it was kind of more a tremor my
documentary though right like a stripper
doc that one just recently came out
there's so many I can't remember what
that one was called but this new one
that is coming out October ninth that is
called Steve Jobs Tim Cook was basically
you know just because Steve Jobs was his
homeboy his friend and also the guy who
basically gave him the Apple the company
to run he said he felt people were being
opportunistic about making all these
movies and making money about this but
then Aaron Sorkin okay fires back at Tim
Cook and says nobody did this movie to
get rich secondly Tim Cook should really
see the movie before he decides what it
is now here we go third if you've got a
Factory full of children in china
assembling phones for seventeen cents an
hour you've got a lot of nerve calling
someone else opportunistic oh that's
heavy man dude that is heavy he's like
oh wait let me take the gloves off now
yeah let me take the gloves off let's go
that's for that's for real right there I
was like wow and that's that's a great
pool
wait man it is a great one edit I did
great out that every now and then you
know it's like this sad state of affairs
it's like you think about it and it's
sad and it's horrible and then you do
know how like other countries have
different you know basically cultures
and countries that live differently than
us but it's bad but then at the same
time that's why we're able to have these
crazy toys you have to at least be
socially aware of it you know well not
just it's not just the lazy boys that we
have it's like it's also created an
entire industry that's employed millions
of people you know and in starting new
industries too so it's such a
double-edged sword it's hard to get on
on either side you know we're grown up
so at least we understand the dynamics
at play you know what I'm saying yeah
where's like you know some of the young
kids are like do my phones dope I don't
care who made this thing you know yeah
he's got to care a little bit so I am on
the two and a half year it's part of it
I mean that is part of it like you know
I heard the story from cnet that was um
fifty percent of all the wildlife in the
ocean has died in the last 40 years or
something right and then there was
another story the same week that was
like there's more devices on the planet
than there are human beings right now
it's which is mind-blowing you think
about it right and that's that does make
sense but that is insane so it kind of
like got me on this thing like I don't
want to get a new phone every year okay
yeah I I can't say that I agree with you
there but it's tough it's a tough call
but I'm the fur I'm number one ocean
lover man oh my gosh I mean I yeah but
it's the you know the phone the whole
phone thing that is not tied to the
oceans it's just high demand being yeah
how we humans are housed in books we are
like locusts that seek and destroy and
only care about ourselves you know like
oh there's a good piece of property over
there let's go grab it just rip things
out of it rip all than the resources out
of it that we can you know you know that
some buildings on it that's an
unbelievably beautiful Segway that you
just set up unintentionally because
Stephen I
got to tell you so first of all to kick
this off we know there was a report
recently from The Wall Street Journal
that Apple is pretty much fast-tracking
to make it a top priority to build and
potentially ship their Apple car concept
that they've been investigating over the
past year in 2019 okay so this is where
this pig dovetails to what you said and
we'll go back to the car apple recently
has decided to buy a north san jose land
a plot of land in north san jose from
166 million dollars Wow to build
facilities and offices it's a 27-acre
site right off of highway 101 in the
moon California so like you said sweep
up the land make means yeah I mean that
I understand because that's in the
middle of a giant industry you know um
but uh that is crate like San Jose is
becoming the place for car manufacturers
like Tesla yeah how Apple like San Jose
is gonna be the new Detroit of the like
the Detroit of the future soon it seems
Detroit Silicon Valley right it's where
the tech companies are it's where these
tech companies are investing so we now
what Google Tesla and potentially Apple
but definitely developing and doing R&amp;amp;D
but potentially all manufacturing yes
some in your country Apple cars in San
Jose that's a huge thing for California
and our country just that we're making
stuff in this country again you know me
and we'd like to make everything
overseas people people will say no way
there's no way that can happen but I I
think arguably Apple has talked about it
for years that they wanted to start
building their own devices in the US max
I know for a fact are now at least
assembled here in the United States not
necessarily manufactured but assembled
here but Tim Cook talked a lot about
bringing that manufacturing and assembly
here to the US it'd be very interesting
to see what happened because was I mean
correct me if I'm wrong but I believe
there was a Toyota for a while had a
plant that was doing some of their EV
ackles out here in Northern California
as well yeah I think you're right um in
this near the Tesla plant to it exactly
I almost believe I feel like the Tesla
plant took over that I still do you
think your verdict s left I think you're
right i think
I bought it and now it's Tesla it was
like Hyundai or something before yeah
something like that but you know I'm all
for a man no I am you know would be
really funny I mean I'm pretty sure
we're right but this is that game that
you play where two people are talking
about a topic and then one guy says yeah
yeah you're right another guy's no no
yeah ya know you are right and they both
talking about this topic and it's
completely wrong yeah totally we could
totally be wrong everyone listening but
I'm excited for the Google car the Apple
car and the Tesla to be built in San
Jose so this is why we do wallets
callers can correct us at one eight
hundred 61 62 63 that is where you
correct us but uh anyways apples you
know car project it's a it's a thing
it's going to be real you know they've
been they talked recently the California
DMV about autonomous vehicles they've
been plotting out land where you can
test officially test these a
self-driving cars as well as electric
cars Apple is going to make an apple car
there's a hundred percent without a
doubt they're going to do this it'll be
interesting to see I still feel like
Tesla's so far ahead of them I don't
know how much they're gonna have a lot
more experience Tesla's gonna have like
their 3rd 4th gen car out by the time
Apple has a car out yeah that's that's
definitely true i've seen some mock-ups
to the apple car though and it looks
pretty cool so yeah cuz they're maka
like look like a car from Blade Runner I
mean okay this Apple stick with your
mock-ups please you'll sell some cars
make it you know if we can sync with my
phone then even better okay let's check
this out since we're having some fun
we're time out cars we also want to talk
about fun accessories for your phone uh
do you want to talk about this first one
Steven did you check it out that much
yeah i watch the video i don't know too
much about it but it looks like it's an
umbrella to help you hold your phone in
the rain is that am I am I correctness
yeah oh hey while you pull the view let
me tell you what what what it might be
called it's called the phone briella so
this guy here he's like having trouble
texting and he's like I and I know
exactly I mean there's like dude what's
going on and this girls like yo homeboy
she's like looking down she's got a
phone briella it has like a see it
sounds like a handle that shaped like a
sea
so you can put your wrist and she just
grabs the umbrella from it looked and it
kind of feels like a weird porny like
soft porn right now weird and they're
like all staring at each other and he
just puts his hand through it that she
takes the phone from him and then has
him put two hands on the phone and looks
at him like you want this big boy so
funny it's the phone briella dude that
is probably awesome it's done it's done
by a Korean design firm they're called
Katie design this this video actually
came out sometime in May of this year
but it's kind of obviously picked up
steam now people start talking about it
um honestly I want one of those things I
think that thing's awesome it's pretty
cool such a great idea see innovation
it's the iphone it's innovating it's
making new industries and even in
umbrellas it's crazy oh and then the
next one I saw this this is for all our
dog lovers out there if you ever had
trouble taking selfies with your pets
because they never know where to look
this could solve your problems it's
called the pooch selfie it's a
Kickstarter project and let me just tell
you it's a tennis ball on top of a phone
when we faceted to the product there we
go here did here it is he's like walking
his dogs around it's like a mount that
holds a tennis ball on top of your phone
so they're like when your thugs look at
you they'll look at the two frickin
tennis ball and they'll be paid a tent
like a tennis ball to a dog is like
crack basically right yeah leyland one
track mind perfect honestly I see the
thing is I'm not gonna buy a boot selfie
I'm just gonna hold a tennis ball on top
of my phone now I think it's probably
messed up but it's it is pretty
beautiful I shouldn't say that cuz I'm
like taking away business from this
you'll have this great idea but um don't
put on I all there put on a tablet how
much did that thing constant thing is
probably fifty cents right it's gotta be
like two dollars look at that dude
they're gonna it's gonna stop for
like 10 15 bucks I've at you because you
know what I'm gonna sell the ball with
it and they're gonna sell them out with
it and they're gonna make it like you
got to have these two together there's
got to be
their uses for that thing to besides
holding the ball you know there's no
people are gonna find some other weird
use for it I'm sure I'm sure that Apple
extra crunchy fans can find a fun use
for it when you do what should we throw
