dean hakama vich who is the newly minted
vice president for internet explorer
we're here at the launch of IE 9 so
what's the news today with ie9 well you
know IE 9 beta is available for download
right now and it includes support from
over 70 partners worldwide we've got
sites live on the internet that really
show off what you can do in your browser
puts the site at the center of attention
so we've seen kind of the behind the
scenes the new faster engine the
hardware acceleration some of those
features but what most people haven't
seen is the full look and feel of IE 9
which is one of the things you'll get to
see in the beta what are some of the
features of the user interface let me
show you one in particular here I've got
a Windows 7 desktop if you look here
along the bottom you see that I've
pinned a lot of websites that I use a
lot so there's the rotten tomatoes movie
review site in fact here's twitter com
not a twitter app but actually twitter
com in fact why don't I go to your site
so here's beyond binary and I can take
the tab and I can drag the tab down to
the taskbar and put it right here next
to Twitter it belongs when I let go it's
got its own icon and now I can launch
directly the same way I launch any
windows application if you look up over
here you'll see that there is regular ie
the back button address bar and now here
is your site pen you notice at the back
and forward buttons pick up the readout
of the cnet icon and the scene an icon
is very prominent cuz the experience
really is about your site maybe one of
the things that's worth showing is back
down over here on the taskbar if you
look at Twitter see that sites can also
program jump lists and here the Twitter
jump list looks a lot like the Twitter
site and I'm sure that your site will
have a jump list that looks a lot like
the rest of your site within exciting
things that you want to offer your
readers so for those who haven't seen
the new look of ie one of the things you
notice is the chrome if you will leave
the part of the browser that's not the
website takes up less space was that an
deliberate design goal well the the
design goal was to have the browser
focus the users attention on the site
and one of the side effects of that is
fewer pixels used by the browser I think
when you when you look at the different
browsers some of them say look at me on
the browser and some of them say look at
the site side to the star of the web so
the ie9 bit is available as of today
what does it require what kind of
computer windows 7 windows vista
machines can run it just fine there are
32 and 64-bit flavors and because it is
the world wide web the beta is available
in 33 languages great thanks team thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
