coyotes these are the animals that greet
Trevor a bear on his computer every
morning possums skunks raccoons
squirrels rabbits great horned owls
hawks jays these creatures all call
Jasper Ridge home a biological preserve
owned by Stanford University in Northern
California to capture these images a
bear is built and installed 25 still
cameras and 6 video cameras all around
the 1,200 acre property this is a
digital wireless camera trap and it has
a infrared motion sensor that detects
the body heat of an animal and when that
animal passes by it triggers a picture
which is then transmitted wirelessly to
a base station at our facility the
cameras also have an infrared flash
that's imperceptible to the animals and
that batteries are all solar powered
we're really reducing the amount of
disturbance in the landscape that would
affect animal behavior and so the
animals are able to act more naturally
the photos and videos collected from
Jasper Ridge give researchers baseline
data for the local animal population
which sometimes can yield surprises when
we started seeing basically weekly
pictures of mountain lions at certain
times of year we were pretty amazed
recently incredible camera trapping
footage has emerged from around the
world showing off rare or hard to
observe species like these elusive cross
river gorillas from cameroon playful
tiger cubs from Sumatra a rhino from
Borneo and a Wolverine from Northern
California this was the first time I
documented documented proof of Wolverine
since I think the 1920s Sierra Pacific
Industries rotates its 100 cameras over
750,000 acres of timberland to keep an
eye on local species spotting the rare
carnivore was a fluke really Wolverine
isn't even in your reality so you're
really not even thinking that I hope I
get a Wolverine and that you know this
set of pictures that was
pretty exciting The Wolverine nickname
buddy
has been photographed over five
consecutive winters giving biologists a
chance to make sure he's healthy and to
spot any potential offspring that's
always the mantra buddy and from
everyone is to find buddy a girlfriend
hopefully one day she too will be
captured on film in San Francisco I'm
