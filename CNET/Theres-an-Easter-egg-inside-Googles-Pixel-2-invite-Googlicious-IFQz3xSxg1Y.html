Google issues for everything inside the
world of Google now the tech world was
fixated on Apple last week with their
new announcements and we can all agree
there wasn't really anything
groundbreaking with the iPhone X but
solid upgrades for users across the
board now Google is up next for their
big phone announcement after they tease
the date for October the 4th we know
it's going to be all about the next
pixel but there's an easter egg on the
page
thanks to nine-to-five google taking a
look at the source code of the ask more
page and a little digging reveals a
picture of a black and white cookie with
multicolored dots but digging even
deeper into the exif data the GPS
coordinates of where the picture was
taken lead to Googleplex and from the
camera listed that took the picture the
message not that easy of course it says
that even with all the leaks
we'll find out the official pixel two
details in about two more weeks
all right the Bose QuietComfort 35 twos
have been revealed as the first Google
assistant powered headphones and are
expected to go on sale on September the
22nd now it really came about as an
accident after someone found a pair put
on the retail floor to Best Buy and was
told they couldn't purchase them until
the 22nd with a retail price of 349
dollars now Google still might announce
their own hardware at the October 4th
event but we were expecting to hear
about their new beasto platform first at
the pixel event and not on store shelves
all right Samsung's physical bixby
button has been a pain in the button
since day one after Bixby came late to
the party and you know what it's really
kind of been a hot-button issue now
according to Sam mobile a new toggle
option is appearing on some s8 and Note
8 devices after a recent Samsung
software update it gives you the option
to turn off going to Bixby home with a
single press it doesn't disable the
feature entirely and if you press and
hold you'll still launch Bixby voice so
instead of doing the right thing and
just letting users customize it the way
they want which they were doing until
they were blocked by Samsung they just
want to remind you it's the button you
wish never existed all right this story
is pretty cool Google has a new payment
system that's exclusive to India it's
called tez but what makes it unique is
that it's a new payment app that uses
ultrasonic audio to send money from one
person to another
now most mobile payment apps use NFC
but tez avoids that because a large
portion of users in India don't have
phones with NFC now the ultrasonic audio
pairs two devices together allowing them
to transfer money tez also connects
directly to a users Bank and it's
available to download on iOS and Android
right now it's currently only available
in India but Android police has found
trademarks that points to them launching
it in other countries in Asia in the
future so yeah check that out really
cool stuff
okay Google Earth VR has been a way to
look around the world and one of their
highlights of their VR platform it's now
adding support for street view images so
you can view 360 degree photos that
people have taken from specific
locations like AT&amp;amp;T Park at a San
Francisco Giants game it's really sweet
and gives you a more realistic view of
what certain places look like Google's
rolling it out to both the HTC vive and
oculus rift and you can also check it
out on the street view VR app on Google
cardboard and daydream and believe it or
not this week on September the 15th
exactly 20 years ago in the year 1997
when some of you weren't even born yet
the domain google.com was officially
registered now the site didn't actually
go live until September the 4th 1998 it
still did basically the same thing but
it's now a whole lot smarter with so
many more specific ways to search but
it's just fun to look back and think
about a company that started in search
and that same company is now making
phones they're working on bringing
Internet to remote areas with Project
loon their self-driving cars with the
way Moe and so much more but it all
started with search engine so happy dome
anniversary Google you domain alright
that's it for this week you can email me
at Google issues at cnet.com or tweet me
at Brian Tong thanks for watching we'll
see you next week on Google issues
you're delicious</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
