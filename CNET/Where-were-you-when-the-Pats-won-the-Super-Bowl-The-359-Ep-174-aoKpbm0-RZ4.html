most inappropriate channel ever to talk
about football welcome to the 359
podcast episode 174 with our friends
Alfred Inge and Roger 10 good morning
guys we are talking about football well
it's right over now it's season over we
got an export oh we're not necessary
down that's the superbowl we're talking
about sort of the social reaction yep is
interesting to see the through the the
heckling of Tom Brady their halftime and
then turned into this celebration at
hambre exactly mean Brady oh yeah yeah
so I mean depending on if you're a pats
fan or not I mean it was either the
greatest night or just a huge snow camp
about your discipline well maybe it's
not disappointed cuz it was a great game
right I'm a huge fan huge fan of the not
Patriots there you go there's a fun game
to watch I wish the outcome were
different I wish I actually watched the
game but I did knee-deep in poop again
yes yeah alright anyways anyway so I
mean there's things outside of the world
from football down there is so that
nearly a hundred tech up bases are band
together to file a legal brief in
opposition to president Trump's envision
band we're talking a little bit about
that as well as Korea stepping in to to
offer their own oversight on battery
technology in the wake of Samsung's
Galaxy Note 7 debacle so more note 7
more samsung yes it is a dead horse and
we continue to beat it because there
just is just more stuff going on there's
a wealth yeah it really is it's crazy
thanks for all the news story never ends
I'm sure Samsung wants it in but it's
just not you had a thought about that
before all right as always leave your
questions in the comments section and we
will try to answer them in the next
after four minutes all right stick
around we'll hit you up in the chat and
three minutes and 59 seconds from 32
welcome to the 359 when we talk about
the top tech news of the day and only
the crap we want to throw it Roger Cheng
I'm Alfred Aang what an amazing game at
least that's what I hear I was busy
dealing with the baby and completely
missed the Super Bowl but millions of
others were glued to the screen and
shared their thoughts on social media
Facebook and Twitter so interesting to
see so the tide turn right from heckling
Tom Brady to the celebration of Tom
Brady towards the end greatest of all
time right at this point five Super Bowl
rings most talked about athlete on
Twitter and Facebook except he doesn't
have a Twitter for anyone to tag him in
so he's not even gonna see any of it
just does that mean he exists i don't
like is that i think he exists
considering he has five Super Bowl but
not on Twitter as a discount right but
yeah it was it was a big night for the
Super Bowl on social media twenty seven
point six million tweets 240 million
post about it on Facebook and dominated
everything yeah and but and that's not
just the Super Bowl it was you know you
know the second most talked-about moment
on Twitter on the super about the Super
Bowl had nothing to do with the game it
was Lady Gaga I'm performance by the way
did she actually like leap off the top
what what is that no she she had like
harnesses and stuff and then she like
jumped into it like I jump into work on
mondays so ice no it's true everyone he
actually wears hard and everything it's
crazy all right next up nearly a hundred
tech giants jointly filed a legal brief
bashing president Trump's immigration
ban arguing that America was built on
immigration and that this move would
actually have a real financial impact on
the nation I mean what do you think I
mean is going to move the needle or is
this just sort of this is adding to the
sort of the rhetoric that's going on I
mean I think it's moved the needle on
text and you saw uber CEO leaving
Trump's uh yeah Advisory Council I think
you know people protesting actually has
real consequences for these tech leaders
and their kind of taking a side against
it now and it's actually coming at a
sort of a you know an interesting time
Trump is I think has until today to sort
of state his argument in terms of
reinstating the band so this legal brief
this amicus brief that the tech up is
filed jointly filed
it's just sort of you know extra it's an
extra argument against ya from span i
mean the band's already been lifted be
from ray judge's order so i mean this is
just yeah you're like as you said just
another layer on top of it so it's it's
an ongoing story will continue to keep
tabs on it the lighting of ongoing
stories samsung galaxy note 7 back again
on the podcast so sometimes government
is stepping in samsung had already
announced that it's you know adding a
new eight-step battery test making a lot
more rigorous adding new test to it to
make sure that their batteries don't
explode and catch on fire and burn you
again so South Korea's government
decided you know what let's let's ramp
that up more their ministry of trade
industry and energy put out a statement
today saying that it's planning on
strength strengthening the safety rules
that it has not just for samsung but
across the board but you can kind of see
that you know this is really thought
about by sams this is a reaction to
Samsung absolutely I mean it's
interesting that they're stepping in I'd
actually like to see this around the
world like I'd like to see China in the
US everyone sort of stepping up their
standards because a lot of batteries are
actually made in china right yeah not
necessarily in korean in fact the fact
that they're stepping up their their
scrutiny wouldn't have changed the issue
with the second runner battery yeah so
but i believe that these battered i mean
i think samsung is doing this more so
with the South Korean government you
know just kind of as a show you know a
good will and in the sense of you know
we really want to get our stuff together
absolutely I what I have to wonder what
LG is thinking of their they're
cooperating I feel like don't rope us in
with this guy what are Samsung anyways
for more on these stories check us out
on Cena I'm Roger Cheng I'm a farang
thanks for listening
where were you when Falcons were killed
well what well I was heavily drunk and
leaving the game out where where were
you night I contributed them to the meme
dumb last night yeah that game was too
good for me to be on social media I like
I did not love that thing like if it's
if it's game that really captivates a
tent your attention can you can you do
this the to screen thing or did you just
focus on the one I didn't even bother I
was like to focus on the game it was a
good game from what I hear was I was
going back and forth with friends not
how in the ether of social media yeah
but I did coin according to Webster's
dictionary superb owl equals Falcon and
I was proud of that I think I earned
that now serve it yeah there's no house
in a mountain named expert operant is
the meme expert yeah exactly we don't
have a lot of action going on in the
chat anybody else out there I we've got
a lot of international fans on board
today and I'm sure that they don't give
a crap about the American superbug I was
a global event let's watch the van the
world I mean the lady gaga thing is
probably gonna go more global than the
game itself right be honest but she she
killed it I those drones that was the
coolest thing about was dope those were
Intel drones yeah yeah yeah yeah they're
like super lightweight drunk yelling
around I i only got annoyed by it
because all my friends were saying how
cool all their drones whir and stuff and
I was saying like this is gonna be the
future of advertisement so enjoy never
having a like starry night anymore just
think about it all these guns are gonna
be so accessible and then they're just
gonna be like like floating in the skies
all the time and yours gonna be others
like the new me to skywriting right yeah
Abby star it's gonna be yeah it's gonna
be skywriting at night and then you're
never gonna be able to escape it because
it's there groans and they're just hang
up there by Pepsi just wow following you
the sky wherever you got I saw it on my
guess is the worst thing ever everyone
thinks like oh it's so cool it was cool
to see that's probably how people felt
about like blimps and skywriting when
they were first invented right wow it's
awesome they can like write messages big
cloud gential and now it's just like
yeah I'm not happy about the drone ads
although great idea if you need to do a
proposal just saying just an uh
the future did anybody watch any of the
ads NEX yeah let's talk about the
commercials if United the Super Bowl
what were some of the ads that really
knocked your socks do you see the ads
for that new Fox show APB I didn't see
the Admiral but I knew that new click
copper cedral thing yeah but like uses
its act I tech police and I see like the
Silicon Valley genius comes in and like
takes over yeah just over those in a
district in Chicago because his best
friend was murdered right in that
district so by the rover so this time
it's it's so it's basically an entire
series based around that one episode of
Law &amp;amp; Order where they went against
gamergate I didn't see I didn't so much
then look it up there's a conic scene
where iced tea corners a guy goes this
isn't a video game there is no reset
button no I think it's the opposite like
this whole thing is like this is putting
in technology yeah they having is Maxine
to all the guys it's like this thing
like fold down into like some kind of
super drone that like flies around and
like stops all the criminals also
Robocop kind of China but they're human
Cobb was alongside not a cyborg so
Robocop mother's old there's also a
board cop the cops aren't the robot
season two maybe maybe season yeah I saw
I they played that commercial at least
like three times I think this is the
hardest thing like this is I was on Fox
yeah that's right that's a 24 was on
afterwards yeah yeah yeah the only thing
I really caught because everything good
happened at the end I saw the ghost in
the shell teaser number three or
whenever it is it which well it didn't
really clued a lot new footage and now
the the face thing was different right
now that that's been in there so what
was new and everything seemed kind of
just like what yeah yeah I really wasn't
any there was a tiny bit of fresh
footage but it didn't really tell you
did you see the barrage of t-mobile
commercials yeah I wasn't really paying
that close as apparent they bought more
or as many minutes as Budweiser's they
were like the top paid off over there
yeah because they were advised was five
commercials i believe so yeah the second
most talked about brand on social media
after pepsi and pepsi only got it
because they you know they do as a super
bowl halftime show oh yeah so yeah
t-mobile like just a barrage of
commercial just uh huh I'm again I only
watched one of them the the Justin
Bieber one but like I imagine they were
they were bashing brought their there
was there they did this whole kind of
like 50 shades of grey everything I
don't know if like Wireless pain ah so
it was like about all the issues that
you get like trying to cancel your plan
or like taxes and fees you know the
whole thing they've been going on yeah
um verizon I didn't see any ads from
verizon i thought i saw one about
actually taking on t-mobile yeah they've
responded on Twitter I saw that oh maybe
I saw on Twitter maybe it didn't show up
on maybe they didn't then perhaps if I
didn't see it if i was gay i'd i missed
I must have missed it but otherwise uh
tracy said she was switching back and
forth between Super Bowl and the puppy
bowl Oh which I missed this year I
didn't get to see however there was a
terrible awful just God uh trolling
effort did anybody see the dead puppy
bowl know what yeah yeah that was on
facebook why because humans are terrible
yeah we don't do that existed he's uh
Jorge says the Pirates of the Caribbean
new trailer was cool agile is cool
trailer I mean I'm kind of a sucker for
those yeah I didn't understand that
trailers but there's no i think i
understand it sirens a zombie it's like
a zombie ship and then they're coming
back to seem like to kiss did it seem
like the second movie had the same kind
of dead ship thing going by all i had to
say something all right you're right
pretty much they're all the same movie
but they're kind of fun popcorn movies i
do it i'm sorry i did the fourth one was
really bad done that kind of turned me
off of this area's I didn't see though
oh yeah that's when they lost the other
two yeah it was like the Fountain of
Youth one or whatever yeah and it was
def only des does not like it was Sam uh
yeah but Randall bloom is back sorry
Tracy I assume they know he's back yeah
he's an illusionist he was in the
trailer yeah I thought that was him yeah
cliff wasn't quite sure and then isn't
he supposed to be don't know the captain
now if like Davy Jones locker Davy Jones
yeah yeah yeah yeah can't let go back on
land anymore wait no I wasn't there like
a scene at the end where she came back
and like unlocked it or something or
like even back his heart and he was fine
I don't I don't remember that I think
there's a scene again like a like after
credits right like she showed up after
like whatever 10 years with the heart
yeah yeah good job Orlando Bloom what
about gardens of galaxies did you see
that I didn't see it yeah it was pretty
good I'm pretty jazzed about that movie
Rosalie knows Talon
stranger things to you my god that
course is so good I didn't see that
either it's insane oh man they got the
little kid in like the little ghost
busters shirt oh yeah they're all just
saw the photos yeah oh wait he's the
uniform right yeah um no it's gonna be
great so much so that a formerly says
that it's going to be set in 1984 I'm
assuming most likely either that were
they they were the original ghostbusters
so there's a linear timeline we've moved
forward one year and stranger things
time timeline that's the one thing we
can formally did my only hope is that
like there's not such a difference
between now and then that like all the
Act child actors like clearly went
through puberty like the filming oh yeah
move sooner or later will we're even
though it's nine lines ears is not one
it's not coming up for a while either
it's coming out october but and
halloween actually always be a halloween
show yeah okay no doubt um but i think
they did all the filming for it already
okay I really that's what I thought I'm
done I thought I might be here just
holding it for Halloween because well
they'll probably call backs and yeah a
lot of editing today a special effects
and all right that kind of makes sense I
guess I'm surprised that they're just
already completely done honestly if you
watch the commercial though it looked
like it was going to be a echo
commercial at first cuz it like started
with like a retro like 80s add like of
eggo but then I saw like tv-14 in the
top corner I'm like why is this a go
commercial have like a television rating
and then it jumped into like the
stranger things death clever nice
glenroy was a big fan of Lady Gaga said
the halftime show was the bomb will the
pyro tech it nearly was a bomb do you
see I didn't I didn't even pay attention
the pyro tech I know is how much white a
bit of it it always is a certain extent
one like worried that she was gonna fall
on the when she would like jump down I
was a little I was a little unnerved but
I saw salt later on the way she fell out
the balls to the wall jump yeah but then
but the way she also fell was like
really funny she looked like Mario
swimming what did you when she was just
like this in the air that that was that
was real like was there a moment we like
is this CG cuz it didn't like it almost
seemed a little surreal to me like it
like almost like it could have been cg
like it could've been a green screen I
saw him to be a great controversy to
come out right it wasn't actually real
I saw a tweet that the drones were
actually pre-recorded um I don't it's
just a tweet so I don't want to spread
the fake news around so ultimately true
effects I liked that coming full circle
here that there were some tweets
comparing her outfit too gozer the
gozerian from ghostbusters oh yeah and
I'm at yeah I can see that I can see
that volcko still drawn a lord of the
cebu leah my favorites one of my
favorite tweets about it was a lady
gaga's change her outfits more times in
this performance and I have all year as
she was fun though and I did get a kick
out of some of the the cameo appearances
I actually legitimately enjoyed Luke
Bryan's star-spangled banner and I got a
big kick out of the bushes coming down
the beginning just because they're
they've they've gone from like I might
disagree with politics silico the wood a
sweet little old couple yeah yeah that's
my perspective on that but all Georgie
did you see the tweet before on Friday
this is quincel tweet me inception coin
which everyone interpreted i interpreted
as an inception reference because it the
coinstar flipped stood on its side I'd
like a coin spinning is that he's ready
for the super bowl this sunday it was
like Inception that's so hip Wow which I
guess Alfred debunk that he was doing
the coin toss yeah it wasn't but
everyone kind of took it as inception
yeah which was really cooler all right
want to call the day yeah let's let's do
it not light news date is kick off the
week let's see how late it's and it's
all downhill it's good how it's gonna
get good this is it we're just starting
