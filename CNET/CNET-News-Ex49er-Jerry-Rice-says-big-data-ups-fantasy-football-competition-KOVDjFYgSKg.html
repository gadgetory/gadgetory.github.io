Francisco an expert panel including
famed 49er Jerry Rice explained how data
and technology are changing the way

catches that I had for many fantasy
football is a game of numbers lots of
numbers Sports technology company stats
calculates 92 data points during each
play of a football game that information
has actually been available for a while

it available to the average fantasy
football player because the technology
was so expensive so Intel's role is to
drive down the cost of the technology
increase the capability the technologies
that it becomes accessible to everybody
take it from a pro football hall of
famer the data makes a difference it
takes it to a whole different level you
know because the fans they have access
to that now and it's just going to make
the the situation a little bit more you
know a competitive because now they have
all that data it's the same data that
head coaches use to manage their offense
and defense researchers and Intel are
also creating analytics tools to help
crunch all that big data welcome news
for fantasy football veterans but for
newbies who are feeling a little lost as
they make their draft picks here's a
little professional advice its
productivity you know I want to see a
receiver the yardage you have to catch
also how many caches how many yards all
of that and the same thing with
quarterback you know you want to see how
many touchdown the quarterback is going
to throw you know his passer rating you
know its accuracy and in case you were
wondering rice is picking the 49ers to
go all the way in San Francisco I'm Sumi
