using an iPhone 10 now I remember back
last year in September when Apple talked
about the iPhone 10 and they said this
was going to be a whole new paradigm for
phones and for the iPhone this was gonna
be a design going forward into the
future for the next 10 years well I'm
using it now and it doesn't really feel
all that futuristic and maybe that's my
favorite thing about the iPhone 10 the
fact that it feels normal in fact
getting rid of the home button doesn't
really feel like a loss at all these
swipe ups and the general controls on
the bottom of the iPhone 10 are so
intuitive that I feel like I actually
prefer them using the home button and I
think it's a direction that they could
use and things like the Apple watch and
the iPad and just generally it's a great
multi-touch swipe interface that they've
got going other things I like about the
iPhone 10 six months later are its size
I like it from the beginning and I like
it now I think it's a perfect size
really easy to hold I don't want a
larger phone and the other thing I like
about the iPhone 10 is that of course
it's almost all screen almost all except
for the knotch which I've gotten more
used to because heck a lot of phones now
have notches so Apple now seems like
they've set a trend
I'm still not wild however about the
fact that the notch cuts out so much of
the information at the top that I can't
see all the bits of info to check
whether my bluetooth headphones are
connected or to look at other bits that
I would have normally looked at and I'm
not wild about the way you have to then
letterbox the screen to look at movies
another thing I'm not wild about on the
iPhone 10 his face ID the face ID I
guess you had to get there because you
had to get rid of the home button and as
the future goes in all the iPads and
computers and everything else in our
lives the ability to log in with your
face is pretty cool and it's great that
it works but on something like a phone
there are a lot of times I want to log
in quickly and it's not so easy to do
maybe I'm waking up and I've got my head
in the pillow and I've only got one eye
above the pillow or I don't have my
glasses on and it needs to be in a
certain range not too close and that's
frustrating because then I have to enter
a passcode same thing with them walking
down the street and I want to quickly
lift it up I
feel like I have to aim my head more and
if I want to lift it just gently on the
desk or if I'm taking notes and the
phone locked and I want to just quickly
unlock it I'm usually having to enter
the passcode and it's a little too slow
for me compared to touch ID if you like
face ID to really needs to happen to
improve all those things I think the
true depth camera is really exciting the
idea that it's almost like a mini
Microsoft Kinect in there and could do
3d scans I still think that's really
untapped as far as a our augmented
reality apps go on the iPhone I feel
like that's an exciting and still
unexplored area of the camera I'd even
like to maybe see if it didn't affect
battery life having something like that
on the rear of the camera but for what I
don't know in the iPhone tens battery
life it's okay
I still feel like about 3:00 p.m. I've
got a panic and recharge to make sure
that at the end of the day I'm not
running out and that's something I've
had for years with the iPhone and a lot
of phones sure you have to manage
battery life the iPhone 10 I find has a
little bit less battery life on a daily
basis than the iPhone 8 plus I want to
get to the point like with the Apple
watch or the iPad where I can do a whole
day and not feel like I have to sift the
battery carefully another thing I'm not
wild about is how much I have to coddle
the phone I love the design of it I
think it's great to hold I think it's
fantastic in the way it feels but if you
drop an iPhone 10 you could shatter the
screen and our drop tests have basically
shown that this can happen pretty easily
now I always keep this thing in a case I
would never hold it outside of a case
like I am now and I would like that
Apple final they tend to make the phones
a little more durable to prevent that
from happening in mid 2018
I think the iPhone 10 really has the
best overall design of any phone that's
out there and I think it's really great
to use it's fast the cameras are really
good and across the board it's proven
that it's the form I would pick over
another form but at that price $1,000 I
still feel like it's too expensive so
Apple may come out with other iPhone 10
like phones this year and begin lowering
the price to make it more reasonable I
think that really needs to happen
because at this point if I were
recommending a phone
to a family member I'd say well you
probably don't need the iPhone 10 you
should probably get another iPhone or
another phone that has a price that
matches that still performs really well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
