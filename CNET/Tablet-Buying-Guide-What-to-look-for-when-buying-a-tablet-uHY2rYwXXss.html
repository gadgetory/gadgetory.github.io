determine what kind of tablet is best
for you you want it for watching video
do you want it just for checking your
email on the weekends instead of busting
out your laptop when it comes to buying
a tablet you want a great screen fast
performance you want the size to be
right for you depending on if you want
it to watch a lot of video then you want
a bigger screen but if you want to take
it on your commute or on vacation you
want something smaller so the screen
size is something you have to think
about the processor how fast it goes if
you want it for gaming you're going to
need something that goes a little bit
faster if you just want it for social
networking checking email watching some
videos and you don't need something as
fast or expensive higher price means
that you're probably getting the
high-end specs it doesn't mean you're
getting a better tablet if you don't
care if you just want something that
works you're gonna find plenty great
tablets but if you want something that
looks really cool then sleek eye and
you're going to be spending a lot more
testing tablets I just use them a lot I
kind of just bin use tablets but we also
burn a lot of performance tests to
determine how well it performs for
gaming as well as everyday use we also
test the screen see how bright it is as
well as the darkest black level to
determine the contrast even though a lot
of tablets have similar resolutions they
don't have the same color range other
new features the kind of mirror
smartphones like fingerprint scanners 3d
cameras if you like something that has a
sturdy aluminum bag or something that
has a plastic bag with like a texturized
grip that's all personal preference
the best of list is definitely the first
place people searching CNET should look
for a tablet because that just has the
best Android the best iOS the best
Windows tablets if your needs for a
tablet are more specific like you only
want to spend $250 on a tablet or if you
want one with the best screen if you
want one that also has 4G LTE service we
also have lists that gather the best
tablets that have those features
I like sending people the right way to
find the right tablet for them I can
relate being a consumer as well always
looking for the right thing for me in
the right price so when people find that
with the tablet it makes me happy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
