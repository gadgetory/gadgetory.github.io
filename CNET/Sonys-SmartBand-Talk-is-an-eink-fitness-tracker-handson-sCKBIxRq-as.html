taking a look at the smart band talk
Sony's latest fitness tracker that has a
trick up its sleeve on the front you'll
see an e-ink screen that shows you your
fitness your steps and your incoming
calls and texts and the band is designed
ideally to work with Sony's life log app
now that app as well as tracking your
steps and your movement can also track
things like what you've been listening
to or what you've been watching it also
tracks your sleeping although the band
and like its predecessor can
automatically know when you're asleep so
you don't have to tell it each night
when you're actually going to catch some
Z's and physically it's small
lightweight and it's also completely
waterproof so when you leave the gym and
hit the showers you don't need to
remember to take it off hear us it'll be
in a range of colors as well so if
you're not keen on the whites you go for
this black and red one which does stand
out a bit more the band has a built-in
mic and speaker as well so you can
actually make and receive calls by
speaking into it smart band talk is due
to go and sell globally towards the end
of the year and Sony reckons it will
cost around the 159 euros mark although
that will of course depend on exactly
whereabouts you live I'm Andrew Hoyle
