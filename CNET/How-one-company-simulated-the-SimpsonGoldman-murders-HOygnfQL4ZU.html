recreations ever made for what some
people have called the trial of the
century the OJ Simpson trial it was
commissioned by CNET and created by one
of the country's leading teams of legal
and scientific experts to demonstrate
some of the awesome power of today's
computers and some of the social
implications of that power even though
it's in animation some moments of
violence may be too graphic for some
audiences here now shown for the first
time ever our recreation of the murders
of Ronald Goldman and Nicole Brown
Simpson
at the night of the murder it's very
dark in this dirt area very dark at the
steps there's almost no illumination
through an exciting new technology
called forensic animation you will
become a silent witness to the brutal
murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and
Ronald Goldman a scene at Central
exclusive these images were created
through a marriage of computer-generated
animation motion capture technology and
good detective work the data came from
court records scientific measurements
taken at the scene by engineers and
special photography attorneys in this
courtroom have said it's likely the jury
will be shown in animation that means a
computer could help determine the
verdict the moment we're going to show
you our dramatic recreation in its
entirety but first we'd like to
introduce you to the people CNET
commissioned to create our
groundbreaking animation failure
analysis Associates of Menlo Park
California dr. Roger McCarthy failure
analysis chief executive officer is an
engineer and one of the few experts in
the world on the subject of recreating
events using computer animation it's
very significant to us as an
organization just because of the
notoriety and I think also the degree of
misinformation that has grown up
surrounding the murders dr. McCarthy is
on the board of several national safety
advisory councils and serves as a
consultant to the army science board it
was failure analysis that exposed the
attempts by the NBC News program
Dateline to rig a gas tank explosion for
an investigative report from the Exxon
Valdez disaster to the collapse of a
hotel lobby walkway in Kansas City
failure analysis and its engineers have
used cutting-edge technology to solve
the mysteries behind some of the biggest
disasters in the world to create this
animation failure analysis engineers had
to write a script based on their
scientific investigation of what
happened high-speed motion capture
cameras and computers were then used to
log actors movements finally powerful
SGI video and animation computers were
put to work to render this
animation it's about as close to time
travel as we're ever going to get you
can go back in time and see things as
they would have been seen from any
vantage point at that time limited only
by the accuracy of the physical objects
you build in an animation for years
computer-generated images have been used
to recreate car and plane crashes and
industrial accidents for civil cases but
in a criminal court especially in a
murder trial their use is rare and
controversial but enough would be
something laughable would be something
usable I had no idea what it would work
out or not or whether I can do it
criminal investigator Alexander Jason
created the first forensic animation in
the country to be used in a murder trial
in 1992 Jim Mitchell was accused of
murdering his brother Artie in Corte
Madera just north of San Francisco
here's a man trapped in the bedroom no
gun doesn't know what's really what's
going on so he finally sticks his head
to look super but he's still there and
gets shot through the head that was a
fatal shot now all this is very very
clear when you see it but when you try
to communicate this verbally it's very
confusing a Marin County jury eventually
convicted Mitchell engineers and
forensics experts who were given
unprecedented access to the Simpson
Goldman murder scene have assembled this
scenario you're seeing an overhead
aerial shot of the Bundy Drive geometry
of this section of town where you can
see there's a number of condos side by
side this area is where the murder
occurs in reality it's covered up with
trees there are steps in a gate in a
dirt area beside the front entryway in a
patio but we took the tree out so you
can see that now we're going to put the
tree in because the night of the murder
the tree provides incredible shade and
it's extremely dark in this area at this
point mr. Goldman comes up to the gate
punches it and rings the doorbell Nicole
Simpson leaves her condo and she
actually needs a front door ajar to come
down and open the gate there's obviously
a speakerphone and she knows who her
visitor is literally the assailant has
to come from the patio area or the
physical arrangements of the subjects
make no sense the way he attacks them
it mobilizes them both he hits the right
side of mr. Goldman's face with his left
hand and does so very hard there's a
substantial bruise on the right side of
his face simultaneously are very soon
thereafter we believe the assailant hits
Nicole Simpson on the left side of her
face with the butt of his knife the
palmer and that knocks her right side of
her head into the wall
we believe that knocks her out which
enables the assailant now to come down
and deal with the number one threat
which is the young able and in pretty
good shape mr. Goldman we postulate that
he puts the point of the knife behind
mr. Goldman's head and actually uses the
knife like a fork with his hand over the
mouth to raise mr. Goldman to his feet
the medical examiner has testified that
that wound alone would have been
sufficient to kill mr. Goldman if
nothing else had been done to him it's
obvious from the medical evidence that
the assailant has a hand over mr.
Goldman's mouth is having a talk with
mr. Coleman and is emphasizing his
points with the knife
the next fatal blow received by mr.
Goldman is a plunge right over his heart
hitting him in the left side of his
torso another thrust again from the back
upwards under the ribcage which is also
a fatal thrust and he takes a final
knife blow in this side another fatal
wound and we postulate he falls away
into the fence we see abrasion marks
down the back of his scalp which we
believe as a result of falling down the
fence and then he falls over and that is
literally the position he is found by
the police the next morning with mr.
Goldman dealt with the assailant is now
free to turn his attention to Nicole the
assailant uses the same technique to
lift her as he does mr. Goldman hand
over mouth it's clear again that the
assailant is talking to Nicole Simpson
the reason we know this is before the
final fatal cut of her throat there are
three other small cuts on her throat
parallel to where the fatal blow is
going to be administered it's clearly
again torture the final cut across her
throat is going to be delivered with her
head cocked substantially
back and the strength in that cut is
enormous and by that I mean she is going
to receive a single slice to the front
of the throat that is going to be slow
deep it is going to Knick her spinal
cord that requires tremendous strength
for a single cut I don't care how sharp
your knife is the assailant notices he
has lost his wool cap and in the
animation he touches his head unlike our
animation which has got enough light
level for you to see what's going on in
the real scene this was very very dark
and it's a dark wool cap he's trying to
feel for the wool cap can't feel
anything through the gloves he has to
take the gloves off to feel for the wool
cap by taking off both gloves and not
being careful about it he actually ends
up leaving a glove behind and not
retrieving the wool cap we speculate
that something disturbed him in his
search and cut it short whether it be a
dog barking or some neighbors voice or
something when the investigators arrived
they're going to find Nicole's body in
this position mr. Goldman's and this one
they're going to find the net skull cap
here they're going to find a glove very
close by it mr. Goldman's pager and his
keys are all going to be found in these
relative physicians we believe this to
be the most detailed reconstruction done
to date
we hope it remains the standard by which
all other reconstructions are judged by
even the prosecution's of course an
animation from the OJ Simpson defense
team would show a different conclusion
but for this animation failure
investigators used evidence presented in
court autopsy reports and detailed data
they gathered from the scene of the
murders the medical evidence is
literally the most important to
establishing this scenario of the crime
the choreography the movement of the
characters to the scene has been driven
by the medical evidence because the
choreography has to produce the wounds
and they have to be produced in a
certain order
the Hat is found with I believe the
number is 26 african-american hairs in
it there doesn't seem to be any contrary
testimony or even dispute over the Hat
as belonging to the assailant so we
merely followed the physical evidence at
the scene
