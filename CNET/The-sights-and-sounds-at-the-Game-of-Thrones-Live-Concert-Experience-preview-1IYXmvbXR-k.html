of you where that music is from but just
in case you've been living under a rock
or without premium cable it's the iconic
theme song for Game of Thrones and it's
about to hit the road as the game of
Thrones
live concert experience it started with
with just a small idea it was in the
studio during one of our music reviews
with my showrunners David Benioff and
Dan Weiss and I played some music and
they said you know what really why don't
you do a concert I mean you should do
this live we got a sneak peak and this
production is a huge undertaking 807
linear feet of LED screens feature here
with massive three-tiered 360 degree
structures putting out video on each
side of the stage
some of those screens shift up and down
into new shapes during specific
sequences so it offers a highly
immersive audio-visual experience for
attendees but we wanted to create a
technically stunning show that just
looks impressive and can do a lot of
things and this is something the stage
can do is so I think it's incredible
even though those visuals were an
absolute sight to behold it's clear the
orchestra is the heart and soul of the
show let's say it's about 65 people we
have a band that actually travels with
me but then we pick up actually an
orchestra and choir in almost every city
and then we also even have a couple
instrument that we specially designed
just for the show so there will be some
exciting instrument that people will see
instead of like oh wow that's what that
sounds like so it should be fun
performing the music and then actually
having a live audience around you and
seeing the reaction from the audience
and for the audience to see the music
played live I think is super exciting so
I can't wait one of our favorite parts
of the preview was a musical sequence
set to the journeys of many of the
show's heroes and some of its villains
will start at season one and sort of an
a linear way to go through the different
character arcs and stories and
everything and the idea is that you had
a great summary of all six seasons and
you have just pumped for season seven
that you're just ready for the next
season over 3,600 minutes of series
footage was reviewed to produce the
content that'll play on the screens but
if you end up going you can also expect
a few special visual surprises beyond
simple show montages the resolve you
could see behind me it's an epic stage
and a special design and the idea is
when you walk into the arena you already
feel like you are in Westeros the Game
of Thrones live concert experience kicks
off its 24 City North American tour on
February 20th 2017</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
