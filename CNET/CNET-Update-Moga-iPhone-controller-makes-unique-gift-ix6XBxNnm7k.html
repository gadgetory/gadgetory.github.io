backup battery made for iPods and
iPhones running iOS 7 once it snaps into
a lightning connector dock it can be
used to play hundreds of games but

racing and sports games that take
advantage of the directional sticks and
action buttons moga unveiled the gamepad

young children need a cell phone but if
a parent wants to send an emergency call
or text message there's a new gadget
sold by AT&amp;amp;T that could give some
parents peace of mind it's the Philips
SmartWatch it costs two hundred dollars
and it functions as a location tracker

speakerphone it requires a ten-dollar
monthly data plan since it functions
similar to a phone parents can use the
GPS to mark approved areas on a map and
they will get a text when the child has
left a safe zone the Phillip goes on
