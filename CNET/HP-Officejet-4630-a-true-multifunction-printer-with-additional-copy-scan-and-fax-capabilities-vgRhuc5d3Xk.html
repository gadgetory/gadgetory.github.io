first look at the HP Officejet 46
mid-range multifunction printer but
unlike most of these things that use a
copier to send faxes over the Internet
this one actually has a fax machine
built-in too so taking a closer look the
4630 has a new design for HP that puts
the paper tray on the bottom and that
gets it out of the way so you could push
the printer up against a wall and you
won't lose any of those functions it can
hold a hundred sheets of plain paper in
the tray and you can also put an extra
35 sheet stack into the auto document
feeder on top you'll use that to batch
scan and fax and the adjustable sliders
let you use all different kinds of paper
different sizes and things like heavy
cardstock letters and more setup is also
really easy which is really no small
feat for a printer you can hook it up to
a computer with just a USB cable but HP
really wants you to connect it with a
wireless router that way you can print
from the cloud using services like Apple
air print Google Cloud Print HP's own
ePrint that's a service that sends
photos to the printer from anywhere
using a unique email address
lift up the middle part here and you'll
see the cartridge Bay there's one for
black ink and the other actually holds
three different colors in one cartridge
cyan magenta and yellow of course the
disadvantage of that tricolor cartridge
is that you'll have to replace the
entire thing when even one color runs
out so to save money on consumables you
can actually use the auto duplexer
built-in to print on both sides of the
single sheet of paper
but to save ink you really only have two
options you can either purchase XL
capacity cartridges from HP and that'll
cost you a bit more up front but you get
more ink in the reservoir or you can opt
into HP's latest and newest ink program
it's called instant ink and it keeps
track of your usage as you print and
then it automatically sends you a new
cartridge when you're running low the
46:30 is a bit lacking in terms of
performance it registered slower than
average print speeds and the tricolor
ink cartridge showed visible signs of
banding but nothing too serious I
printed a bunch of full 4x6 color photos
on it and while there are some definite
limitations to the tricolor cartridge
it's good enough to use in a scrapbook
or for professional documents like
resumes and presentation slides you can
read more details in my full review on
CNET but that's it for this video I'm
Justin this is the HP Officejet</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
