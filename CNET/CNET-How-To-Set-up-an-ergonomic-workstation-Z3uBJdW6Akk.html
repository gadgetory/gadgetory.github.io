setup would look like is to sit back in
your chair and relax for most people it
would look something like this your feet
are on the floor you're leaning back a
little bit your shoulders are relaxed
and your hands are in your lap this is
called your neutral posture and if you
can keep it this way while you work
you'll be in good shape with that in
mind let's build an ergonomic
workstation the most important part of a
comfy desk is making sure your keyboard
and mouse are positioned correctly
considering this neutral posture your
keyboard should be set 1 to 2 inches
above your thighs and should be close
enough to use that your elbows stay by
your sides for most people that probably
means getting a keyboard tray or
lowering your desk but remember only 1
to 2 inches above the top of your legs
when you're there position your devices
so that they're close to shoulder
distance apart and that they're parallel
with your thighs so that you're not
extending your wrists like this keep the
keyboard flat and forget about using
those little kick stands and speaking of
your wrists don't ever use a wrist rest
rusting your palms is one thing but the
moment you use a wrist rest you cut off
blood circulation and hello carpal
tunnel
next up I've got a couple useful tips
for setting up your screen first the
distance if it's too far away
you'll start craning your neck to read
what's on the screen to find the sweet
spot extend your arm and the tip of your
middle finger should land on your screen
so slide the monitor forward or back
until you find that spot if you have two
monitors set them up side by side at an
angle keep them as close as possible to
each other so that when you pan your arm
in an arc your fingertip reaches both
screens in this case I use this screen
more often so I'll Center it a little
bit more now let's talk about height
there's no cut-and-dry rule but here's a
little trick facing your monitor close
your eyes when you open them your eyes
should land on the address bar if they
don't lower or raise the monitors either
with the built-in option with risers or
with books
last of all tilt those monitors just a
smidge to avoid reflections where
everything finally comes together
is your chair it supports your back your
bottom and of course your posture there
are lots of chairs to choose from but a
few important things to look out for
first it should have good lumbar support
for your back and when you sit down
there should be a little space between
the edge of your seat and the back of
your knees about the size of your fist
then the last thing to do is to make
sure your feet don't dangle if they're
dangling don't adjust the height of the
chair because you'll mess everything
else up instead grab a footrest
slip it under your desk and problem
solved at this point you should have a
pretty good idea of what an ergonomic
desk setup should look like from here
you might want to watch my video on
avoiding eye strain and I have to say it
I talked to a couple organ ahhmm expand
this is what they recommended but go
ahead and talk to your physician or an
ergonomic specialist to find out what
sort of setup would suit your needs if
you have any questions along the way hit
