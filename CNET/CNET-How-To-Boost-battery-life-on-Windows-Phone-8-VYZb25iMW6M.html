have been rocking it since 2012
it is never a bad time to make sure
you're getting as much battery life as
possible decreasing brightness and
saving Wi-Fi when you're not using it
are a couple obvious tips but there are
also some other settings buried in the
system and they could be seriously
draining your battery all right head to
Settings and follow along most of what
we're doing is disabling unnecessary
features but if you actually use one
keep it enabled obviously ok first go to
Wi-Fi and tap advanced and uncheck these
two boxes now your phone won't waste
energy always looking for hotspots now
back in settings click on tap and send
and turn it off ok there are a few more
things you should tweak in this system
settings menu go to email and accounts
and for each account adjust the download
new content option to the lowest
frequency you're comfortable with if you
can choose manually otherwise go for
hourly now head back and go to backup
backing up your data is really important
but it'll be less of a drain on your
battery if you did it manually so turn
off each backup option and then when you
do want to backup your data enable it
and hit backup now and finally go to
phone update and uncheck automatically
download updates now your phone will
still tell you if there is an update but
it won't download it automatically which
is the worst when you're trying to be
careful about your battery life ok back
in the settings menu swipe over to
applications here will take a few
important things under background tasks
you'll see apps I have permission to run
in the background go through this list
and block any apps you don't absolutely
need now go to games and turn off
connect with Xbox and sync game requests
again if you use these features leave
them enabled head back and go to music
plus videos here turn off connect with
Xbox music and this cloud collection
feature
if you don't use it with these changes
you should see a significant increase in
your phone's battery life and if you
want even more battery saving tips check
out the extended guide on CNET how-to
and if you have a tip of your own don't
be shy let me know on Twitter first seen
