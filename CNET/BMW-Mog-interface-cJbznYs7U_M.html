the car except those times when you wear
out the thumbs-down button because you
get like seven or eight crappy songs in
a row it happens your iPods great all
the music on there is stuff you like
except for the ones you don't like
anymore so where's the middle ground
between predictive and on-demand when
you're on the road that's what mog says
they are it's a streaming service that
mounts up on your iPhone for now in BMWs
and minis you put it in this cradle
right here and then it lets you do
either predictive streaming like Pandora
or you can do one ZT z stuff pick the
exact song you want like Spotify all of
this of course wirelessly it also lets
you do interesting blend of sort of
Spotify artist specificity with
Pandora's predictive playlist now let's
take a look how it actually works in
this car you get this kind of cover flow
looking thing which is very attractive
though it's not literally cover flow now
the tool you're going to wear out the
most is going to be searched this is
where it's really cool you can go artist
album or song they've got 13 million
tracks in their library one of the
largest out there if I search an artist
for example here come all the albums
that they've got from that artist and
then I can dig within one of those and
find songs and add those to a queue to
keep them playing or it'll just play
through the album naturally in track
order so it's all kind of very logical
and intuitive here's what's interesting
I can also say make that artist the core
of radio mode like you do with Pandora
say play this artist to play this song
and make a playlist out of it they do
that but they also let me do this I can
say only tracks by that artist as
opposed to going off and playing stuff
that they think sounds like that artist
which I don't think sounds like that
artist or I can go to similar which is
more Pandora like now notice everything
i'm doing here is BMW i drive style not
a special interface for mog that means i
use the eye dr knob to navigate and
select these inscrutable little icons on
the left but once you get used to them
they actually make sense but let's look
at the costs first of all on this BMW
you've got to have BMW apps it's a two
hundred fifty dollar option on top of
that you have to have an LCD based car
which is another cost of several
thousand depending which model you by
then there's the ten dollars a month to
get mugged at the premium level which
allows all of this mobile technology to
use it through your phone and through
your car now how hard will mog
hit your wireless data plan their mobile
version streams at 64 kilobits sounds
fine not amazing that comes out to about
twenty eight megabytes per hour let's
take the average u.s. commute of around
twenty five minutes each way or about 17
hours a month if you listened to mod
eighty percent of that time on commute
alone that's about 380 megabytes of data
well under the typical 3g data plan of
two or three gigabytes but it would also
probably double the average amount of
data you're using today okay so it's a
little pricey in this particular use
case it is well done but here's what
would be better done if Apple opens up
the searing voice command API to
developers like mog so i could see
redrive the mog app on my phone and then
i don't have to worry about what
automakers support what that to me is
the secret sauce I hope they agree
