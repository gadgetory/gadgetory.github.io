exciting thing about this sensor-based
era xbox and kinect have been a big part
of getting the the vision out there to
consumers what should they understand
next I just think it's a new start of a
new way of computing so we have had a
new different kinds of input models that
have had inflections in technology like
a mouse as but it was a big inflection
point touch with a big inflection fight
I think voice gesture vision is all
starting to come together with the
different what's services and technology
in devices need the battery life I was
doing all those things would be able to
some really amazing things now we're
seeing some very different designs of
products as well because I imagine when
things are sensing you need to shape
them differently comport them to the
user differently what does the millions
you've learned through Xbox through
surface you've been through this couple
times sure there's a lot of devices are
trying to be the one size fits all
there's the ones that are trying to be
unique individual single purpose devices
and I think we're all still trying to
figure out exactly what it means to be
wearable it's gonna be different for
everyone I think it's about finding the
problems to solve for people and people
are all different and so they've made
different solutions for different
probably fair to say the jury is still
out on all in one versus many discrete
devices week so when you see the magic
of something like you know Fitbit or
shine or even when the kindle first came
out it was just a single-use purpose
device and it captured your imagination
and then we started to add more to it
and some of the magic kind of goes away
after that and so I think as you start
to see some of the really interesting
ideas no one has really hit yet on the
exact you know scenario that's going to
make everyone go out and get
yeah but it doesn't always have to start
with a big bang I think a lot of times
technology start says oh you know like
the iPhone it's a bad phone but it
became something really interesting and
a good phone over time so it's not
something that's just silly be one big
bang let's talk about the services the
data comes off these sensing products
and then the services we create from
them if you could tell the the average
user what's the fundamental difference
and benefit of having something sense
you that's gonna make the services we
use better what's the big idea well I
think there are many big ideas but one
of the ones i think is around
authentication is one of the most
motorists things about using your device
today I mean the pin makes it pretty
easy but it's being able to go and you
start your car you start to find your
key yeah keys have changed we still have
keys and then you have a sensor on your
keys to find your keys it tells your
phone to find review so there's going to
be new ways to authenticate that use
your personally identifiable information
that's private to you so no one else in
our open your house or do other things
that aren't really about you I think
that's an unlock a lot of things for
people you know there's a lot of very
small T diems that we go through every
day it may sound small to unlock your
door with a key open your car have to
enter that unlock code on your phone but
how many hundreds or even thousands of
times did we do that a day now do you
just access our stuff or bring it back
to you know we're talking about Xbox a
minute ago the remote right the remote
with a magical thing that changed
channels and then it got all those
inputs for the different things that
were connected to your TV and it became
an onerous task yeah so finding a CSP
nhd was so difficult and now for the
invention of new kinds of input models
with boys you can say no xbox watch ESPN
it'll go right to it more natural
natural more elegant intuitive and more
about what you're trying to get done
unless about just having the capability
be in the device you can focus on the
end right and not so much on the means
right great excellent that's great do
yeah perfect thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
