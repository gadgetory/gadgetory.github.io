spying on other apps I'm Bridget Carey
and this is your cnet update every other
day there's a new report on hacking we
have to worry about this time the
concern comes from the smartphone apps
that you trust security researchers have
found a flaw in Android iOS and Windows
Phone operating systems where malicious
apps can run in the background and spy
on the information stored in other
popular apps like Gmail chase bank and
H&amp;amp;R Block here's how it happens you
download what appears to be a harmless
app like maybe it's a wallpaper app but
it's actually running a program in the
background that taps into the phone's
shared memory and records what you're
doing and what you're typing in real
time in a video on YouTube researchers
showed how a bad app can steal the
username and password from an H&amp;amp;R Block
app and even steal the social security
number that you type in to check your
tax return with Chase when you take a
picture of a check the hacker can get a
copy of that photo of the check these
bad apps don't require special
permissions to be able to see the shared
memory that's why this is so dangerous
facebook asks for way more permissions
than these hacking apps so think twice
before downloading a pointless app it
could be masquerading as something
malicious and it could be hard to spot
and when it comes to downloading apps it
turns out most of us don't download apps
often comScore's mobile app report says
that in an average month sixty-five
percent of smartphone users don't
download a single app it's not that
people don't spend time on apps people
just aren't often hunting for a new one
the report says forty two percent of all
app time is spent on your one favorite
app meanwhile in the world of antivirus
software symantec is trying to make
things less complicated next month on
September 23rd the company will release
one product under one brand Norton
security it'll replace norton antivirus
norton internet security norton 360
norton 360 multi-device and norton 360
premier edition yeah nice to have it
under one thing now and it'll protect up
to five devices including Windows Mac
iOS and Android the company is selling
Norton in a subscription service and if
you run into a problem that Norton can't
protect there is a money-back guarantee
and there are two updates in the world
of wearable gadgets ESPN now has an app
for the pebble smartwatch that will pop
up a game score alert on your wrist and
there's also an app update with fitness
tracking watch hybrid misfit shine which
I'm wearing now inside of a necklace you
can also wear it on your wrist misfit
now syncs data with a MyFitnessPal app
that's your tech news update you can
