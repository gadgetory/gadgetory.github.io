be too safe I'm Bridget Carey and this
is your cnet update the annual III video
game expo kicked off Monday in Los
Angeles Microsoft gave the first
presentation and the most interesting
part was what Microsoft didn't talk
about there was no mention of the Kinect
no mention of what the Xbox one could do
as a media player no mention of Xbox
one's extra features at all for that
matter nothing even about the original
Xbox TV shows that have been teased
before Microsoft only talked about
upcoming games that's it considering the
Xbox one console is less than a year old
Microsoft may have made a mistake to
play it safe if you don't already own an
xbox one Microsoft didn't explain why
their system is worth getting over
PlayStation 4 well unless you count the
few exclusive games which include a halo
anniversary compilation pack of old
games there's a reason why Microsoft
took on a different tone when the Xbox
one was unveiled last year Microsoft was
criticized when it said the system was
going to require the kinect to be
plugged in and how you had to be
connected to the internet to play a game
and how it was going to block you from
playing used games there was so much
backlash that Microsoft backtracked all
those plans it also faced criticism over
the focus that have put on the
livingroom entertainment features and
now the company seems to be totally
afraid to talk about anything other than
the fact that the Xbox plays video games
the game that got the most attention was
the new halo 5 but that's not coming out
until 2015 there should be a beta
version of the game out before the
holidays and the plot is that the iconic
Master Chief character is reflecting on
his past and future on a personal
journey questioning Authority and
searching for truth another noteworthy
game that's only playable on the Xbox
one is sunset overdrive if Tony Hawk's
Pro Skater had a zombie mode well this
would be that game it's a cartoonish
game where you save the day by sliding
and grinding on poles and rail
blowing up mutant zombie things it comes
out october twenty eighth microsoft also
spent time talking about other games
that will be coming soon but many of
those titles are also going to be
available on the playstation such as the
new Assassin's Creed call of duty and
Tomb Raider in the next scene at update
I'll cover the highlights from sony's
playstation announcements along with
news from nintendo it won't take much
for sony to outshine Microsoft at this
conference that's your tech news update
you can get your III fix anytime at cnet
com / III as we cover the expo all week
long from our studios in New York I'm
