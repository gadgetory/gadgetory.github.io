feature I'm Bridget Carey this is your
scene at update Apple faces a five
million dollar lawsuit over a new
feature called Wi-Fi assist it all boils
down to data charges you see with Wi-Fi
assist the iPhone automatically switches
to use a cellular data connection
whenever there's a weak Wi-Fi signal but
the controversy is that this is turned
on by default for anyone that updates to
iOS 9 the lawsuit which was first
reported by Apple Insider argues that
Apple did not give a good enough
explanation of what it did and it should
have alerted users because it could be
easy to accidentally run up your data
bill and go over your monthly limit when
you think you're just using Wi-Fi you
can find this in iPhone settings under
cellular and you scroll all the way down
the page to turn it off the plaintiffs
are suing Apple over false advertising
and negligent misrepresentation and in
other Apple drama it seems we have an
early look at the Android version of the
Apple music app with leaked screenshots
published by the German site mobile
geeks Apple has said it's working on an
Android version to come out in the fall
so that in itself wasn't a secret
it appears the design is similar to the
iPhone version meanwhile Apple also
began selling the new Apple TV streaming
box through its online store it starts
at one hundred and fifty dollars but the
older model can still be purchased for
$70 and over at Microsoft you can now
find the surface book and surface pro
for officially on sale it's also
available to purchase at Best Buy Amazon
and Target in New York City you'll find
the new machines on display front and
center of Microsoft's brand new retail
store on Fifth Avenue it's just five
blocks away from Apple's iconic New York
Cube this Microsoft store opened Monday
and it'll be the flagship for all the
company's retail locations along with
the surface machines there are also
Windows computers on sale made by other
manufacturers like Dell as well as
Windows phones and wearables like the
Microsoft band and of course there's
plenty of software the second floor is
where you'll find Xbox one games two
demo
walls are covered in 30-foot long video
screens and there's also a lecture area
the helpdesk will assist with any
questions regardless of what device you
use so yes you can ask them how to use
office on an iPhone in a way this
investment is one big marketing tool for
Microsoft to better push Windows 10
products directly to consumers that's it
for this tech news update and there's
more at cnet.com from our studios in New
York I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
