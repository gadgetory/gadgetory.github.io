to the bus report the show about the
tech news that everyone is talking about
this week Yahoo's totally tacky CEO
break up The Bodyguard reimagined at
apple headquarters and Groupons IPO is
starting to look a little like a smoking
crater but there's good news up first
with the gadget of the week the gadget
of the week is the droid bionic at long
last after an almost nine month wait the
motorola super phone that was announced
at CES finally came out this week and
it's a whole new super phone now in fact
the only disappointment now is that it
doesn't make the Six Million Dollar Man
Bionic noise as its default ringtone but
it's a cnet editors choice it's the
first dual core phone to support
Verizon's 4G network it has a sleek new
form factor although it's roughly as big
as your entire face thanks to the 4.3
inch screen on it it has an 8-megapixel
camera HD video capture the mobile
hotspot feature Gingerbread and a beefy
new battery that will actually stand up
to the fact that it's a little tiny
supercomputer well I mean I guess tiny
is kind of relative I don't know I was
just hoping for a slightly bigger screen
just me and now for the news Carol Bartz
was fired as Yahoo CEO this week and in
her trademark style she told it like it
was she sent an email to employees that
said to all I am very sad to tell you
that I've just been fired over the phone
by Yahoo's chairman of the board it has
been my pleasure to work with all of you
and I wish you only the best going
forward Carol actually I can't believe
there weren't a few swear words in that
email cuz fired over the phone wow
classy guys anyway the phone firing
comes as yahoo has continued to make a
lot of money more than a billion dollars
in pure profit in 2010 and attract a lot
of users but it just didn't have any
focus or nerd love or shareholder trust
and then of course everyone immediately
started wondering whether Yahoo was a
takeover target although co-founder and
former CEO jerry yang told employees
that Yahoo is not for sale he said
everything is business as usual there's
going to buckle down and grow and grow
and even though the board seems like it
doesn't have a plan but fired the CEO
anyway it's all going to be fine I bet
they
totally bought that too oh yeah remember
that one time in the bathroom when
Microsoft wanted to marry you and I told
you to just take the damn ring Microsoft
ain't showing up in a limo like mr. big
girlfriend that ship has sailed Apple is
hoping to lock the barn door after the
horses went out to bars and left iPhones
in them the company has posted two job
listings for product security management
specialists I suggest they hire one guy
named stone and another guy named Killa
sprint has added its signature to a new
lawsuit intended to block the proposed
AT&amp;amp;T t-mobile merger meanwhile another
hearing on the merger proposal is
happening September 21st in Washington
where AT&amp;amp;T is expected to continue to
argue that the merger will be nothing
but awesome sauce and unicorn breath if
you would only just listen what are you
not understanding here it's also clear
don't you see this is like the part of
the wedding where the priest says does
anyone have any objections to this Union
and then every single hand in the church
goes up not just the one ex-boyfriend
who drank too much before the wedding
everyone groupon has cancelled its IPO
roadshow after reports the company might
have violated the SEC quiet period rules
when its CEO wrote this big internal
memo about how great they are and then
that memo is immediately leaked to The
Wall Street Journal because that's not
what quiet period means the company is
reportedly thinking about delaying its
IPO because the market has been so
volatile lately also because of all the
reports that they're losing money and
users at a seriously alarming rate also
because of reports that their 30 year
old CEO is totally arrogant thinks the
rules don't apply to him and is going to
ride his steed of hubris right into the
ground and take the whole deals business
with him I bet quiet period sounds kind
of good to them right now
and finally let's have a look at what's
clogging the tubes I've been ignoring
the entire story about Michael Arrington
and TechCrunch because I don't really
care that much and it kind of feels like
Valley inside baseball stuff but it
turns out if it's big enough for the
crew at the Taiwanese news animation
desk it's big enough for me chiming
photochemical yelling don't i see cool
cool on Pine Hollow TechCrunch por
diente de mayo and Kenta mighty AOL
young Don Quixote me crazy late uncle's
eating crunch fund hondata I told Zach
and Jonna Arlington you Charlie home
just and preggers your country Sahara

OSHA Pocoyo should hold their annual
income to AOL sante amo Saddam vampire
