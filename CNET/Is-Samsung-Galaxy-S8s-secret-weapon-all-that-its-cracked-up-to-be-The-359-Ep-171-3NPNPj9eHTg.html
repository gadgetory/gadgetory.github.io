you will be talking about Samsung not
Trump samsung's galaxy s 8 and the the
qualcomm snapdragon chip powering it

so will break down whether or not that's
such a big deal i will also talk about
super bowl and v are you excited bout
that i will not be watching it in VR I
will not either um I don't even know if
I'll be watching the Super Bowl we'll

yeah not my own poop or somebody not
another adult poop just to look kid
that's like an another to monday party
oh it's a it's definitely a party of a
different sort not that fun lastly we'll
be talking about walmart and its
decision to kill shipping past shipping
pass yeah it's a it's basically damron
prime clone yeah yeah um and walmart
taking a little digging amazon right
throw a little shade but I little yeah
little little or a lot yeah yeah a lot
well which is funny cuz if I'm walmart
I'm not throwing shade at amazon I'm I'm
scared well yeah that that explains why
they tried to clone it there you go and
then it was just as much tangled thing
they're like to yoga yep and they put
out misery yes alright so as always
you've any questions leave them in the
comment section Brian given both we will
try our best answer them and yeah well
we'll enter them in four minutes or so
or so or so trying to keep it in four
minutes alright 59 let's get this
recording underway and here we go in
exactly three two one
welcome to the 359 where we talk about
the top tech news of the day and other
crap we throw in I'm Roger Cheng I'm
Alfar nang so samsung's galaxy 8 is
still a few months away but there's
already bustering about one critical
feature the inclusion of Qualcomm's
latest Snapdragon 835 chip it's built
with a smaller architecture so
theoretically should run a lot faster
and be more power efficient longer
lasting a sharper smarter phone we're
gonna see a bunch of these phones
launched in another month or so at
Mobile World Congress not the GSA but
budgeted other phones LG what we're
thinking about a role it's gonna have a
phone nokia another blackberry all these
phones will not have the latest chip
there'll be sort of content to use last
year's chip and so Samsung will get kind
of this exclusive run do you think
that's a big deal i think it i don't i'm
not sure how big of an improvement it
will be right no one knows yeah exactly
i was at the Qualcomm's summit that they
had really showed off all the features
for the Snapdragon 835 and you know if
all they're saying is true then yeah
it's gonna be a major deal but the fact
is you know as our colleague Jessica
wrote in a story you know it's new chips
aren't always the the the end all be all
right they're not always as you know
they're they're oftentimes the hype
around these chips or don't meet reality
and yes there are loads of features
available in a 35 samsung may not use
all of them you know to kind of keep
costs down to make sure that it's you
know it's still a reasonably affordable
high-end phone they may not use all the
different features whether it's you know
quick charge 4k ultra HD premium video
you know more batteries to facial
recognition and particularly with a
quick charge I have to imagine that
Samsung is going to be easing off on
something a quick charge stuff right
you're gonna play a little bit safe when
it comes to the battery I mean I they
did pretty fine with quick charge a
three-point Oh though this is just an
update to that and that's the thing a
lot of these features are basically it's
an improved version of what it already
had I think that's why all these
companies that aren't Samsung are kind
of content with using the old ship save
a lot of money
in the future yeah I mean that's a
telling sign to me that you know these
companies are saying we're just gonna
stick with the old one yeah I talked to
a couple these OEM who basically said
you know there's still a lot of runway
on the last year's chip we still haven't
fully used at that the potential of
these processors and so we'll see really
for normal people you're not going to
notice a difference right so next up the
superbowl will be televised but it'll
also be shown in virtual reality Terry
Collins breaks down this deal that live
like has struck with Fox Sports to offer
pivotal moments from the big game in
virtual reality you know it's just sort
of the latest in this broad trend of
everything going into VR what do you
think I mean unless it's literally live
like you you're gonna but it's saying
it's you know showing the highlights
yeah it's more highlights yeah so it's
not gonna happen live and then I think
by the time it's available you're not
gonna be interested in any way I always
feel like interest in super bowl goes
you know then the game happens and then
it's over and then said well yeah you
know the results and that's it like what
do you care how these highlights better
be amazing for you to you know watch
them and then think I gotta see this in
VR well if you mean you're hardcore
Falcons or pats fan you might watch at
the stuff out otherwise yeah all right
lastly Alfred what's going on walmart so
Walmart had its um shipping pass uh you
know basically killed off and if you're
not familiar of shipping past it was
basically amazon prime but you paid
fifty dollars a month right for free
two-day shipping they decided to get rid
of that and instead basically if you
order anything that's more than
thirty-five dollars you get free
shipping over that right and basically
they're saying you know two-day shipping
it's it's very hard to maintain which
amazon has also had problems with right
so there you know basically cutting it
for for cheaper deal and if threw a
little shade of at amazon basically
saying you shouldn't charge a membership
for two days shipping yeah so alright
for more about these stories check us
out on cnet i'm roger j I'm out for dang
thanks for listening
so who are we rooting for in the
superbowl guys I can't say I'm waiting
for the not Patriots I would yeah I
would say the the Falcons I guess life
by default I don't care about the
Falcons at all but I don't want the pats
to win I'm a huge fan of the United
States not are not Patriots that's my
favorite tea and all of the NFL are our
own and remorse are the head of our copy
desk is a hardcore Pats fan so yeah
don't don't say that around I mean I'm
really not all invested I just a joke uh
I don't know just I'm even less
interested less invested in this game
than ever before well what about MDR no
well I mean I'd like to experience that
to be kind of neat I superficially by
the way it's not like it's not like
you're experiencing it you're not in on
the field experiencing in VR I think
you're just like your the sideline so I
right yes I said box right there yeah
like a nice woman on boxee so that's way
up it's probably just like glorified
like 360 video probably yeah no no
totally as you turn around you can see
the crowd chattering to the field some
people give their right arm for that
they never get that go to the selections
I'm just bothered whenever somebody
calls it like VR but it's just 360 video
yeah yeah because to me like the
threshold review our is a marketing
gimmick you don't like interact with it
and things like that kind of like the oh
yes you have a much higher threshold
grab everyone else in the industry image
just 360 video like we could we have a
360 like like hammer don't we sure can
we just say like all of it is in let all
our like videos rvr now if we just
record off of that I mean 360 is just
not as sexy of a term yeah yeah but it
just don't call it what it's not fair
enough all right let's jump back into
Samsung Antoine Antoine in the chat says
I'm a note fan but these past years I've
been I was not convinced about the
phablet why the hell do they keep
removing stuff from the note and not add
new stuff to the old ones I'm a little
confused Antoine could you maybe clarify
that I think you're heading in the right
direction to be a really good
conversation point but we need a little
push so what exactly are you angry about
in terms with the elimination of
features because as far as I know no
problem the know today was they packed
in so many features no note 7 then oh
sorry the note 7 some of the note 8
I know I think he's he's gonna have to
clarify yeah please aunt juanita I don't
want to speak for him um yeah um so the
the walmart 50 bucks a month are you
kidding me when you're paying a hundred
bucks a year for amazon that's another
arrows 50 bucks a year oh i thought you
said a month you don't it's basically
okay so Lisa stop I'm its Jets have the
price of amazon prime it's a guarantee
two-day shipping but that's gone now
yeah no one really cared no one really
yeah it has like Walmart's offerings
really its library isn't not as
extensive as a mess right and the other
and look years passing and a bed is
broken this down the past like Walmart
is does not they kind of kind of care
about online sales but not really
considered core sales are still getting
next door so they traditionally have not
really spent a lot of time and money
investing in that business in making
their online business as robust as being
in the store they've changed I mean I
think they're changing that now buying
gedcom trying to trying to get
themselves more modern but yeah I mean
that there's it's not a surprise that
this programs and then the other issue
is is basically you know fifty dollars a
year is not sustainable for two day
shipping right for Walmart yeah yeah I
mean one more I think walmart there was
an aggressive introduction I really
thought you said a month no and I would
have been that that's crazy yeah that's
crazy as wait that was that's like that
it's funny Fresh Direct offers very
similar thing now it's like a think my
wife pays like hundred bucks and now she
gets I think one or two day shipping
you'd better get your ass or easier than
one or two days yeah no but the whole
point is like they're doing like a prime
type member yeah they never did that
before they do I thought okay guys it's
new to me as he the American populace
becomes less and less likely to leave
their homes yeah I've still yet to do
freshdirect i don't i don't like oh just
wait till you have a kid I don't get
that its client groceries like not at
the store cuz like I like to see and
touch the food again just wait till you
have a kid they're like leaving your
apartment takes like 45 minutes and it's
not cool circling back on the sand sauna
Cedric and the chat wants to know have
they mentioned if it'll have a headphone
jack
for the essay yeah I would suspect that
they will have a headphone jack I think
it was a big selling point with the node
7 when that came out and it you know
it's a chance for samsung to knock Apple
which they never miss a chance to knock
Apple touche and then there's also been
a lot of like leaks I mean these are all
rumors but right there there's been like
phone cases that have been shown around
before they you know s8 that does have
the headphone jack in it so yeah I would
imagine us pc though not not micro us
now but yeah headphone jack yeah sidebar
to this chris wants to know if anybody
knows when the nougat update is coming
to s6 edge+ in the UK we having a very
specific added solely specific we have
no idea no idea you'd have to ask
samsung and the carrier at in UK because
it's usually a mix of the two where is
the fingerprint scanner on the essay is
it on the back I imagine will be in the
back here we have a few people in the
chat are gonna be disappointed but very
similar to i believe the actual LG phone
the pixel an old HTC phone they all had
the thing a princess er back I don't why
you actually don't mind it cuz that you
that seven is on the front though yeah
but the remove if they're removing the
home button everything ok I'm making the
screen larger then that makes sense to
remove all the physical buttons on the
front put whatever whatever scanners in
the back because you kind of hold it
like that anyway like I've no it's not
like with a pixel that I use it's pretty
natural to just tap the back and unlock
your phone Paul was ambitious and the
chat and says they should put dual
fingerprint scanners on the front and
the back yeah yeah that makes no sense I
mean it's a natural hold if you do that
yeah exactly oh that's just why yes you
can put it all the things you want but
you know I caught one costs money takes
up real estate those are factors you
don't really want to mess with rice make
it ten fingers yeah we're at it I mean
yeah if you really want to i guess you
could you could add one of the back and
could turn the volume rocker into a
fingerprint sensor you could you'd have
one of the top and on the bottom just
basically any way you touch it yeah the
fingerprint scan was the entire body
that would be kind of cool like the
entire frame there's a finger printed
palm scanner do we have an idea about
price yet any ballparks i would imagine
similar you know last year the year
before six fifty seven hundred dollars
yeah you've been on the ball of the the
Price is Right styling with this stuff
you guess the Nintendo switch yeah man I
got it I gotta get on that show press is
right I would kill input well that's not
true it was anything tech related I'm
yeah yeah it's like refrigerator of like
uh refrigerator is tech now that's true
member CES yeah you're right it's
smarter than we are yes yes uh things
are smarter than we are though Touche um
let's see before we call the day let's
put our bets down for the super bowl man
