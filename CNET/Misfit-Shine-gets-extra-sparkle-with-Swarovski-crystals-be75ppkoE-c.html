with Vanessa from CNET and one of the
more interesting partnerships is misfit
who already makes fitness trackers that
pair with a bunch of accessories
bordering on jewelry are now pairing and
working with Swarovski and this
partnership has produced the misfit
Swarovski shine this is actually jewelry
in a variety of different forms Lakes
pendants and there is a jeweler off ski
crystal that is bonded onto the hardware
here these are going to be available in
March and packages for the Swarovski
shine start at $170 to a 250 they
include a workout tracker a rubberized
band they are water-resistant to 50
meters and they're also these
accessories which work at the original
misfit shine and yeah I'm not an expert
on jewelry and you are we this is
actually the the first wearable that I'd
actually wear out so misfit was already
one of the popular ones for women
because they're more the more subtle
ones and they track your sleep and your
exercise like you said but they tend to
be you know wearable for us so I'm glad
that the technology world is finally
catering to us women with some shine
well these also have one more wrinkle
coming out later in the year is a violet
crystal misfit that generates its own
power it has an energy harvesting
crystal this patented technology is a
solar collector that uses the crystal to
bend light in and sustain its own energy
which is minutes of daylight charging at
a time so this is kind of the beginning
of embedded wearable technology that
doesn't look like wearables at all
pre-orders are on misfit calm now it's
gonna be available retail stores
Swarovski in Hong Kong the US and China
and it's also gonna be available in
Swarovski calm from CES I'm Scott Stein
and I'm Vanessa Adriana</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
