new phone especially when you're on a
budget your heart says iPhone but your
wallet says previously owned flip phone
so if you find yourself looking at
low-cost phones you know nothing about
just know that it's a dangerous position
to be in and thankfully Sina can help
you spot the duds Donal Bell and in this
top five we're counting down the top
five cell phones to avoid for 2013
ranked by C net associate editor Lin lah
starting off at number five the Alcatel
authority on Cricket Wireless this is
the newest phone on this list making its
debut back in March which begs the
question why the hell isn't running
Android 2.3 maybe they thought you
wouldn't notice on that crappy 800 by
480 resolution screen but more likely
they couldn't get anything more recent
than Gingerbread to run on their sad
little processor don't let the name fool
you a toddler with an iPhone 3G can
wield more authority than this thing at
number four the Huawei verge on MetroPCS
now I actually like this phone it's a
conversation starter the conversation
going something like hey do you want to
see my DeLorean I just traveled here
from 1998 seriously it looks like you
mugged someone's grandma took her phone
I said I am cheap and $49 with no
contract sounds like a pretty good deal
if I ever needed a phone to smuggle into
prison or organize a meth lab the Huawei
verge is at the top of my list I can't
say the same for number three the
pancake hot shot on Verizon this guy's a
holdover from last year's list but
people are still buying it so let's go
over this again even if they pay you to
take this phone you're still paying too
much for it when you factor in the
two-year contract with Verizon for a
phone that can't even use Verizon's 4G
network the processor is ancient the
operating system is this weird
proprietary thing that's void of any app
that you might want and the screen aside
from being laggy and sometimes totally
unresponsive has a resolution lower than
the first Apple Newton this thing is a
disaster and we're only halfway through
the list
coming in at number two the ZTE anthem
for Jian MetroPCS if the thought of a
no-contract 4G Android phone for $200
sounds too good to be true you're right
the spoiler here is that the whole thing
is bottlenecked by a slow 1.2 gigahertz
processor and 512 megabytes of RAM so it
might be 4G coming to the phone but the
overall speed is still stuck in 2010 and
so is this operating system
here's another recently released phone
that's still running Gingerbread on the
upside it does come pre-installed with
Kung Fu Panda 2 you can tell your kids
that star wars episode 7 if you want
since they'll be wincing at that 800 by
480 resolution screen now before we get
to our number one worst phone of 2013
let's remind ourselves what good phones
look like our current top pick over at
seen its list of the best five phones is
the Samsung Galaxy s4 $200 on contract
available everywhere stunning screen and
it runs the latest greatest version of
Android
instead of Kung Fu Panda 2 this thing
comes with Dignity alright and now for
the number one phone in 2013 that you
should avoid like the plague the ZTE
groove on Cricket Wireless when we first
got this phone we assumed that it was
one of those slide-out keyboard deals
but no turns out that this phone is just
big and ugly it's also like a greatest
hits of everything we hated about the
last four phones a stale version of
Android crappy screen slow processor
ugly design and bad call quality to this
groove is one that I would be happy to
lose alright that's it you've been
warned five phones that will make you
sad and curse your life for a phone that
you're going to love check out CNS
