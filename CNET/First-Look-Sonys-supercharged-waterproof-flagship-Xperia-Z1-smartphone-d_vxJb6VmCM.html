a look at the Sony Xperia z1 it's sony's
latest flagship smartphone packing a
20.7 megapixel sensor a sleek aluminium
frame and the same waterproof design
we've seen before on the Xperia Z like
the experiencer before it the z1 has got
a 5 inch display with a full 1080p
high-definition resolution so sony says
it's updated the display with the latest
technology from its bravia line of tvs
which promises better saturation and
higher contrast difficult to tell
exactly how that compares under these
lights but it certainly does look quite
good like the experienced it before it
and indeed the tablet said the z1 is
completely waterproof you can submerge
it to a depth of one-and-a-half metres
for up to 30 minutes best of all though
it's taken away the flap over the
headphone jack meaning you don't have to
undo it every time you want to use your
headphones so it's running on a 2.2
gigahertz quad-core processor which
should make this thing seriously
powerful luckily sony has paired that
with a 3000 milliamp an hour battery
which should keep this thing going for a
while our launch is busy dois will be
running Android version 4.2 point2 it's
a bit of a shame because that isn't the
most recent version of Android that's
4.3 but sony has said that an update
will be on its way although hasn't yet
said when that will be one of the most
exciting additions to this phone is the
camera on the back now this is a 20.7
megapixel sensor which is really very
high resolution in fact sony claims
that's the highest resolution you can
currently get on an android phone now
both the sensor and the glass have been
made slightly bigger which should allow
it to take in more light sony reckons
it's going to be quite good in low-light
especially with the biomes image
processor but it has behind it having
been able to give it a full test yet so
I'll really have to see how it works
when we give it the full review so there
we have the z1 there's no official word
from so many on price yet we are
expecting it to be somewhere around the
price of the Xperia Z probably around
the 500 pound mark now it's due to come
on sale in the UK surely after its law
Aoife on the fourth of September we
haven't got any word on global
availability yet so make sure to keep it
cnet for all the latest news I'm Andrew
Foyle and this is the Sony Xperia z1</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
