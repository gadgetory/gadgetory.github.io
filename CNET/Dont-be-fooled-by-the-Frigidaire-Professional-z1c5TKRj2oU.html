standing next to the frigidaire
professional seven court programmable
slow cooker now this is a very fancy
looking device it's got this really
classy stainless steel finish on the
outside and these glossy chrome handles
and this nice glass lid here it's a very
attractive looking device it looks good
and it's meant to sort of class up the
humble slow cooker and they've
accomplished that I give my kudos to the
Frigidaire design team it does good
looking appliance but I have to say the
design is not terribly user-friendly
take the handles they look good but
there's nothing separating them from the
really hot exterior of the slow cooker
so when you're grabbing it your fingers
early fit all the way in to begin with
and they're going to get bunched up and
get burnt several times I had to pick up
this unit while it was hot and I burnt
the back of my fingers and my knuckle I
didn't have that problem with other slow
cookers that all seem to figure out that
you needed to have a small little patch
of plastic or something protecting you
there from getting burnt when you pick
it up on top of that the slow cooker
just lacks a lot of the type of features
we would look for in an upgraded unit
something you're paying more than 50
bucks for this cost $99 that's a lot for
a slow cooker and it doesn't have a vent
for a meat thermometer it doesn't have
locks on the lid so you can travel with
it there's no place to wrap the cord in
the back there's just a lot of things
that are missing that I wish that had as
for the features that the Frigidaire
Professional does have I'm not sure when
I would use them for instance take a
look at the presets on the front of the
machine you've got low medium high and
soup modes now I guess media makes sense
as an extra if you're low is too low
you're high as too high but still that's
kind of pushing it and then I don't know
that I need a dedicated soup mode on top
of that you've also got warm and buffet
moves those are two separate modes that
both just keep your food warm as opposed
to cooking it do you really need two of
those the bottom line is that this is a
good-looking appliance that just doesn't
really have a lot of depth it doesn't
have a lot of smart features or
thoughtful design it just looks nice and
it does basic slow cooking fine but so
does a twenty-dollar slow cooker so you
don't really need to splurge on this
thing I'd rather have that much more
affordable slow cooker than this now if
you don't want that $20 slow cooker if
you want something a little nicer I say
the sweet spot is somewhere around 60
bucks where we found the Hamel
beach slow cooker that we tested and the
crockpot both of those were great and
they work well they're also more
affordable than this you want something
really nice you can go for the ninja
three-in-one cooker which will double as
an oven or stove top got mixed results
in our test it's worth a look for cnet
I'm right Chris</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
