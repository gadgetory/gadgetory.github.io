Senate and Tec Republic's cracking open
we're live on the scene at stage at CES
2018 and instead of taking something
apart this time today I'm going to be
putting something back together with our
help of I fix it right here so now if
you're the owner of an iPhone you've
probably heard about Apple rolling out
an iOS update that slows down the
processor on older phones with weak
batteries right now Apple says they did
this to prevent the phones with worn-out
batteries from randomly shutting down
unfortunately they didn't really tell
anyone that they were doing this which
made a lot of people angry because they
may have bought a new iPhone when all
they needed to do was replace the
battery now the uproar has been so
intense that Apple issued a rare apology
and lowered the cost of battery
replacements from old or for older
phones from 79 to $29 now if you don't
want to wait for Apple to do the job you
want to just save a few bucks or you're
the person that likes to do it yourself
and we're gonna show you just how easy
it is to do I'm here with Chris bras
from iFixit who's going to show us how
easy it is to replace your own iPhone
battery now Chris thanks for coming down
thanks Bill thanks the opportunity all
right so tell me a little bit about what
you've got here what type of iPhone do
we have and what's in this box over here
sure well thanks for the great lead-in
you hit all the relevant points about
why we're here and why we exist well
what we've got today is I've got an
iPhone 6s here today which is a pretty
popular model of the phone as we know
and we're going to take this apart into
a battery replacement on it and
do-it-yourself battery replacement I
brought with me today one of our battery
replacement kits that's available from
ifixit.com that has everything you need
in it and tools parts and along with our
guides that are free online you'll be
able to do your own battery replacement
just with this simple kit great and just
as a little bit of a preview we actually
have something special for everyone here
in the audience at the CNET stage at the
end of the segment right that's correct
little surprise at the end alright great
so let's get started sure
so we've got an iPhone 6s here and well
with all the recent news everyone's
interested in knowing whether or not
they need to change their battery and of
course you can gauge the health of your
battery currently if you connect to a
Macintosh with the cocoanut application
to gauge the the usage of your battery
so far to give you an indication of
where it is and of course if you're
already experiencing recurring recharge
times because the battery is not lasting
as long you might be able to tell
already you need okay right and of
course runnings more slowly than it used
to and it's a couple years old yeah I'd
be time to do this man interestingly
before Apple made this announcement it
was my 14 year old son who told me how
slow my phone was run and I didn't
realize why all right he was right cool
it is the battery so what we're gonna do
today is we're gonna unbox on one of our
parts and tool kit for a battery so you
can see what's inside containing all the
components we need then we're gonna go
ahead and carry this phone all right
let's we're back together show me what
you've got in the box so again this is
our our kit that contains everything we
need and these kits are available on
ifixit.com and of course Apple has
reduced the cost of a battery repair
from $79 to $29 but I fix it we're
selling all of our battery kits lower
than that a lot to make it easier for
the customer and so we'll open up the
box here and we start with something a
little you got this little attaboy okay
you do it right right and inside we
really got two parts to this there's our
repair tools which are all the tools
we're gonna need and then we've got the
repair parts okay all right we'll take a
look inside and see what we got here as
well this is also a very technical part
here as well a tool this is the whole D
up e but I'll show you how that works in
a few minutes so I'll unbox these couple
of elements just so we can see what
we've got
now while you're doing this I don't
wanna stop you keep going but what are
some of the safety precautions that
people need to take before they do this
sure well a couple of things one for
sure you want to backup your data if the
phone is still functional you want to
make sure you connect to itunes and make
sure you have a full backup of all the
data just in case something goes wrong
or just in case you you know having
issues during the repair um you also
want to make sure that if the phone is
functional that the
battery is drained as much as possible
ideally below 25% or lower as we all
know people have a justifiable fear
about lithium-ion batteries exploding
however the operation we're gonna do
today is perfectly safe to do and the
last charge in the battery to safer it
is okay so we want to take those two
main precautions all right great in
addition if you happen to be in a space
where you have a proper ESD clean
workspace that is ideal of course here
on the stage we don't have that set up
we can't do that but I do have today
with me a magnetic mat which allows us
to work on and keep all of our parts
safe in one location while we're taking
it apart all right so we've got our
tools already open and then we've got
the parts we're gonna need our battery
is right here and a couple of other
accessories our adhesive strips are also
here as well all right now how long do
with this job take sure for for a DIY
repair the very first time you've
attempted this we estimate between 50 15
minutes to 1 hour to complete the
battery replacement ok but for a pro
like you 15 minutes on well we'll see so
in my kid here I've got all the tools
I'm gonna need for this repair you can
see here we've got a couple of driver
bits a driver a pry tool a spudger one
of our very important tools here and the
tweezers and a suction cup those are all
the tools that we need and now what are
some of the reasons that people would
want to do this themselves besides just
being a do DIY er sure well of course
there's that aspect that people want to
repair their own things currently you
have the option of going to an Apple
store and Apple Authorized service
provider to have this work done but the
interweb seems to be telling us that
there are very long wait times in some
cases and some supply problems in fact I
think it was mentioned just today that
Apple has a shortage of 6s plus
batteries so that's a kind of an issue
if you don't want to wait weeks or
months to have the repair you can do
this in an hour yourself just after
receiving it from us great alright well
let's get started
sure so let's take a look and see what
we need here well with the 6s you know
Apple has done a few things to make it
hard for us to get inside and they
started with creating their own
proprietary pentalobe screws we remember
those from a couple of years ago and
well we know that they put those screws
in to prevent us from getting in because
once we get inside they're all standard
Phillips screws now iFixit created us
tool the Pentonville driver specifically
to be able to get at these and so we're
gonna go ahead here and pick out one of
our bits that we need which is our
pentalobe bit and got it right here and
this bit will allow me to take out the
two screws on the bottom of the phone
that are really securing the display in
and these are right on either side of
the lightning connector that's directly
in this magnetic map that I showed you
is really nice because you can place
each particular component in the same
orientation that you pulled it from
without the screws rolling onto the
floor and these are screw line to find
them now replaceable where participants
are available however you don't want to
lose anything during the repair so I
pulled the two screws from the bottom
now what I need to do is acknowledge
that there's an adhesive strip that
Apple has placed around the perimeter to
this screen in the frame that holds that
display in as well as some clips that
are along the sides so what we need to
do is release the display slightly and
get under the display and release those
clips so we can get at it and what are
those seals for so those seals are
primarily for waterproofing and in fact
I believe that seal was not in the six
and started in the cigs and asks if I
recall and so what we're going to do is
we're gonna use a suction cup here and
on this particular phone we're gonna
want to place the suction cup about in
that location just a not over the home
button but just at the bottom of the
screen and a clean screen okay will help
us adhere better and if your screen is
shattered which is a common problem
these days clear packing tape over the
top of the screen will create a surface
that this can adhere to and that's one
of the safety precautions when you're
doing this you want to make sure that
you don't crack the screen so don't
press you don't have to press really
hard to get this to stick yeah that's
correct in fact this is all about
finesse and using the correct amount of
pressure and for a first-timer this can
be a little intimidating that's for sure
but let me show you how the process
works so we want to make sure we have
good suction on there and we do and my
goal now is with those two screws
removed is simply to lift until I can
see a small gap I know this won't show
well on camera
I can see a small gap forming now just
above well I've asked my suction just
above the headphone jack on the bottom
of the phone there's actually a little
notch right there that's what I'm after
as my entry point my suction keeps
losing suction there but let's see we
can get that up okay so I've got my
spudger tool and I now have it just
underneath the display and what I want
to do is move it and keep it horizontal
and begin to pry at the screen along the
edge first and then move back to the
bottom and do the same process on the
opposite side now obviously when you do
this you want to make sure that your
phone is off right that's correct thank
you for me missile in the first steps
after time out draining your battery I
should have obvious turned that phone
how are the complete when the phone is
powered on thanks for that so you can
see now that there's actually a gap
created that I've been able to do right
there so that's the first step and now
we can actually start to lift the
display off of the phone but when we do
that the adhesive strip that's around
there can make it a little bit
challenging so in this particular case
I'm going to go very slowly to begin to
lift the display excellent and I can
take my suction cup off right now and
now I should be able to with a little
finesse and equal force lift that
display right off indeed that's pretty
simple there we go another display
inside the phone yeah and there's a
perimeter adhesive that's hard to see
here but it's right inside the frame
that keeps that locked in as we were
referring to earlier now ideally we have
a special tool here that I was referring
to earlier called the hold yuppie tool
and in this particular case what we're
using is a rubber band around a water
bottle and what I'm gonna do is simply
support the display like this let's turn
this around this way a little bit so we
could show everybody in the audience a
little bit sideways I know it's a little
bit yeah I don't want to flex these
cables too much right but yeah we can
work on it like this if that works yeah
alright I think that looks good great ok
great
so we're holding the display up here
just to make sure that it stays out of
our way but we have some very important
cables here we don't want to flex
obviously or cause any additional damage
to right so now we're now one of those
cables go to those cables go through the
display the digitizer and the front face
and the camera right there and so we can
acknowledge the battery we see the
battery here now we know there's also
adhesives in the battery in and it's
very strong and that's what we're gonna
have to release and so one thing that we
don't have with us on stage here which
is a big help in these processes is heat
so this adhesive breaks down quite
easily with heat and we sell it to we'll
call the eye opener which is a gelatin
based device you throw in your microwave
for 30 minutes that heats up enough to
between 140 and 180 degrees that you can
place under the phone to heat that
surface and release some of that
adhesive it's like one of the neck pads
right or the there's iPads that you heat
up into Mikey and you can also use a
hairdryer or a heat gun if you calibrate
it properly to one for you don't want to
melt anything right 180 would be a max
and you don't need it that hot ok we did
a battery replacement two nights ago
here at the show on a cocktail table in
the bar area using a candle underneath
the phone to heat it I do not recommend
this to people at home but it worked ok
great so so what's the next step next
step in the phone right here is we're
gonna want to disconnect the battery
this is important because obviously
making sure there's no charge going to
the phone while we're working on it is
key there's a small shield that I
already removed kind of to facilitate
this for the camera that goes over the
battery here and it has two screws
holding in place regular Phillips very
easy to remove but then then I can't
hold this up for the camera right now
we're gonna want to remove the battery
connector the battery connector is right
here and you can use a spudger tool here
and the other anti-static tool or a
fingernail by anti-static we mean
plastic basically here or well yes
mother
okay so esd-safe plan okay pacifically
and that again referring to ESD these
tools are all ESD safe you can also use
your fingernail if you're necessary and
by ESD we're talking about electrostatic
discharge yeah oh thank you we don't
want any kind of static electricity like
don't walk across the carpet and zap
your phone because that can damage the
electronics correct so now I've just
removed the battery cable so I've
disconnected the battery now from the
phone ideally I want to try and move
this battery cable out of the way a
little bit so that it won't accidentally
reconnect while we're working on it so
now battery has been disabled although
this battery is well glued in there and
because I know that it's glued in there
I'm gonna have to use a little bit of
force to get it out because I don't have
my heat so I'm gonna go ahead and remove
the rest of the display right now so
that I don't screw that up in the
process so in order to remove the
display there's a small shield bracket
that goes over this component right here
with four small Phillips head screws
I've already removed that and we have
three different cables that we need to
now remove the camera the digitizer in
the actual display cable and they're
layered down so that you can pull them
out in the sequence in which they were
set up and again a spudger or a
fingernail can usually get under here
let's see getting a little closer I've
got two of the cables up and you want to
be really careful that you're removing
the cable and not the socket itself
these are fairly fragile but now all
three cables are loose believe it or not
that's all that's holding the display in
place so we can take our very high tech
pull the uppy tool remove it and the
display is now free that's it really
right so I know it's easy but the
display is now free and now we have
basically the chassis in the battery in
the motherboard so now we need to get
the battery out this is where applying
heat from iOpener would work great but
we don't have that here so what we're
gonna do first is kind of gauge how well
this battery is in here by just kind of
feeling around a little bit and seeing
if it's loose at all and it is not loose
at all
so we king of that adhesive you know our
devices in general getting more
difficult to repair that's a great
question
so
iPhone 10 that just came out actually
earned a repairability score of six from
us which is pretty good the reason it
didn't get better is because the back
glass display this phone receives a
seven score out of ten for repairability
which is actually quite good I think
most people would believe they're less
repairable than that but in fact though
this try this phone is a repair ability
of seven so the two adhesive strips that
are holding the phone in place we need
to remove those and it's a little hard
to see here but I'll show you they're
stuck right here and what we want to do
is try our best to release this tape I'm
using a tweezers here in this particular
case or a fingernail and if you need a
walkthrough of these the instructions
for all of these replacements they're on
the website correct on iFix its website
that's correct in fact a prerequisite to
doing this should be that you have a
computer open with our guide in front of
you we wouldn't want you to try this
without a guide unless you're a repair
technician who has done it many times so
right there I've pulled up the adhesive
cabs that are actually holding the glue
to the bottom now this is a little
tricky and this is where a little
finesse comes into play but we need to
now try and remove these adhesive tabs
by getting a good grip on it and
beginning to pull and ideally continue
to pull and pulling these horizontal
right I'm talking about us so if about a
sixty degree angle or so works best and
trying to keep getting to the root of it
as you stretch it you can see this thing
stretch to a couple feet in length and
it's only three inches long and these
are basically like those strips the
adhesive strips that you used to hang
things on your walls you work under the
same principle that's correct and so
okay we may have got there's the first
one completely now I'm not sure if I got
all of it but I got most of it and
that's really good if we don't get this
out we need heat to get that uh-huh
perfect I failed so so what do you do
now well this is where that finesse come
okay a little bit of force if I had heat
to apply I'd be applying heat right now
I don't have that so what I'm going to
try and do and in this case I actually
got the strip
farthest away from me out I wish I had
gotten this trip out because this is the
side we need to remove the battery from
so now I'm going to try and get under
this battery with either a spudger or a
pry tool to see if I can begin to to
lift it or free it in any way I don't
want to break the battery no no keep
going and I don't want to flex the
battery too much and I surely don't want
to puncture because it is a fire risk
absolutely right so what I'm gonna do is
I'm going to use my spudger in this case
just to get under it a little bit and
then I'm gonna use another extremely
high-tech tool that I brought with me
today which is my hotel key you can see
we use very high-tech tools and we use
really high-tech tools this is great a
very stiff card that you can use we also
sell a card specifically for this
purpose but again I want to make sure to
try and get under there as horizontally
as possible and begin to work that strip
and I'm I'm slowly feeling it out as I'm
going so while while we're removing the
battery does anybody in the audience
have a question just raise your hand
I've got a mic right here if you've got
a question for me if you've got a
question for Chris from I fix it nothing
like how much is the kid or how
difficult is it sure yeah what happens
to the adhesive once you kind of pry
everything open oh that's great quite
water proofing sure that adhesive is
wasted at that point and needs to be
replaced
so we have adhesive in the kit for you
both for the perimeter seal and for the
battery
it's single-use so looks like I've been
successful here or I'm half stuck but
pull out my tool and in fact I can see
the battery is going to come free here I
want to make sure that it comes free of
all other parts and components and it
did okay you can see the adhesive strips
on the bottom now these strips are
really good at not coming off but in
this case we would be taking this
battery out completely and recycling it
and a new battery doesn't come with the
strips on it so the battery is now free
this is ready to recycle all right so
let's get the new battery or we gonna
are we ready to put the new battery sure
are we sure so there we've got our case
so now let's look at our
that came with it here's our battery so
let's go ahead and open the package here
the anti step back I want to make sure
we get this in the time that we have
left here's that new battery and we've
got our adhesive for the battery as well
those strips that need to go on there so
let's go ahead and work the battery just
for a moment and get these strips on
now there's a placement kind of trick
with this we want to orient the battery
just like we know it's going to go in
okay so you're gonna stick these here
and and fold them around yeah that's
correct
flip the battery over and whoops we got
this back so while you're doing this I
just want to tell everybody you know
I've worked with Kyle Luke and everyone
I fix it for many years and I often use
their tools for my own cracking open
videos and not only does I fix it sell
the tools and the components to help you
repair your own devices they're big
advocates for making the electronic
devices that we use everyday easier to
repair so Chris I don't want to stop you
keep doing this but can we can you tell
everybody why it's so important that the
devices that we have are easier are easy
to repair or we can repair them
ourselves
well absolutely the reality you don't
keep going like yeah the reality is we
don't need to replace our phones every
18 months
we need to keep these out of landfills
and keep them functional for longer so
that's what we're really trying to do is
you know save the digital world one
device at a time so we've got the
battery in place I want to make sure
it's fitted into the space correctly so
I'll actually kind of wedge it in up
front make sure everything looks good
this is a single opportunity to stick
this correctly and we've got it in so
it's down the new battery is in the
battery is in we're gonna now we just
need to put everything back together
right correct it involves putting the
seals back on around the glass we're
gonna reconnect the display and then
we're going to reconnect the battery and
seal everything back up yeah that's
exactly correct and we can go ahead and
do that quickly I'm not going to
reinsert the perimeter different
interest of time let's go ahead and just
reassemble this if we can here and I'm
not connecting the battery yet we're
still doesn't that last yeah and we got
the connector off to the side so let's
get the display back in place first
this should go quickly for me and these
are really small the little ribbon
cables that hold the display through the
to the circuit board so you have to be
real careful when you push them down not
to tear them not to rip them because you
don't want to replace this screen as
well as just replacing the battery right
that's correct and while you're doing
this where can people actually get the
kits so you can get the kits out
ifixit.com
and all of our kits are currently
available including the ones that Apple
is apparently having a hard time
supplying right now and like any good
demo it becomes more challenging on
camera so I'm trying to reconnect the
digitizer display right digitizer cable
right now so if once you get these
reconnected so what's the next thing the
next step is we're gonna basically
button this phone up and put her back
together let's see if we can get to that
stage yeah if we can get there that's
great if not we can just show everybody
how we sort of reattach okay so now what
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go ahead and
reconnect my battery cable in this
particular case come on baby get in
there they are hard they're little bitty
they're little connector you know it
doesn't take very much to push them back
down your fingerprints are in we have
everything connected and we're gonna
slide the glass back down it's exactly
correct now the glass will go into place
and that new perimeter adhesive seal
would be in place right and as we set
this down again single use you want to
get it aligned correctly the very first
time
so now we'll put pressure from the back
so we've got a couple of clips we want
to clip in place and squeeze it shut and
work all the way to the front to screw
I'm gonna give it a big visual okay it
looks like we're in and we're all done
right that's it we got two screws to put
back in now these batteries come roughly
at about 50% charge or so typically but
you're gonna want to really go through a
full battery cycle once you do a force
restart the very first power on to drain
it all the way down and then charge it
all the way up now for a little
conditioning and we've got our other pen
a little screw and we'll be done alright
well Chris thanks for joining us here
now
see how easy that was now get out there
and fix your own iPhones</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
