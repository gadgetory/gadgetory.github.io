Waterman was used to describe a portable
music player as a cattle but Sony has
spent the last 15 years trying to revive
it all Sony has tried competing against
the iPod the new zxt is the first
high-end player to hit us Shores that is
going for smaller fry namely Astle and
Kern and hi-fi man this is a luxuriously
built and luxuriously priced Walkman at
eleven hundred and ninety nine dollars
and it builds on what Sony has learned
from its budget players and its
experience with the Android operating
system the player holds 128 gigabytes of
music with an additional microSD port
and will playback most file types
including Apple Lossless and DSD the
build quality is what you're mostly
buying here with a weighty feel in the
hand and nice big thick buttons that are
wisely indented to prevent being pushed
in your pocket
something the pono player could learn
from this is not a phone there's no sim
card but it does have Wi-Fi and so it's
already a step above its competitors
because it allows users to sample the
future of music listening - ringing from
services such as title if you've used an
Android phone before the ZX team will be
very familiar even if Sony has tried
almost unsuccessfully to make it not
look like a phone most apps will work
though surprisingly third-party music
players have been somehow deliberately
or accidentally gimped to not play
high-res files either way Sony wants you
to use its own inbuilt player sound
quality is the other part of the price
equation and as you'd expect it sounds
very good with bags of detail and bass
weight plus it has a great sound stage
for a portable it's a cut above cheap of
devices like the pono player and Sony's
own a 17 walkman is it worth 1,200 bucks
though it certainly feels like an
expensive device and the ability to load
streaming apps is a great bonus battery
life and it expected 33 hours of
high-res playback beats the pono player
by a factor of four if you're looking at
a high end media player and want
something more flexible than the audio
only competitors at the price then the
sony is definitely worth an audition
