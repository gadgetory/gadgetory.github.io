iPhones and we're sorting all the
conflicting rumors about the iPhone 10
are sales let's get right to the core of
this week's Apple news and rumors next
year's iPhones could look a lot like
this year's iPhones many reports at this
point including one from longtime Apple
analyst Michiko suggests that Apple will
be keeping the same three sizes of
devices in the three price tiers now
it's pretty disappointing considering
this was supposed to be the SEO for
Apple but in light of recent history
it's not surprising at least it's not
surprising to me before the iPhone 10
Apple retained the same general design
for three years in a row with the iPhone
6 6s and 7 so it comes as no surprise
now the latest 9 to 5 Mac report
suggests that one of these devices
likely the more expensive iPhone 10's
Mac's
could actually lose some weight thanks
to a new type of oled screen made by
samsung that would allow for a slimmer
lighter form factor now the report also
goes on to say that given production
limitations at this point it would only
be able to apply this change to one of
the three new models and obviously the
higher end heavier one makes the most
sense but even with this brand new OLAP
screen you'll probably still have to
deal with the knotch
on these new phones reports from Forbes
and nine-to-five Mac suggests that Apple
is having a hard time getting rid of the
notch on its newer devices because it
still means that shoe depth camera array
on the front for face ID now other
devices like the Oppo find and vivo NEX
have already figured out a way to make a
truly bezel s display and Samsung is
rumored to be working on an in screen
fingerprint reader that would also allow
it to be truly bezel as' but don't
expect this from Apple in 2019 now with
no major design changes to come and
apparently no smaller iPhone se to look
forward to that leaves little for Apple
to wow us with at least in terms of
phones of course the 2019 iPhones could
still have redeeming qualities like much
better battery life which is always
welcome or a much better camera welcome
just announced this new chipsets which
allows to have a blurred background
effect on video now that would be a
great feature for the next iPhones
even though Apple doesn't really you
welcome chips they also potentially
could switch to a USBC like the iPads
from this year but that wouldn't make as
much sense on an iPhone and they're also
said to be including better AR features
now whether or not it would be a
software update or hardware it's tough
to know kind of like AR kit to this year
which brought the measure app and
multiplayer support to the iPhones the
latest patent suggests AR feature is
being used for something that at least I
would use a lot more figuring out which
one is your ride seriously there's been
many times where I've either jumped in
the wrong car or scare the crap out of
poor drivers because I didn't know which
lyft or uber car was mine now the app
would allow you to point the camera and
figure out which one of the see of cars
is yours it would also work the other
way and allow drivers to pinpoint who
called the lift but the more exciting
changes to the iPhone could be coming in
2020 and sometimes it's worth taking a
look at the companies that provide the
materials for the iPhone to get a sense
of what we can expect from Apple's
devices take Intel for example the
company just announced its latest chip
which comes with 5g support now it's a
little too late to implement it in 2019
iPhones but definitely by 2020 this
would be a little further behind than
some of its competitors but by 2020
there will be a lot more network support
and 5g would actually make more sense on
an iPhone now let's take a look at
Corning the company that's been
providing the Gorilla Glass for the
iPhone since basically the Golden Age of
Steve Jobs and it's now working on an
ultra-thin foldable glass which we got a
chance to see for ourselves now again
it's still in early development phases
but it could potentially cover the next
generation of foldable devices including
one from Apple it's no secret that
companies like Samsung are starting to
adopt the foldable phone trend
announcing plans to make a foldable
device and Apple could be next and the
rumors about disappointing sales and
production cuts to the iPhone 10 are are
continuing to add up this week now Japan
displays the screen supplier is the
latest iPhone supplier to report that
it's cutting its forecast growth for
2019 this according to Forbes
and then we saw this report from
Bloomberg which actually says the
complete opposite and that two of
Apple's main suppliers are actually
reporting growth in the last month now
what does this all mean it means you
really can't trust the rumors and you
probably already knew that now the sad
thing is we probably will never really
know the truth to this matter
especially now that Apple's quarterly
earning reports will not include an
itemized breakdown of unit sales now
let's talk Apple watch last week Apple
finally launched the ECG app for the
Apple watch series for which we've been
waiting for since its launch and it's
already helping save lives it also
launched right alongside the irregular
heart rhythm notification that actually
comes to all Apple watches except for
the first generation with the update to
watch OS five point one point two that's
sexually the reason why we skipped last
week's episode of apple core I was able
to test out this feature early and I
took it to the doctor's office to
compare it to a traditional EKG reading
and it actually held up in fact it
showed that I had something somewhat
interesting about my heart that I'm
gonna have to get checked out later on
and apparently I'm not the only one
benefiting from this feature since its
rollout barely a week ago user IDI
dental on reddit posted that he had
received an atrial fibrillation
notification on his Apple watch
now the 46 year old was interviewed by
Good Morning America and he actually
said he'd been having chest pains
earlier this year and that the doctor
hadn't been able to diagnose it sooner
but that once he got the information
from the Apple watch along with his
hospital tests he was able to get a full
atrial fibrillation diagnosis and he
will now be getting treated so it could
have potentially saved his life and you
can expect a lot more health features
from Apple in the coming years the
company is rumored to be working on a
glucose and blood pressure monitor for
the Apple watch it also just got a
patent for biometric sensors in the air
pods that could be interesting in the
coming years and Apple has just released
its first sleep tracker since acquiring
the sleep tracking company Bennett in
2017 as of last Friday you can now buy
the Bennett 3.5 sleep monitor on the
Apple Store this
thing two millimeter strip that you put
under your mattress and it connects with
your iPhone and Apple watch and it can
measure things like your sleep time
obviously your heart rate your breathing
patterns your bedroom temperature and
your snoring but then again if you're
married you probably don't need a
tracker to tell you that your snoring
that does it for this week's show but in
the meantime I'm still collecting your
2019 wish list but what you most want to
see from Apple so let me know on the
comments section below or hit me up on
Twitter and come back next week for more
