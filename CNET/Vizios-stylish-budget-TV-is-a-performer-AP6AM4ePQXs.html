at the vizio m551 DTV if there's one
thing that might have prevented people
from buying a vizio TV in the past it's
that they looked cheap with massive
old-fashioned designs but with the new
em series video has finally delivered a
TV that looks a lot more expensive than
it really is this has a really thin
bezel and the company logo is very
subtle it looks like a tab in a browser
there are several other PC like touches
as well from the monitor like stand to
the notifications area and set up
windows but this is a TV and while it
does have an extensive apps selection
and wireless connectivity is designed to
let you watch stuff so to that end you
get an edge-lit panel with local dimming
for better blacks and a passive 3d
system if you're choosing between this
and the slightly cheaper e-series you'll
find that the M is capable of a more
natural looking picture it's local
dimming system is less aggressive than
the e-series and so shadow detail is
deeper and more realistic even though
absolute black levels aren't as good
color is also better on the m551 if a
little too saturated but it's still
better than the under saturated tones of
the e series for the money it's tough to
recommend another LCD TV which offers a
similar picture with only Sony coming
close at almost twice the price as such
the m551 is an excellent option if you
want a 55 inch LCD screen with good
image quality for around a thousand
dollars this has been ty pendlebury for
