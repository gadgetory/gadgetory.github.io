probably isn't the first thing that
comes to mind this guy's full name is
the halo plus smart smoke and carbon
monoxide alarm with weather alerts and
believe it or not it's worth considering
right alongside the popular nest protect
so you hear weather alerts and you might
think the last thing you need is a smoke
detector blasting in your ear whenever
it rains fortunately he'll are smarter
than that it lets you know about
inclement weather by flashing blue
telling you what's up and tuning to a
local weather station you can even fully
customize what weather events you want
to know about obviously this guy detects
smoke and carbon monoxide as well plus
it does all the basics you'd expect of a
smart detector it'll send you push
alerts and track your alarms history in
the app you can turn on a light and
change the color you can even turn on
party mode for some reason the light
isn't motion sensitive which is too bad
and halo doesn't work with this many
other smart home devices is nest but it
does work with Alexa and the Amazon echo
so you can turn on the light with your
voice it also works with smart home
platforms smart things and iris by
Lowe's so you can flash your smart bulbs
in case of emergency this guy is $130
versus a hundred for the nest protect
it's available for less without the
weather alerts but that's a big part of
its unique appeal to me and I'd call the
halo plus worth considering especially
if you live in an area that's prone to
inclement weather</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
