2015 right on the show floor just look
at some of the amazing indie games that
are on display this is objects in space
it's a space simulator game where we're
making out like the ship's our
submarines instead of planes so you're
navigating your ships from nebulas to
asteroid fields and trying to power down
systems to get stealthy and not be seen
by other ships instead of trying to
shoot our main window or something like
that if you want it's a point-and-click
interface where you select where you
want to go in space and let the
autopilot do the rest but if you wanted
to get really into the game you could
manually control every ship movement
yourself and try and only use exactly
the thrusters that you want at the right
time it's really down to the player the
same goes for repairing your ship if you
go to a starbase you can repent you
negate your ship repaired by just paying
someone else to do it or if you decide
to do it yourself you can open up each
individual module replace it with spare
parts and try and do some fearsome on
the on the fly repair jobs hi I'm
Jennifer Cail i'm from germany i work
with these guys on objects in space now
you actually put together the casings
and the controls object exposes oh we
had this fix idea you know we're like oh
yeah okay we could tell your showcase
what we can do what people can do with a
scheme later on so literally these are
just mdf nails and glue that's the three
dollars and it's actually people
controlling the game by video yeah we
can sitting in an electronic store
sitting on the floor with all these
buttons like oh yeah this is nice this
feels nice this feels nice what can we
do with this that's what we would have
been doing the last two weeks and of
course the idea is that people who get
the game can build these sort of things
up for themselves yeah that's the idea
so anyone who likes to do do
anyone who has a little bit familiar
with Arduino can do anything they want I
can build huge consoles people have
actually offered us money to to for us
to build them for them like oh my god I
don't know we only have those we have
not anticipated that maybe we'll do a
Kickstarter maybe we can do like special
editions where you can actually do kids
then you can purchase and fill them
yourself remember check out cnet com for
a lot more coverage on pax Australia
