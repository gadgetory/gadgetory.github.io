it's time for episode 192 of the 359
podcast and today we got a packed house
at Ben Fox Rubin I as akhtar and see
tomorrow Blanco thank you for joining us
hey to be here yeah coming in from San
Francisco and today we've got a pretty
full show to we're going to be talking
about a new research project from IBM
update on CIA vs WikiLeaks and also
whatever a leafy is yeah i think we
think you're trying to say Wi-Fi again
we something like that a goofy and I see
jeez and how it's gonna get you to buy a
phone I don't know send in your
questions and comments we'll get to as
many as we can at the end of the show
and let's let's break some hearts people
the ones been good podcast the one thing
been neglected to mention zo no swearing
I know it's gonna be hard it was about
to when you said that like literally she
was about to drop a couple F times oh I
can't school I'm you can but there will
be problems we can make it happen of me
whenever you're just whenever you're
ready and yes I have accidentally curse
on the show before yes several times you
trying to save Xiao Mei and it kind of
came out all wrong that's true yeah all
right hang on everybody will be back in
exactly three minutes and 59 seconds
from 32
welcome to the 359 I'm Ben Fox Rubin I'm
I as the wolf akhtar oh and we have a
special guest today xiomara Blanco from
the San Francisco office thanks for
joining us what up yo so get ready to
have your mind blown IBM researchers
found a way to cram data into a single
atom of home iam that I pronounce that
right that's why folium home IAM which
is apparently an element that i just
found out about this could allow you to
fit apple's entire music catalogue of 26
million songs onto a storage device the
size of a penny I was freaking psyched I
read this story i read the nature
article i didn't read the nature journal
article because that was a little dense
but the idea that you can take a single
atom and then flip its orientation to
have polarity and it's stable because
this was not possible before Magnus you
when you keep cutting them in half what
happens is their polarity becomes
unstable so you're trying to write data
to it it's kind of a bad idea but this
is insane it's also going to be done
like around under five Kelvin which is
really really cold whoa yeah right
psyched about this so this isn't coming
anytime soon though right no the IBM
researcher cousin Christopher lot
sending lots he said something like it's
gonna be decades before we see this in
like actual products because their idea
is to do the research to figure out what
can be done when you miniaturize
everything to a single atom that is just
crazy yeah I think what would I like
about this idea too is that you could
potentially store your entire personal
catalog which is like literally
everything about your life in a
SmartWatch or a ring or something like
that which granted is both good and bad
because it could get lost or stolen but
at the same time everybody's carrying
around more of their information it's
the black mirror episode with the grain
that's how it happened totally totally
seen the black mirror episode with the
grain oh no I just watched that sanjana
parrilla episode again oh it's a very
good one it's a very good my favorite
one so next the CIA wanted to take a
moment to say you're welcome America
after WikiLeaks disclosed a trove of the
CIA's hacking tools for phones and pcs
the spy agency responded unsurprisingly
by saying that it's a spy agency I love
it because it's like your mom being like
it's my
job to embarrass you it's like what if
we are it's what we're supposed to be
doing it's like okay I guess I my issue
with this is like how does do you think
that that posture will quell public
concerns like are people going to be
happy with how the CIA responded to this
i don't think they're trying to quell
concerns yeah they're like gonna like
him to your mom is the best because
they're not there to make you happy they
dare make sure that everything's okay
not necessarily if you're happy exact
with quotes air quotes if you could hear
that in the audio podcast okay according
to them you're gonna be your nation will
be healthy and safe so the CIA also
stressed that it's illegal for the
agency to spy on American citizens we
totally believe you that is entirely not
what WikiLeaks is going to disclose in
its next data dump but I don't know well
we'll say last one of the themes of mwc
this year was upgrading camera
technology because apparently that is
going to get you to buy a new phone and
it's also going to help dry an Instagram
and snapchat lovers this includes
creating new words for group selfies
like grew fee I hope I'm pronouncing
that right and rally fought we fee wife
wifey wifey we fee as hell Spanish
people pronounced Wi-Fi when they don't
know that it's pronounced Wi-Fi so LG is
pushing we fee and it's huawei pushing
goofy yeah right to see didn't you say
that this was like I see I see is the
word but you're supposed to nephi I mean
I don't call it an Essie but I knew of
the term I see which sounds better than
grew fee but sounds like roofie it's
they're very beautiful get the other for
a goofy nah I don't have been that
photos goofy if you want to read more
about these stories check us out on cnet
I'm Ben Fox Rubin my as the wolf akhtar
and I'm xiomara Blanco thanks for
listening
we have some skeptics in the chat go
figure with what we can we feet with
literally everything you're like it will
take off at I'm skeptical of all of our
fake news story now the atomic stories
you say we're not going to see this for
a long long long yeah what he said
except for Ricky who's as androids had
this since 2010 that's so yeah it's
already they've done and it's readable
so it was stable for several hours it
was save them for several hours that's
the start yeah so yeah and they even
said it won't be commercialized for
several decades because IBM and the
other researchers behind it this is the
beginning of this right and it's a huge
leap forward as as mentioned in stephen
shankland story a hard drive today takes
about 100,000 atoms to store a single
single bit of dating single single
stinking bit of data which is a one or a
zero this drink sit down to literally
one atom which could be a massive
massive leap forward in atomic storage
but granted yeah it could take a while
but do people even like store stuff
anymore like isn't everything going to
the cloud this is a fantastic question
yeah so basically I'd imagine when you
want the offline mode you get everything
and then you ain't you can resync when
you're back online assuming that there's
ever an offline in the future cuz like
the whole thing is like you can store
apple musics entire catalog but it's
like I don't even download music anymore
so what's going to happen I still
imagine that it would be for like
imagine PlayStation 72 and your debt you
downloading everything you can have like
every game available and load time
should be like nothing I'd imagine
assuming this thing doesn't like explode
on you but I think this could also have
positive implications for the cloud
right because all those giant cloud
storage facilities that Amazon and
Google and Microsoft have been building
those could potentially shrink down or
at least not get gigantic because
there's going to be so much more storage
that we're going to be creating every
single day that's already been happening
so the prospect of having something like
this at least ensures that we're not
going to like just end up being covered
in a mountain of data that we're not
going to be able to control or be able
to even store everywhere shaking data
servers I like that idea yeah or he's
keeping same size and store every
ever wherever or is Ricky points out in
the chat porn well yeah I have and
there's a lot of porn on the internet
and we need to make sure that we secure
it properly you gotta buy it up the
atomic storage so Thank You Ricky take
the arts just thinking about like Menace
Arts paintings like this is pornographic
and it's like when I was like now it's
art yeah maybe I want to go back to this
mobile world congress thing by the way
do you really think that people would
buy a one phone over another phone
because it takes better group selfies
yes no ok we have a controversy on our
hands I'm letting the Samsung thing with
Ellen on while ago like if you can fit
all those people women like the Oscar
photo it's like that's like the first
time I use one of these I'm like okay
that's so everyone get really close
which is awkward if you want to be I
exactly which we do constantly we can't
taking selfies me and Ben it's just not
a really good thing but guess that's a
goofy excuse me it's not so easy it's a
twofer to fee and there and the and the
rails just why not we just went off how
to tape the idea of a third party selfie
like that's a photo you heard that right
yes sir party self seen that many times
anyway so you think people would if you
think they wouldn't go for a camera I
mean a camera that has a wider angle
lens as a decision making I think if
it's just a package with a great camera
the way like the iphones just been
riding the camera wave-like great phone
but really great camera I think that's
just how things are moving like the
camera is the biggest feature yep and
it's natural to improve on that with the
wider angle with the better lens with
all these features but for someone to
like pay 500 600 dollars for a new phone
because it's going to take better photos
of them with their friends I just maybe
I don't want to believe in that work was
really one of the things when all things
are equal you like of it they're all
androids all Snapdragon 835 it's all got
the same screen sock you're like at the
end you're like okay which one do I want
that could be like all right it's got a
wider angle that might push somebody
over the edge I think the potential of
zoom is helpful that was also mention in
katy Collins's story about me that yeah
I think a lot of them under life digital
zoom so it's not real zoom
meet um but I what impressed me I'm very
skeptical of the idea of that group so
you have that nobody cared yeah you know
Kate does something nobody cares did it
happen you know and then they come out
with a 17 year old phone and we're all
gaga so go figure I have to quote Huber
Jay Farnsworth on this I don't want to
live on this planet anymore yeah cuz of
the groupies yes oh I'm sorry I mean
technically the show is one big groovy
right now hi welcome to technology hey
back in the chat they want to go back
into the storage stuff Diaz asking how
much will it hold in the range of
terabytes at gigabytes or as premium
gamer points out yocto bytes 10 to the
31st power figure 4 megabytes per song
and do that x 26 million i have to do
the math but you you got a calculator
there let's know that computer thing the
computing part oh my gosh that let's
find out that's my ring on the desk
sorry we're not mathematicians so buddy
asleep or megabytes x 26 million so
that's 104 so what is that under 4
million bytes on 104 million megabytes
which is I don't know many many
petabytes or many many yeah maybe hello
hello we're making up the new Hellebuyck
there it's a lot it's a lot and you'd be
able to store it in a very like such an
incredibly small size that you're
talking about the size of a penny the
potential of just like squeezing
together like a stack of pennies to
create the amount of data storage that
you would probably never really need but
at the same time that's big enough for
your phone I mean yeah you could
potentially do a lot with that but I do
think it's interesting what you
mentioned as far as like everything's
cloud storage these days and more things
are becoming cloud storage so what
exactly is this gonna but it do for us
it evokes images of that original IBM
computer that was the size of a truck
totally and that was like what right 16
megabytes or something like that yeah
yeah anyway to eat you know pieces of
paper with you know punch cards in it so
hundred come a long way so be 104
terabytes on a penny thank you so if you
had like imagine like two or three of
them in a phone you wouldn't have a lot
of those these
chips so you have like 300 terabytes at
your phone you'd have more room for your
stupid goofy can arguably you basically
have what I think this is like a
conspiracy it's like the Goofy's and all
the storage like it is and this any way
they want to take photos of ourselves so
they they can steal them and be like an
what it's our job it's our job it's our
nigga describe annoy sure Raja Raja has
got an interesting theory says that the
current highest capacity SSD sits at 60
terabytes with atomic storage we could
have maybe 60 petabytes I think that's
entirely obtainable theoretically
throughout this conversation 30-year in
about 30 years of righties right but the
idea to and it's worth mentioning in the
story that they started with one atom to
specifically say like hey this is
possible we did this and it was actually
functional for a couple of hours but
then you move up from there to something
that could actually be more commercial
so yeah it's probably not going to be a
single atom but it's still significant
improvement like any huge shift from
potentially flash storage to you know go
to Tom here's a here's a concept I don't
think we have an immediate answer to but
it's definitely a good point of thought
from yothu and our friend Chris does it
require cryogenic cooling or anything
Chris thinks it would probably yes a
pretty intense cooling system to keep
maintain this based on what we saw there
it was about minus 286 Celsius 0 minus 5
Calvin so if you do the math it's pretty
crazy I don't know if cryogenic is
necessary but it's gotta be really
freedom like six hundred fans ought to
do the trick yeah pretty close to atomic
0 this is this is also an issue with
quantum computing where they also have
to have it really really low
temperatures what's interesting is like
are they going to find certain types of
atoms in the future that don't need to
be that low temperature so that you
could actually like walk around with
this in your phone and and I think
that's also what's going to take a
really long time to figure out is what
sort of like molecules they can use at
room temperature they can still do this
kind of thing and coming full circle
alex says with this type of storage
people could get off the cloud and get
some privacy back from the government
right
cos it doesn't really matter yeah so
they get her phone nothing sacred you're
basically screwed regardless and the CIA
is watching the ship that would have
been a great title for basically screwed
regardless no and the CIA is watching
the show not because they're spying on
us because they fence they love this
show I've heard directly from they left
you a note it was in you walk oh
yes you warned you not to do that it's
okay it's all good seahurst time is your
first time we're not on CBS yet so yeah
in trouble yet that's right sorry bunny
this will this will eventually just be
the replacement for CBS News though so
so obviously we have that kind of tech
all right that's probably a good place
to end it for the day as a fun
conversation theoretical atomic storage
absolutely I guess it's really not
theoretical anymore it was practical and
way way way way way way down the road so
yeah always fun talking about that stuff
cool it's called uh sees you guys I'm
not calling with that yet all right i am
gonna exit the show at some point okay
the 359 podcast is available on itunes
melon cares anymore soundcloud
feedburner google play music and of
course on cnet com thanks everybody for
watching and we'll see you again on
monday alright have a good weekend
everybody thanks for joining us this
