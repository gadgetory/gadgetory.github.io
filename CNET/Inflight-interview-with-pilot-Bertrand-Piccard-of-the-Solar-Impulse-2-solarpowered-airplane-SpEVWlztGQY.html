yeah yeah it will it's it's it's a good
good good moment for all of us after a
hot night we had a hard night with this
this profile and with lots of chances
for a batch all who couldn't rest and
the hardest but things were things were
hopefully looking looking at cuz he's
got a big day ahead of him as well let's
go to the simulation now this is your
hard a beautiful form of you all your
hard work
after many after many years of hard work
but tell us what's going on here it's
different than some of the other
simulations that we've had and that
there's maybe fewer of these sort of
rainbow the rainbow effect so it's not
as windy yeah this simulation shows the
travel I mean it fell over our craft and
watches or behind us is in blue which is
a Harris will be displayed in yellow and
it's interesting too to show the in
particular the wind situation and each
small line here shows the direction of
wind and the intensity depending on the
color and it also shows the the patches
of of clouds yeah main clouds which are
above the aircraft so we can see here
that rays nothing dangerous risky for
the rest of the flight and normally the
situation will be really good for what
is now some of the other flight so you
had a lot of tailwind but on this flight
it's actually been quite quiet lots of
updrafts and downdrafts yeah yeah during
the night we had yes abduct and
downdrafts which means turbulences which
means uncomfortable situation for petrol
also and globally speaking that this
this flight is not we couldn't really
benefit of everybody my name is Steven
Beecham I'm here with cnet.com and we're
gonna do a live we're gonna attempt a
live in flight interview with captain of
the Solar Impulse 2 solar powered
airplane
Bertrand Piccard he's somewhere over the
desert in the Middle East right now and
we're gonna try to connect with him via
satellite and I'm gonna do an interview
live over Facebook live streaming
YouTube with him with a long delay so
it's gonna be a little difficult but
just stand by this is from Solar Impulse
calm there's their website this is a
live stream they're putting out right
now he's on the last leg of his trip
around the world on a solar-powered
airplane so stay tuned we're gonna get
this going here so hang in there we'll
be right back with you guys shortly
simulation gives you a real sense of
just how much work you've put in and
also just how much planning happens in
the background before we actually take
off has this been you know of all the
simulations that you've done for all the
different likes how is this compared or
what's been the trickiest simulation
work they've had to do I know you had to
do a simulation to build the airplane
too so maybe that then we can include
that no I think what was really tricky
okay yeah two to two different things
yeah the preparation of the summation of
the autumn mathematical models to to
conceive to consider aircraft with with
the ship chief engineer peter fry and
that was really tricky because we we
knew that we have to reach a really good
level of accuracy in order to to build
the right aircraft yeah and afterwards
what was a really cheeky was the
preparation of the vehicle flights yeah
because we had you know we had to to fly
with the aircraft virtually before the
aircraft really exists in order to train
the team in order to turn to to to learn
how to fly with with it yeah and we also
knew at this moment that it was really
important for all of us to be able to
simulate every leg of the around the
world at non sure yeah which means a lot
of preparation with your air traffic
controller better
with a mission ingenuous so yeah yes of
work and it's about and lots and lots of
mathematics I think we shouldn't forget
that it's a very pretty picture but you
are a mathematician so this is this
requires a lot of hard math work so if
you're in school looking at this you can
be inspired and this is what you could
be doing someday and this is a very
practical you know use of mathematic and
the computation of innovation and
mathematics is really thank you many
gives a really good things yeah yeah
excellent well that's uh yeah another
aspect of the solar Solar Impulse
project and the people here
excellent will go back to Beth's hall in
the cockpit now and we will be keeping
you updated throughout the rest of today
as he makes his way closer to Abu Dhabi
and gets ready for landing
okay guys they're gonna connect with me
soon over the telephone and I'm gonna
have their live stream up so just stand
by this is very technical we've been
planning this for a while
hopefully it's gonna go okay I'm gonna
ask them a question there's gonna be a
long delay he's gonna answer so
hopefully gonna make this work okay
so just stand by
there's captain card hanging out in the
Solar Impulse - I'm just waiting first
phone call
all right guys they're about to call me
so stay tuned we're gonna talk with
Captain Picard Solar Impulse to live on
Facebook livestream and YouTube
simultaneously so here's the call I'm
gonna take it
hang on in there guys hey this is Steve
in San Francisco I'm ready
okay the pilot is ready so they will
just connect you and you read here like
I told you the Mission Control Center
just introducing you to the silence okay
they will take you like in the second
okay sounds good thank you
alright hey guys we're here live with
Bertrand Piccard the pilot of the Solar
Impulse 2 which is flying in the Middle
East right now he's waiting for him to
say hello we're just hanging on for one
second hello this is the Mission Control
Center in Monaco you're now hello this
is the Mission Control Center in Monaco
you're now connected to the pilot back
home pick up a lot of looping things on
my headphones but I'm just gonna go for
it mr. Picard can you hear me ok I'm
gonna turn this down here I think that's
gonna work better this way ok ok ok guys
so we're gonna try again there's looping
connections going to look like there's a
control room of Monaco they're sending
the signal to theirs come into my
control room so just stand by we're
going to get this worked out I think the
connection now works good so please try
again mr. Picard my name is Stephen
btrim in San Francisco with Cena calm
thank you so much for taking the time to
talk to us how are you doing sunrise
over the desert of stamp of so in the
Arabia that the night was really bumpy
it was turbulent you know the heat there
are a lot of servos up they remade
during the night so it was the smoothest
night I could have I really have to
fight or die
controls the yesterday has been gorgeous
with a desert of Egypt the crossing of
the Red Sea arrived all of the mountains
of Saudi it's a beautiful slide I have
to say we're able to get any rest last
night last night the door Lester this
morning a little bit just before sunrise
I had the the the first night of the
your day of the horizon and the mirror I
could make a few naps but you know at
the end I'm just here to sleep I mean
I'm here to fly the plane I'm here to
bring it to Abu Dhabi so if I can sleep
of course I I'm in a better shape and it
easier that's the goal now is really to
finish successfully the last leg of the
around the world solo flight so set the
scene for us everyone that's watching at
home where are you right now
and what is your elevation and what is
your airspeed just so we get a sense of
what's going on yes so the Arabia other
place which is just a desert of Sam it's
completely flat they are doing it I'm
flying an eight thousand three so it's
low because you know during the night I
fly lower in order to save energy and
when the Sun comes I starts to to climb
again and I'm flying at a speed of 29
which is maybe slow for an airplane but
you know this airplane is very strange I
mean the first of a kind it's like
slowly has a huge wingspan sensitive to
turbulence but the way it is built
allows it to fly a at night without fuel
so I spent the night on the batteries
that were charged yesterday during the
day flight and now I'm starting to
charge the batteries again for the next
day for the next night so it's they
could you era in aviation
because of course it's the beginning
it's difficult it's challenging there is
go Hedgehog
nobody explained us how to do it we we
had to invent something completely new
so you guys have already set the bench
for longest flight it was five days in
the solar and solar-powered plane
correct yes exactly
that was the flight of all the way from
Nagar Yahoo to Hawaii and what is great
is to see that this airplane in several
days several right now we have when I
could be at nap take it was three days
and three nights we had several slides
of two days and two nights with all the
way so so you see it can fly and you
longer because it has no fuel because we
found a another way to do but before all
the airplanes would be sonar of course
there will be a lot of time I think the
first step relation will be to become
electric because electric motors are
much better efficiency of course
batteries are heavier than fuel but I
bet that in ten years time you will have
electric airplanes flying with 50 people
on board for show to mediaforce light
and this will happen in the next 10
years so maybe that fully solar but
fully electric degraded of the airport
before taking off switch other lot of
advantages yeah if you like there's a
renaissance and solar powered planes
right now I mean Facebook Mark
Zuckerberg just launched they're playing
the Aquila plane last are in June but
they just released a video of it last
week did you did you get a chance to
check that out and and what are your you
know one of your remarks are regarding
that yes of course
I saw it that solar Facebook is
beautiful it is a fantastic shape and
their plane that this beautiful always
flies well and you know cool well it
reminds me you know 17 years ago
it was just after my food would slice
around the world when I started to speak
of an airplane flying around the world
without fuel everybody thought I was
completely crazy and now things start to
happen which is good that's the role of
pioneering to open the way and they give
the ways to people to try this is what
is missing in our world today people are
stuck with old devices all the sources
of energy and they think they will be
able to live forever with it but it's
wrong it's completely wrong the world is
going in the wrong direction we are
destroying the planet were polluting the
environment were depleting the natural
resources were poisoning the lungs of
the children were breathing the air that
we have absolutely we must do
differently I know I know how you feel
like when I when I put gasoline in my
car I feel like this is archaic like why
am I still putting fossil fuels in my
car but you know that's that's the way
life is right now but um you you've been
working on this project since 1999
correct how does it feel to be you're
just hours away from finishing your trip
around the world how does it feel to be
almost done with with this major
accomplishment the others
if I think about it I become too much
emotional so when I took off yesterday
morning in Egypt i i i was thinking i'm
doing this right as a pilot not as the
nature of the project i'm doing it as a
pilot to bring the plane to Abu Dhabi I
well to to enjoy the slides also to give
interviews to speak about technologies
but I try not to remember that it's the
last slide otherwise I will have tears
in my eyes and my voice will break
that's wait for up with a beat we
celebrate and you know still the day and
the night to go challenging it's nuts
because it's the last flight that you
see I remains very difficult especially
over deserts where you have turbos where
you have proven answers I can even
though I have to focus on the top yes so
during this whole journey which has been
you know the last year
more than a year of your life just going
around the world not not even counting
building the plane but what was the most
memorable experience for you so far on
this trip I think they were two things
that were fantastic one was crossing the
Atlantic in the in the solar-powered
airplane because I met bird when I was a
child I talked to him that's okay flying
over the Atlantic for the first time
with his solar-powered airplane that was
great because Charles did Bergen go to
Paris to open the way to commercial air
transport them my goal was to use the
symbol of the Atlantic to open the way
to much more implementation of skin
technologies so that was really a
highlight for me and another highlight
of course was when I could speak either
to ban ki-moon the secretary-general of
the United Nations from the cockpit of
so knowing most when I was about the the
Pacific speaking to the hesitation and
really demonstrate that all these new
technologies they are materials they can
be used everywhere not just for airplane
but they can be used to replace all the
old systems that are polluting and if
you replace all that you you make profit
to create jobs you'd improve the
industry so you see a what I told ban
ki-moon is that now there is no need to
be only ecological you can just be a
chicken using the clean technologies if
this will protect that by Matt also and
it's really amazing what you guys done I
got to go to Moffett Field when you guys
were there an interview and interview
some people and we also got to watch the
the airplane take off from the runway it
was pretty surreal experience you know
like I see videos of the Wright brothers
when they're testing their first plane
and there's people milling around you
know just kind of watching and I see
videos of you know the Apollo spaceships
taking off and there's people watching
from afar and I you know I feel like I'm
one of those people you got to watch
something extraordinary happen so I want
to thank you for that but um what is
next for the Solar Impulse team what are
you guys what is next after you guys
accomplish your goal what are you guys
planning next
we have a user experience in our
technical team for solar-powered
airplanes with high payload and you know
there is a huge development direction to
replace analyze for observation for
internet and so on and that we are
working of that and also a Borschberg my
partner who is leading the technical
team is very keen to develop that's
cause I would like to also develop
electric airplanes for transport or for
passengers because I think it's really
worth it and what we will do of course
now is to evoke the International
Committee for clean technologies like a
World Council of Technology is that I
announced when I was flying above the
Atlantic and this is a way to give a
common toys more power to the
association institution organization and
are working in technologies and
renewable energy because they are not
organized together as a community and we
need these to be able to advise the
governance and to go impact on the
energy policy so this is really what we
call now you're following Paul's solo
impose allows us to do that and now
we're going to do it that's fantastic
I'm really happy to hear everything is
going so well thank you so much for your
time Bertrand Piccard does pilot of the
Solar Impulse he's above he's over Saudi
Arabia right now flying live and this is
all happening live is it okay if I call
you Captain Picard cuz I think that's a
thing right yes but you know that
captain because it's no Trek was named
after the TWiT brother of my grandfather
no way the stratospheric slide to the
balloon in the US and the creator of
Star Trek 2 came as an inspiration for
Captain Picard so it's really sunny
that's fantastic well thank you so much
for your time and good luck I'm I'm very
excited for you guys it's gonna be
really cool to see you guys land yes
thank you very much for your support
all right have a go on
alright guys that was Captain Picard in
the solder in place - and he's taken off
he's flying off into the desert so uh we
will catch you guys check out all of our
coverage at cnet.com there we produce a
lot of videos about the Solar Impulse in
the Facebook playing the Aquila so check
out all of our coverage at cnet.com and
we'll check you out next time thank you
very much and have a great night</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
