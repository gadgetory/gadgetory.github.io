how many you think how many of these
CDMA iPhones that you could manufacture
in the first quarter and in the first
year of availability that's probably
more question for me you know I'm not
going to get into our our forecast but
because we tend to be a company that
does something and then reports what
we've done instead of instead of
predicting however we are incredibly
excited to bring the iPhone experience
to Verizon's ninety-three million
customers and all the new customers that
will want to use an iPhone 4 and Verizon
and I think it's fair to say that that
both of us think there's tremendous
opportunity and you know no one more
than us wants to give Verizon customers
the choice they've been waiting for is
the CD amia iPhone going to be on a
one-year upgrade cycle or will it be
refreshed in the summer like if they're
at the gsm iphones you know we have a
long-standing practice of never
commenting on our new product roadmaps
for all of you that focus on Apple I'm
sure you knew I was going to say that
and I guess some people are slightly
surprised that this isn't a 4G LTE
iPhone why did you decide to go the CDMA
route and not lt8
two key reasons one the first generation
LTE chipsets forced some design
compromises some of which we would not
make and secondly and most importantly
Verizon customers have told us they want
the iPhone now you know if if I could
if I can't tell you the number of times
that I've been as to my colleagues have
been asked over this incredible success
run of iPhone the the most popular
question has been with will the iPhone
work on the verizon network and we
wanted to provide people that choice now
so let me just add and conclude the
answer to that question from our
perspective we have a very robust idea
and collaboration we've been working at
this for some time as you've already
heard in the course of this conference
we have a tremendous network in our 3G
network the best in the country and we
want to make sure that customers can
take advantage of that with this
partnership so as we look at our
roadmaps together this was the right
thing to do at the right time for
customers throughout the industry CDMA
iPhone going to be exclusive to the
Verizon platform the agreement that Dan
and Lowell I have Apple has is a
multi-year so it's very strategic its
non-exclusive but beyond that we're not
commenting on the terms of the agreement
just a quick question looking at the
picture you have up here it looks like
there's some differences in the antenna
and I'm just wondering what changes had
to be made if any to the antenna and I
know there was some you know a little
controversy but I'm just wondering if
you've done anything obviously it's a
different CDMA so you've got some
differences there but just like to know
from a techno technology perspective
what if any changes had to be made to
the obviously has to be optimized to
work on the cdma/evdo network and it's
going to do a great job of that yeah let
me echo those comments as I said in my
opening we have been going through very
robust testing for a long period of time
and we feel extremely confident we don't
see any issues there and we know that
the collaboration between
Apple and Verizon Wireless is going to
be an outstanding customer experience so
we do not see that as an issue
we were wondering and we have a lot of
readers who are wondering what happens
when you're using your data connection
and you get a phone call
yeah so it's let me handle that one so
it's consistent with other other CDMA
devices and you know we continue to
improve the whole CDMA infrastructure
but it's it's the same experience that
you get on CDMA devices now first is
there an extra charge for the tethering
and secondly apart from the ability to
make voice calls are there any
capabilities or features in this version
that don't exist in the GSM WCDMA
version okay let me let me cover the
first one so we talked about the device
pricing what we didn't talk about and
we're not going to talk about today are
the pricing for the for the network
connect connectivity but we'll be having
announcements coming on pricing in the
future but not today the answer your
second question there is an additional
feature in this iPhone 4 and that's the
personal hotspot which can connect up to
five Wi-Fi enabled devices
I'm just curious when we'll be able to
see an LTE enabled iPhone and will there
be any data caps or limitations like
AT&amp;amp;T currently has I'll take the first
part of the question and Dan can to the
second the first part of the question is
we're not going to comment on any
unannounced product and I think all the
Apple press here will tell you that's a
fairly common answer and I'm going to
stick with my answer just a couple of
minutes ago
we're not commenting on any pricing or
pricing strategy changes today but let
let me say this is that that we are
going to have a very strong offer to
attract customers to our network on the
right devices and to drive the right mix
in our business and more to come on that
in the future you mentioned the
merchandising aspect is this going to be
available
in any of Verizon's indirect sales
channels and is there a timeframe for
that yes it is going to be available in
indirect sales channels not exactly at
launch I I said it I I went through it
pretty quickly set it in my opening
comments but we are this is going to be
available in certain of our key
distribution partners you know we're not
announcing a date today but it will be a
matter of weeks where we'll have broader
availability after the launch experience
is so experiment at Apple in the iPhone
with AT&amp;amp;T currently allows that GSM
constant data constant voice connection
can you just describe what is the
experience difference of being on a
voice call and then attempting to access
data such as a web how does that feel on
an experience level using CDMA
technology you know I think I think
people place emphases on different
things and I can tell you that as I said
before the the number one question I've
gotten despite selling tens of millions
of iPhones and having customers download
billions of apps is when will the iPhone
work on the verizon network and I could
not be happier to sit here today until
all of those 93 million people and all
the people that want to join Verizon
that we're delivering it to them and I
think they will they will make those
sorts of trade-offs so I would just
conclude with this and this will then
end our Q&amp;amp;A I'm very pleased with our
partnership and being able to offer this
to our 93 million customers and I'm
especially pleased to be able to offer
it to the 300 million people in the
United States
