users are protesting I'm Bridget Carey
and this is your cnet update YouTube
users are outraged over a change made to
the site Google+ has been integrated
into YouTube's commenting system so if
you want to leave a comment you are
required to use a Google+ account that
leaves people with basically two choices
either drop your YouTube handle forever
and start using your real name on
Google+ or keep your YouTube handle and
create a Google+ page for it kind of
like if it was a brand page the idea is
that if people use their real names to
leave comments it will cut back on the
filth that spews forth from anonymous
users and it will clean up most of the
conversation but people are upset and
protesting because they value their
privacy and didn't like the taste of
Google shoving its social network down
everyone's throat some protests simply
with repetitive comments like this image
of a tank there's also a change.org
petition with more than a hundred
thousand signatures and reddit users
have swarmed the Google forums with
hundreds of thousands of complaints of
course many are happy with this change
because it's a step toward raising the
quality of conversation but it's not
perfect the new system allows people to
put in hyperlinks now and of course
people are abusing it and sharing links
with viruses many videos still have
comments with hateful remarks floating
to the top of the pile just because
they're getting replies google says it's
working to fix these issues but there's
no sign that it will back down and
return to the old commenting system you
can bet Google+ is here to stay it's
also a bad week for another Google
Department the HP Chromebook 11 has been
yanked from store shelves due to an
overheating charger HP and Google
advised owners of the laptop to stop
using the charger that came with the
computer and use another micro USB
charger a new mobile payment system has
gone live nationwide it's called Isis
mobile wallet and it's a joint venture
run by a verizon AT&amp;amp;T mobile it works
with a few smart phones but not the
iphone to get folks interested in paying
with a tap of their
phone there are some freebies some
vending machines use my coke rewards to
give up free drinks and jamba juice is
given away 1 million free smoothies to
Isis users remember the days of printing
out directions from mapquest before your
trip well then you should check out the
new mapquest app for Android and iOS
