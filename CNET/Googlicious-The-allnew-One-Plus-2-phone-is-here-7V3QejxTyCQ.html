google licious it's everything google
that we can pack inside of a show so do
you want the good news or the bad news
first you know what I'm going to start
off with the bad news and then you know
everything else after it will be better
first up an NPR report says mobile
security experts at the firm's imperium
have discovered the worst Android
vulnerability in the mobile OS history
and it can affect your phone by just
receiving an mms message now you don't
even have to open it because once the
message is received it activates code
that gives the attacker complete control
of your device including everything from
stealing your data to controlling your
camera and microphone now don't start
running in circles according to this
Imperium the exploit isn't being used in
the wild just yet google has full
details to pax the exploit and has
acknowledged its severity but the bigger
issue Google can't force users to update
their OS and relies on carriers and
manufacturers to issue the fix good luck
with that so most likely many people
will still be susceptible to an attack
like this if it ever goes mainstream
good times Google all right in better
times for all of us Google is finally
dropping its Google+ requirement across
their products starting with YouTube
they said it was based on user feedback
that it didn't make sense for a Google+
profile to be your identity in all other
Google products or duh now the only
drawback for me is calling out trolls
and you know people that just aren't
happy with their lives and being able to
identify exactly who they are yeah I see
you now the change will be rolling out
in the coming months and we're finally
starting to see Google's separate itself
from there soon to be dead if not
already dying a slow death social
network all right after months of a
slow-burning hype machine the new one
plus two phone has finally arrived is
still bring similar dimensions with its
5.5 inch 1080p display it brings an
all-new aluminum frame with a textured
backing that can be swapped out and
features a Snapdragon 810 processor and
up to four gigs of RAM depending on the
model now there's a 13-megapixel
rear-facing 5 megapixel selfie cam
and they're all running on their own
custom oxygen OS starting at 329 and
available sometime in August now the
reservation list for the one plus two is
now open and they're expected to launch
with anywhere from 30 to 50,000 phones
compared to just 10,000 for their first
launch hopefully this won't be as
exclusive as last time since really it's
one of my most anticipated phones 4 2015
also Motorola announced their latest
flagship phone as well called the Moto X
style but in the US it will be known as
the Moto X pure edition that will have
universal LTE banding allowing it to
work on any carrier standout features
are its 5.7 quad HD display a quick
charge feature that gives you thirty
four percent juice in only 15 minutes
and it's super customization through the
Moto maker site there's a 21 megapixel
rear camera and 5-megapixel front-facing
cam that will cost 399 unlock and will
be released in September they also
announced their moto play with better
battery life but a smaller screen and a
revamped Moto G their best-selling
smartphone of all time and more leaking
in the android world this time it's
phone arena with pictures of what's
believed to be the samsung galaxy s6
midi yes samsung's throw spaghetti on
the wall and see what sticks strategy
still holds true after the recent
release of the essex active with its
more rugged design now there's no
reliable word on the middies official
specs pricing or carrier support but it
exists and will probably find out very
soon and here's something we do know
that samsung is doing and you know what
it's pretty badass the korean giant has
announced their latest monitor the SE
370 and it will be the first ever to
come equipped with an integrated
wireless charging pad now it's a
standard 1080p display that comes in
23.6 or 27-inch versions but this is a
killer idea the LED base will turn green
while it's charging a compatible phone
and you can bet a few other companies
you know might be copying this in the
future and finally in other news razors
acquisition of uyo is finally official
it was the android game console that i
invested in on kickstarter and flopped
now razor has their own living room
console called Forge TV and their goal
is to migrate who use
to their platform o'yea says it will no
longer be involved in hardware but plans
to publish future Android TV content all
right that's going to do it for this
week's show you can always email us at
google issues at cnet com or tweet me at
brian Tong thanks for watching it will
see you all next time for some more of
that Google Isha's Google Isha's</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
