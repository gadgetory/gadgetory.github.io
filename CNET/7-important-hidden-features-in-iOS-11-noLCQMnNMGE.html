initially let on here are seven
important new features we found while
testing the early preview Apple is doing
its part to eliminate distracted driving
your iPhone can now detect when you're
in a moving vehicle and can if you want
it to automatically enable do not
disturb while driving just go to
Settings do not disturb and under do not
disturb while driving tap activate and
select between automatically when
connected to car bluetooth or manually

Apple device with an emergency SOS mode
your iPhone can now call local
authorities in context of your choosing
if you simply press the power button
five times depending on your preferences
which you can change in settings
emergency SOS your phone will either
prompt you to complete the call or will
do it automatically a new sharing option
has been added to iOS 11 as well
it's called mark up as PDF and it lets
you do just what it says when viewing a
webpage a photo or another file tap the
share icon and select mark up as PDF iOS
will convert it to a PDF and then you
can use the iOS markup tool to draw a
sign or add text to the document before
saving it and sharing it a new
accessibility feature does away with the
need to talk to Siri at all instead you
can use the keyboard to type to apple's
digital assistant open Settings General
accessibility Siri and toggle type to
Siri to the on position now whenever you
hold the home button to activate Siri a
keyboard will appear if your power
button breaks you can now turn the phone
off with the new shutdown option under
settings and then general to power the
phone back on simply connect your phone
to a power source the iPads new app dock
has a section that displays recently
used apps but if you're not a fan of the
constant suggestions you can disable it

has added a one-handed keyboard option
