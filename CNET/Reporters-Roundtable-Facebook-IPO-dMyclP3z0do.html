Roundtable
I am Rafe Needleman in San Francisco and
it has happened
Facebook is now a publicly traded
company is to internet IPO ever Facebook
is going public today and is becoming a
company worth over 100 billion dollars
and this just eight years after a start
in a humble Harvard dorm room Facebook's
IPO will change the economics of the
Internet
not exactly a cash poor company before
the IPO the new public funds lining
Facebook's pockets will mean the social
company has extra money to launch new
projects and buy up companies that mesh
with its mission or compete with it will
the frenzy for Facebook stock last can a
social network make money the way Google
does which is hand over fist and is this
a stock you should be buying today
alright guys we're here at reporter's
roundtable a special live show we have
done a live show in quite a while we're
going to be talking about this IPO
should you buy it or not we've got a
couple of great guests to talk about it
first of all Jill Schlesinger from CBS
MoneyWatch is joining us over Skype Jill
can help sort us out with help us sort
out the pros and the cons for investors
interested in this IPO thanks Jill for
making the time and arackliffe is a CEO
of wealthfront an internet era
investment advice service I hope I got
that right
yes I've covered the companies
fascinating Andy's a venture capitalist
at benchmark capital also teaches about
entrepreneurship at the Stanford
Graduate School of Business and he wrote
about Facebook's IPO foreseen it on CNN
news in February Andy thanks for making
the time thank you joining us also over
Skype Tom Merritt the host of the tech
news Today Show on the TWiT network of
course a also former ce net podcaster
here for buzz out loud Tom thanks for
joining us always good to be with you
right and if you have a question about
this IPO for this panel send it to us
you can send me an email roundtable at
Cena Tom or sent a tweet use at Rafe in
the tweet and the hash tag pound FB IP o
and hopefully I'll see it but we're
gonna get started here with another
guest a little Facebook stock weather
report
Paul Sloan is joining us here he is our
exec
who has been a man on the spot for IPL
coverage Paul give us a sense of what's
happening trafficking weather what does
this mean what does it mean plane it to
us how's the stock doing you know the
stock is up modestly but you have to
think that the bankers are in a little
bit of a panic mode I mean bankers I
think you can tell me Andy if I'm wrong
like to see a little more of a pop and
they can't exactly support a deal when
it's this this large so the stock went
public at 38 went public at 38 which
raised higher than expected they had
raised the range I guess couple days ago
demand was off the charts you know
people tried there was all kinds of
skepticism you know bad news from
General Motors ads aren't working and a
lot of insiders you know taking money
off the table and yet you know and the
demand has been really strong and so it
they pulled off an incredibly successful
IPO it just hasn't hasn't popped out of
it out of the gate is in 1999's no so
the stock right now is at 40 point 83
which is a seven point four percent pop
since since opening who makes money when
a stock pops up Andy
well the underwriters typically place
the stock with institutional investors
to begin and the intent is to give the
institutions enough of a toehold
position that they'll want to come into
the market after the IPO goes effective
and buy bigger positions but some of the
institutions run so much money that it's
not worth it even to have that toehold
position so they're going to flip the
stock and they're going to be the
primary beneficiaries of that initial
rise in the stock so Jill with
performance like this up right now we're
at 40 points 99 up seven point seven
percent boy this is so exciting I can
barely contain myself Jill what does
this mean what is a 7 point 8 percent
rise in a Internet IPO mean for the
retail investor because most retail
investors did not buy in a 38 so we
always used to say this when I was a
trader we would call them the dumb money
they got in after the fact they're the
ones who probably bought the shares at
42 43 when it popped earlier but for the
most retail investors you know honestly
chill out
touch this young today I'd let things
settle down or by the way I just buy an
index fund which is gonna have Facebook
in it and just know that even in the
last seven deals done in the past year
while the stocks have gone up a lot in
the first day or two they're down 11% on
average a month after the IPO
wouldn't that be fascinating if Facebook
actually fell below the offering price
it would be like all the hype for
nothing would be kind of fun right it is
that a big deal of Facebook foes falls
below offering it is for the media
you're the only person here Andy who is
not doesn't that have a media job what I
think that it creates some artificial
pressure for the management team that
they have to field a lot of questions
about why is the stock below the
offering place but if you think about it
when you sell stock you want to sell it
at the highest possible price to give up
the least amount of dilution and so
there's a trade-off between selling it
so high that that stock might go below
the offering price and and then not
having the pop because people think well
if it doesn't go up fifty percent it
wasn't a successful underwriting you
know Google was perceived as not
successful under I think because the
stock didn't pop on the day of the IPO
they did pretty well now tom you've been
tracked even in this industry almost as
long as I know I have you been tracking
this stuff forever how exciting how
important do you think this IPO is for
for technology companies well it's it's
one of those benchmarks that you know
we've we've seen Zynga's and Groupons
and Zillow's but Facebook is is one of
the big companies it's the one you talk
about all the time it's up there now
with Google and Apple and Microsoft in
at least in being newsworthy and being
of interest and it's got 900 million
users so it's huge I think a lot of
people were keeping their eyes on this
to see how a big company like that is
going to fare in the current IPO market
when we've seen the Groupons and the
Zynga's and the Zillow's pop out go way
up and then drop below their opening
prices jazz Jill mentioned and would
Facebook with their momentum being able
to buck that we've seen a lot of mixed
signals
Facebook raising that opening price but
at the same time
General Motors coming out just a week
before the IPO and saying well we're not
gonna spend any more advertising money
on Facebook now I may have a unpopular
view here on this particular IPO but I
would like your comments this whole
panel's comments on this perspective
which is that if a stock goes out at 38
jumps up to the low 40s and then hovers
around 38 for a while it seems to me
that that indicates that the stock was
accurately and correctly priced that we
don't want to see a stock doubling or
even going up 50% the moment it goes
public that means that there has been
money left behind that they miss judged
what the company was worth so I look at
this and I think the underwriters did a
good job Andy you must have worked for
an underwriter I've never I know nothing
about economics I'm a journalist I think
that's a very fair statement and the
only thing that keeps companies from
pricing significantly below the fair
value is they want to reduce the chance
that sometime in the future the stock
trades below that price but I would I
completely agree with you Rafe the fact
that the stock is up 8% is a testament
to the quality of the job that the
investment bankers have done okay
I will say one thing that you know look
they did raise the range so the the if
we got on the original range of the
stock offering before they went on the
roadshow it would have been you know we
would've been talking about a 20 30
percent pop so I think that probably
they did price it right I'm sure that
everybody at Morgan Stanley's dancing a
jig right now you know they're gonna
collect 176 million dollars of fees to
split up among those 33 underwriters so
I think probably after Facebook
employees and in early investors the
investment banks are gonna be the
happiest today I mean for sure it helps
that it's priced right when I said there
was panic on the investment bankers I
mean earlier today was trading right
around 38 39
it wasn't exactly big pop I think that
obviously was a huge success for
Facebook I mean it seems perfect for
them
but I think from the bankers perspective
they don't want they don't not want to
see a falling lower I mean it just makes
it they want to they want to see that
the excitement's out there wave can I
give you one other perspective if you're
a consumer internet company or a
consumer company in general and you're
not on everyone's radar then having a
big pop in your stock price is a really
good thing to happen it means that you
left a little money on the table but the
marketing value of having a stock that
goes up 50 or 80 percent is invaluable
priceless and so if I'm a much lesser
known internet brand having everyone
report on the big pack in my IPO price
will get me press that I never could
have gotten otherwise and can build
momentum in my business now if on
Facebook I don't need that right so I
have an incentive to price it much
closer to the fair value because I don't
really need that pop as much as a
lesser-known brand now everything that
we know about Zuckerberg says that he is
very hands-on with stuff that many
entrepreneurs and CEOs would not be for
example booting the lawyers out of the
room when he was doing the Instagram
deal uh Tom what's your sense of how
hands-on this particular CEO is with
something as arcane as dealing with the
stock market well I don't have much of a
sense of it directly I don't have any
direct contact with Facebook but just
from watching the roadshow and and the
controversy about the hoodie and him
sort of bowing out of a couple of the
appearances it seems like he's really
more concerned with coding last night
they had a hackathon to lead up to the
IPO he wants to run the company he wants
to work on Facebook and this is somewhat
at least it seems from the outside a bit
of a distraction for him that he's happy
you know he's glad that they're public
and they're bringing in the money but he
has consolidated control of this company
remember those Class B shares that
current owners have pre-ipo have 10
times the voting rights he's gonna have
by different accounts 54 to 56 percent
of the voting rights over the company
even after the IPO so I think this is
something he felt he had to do he put it
off as long as possible
and I bet he's glad he's done with it
now so you're never once you go public
that's the deal with the devil you never
get out of that one though do you know I
mean they're not gonna bring it back can
I ever have the money to buy it back
from the public again so forget about it
how is Facebook going to change now that
it
despite Zuckerberg ownership of all the
voting rights essentially how must
Facebook changed now that it is a public
company I don't think it needs to change
at all you know I think there's this
misperception that in order to run a
public company you have to satisfy the
shareholders or bought your stock last
week the best CEOs I know the most
successful ones who've been able to
transform their companies over time run
their public companies like private
companies they worry about what's best
for the company over the long term not
what's best for the people who bought
the stock yesterday
would you consider Google an example of
a company that does that yeah I would
think Apple as an example Veritas
software was an example Adobe was an
example so they they do what's right for
the long-term business and they don't
pay that much attention to what the
short-term investors want to do and and
I don't think that's a breach of one's
fiduciary responsibilities just because
you ignore the short term is there a lot
of constituents that you have to worry
about now one of speaking of short term
one of the very interesting news items
that broke this morning after Facebook
went public was that Zynga stock fell
off a cliff and in fact it looks like
the stock was halted I don't know if it
still halted for a while after dropping
13% of the triggers went off and they
turned off trading on Zynga why would a
Facebook IPO cause Zynga to drop when
these two companies are basically from
my estimation two sides of the same coin
of the social network business I'm
opening this one up for speculation
because I'm fascinated by this well I
mean there's only like one possibility
for I'll put it by trader hat on what
for a second I mean there is a
possibility that people are basically
putting a spread on I'm gonna go short
Zynga I'm going to a long Facebook
Facebook's a better value for me and
I put on a great spread and a lot of
times you know it's like saying I'm
going long coke and short Pepsi and they
think there's better value in Facebook
unless there is news about Singha then
we just don't know about nobody okay uh
all right so let's see what's going on
right now with the stock this is uh is
becoming boring 63% for Tiffany
I need a timpani yes Andy I totally
agree that that and we've talked about
this before that really it's about
leadership and a good leader can
navigate the company even if it's public
and doesn't have to necessarily cater to
the short-term interest but surely when
you have so much of your company's
wealth among your employees tied up in
restricted stock and over time I mean
it's in it it's helpful if the stock
does well over the next six eight months
well this is one of the interesting
things here how do you manage a company
that goes public and makes so many
people so wealthy now granted they're
not they can't cash out today if I'm not
mistaken I'll talk about what it must be
like if you're an engineer at Facebook
and you've been there for three years
you now have stock that is worth house
money it's fu money right good Muslim
how does Facebook keep these engineers
motivated and if you are one of these
engineers and if we're you you know if
anybody here has had a windfall at a at
a company how do you manage things Jill
Andy I mean I can tell you what best
practices are and I think that Facebook
is doing a great job at the best
practices all right number one you spend
a lot of time preceding the IPO
explaining that the IPO is just one step
in a long term marathon that it's like
you know when you graduate from college
it's called commencement it's the
beginning of the next stage of your life
and I think that they're really really
good leaders position IPOs as
commencements where as many individual
investors view it as a final outcome or
the ultimate milestone and exit for
venture it's not no it isn't no you hear
about we hear about the exits all the
time you're saying that the journalists
the press made that up no but I can tell
you that that having
in the venture business for 25 years
before teaching at Stanford and starting
wealthfront we never called an IPO and
exit never yeah I have a different
perspective on this because when I was
an invest investment advisor in New
England I used to get hired by some of
these tech companies in 1998 1999 and
2000 to come in and do face-to-face
meetings with their employees who were
about to become very wealthy and the
great companies what they would do is
they'd take me someone like me and
they'd say I will pay you by the hour to
sit and talk to these people about how
they should not squander their newfound
wealth and it was amazing you know of
course some of these guys would go out
and go nutty right they're gonna you see
a parking lot full of Porsches but you
know that may not be the culture out
there but it was really astounding to
see the the real differences among the
types of employees some people just
thought yes I've just become rich I'm
going out I'm going crazy but I would
say that especially as you got later in
the cycle people were scared they said I
don't want to squander this please help
me and I think companies and especially
company like Facebook there are gonna be
so many people who are worth so much
money
you can imagine the pressure that I
would have met that that you're carrying
with that you know if anyone who's
watching this who's got in this position
don't blow it make sure you secure your
financial future and of course buy
something fun but it's kind of like a
lottery in that way if you're gonna hit
it big put the money aside that you need
to do everything you want to do your
kids college you know your own
retirement and then of course have some
fun you know remember a bunch of
Facebook employees or former employees
of sold stock they sold it on second
markets and they have not by and large
done ostentatious things with that money
and I think that's a proxy for what
you're gonna see from the people who
remain as employees and are likely to
get some liquidity after the lock ups
are released in six months see it's even
better they've started companies or
they've invested another company now
that is one of the great things about a
big IPO and about a lot of people having
excess resources to do things like I
mean if you're Jeff Bezos you've got a
lot of excess resources you
launched a space program but if you have
maybe you know only six figures or that
you can you can take this money and
invest it back into the technology
economy and is that's a great thing and
this is how the boom-and-bust cycles
work but and this is where
entrepreneurship comes from it's all
these angel investors well it's not
necessarily a great thing if you look at
technology successes over the last 30
years the amazing thing is the number of
companies that achieve great success is
incredibly consistent I did a some
research in 1995 and updated it in 2004
some presentations that had to give
where I found that only 15 companies
plus or minus 3 are created every year
that at some point in their life reach a
hundred million in revenue that's it
nationwide and it doesn't change any
year but this so the number of companies
started is like a sine curve it
oscillates so I think we're gonna see a
lot more money coming into the angel
market as a result when the lock ups
come off but that doesn't mean we're
gonna see more successful companies it
just means we're gonna see more failed
companies well it depends how you define
success it depends how you define
success right Instagram would not have
made it onto your list agreed agreed
but I'm talking about but for the
economy in terms of jobs and such the
number of companies that achieve
critical mass or real success is very
consistent and having more angel money
come in isn't necessarily gonna drive
more innovation as many people are
positive but Instagram type successes
drive a lot of those angel investments
let's this begin to wrap this up by
talking about where Facebook does need
to innovate and where they may be making
acquisitions whether there are actual
company acquisitions or what are called
aqua hires buying a small company out
just to get the engineering talent
they're mobile Tom Andy Paul Jill
anybody don't want to talk about how is
Facebook going to manage the move from
the social era which we're in to the
mobile era which we're moving into yeah
that seems to be the common consensus is
that Facebook needs to be
in mobile effect there was an
interesting Forbes article at the end of
April saying that Facebook and Google
are fighting the last war that they they
need to be looking farther ahead and
Facebook struggling with mobile is
evidence of that
I think what we're seeing with Instagram
acquisition and with the acquisition of
the lightbox folks recently is is what
their strategy looks to be which is
let's go out and find people who are
really good at mobile bring them into
the company and it's and let them loose
and see what they can do Google just did
that to very good effect with Google
Plus everyone suspects that pulling in
Kevin roses team from milk is what
brought out the new Google+ mobile app
which has been a fantastic improvement
over what they had before so I would
expect to see more of those kind of AK
hires as you say from Facebook
the other thing we hear that is a big
area of expansion obviously we know
about this is global presence the news
came out the other day that there will
soon be more Facebook users in India
than there are in the US so how
important how does Facebook make the
transition to being a truly global
company where the United States is just
one of several markets we did a long
time ago because you have you might have
users but you need consumers that's what
they need and what we know is that some
of those economies where there's been
expansion with Facebook those people
aren't necessarily consumptive and
especially like in a place like China or
India where they are more of a saving
society than a spending society we're
waiting for them to become more bigger
spenders and I think that is the next
frontier but right now let me tell you
something Chinese people say 40 to 50
cents of every dollar they make they're
not clicking on ads on Facebook and
buying crap on the Internet
well let me give you a different
perspective so everyone's talking about
mobile and I think it is critical that
Facebook's succeed on on mobile but
we're forgetting the fact that they own
the plumbing of the internet the new
plumbing look at Facebook Connect think
of how many websites use Facebook
Connect is the way to get new people to
come use their sites if Facebook wanted
to they could charge a
Hania login in every single website i
know i would would pay facebook for to
have it-- you're done well we would but
you're right slight everyone's
forgetting this and if they charged a
penny a login for Facebook Connect which
makes it a lot easier for me as a
website operator to offer convenience to
my users that would be a billion dollars
in operating profit tomorrow so lest we
forget how much of an asset Facebook has
built that will continue no matter what
happens in mobile all right finally
advertising this is where these
companies make their money this is why
Google is a forty billion dollar revenue
company and Facebook is under - Paul how
does Facebook turn it around in the
advertising space look I agree with Andy
I think it's a mistake to think of this
only as an advertising play I think
there's so many users and there's so
many different opportunities whether
it's expanding Facebook Credits
whether it's using mobile to get off
into offers like local offers whether
it's Groupon type offers there's all
kinds of ways whether it's charging for
Facebook Connect whether it's creating
an ad network outside of Facebook which
a lot of people have speculated could
happen you know where they create ads
where maybe you know you go to the
Washington Post site and you see an ad
for a restaurant and you're like huh my
friends liked that one and so do all
kinds of ways they can not only boost
their advertising revenue but get other
other revenue the question is how long
it'll take to do it and whether they
pull it off you know every disrupt
plague Christensen wrote of a book
called the innovators dilemma which
really made an impact on me and he
coined the term disruptive technology
which is often misused but disruptors
always sell their product for a lower
price but they sell more of it so if you
think about this in Honda motorcycles
versus harley-davidson mini-mill steel
mills if you look at Facebook ads Google
text ads versus Yahoo display ads well
Facebook ads have a fraction of the
price of a Google Ad so people always
think oh there are a terrible
advertising company well at the time
Google went public at the same age I
think Facebook has more
sizing revenue then did Google so turn
around why are we talking about
turnaround if they're doing better than
Google did at the same age that's one
way of looking at it actually sorry Jill
any final advice for people who are
looking at this stock hovering around
forty one dollars and thinking oh I got
to get in now before it goes up to sixty
what do you think yeah I think really
there's no reason to make a trade now
you know and and by the way you know for
most people who are out there managing
their financial lives you gotta remember
you're not building a portfolio of 50
stocks you're not a money manager and
those guys can't even beat the index
stick with the index and by the way I
don't want to be a buzzkill I know
everyone is so psyched about this there
is a huge problem lurking in our markets
right now and it's called Europe and
it's called Greece so before you go jump
in and start getting all whacky about
Facebook make sure you've got a
diversified portfolio because it is
going to be bumpy in the future and the
best place to do that
thank you for your time your payment for
your time is tell us about well friend
really briefly ten words or less well
we're a an online investment management
firm that helps young people initially
who work in technology to have their
money managed in a diversified portfolio
of very inexpensive index stocks of the
type that Jill described and we do it at
a tiny fraction of the minimums of the
high-end wealth managers like Goldman
Sachs and for a tiny fraction of the
fees thank you
always great Andy to hear your your
input on this stock and others in the
market in general and of course is a CEO
of wealthfront Tom Merritt is the host
of tech news today Tom any final words
on this or other exciting public company
news well Eric Mac has a great article
I'd seen it today about a programmer
who's doing Facebook IPO day closing
price comm you if it's already at the
end of the day that it's too late to
look at it but by scraping Twitter he's
predicted that the closing price will be
$54 but then we also have John Perry
Barlow of the EMF
predicting that the stock will close at
$32 so I guess by the end of the day
we'll know whether Twitter or John Perry
Barlow are better at predicting the
future you know how to make money on
Facebook stock is run the betting pools
don't touch the money Jill is Jill
you're at CBS MoneyWatch tell us what
you're up to I am covering this story
