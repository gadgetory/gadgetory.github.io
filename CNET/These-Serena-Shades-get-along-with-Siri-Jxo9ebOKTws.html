to add to any smart home the problem is
once you start getting a look at the
market you realize just how expensive
they can be for these Lutron serena
shades for instance you'll have to pay
at least 350 bucks to get one shade so
that means that right now while
outfitting your whole home with smart
shades seems like it would be really
cool it would actually set you back
thousands of dollars that said these
shades perform pretty well and could be
really nice for some vaulted windows or
if you have a small apartment or a
single room that you want to outfit with
shades the cool thing about these shades
in particular is that they're homekit
compatible that means that you get Siri
voice control as well as integration
with other homekit compatible devices
and even some devices that aren't
overall I really liked working with
these shades they're quiet they're
unobtrusive app control is really
intuitive and setting them up actually
is really easy you only start to run
into some performance hiccups when you
start trying out some of the features
like geofencing or a series control but
even the problems with those two
features were really minimal when taking
into account the overall success of the
product</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
