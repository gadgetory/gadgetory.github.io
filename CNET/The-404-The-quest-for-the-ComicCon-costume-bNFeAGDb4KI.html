of people on the show floor there are
thousands of people spend hundreds of
dollars and hours planning their costume
and they all look great let's go talk to

to paint the more unreachable parts of
your body my father do you have any
suggestions for what uh maybe we should
try on what we should buy good look for
a Galactus costume that would be cool so

sharp and I'm fragile all right we're
here at the blonde Swan with Elizabeth
and really like what you got going on
we're looking for costumes really
digging this whole steampunk sort of
thing what do you think we'd look good
in well you can't be a beautiful leather
top hat you can't beat it you know it's
a classic you can dress it up with
goggles you could wear it with a cool
leather vest you can dress it up with a
cool tailcoat you do whatever you want
with it also can't help but notice the
gas mask that you have hanging out here
is that to battle the smells of
comic-con
no comment you guys smell like gazing
yeah well we know ease now okay it's
these other people you gotta you gotta
worry about here what do you say you
want to try on some of this stuff I
think I feel good this this might be the
one are you seeing what do you feel see
I feel I need more knobs and dials maybe
a pocket watch what you do just kind of
hold it up here and the straps there's
nothing weird about this so the the
search for our new comic con costume has
led us to this booth where you can
become your own Jedi yeah for a hundred
and fifty dollars you can buy a black
Slanket no this is this is the Jedi
Snuggie all kidding aside this feels
very comfortable yeah and I wish that it
does it come with a lightsaber to come
on a lightsaber know they are sold
separately they are sold separately
don't forget in the Star Wars universe
nothing comes free all right Wow look in
the complete ensemble can be yours for
the low low price of 800 you have an
extra large but a 26 waist of the robe
what do you think you saw i'm here with
Yoda yeah apparently it's impossible to
embarrass yourself at comic-con I'm just
gonna say I thought my Jedi robe was
cool but why is my Yoda yeah but I'm
taller than you doesn't make sense
suspend your disbelief let me can let's
take a look at you here get a bucket

you sir yeah it's me oh that's good oh
that looks good nice this is actually
what Justin looks like before we put
makeup on every 40 for that is how could
anybody wear this for more than five
minutes look at that guess we have to
buy these things now huh I just sweated
my face into it think we finally come to
a conclusion yeah although i don't
remember Batman having a red beard
Batman took a few months off and he let
himself go a little bit you got out of
shape yeah you know don't worry about
that but you know we looked upon my
sometimes the oldies are the best you
know that's right we've got to go with
the classics so I think we're gonna be
spider-man the classic the classic Asian
