my name is Steven Beecham and you are
watching the Apple byte extra crunchy
podcast with your host mr. Brian Tom
what's up what's up everybody hey
welcome to the show in this episode of
102 this is really the week of reviews
for the Apple world we have Apple watch
series 3 Apple TV 4k iPhone 8 iPhone 8
plus iOS 11 and I couldn't do this
without our man on the East Coast mr.
Scott Stein hey buddy welcome to show
again residents a little hello hello
before we get to talking back and forth
with Scott and and Beach about
everything again this show is all about
you all we had something like over a 30
something calls this week might have
been even more than that again the
number is 1-866-376-8255
wanted to kind of jump around and talk
about all of them and kind of what your
experience was what other people are
saying and I think the product that was
is still the most intriguing to me like
I'm supposed to get a delivery today
they get an Apple watch Series three if
they knock on my door I might have to
get out of my chair but you know this is
the product that has the LT and the
watch finally people there I think the
reviews were across the spectrum from
very pop most of them were very positive
then we had a few that were had a lot of
issues with the LTE now I do want to
before we talk to you about this just
dig into that a little bit basically
some reviewers have problems with LTE
switching off from between the phone and
then just going dedicated LTE Apple
actually made an official statement on
this which they normally don't always
try to get in front of but this is what
happened if you haven't been familiar
with what was going on with the LTE
issues basically this what Apple said we
have discovered that when Apple watch
series three joins unauthenticated Wi-Fi
networks without connectivity it may at
times prevent the watch from using
cellular we are investigating a fix for
a future software release so they're
trying to tell us that okay fine they're
gonna fix us now Scott you got to use
the LT Apple watch what was your
experience so I didn't have that happen
but you know this thing is using it over
the course of less than a week a lot of
times with wearables I want to wear them
even longer but that's where the you
know that's that's what our review date
hit and we're still gonna be looking at
this going forward I didn't see those
problems put us on other types of things
that were weird sometimes
I found that getting messages and
notifications happened or didn't happen
and that was for a variety of reasons
one iMessage seems to come in bursts or
not at all and that's something we're
still trying to figure out what's going
on there notifications with third-party
apps that needs your phone on somewhere
which I mentioned in the review in order
to send those notifications up and then
back down your phone so if your phone
was off there are some third-party
notifications you would not receive so
that's strange also a lot of the apps a
handful of the apps worked over LTE
handful the apps did not work
and I expect that that's going to change
over the next week or so
as you know like a lot of times that is
of hardware that Apple launches where
apps catch up to it but the question is
how many will take advantage and how
many will just decide that it's not
worth it so I don't know but it did mean
that that it's the classic your mileage
may vary is very true for the LTE Apple
watch plus I only used it on one carrier
so far and that was the case I believe
for most of the reviews that almost all
the reviews that were done all the
review they should say because um apples
you know that these these watches
pre-release were bonded to a test phone
number so now we're going to be testing
them across phone numbers we were not
able to do that leading up to the review
so there's a lot more questions to ask
and answer both of them there's a lot
more questions about it and if you're
hesitant about all of that then don't
get the LTE version the same thing those
I also looked at it as an Apple watch
and I think it's a slightly better Apple
watch so it continues to be a good
really good SmartWatch and I think the
best of the bunch but the LTE is a
different issue do you think how well
with both the actual rating you know
that you gave or about this you know
what I don't necessarily like to talk
about a score rating yeah based on your
experience who is the LT base and based
on its performance who does the LTE
watch really serve at this moment from
your time with it early on yeah that's a
good question so I gave it an 8.0 that's
actually a little bit lower and lower
than the series too and it felt like a
wash to me because while it's better
with software
it feels faster loading apps I think
some of the health improvements are nice
especially that it gives you continuous
standing sorry resting heart rate
averages and walking heart rate averages
which feel more useful than just hanging
your heart rate on the other hand you've
got some of these LTE quirks and I think
that who is really for with that short
of battery life on on phone calls is for
somebody who just wants an
an extra line you know the same way
you'd have a home phone with an extra
line on your phone you're looking at
these things as in case I need it
maybe I left my phone at home maybe I
run and I just be worried in case
something happens it's kind of an in
case something blank and that's where
the LTE connectivity possibly being you
know being an issue and open Wi-Fi spots
is a concern because in case you needed
it there it would be an issue no I found
it worked when I was using it but I was
going between Montclair New Jersey in
New York City commuting I was taking a
look at the levels that I got an LTE
service they seemed to mostly hang in
sometimes it would it would X out which
means it wasn't using LTE but when I
started using the phone again it would
turn back on like it was kind of going
into a sleep mode but I got phone calls
that didn't seem to be a problem
receiving texts sometimes was a little
bit weird I think the reality also when
I look at this product is you're not
just getting the Apple watch you really
cut it they're kind of selling you with
the Apple earpods and this watch
together to effectively bridge this hole
okay you're not gonna have a look I
don't see many people talking to their
wrist and it is a little less natural it
almost seems like they aren't outright
saying it but it's really you're not
only gonna get the Apple watch LT but we
want you to get the air pods to
complement it yeah the microphone is
fine on the Apple watch for phone calls
nobody notices that you're talking on a
watch but the speakers are really really
not good for talking in public okay
they're really not good versus bad
because they're fine for a little thing
but they get drowned out anytime you're
at a big public space you have to hold
it up to your to your ear and then it
becomes really uncomfortable so if
you're liking at home in a quiet space
they're fine and so it's kind of like a
little intercom but you basically want
to get a good pair of wireless
headphones not just for music but one
with a good microphone to be able take
calls
I do think Apple has obviously created
the seamlessness more seamless it's - I
still had some issues with air pods
connecting to them at times but more
seamless with with air pods
to the point where they feel like a
package even more now but that's an
extra hundred $60 and the extra $10 a
month you're gonna have to spend to keep
this watch connected which is the thing
that annoys me the most that is
something that I really don't know if
would be worth for a lot of people and
and that's the deal breaker if anything
else year-over-year the watch is what is
it like $30 more I think
but the dip but the gap between the
three and the three with LTE this year
is $70 so it's that's a big gap but if
you had bought the series to last year
the equivalent price on the series three
it doesn't feel it's about like what the
Apple TV 4k is but that's not really the
right comparison because right now you'd
be picking LT or no LT yeah yeah the O
really quickly before we move on to the
next product
battery life what was the thing that I
always say is when you first specific
with the Apple watch I remember when I
first got it I was tinkering it and
messing with it all the time and I was
like holy crap this battery life is like
nothing and I know as a reviewer you
really had to put it through its paces
what did you feel like the overall
battery life was actually using it like
did taking a one call pretty much feel
like dang I just killed like a third of
the battery juice on here taking one
call didn't produce that but if you
stuck on the call for like half an hour
you would definitely notice that and I
did notice that so for like a couple of
minute phone call nobody oh my god it
goes so across the board and that's the
problem is that you really have to
monitor your battery because it really
changes on a daily basis if you're so
with the way the connection works on the
watch is it's designed that Apple made
it so it's like gonna always look for
your phone first and that's the least
draining then it goes to Wi-Fi which is
slightly more draining then it goes to a
Kenosha below greater drain now and then
that hiccup and the in like the
trade-off was that like when it tries
going to Wi-Fi but then it finds the
network but it requires a login like
Starbucks
and it can't get the login then right
now it like hangs and you don't have any
connection and there's no way to you
can't break that so that's a problem but
battery life if I'm just using it
connected to my phone or phones always
on me is basically like it was before
where it's about day and a half you know
like by the end of the day or about
sixty percent fifty percent battery
which is which is fine it's not great
but it's what it was before and it means
you you could make it to the end of the
day you're you're still gonna have to
charge but but if you keep if you use
the LTE stuff you'll seen the music your
we even gotten in a music streaming
which not available but just playing
music doing any heart rate GPS tracking
talking to someone also at the end of
the day we written by 4:00 p.m. it could
be time to recharge and so that's that's
it that's a big change and you know all
of a sudden I look down and go oh it's a
30% same time in another day it's at 70%
that's what's gonna happen when you're
using it you have to be ready for that
and ask if that's really been anything
you want to get into of course you can
just turn your LTE off but then you
basically as not having bought an LTE at
the ops 3 yeah uh final verdict for you
personally would you buy it
for you personally version I would do an
Apple watch for the first time I would
get a series 3 because I think it's got
a little more speed to it and I but
here's the thing I really think when it
comes to Apple watches pretty much
across the board except for the ones
their reports say when the first Apple
watch is not compatible as some of the
new heartrate features uh but other than
that between like a series one and the
others they all feel kind of the same
it's just a matter of what extra little
things you want to pay for so now it's
like it's more like a car where it's
like they're all they're all gonna
function fine but do you swim or do you
want GPS or do you want the phone call
thing or basically what you know if
those don't matter to you then get the
cheapest one that's on sale and don't
sweat it
yeah I totally I agree with you 100% on
that I have a first Siri
one I tried a series two but because I
didn't want to swim I'm like I don't
need to get this and then the only
reason why I'm looking at series three
is I just want to see how well this LTE
thing actually works but am I gonna
really use em is it really gonna be good
enough for me to use the phone
differently that that's in my life and
where I live again right signal it
depends on where you go what you do in
the area that you really live in so it
it feels like this is gonna be one of
those products that people will have
different opinions on just because
there's so many different factors that
can dictate how well this actually
performs based on what you do or where
you are so I looked at it compared to I
kind of felt in the weeds because I
reviewed this is not the first watch
phone I've looked at and to me it's kind
of like a familiar thing at this point
which is not the case for a lot of
people I looked at this samsung series 2
3g Samsung s3 which had LTE I looked at
LG watch sport I looked at the LG watch
urbane LTE for like a hot second before
it was met and I you know they all had
trade-offs when it came to the s3 last
year none of them performed well doing
using cellular the s3 I liked as a watch
so again that was but you know it was a
trade off against the performance of it
with cellular so Apple went into the
same you know problem landscape and I
don't know if they would be able to
conquer it and they didn't really fully
conquer it but I do think it's working
more smoothly than it did on those
watches I still felt like when I first
set it up I was surprised that I was
getting work emails that was my
interesting part because we're on you
know that's like a pretty complicated
security login and yet here they were
just popping in once I first set up
syncing so that was kind of nice others
sometimes don't do that so there was
that there the fact that I was able to
get the phone calls I still had to do
because we're doing on the one test
phone I was having calls get forwarded
from my other account so you know
there's a lot of things I still want to
check out living off of it even more to
see if those weirdnesses continue or to
test it but it was a fun experiment for
like an hour
you know it was like it was the most
unique thing of the three products I
reviewed because the the iPhones really
didn't feel different on a general basis
so I thought that was kind of in a weird
way kind of Zen at first but I was also
impressed by that by the music function
which we can get into - please do yeah I
just want to make sure was a gift
talking but thank you talking forever
about this thing I know you can Scott
but I love you so I let you talk and
that's a thing I keep having to pull
away from this and go I'm a kind of a
smartwatch geek but the average person
doesn't need a SmartWatch and I still
don't think we've crested at the point
where there any sort of essential device
and then when it comes to Apple watch
you're also getting more and more each
with like GPS for runners GPS plus LTE
for runners and people who want to get a
phone call so you know you're slicing it
I think thinner Apple wants it to appeal
to more people but I don't know if we're
there yet but the music part
Apple did address something that finally
I think makes the Apple watch all the
models they get the update feel more
like an iPod before it's really annoying
the sync music to Apple watch it's
annoying the sync to Samsung gear s 3
it's annoying this thing to Android wear
it's just been terrible you have to set
up these playlists and way films
transfer the one thing the new one does
is that now a key number of most
listened-to albums and a few playlists
automatically go on the watch the first
time you're charging it even without
doing anything which is great because
the moment you want to start listening
to music it's basically like a
collection of you know I don't know 100
or so songs that are just there for you
and that actually was really nice and if
you want to add more you can add them
and then you do have to annoyingly Reese
put it on the charger and let it sit for
a while the transfer but it didn't take
as long to do that as it used to and
again I just felt like I started
listening to music more on them which is
like I never did before because the
music was just there and it also
sometimes
when I was walking or meant saving
battery life on my phone just using that
as the music player so there was that
that's not mean that that's something
that most people haven't actually talked
about is that just the fact that they
put making music on they're a little
more easy and it's just they're allowed
to listen that's interesting I I didn't
think I didn't even think about that
until you just brought that up I'm like
you know what I would probably do that
then yeah there's so many ways to look
at it like I kept slicing the review
into subsections and when I when I
handed in the review to edit it was like
you know two thousand plus words I
thought I was gonna keep this simple but
it's because a lot of these things it's
just like phones you have to look at it
all different ways like a phone you look
at how is it as a camera how is it with
this how is it with better like with
what with a smart watch now it's like
how is it as a music player how is it as
a fitness tracker how is it as a phone
now how is it as a watch so there's all
sorts of use cases that people might use
it for and they don't necessarily want
one but they might want the other so
yeah music I thought I think it's a
better iPod than it is a phone you know
that's very you're saying that because
in their pitch you know they're like the
big pitch their whole they're like
slogan it's forty million songs on your
wrist you know so it seems like they're
making a big push for the music but
you're saying like the music's actually
stored on on the watch and it takes how
long did it take to transfer over again
so you used to feel like it almost stuck
overnight used to like a bizarre you
just keep checking and I was thinking
how it's like Apple watch software
updates like sometimes they just seem to
SM Brian you tweeted about that one
point they seem to just hang for a while
and I go come on like this is doesn't
seem like it's gonna be that hard to do
but now it happened while I waited so I
could see it took a little bit of time a
few minutes but I could see the album go
from like put it on there to you know
now like the the graphic changed to show
that it was on the watch so a little a
little better still I mean it definitely
could be better plus the one thing
that's weird as you still can't send
albums directly from the music app into
the watch like you want to just be
listening the music and go add that to
my watch but you you can't you have to
when you launch
music got four first time it tells you
do it in your watch so it's like buried
in the watch setting still fine it did
work and it's stored there
you can I think it's like what is it to
gauge your so it's not a ton of storage
space it's like an iPod shuffle but it's
enough that you can put frequently
listen to things and the playlists they
automatically put on there keep getting
updated over time including the most
listened to albums you have I mean it's
weird like I think chill is a permanent
playlist that gets synced so like you're
going to have you're gonna have chill I
would like them to it's like the YouTube
album like I would like to be able to
remove chill oh yeah if I want to but
there's nothing else I would put on
there you know that's like not taking up
any space you use otherwise there's a
storage on the Apple watch is weird it's
not like storage on your iPhone so I
don't mind that they're sticking some
music on there I would like to remove it
but it's better than not having any at
this point and you can add your own
playlist as well that's cool very nice
alright here Scott so we're gonna move
on to the next product here it's really
the most recently reviewed product out
of this batch and it's the Apple TV 4k
and I was you know I
I always like to give Apple the benefit
of the doubt and hope that we hear or
find out something and I remember when
the Apple TV 4k was first launched and
they were talking about Dolby vision and
HDR 10 I'm like this is awesome but then
they never said anything about Dolby
Atmos or DTS X and for people that
aren't familiar I mean people that have
listened this podcast enough know how
much I'm all about Dolby Atmos because
it is amazing it's like once you
experience it it's the next level of
audio and home audio and so I'm like
okay well maybe Apple will didn't bring
it up because they didn't think it was
important and a lot of times when Apple
doesn't say something in the keynote
it's deliberately like yeah they don't
see it because they're not getting any
time soon so the Apple TV 4k came out
Dave caps um I reviewed it didn't the
awesome job digging into it but you know
you mentioned this thing about Apple did
really conquer Apple watches they just
kind of caught up and did something but
they're not conquered and I feel exactly
the same way with this Apple TV 4k they
had an opportunity here to actually
conquer the landscape or give us
everything we that everyone else has and
they can stay can do that but on launch
again it's like this mishmash of okay
here
here's 4k video but we're not gonna give
you the highest fidelity of audio that
is not like it's hard to find I mean
dolby atmos and DTS X have been here for
a while people have systems and I just
like how can you put Dolby vision but
not put Dolby Atmos in your box I that
just seems like it's just half of the
puzzle I just think it's absurd and not
only that you know it doesn't support
vp9 which is 4k video for youtube and
goodness I mean YouTube is the number
one video streaming platform on planet
earth so it doesn't have support for
that I don't know I just think there's a
lot of holes in this where it is still
the only set-top box at this moment
standalone that does Dolby vision others
do HD are 10 but it's just like and they
said they'll do a software update down
the road but again I was just like it's
an in it just felt incomplete to me yeah
I think if you are I didn't even get a
chance to look at it Katz Meyer has been
having fun with it I've been curious
about it and I'm hoping to go take a
peek at it it's a weird product because
you know it's actually to my mind in
terms of where Apple products are at
Apple TVs are low priced they're like
the thing you could go buy on an impulse
which is not the case for a watch or a
phone or an iPad at the same time yeah
there's a whole you know big curve of
audio/video file you know interest in
terms of well yeah well if you're going
to give this to me I'm gonna make the
move and put all my stuff on here I want
it to go all the way to the top and beat
that and like what is the Apple TV is it
meant to be a casual thing is it meant
to suit the pro you know top end
audio/video file needs and it's hard to
tell like you said and leave some things
out and then I'm like a person who look
I'm not it's it's embarassing my home
set up like I don't have any interesting
audio setup at home we listen to our TV
via the TV speakers by decree in the
home because we don't want to wake up
the kids I like to have a sound bar and
that doesn't even get turned on and so
it's um it is a 4k TV that I got last
year but yeah it's weird so I don't I
don't know I I you know I'm really like
not keeping up I kind of like threw my
hands up as far as like keeping up with
audio formats myself but it is
frustrating is you might find something
that you want to be watching or want to
be enjoying and I think is a lot of
performance to keep track of I just
don't know I I felt fine with work
anyhow it's been out there for a while
it's like Apple talked about it as if it
had just debuted I feel like every game
console and everything like you know go
to Best Buy and it's like for Kayla and
so congratulate it's good that it's
there congratulations and that's
important but this is not I was more
focused on like how they're reinventing
the idea of television and how this does
not do that we keep wondering whether
they're gonna have TV packages or other
stuff I mean it doesn't and so in that
sense it's another streaming box and a
bunch of streaming boxes and some parts
seem really nice in the end I feel like
for the $30 more it's like yeah you just
buy this one it's it's an easy kind of
no-brainer but and I'm curious about
games but I was curious about Apple TV
games before and while there are a bunch
of them it's not really used for that
and especially in terms of controllers
so I curved my enthusiasm with that part
is to well yeah I mean the whole idea
that you know Apple during their
keynotes they'll always pitch something
cool like hey when that when the new at
least the upgraded fourth generation
Apple TV came out they bring out a bunch
of developers but
because they do bring out a developer
that has something cool to show doesn't
mean that everyone's gonna jump on board
and you know the most for the most part
the games on the Apple TV the good ones
are just ports of very early iPhone
games that were popular like jetpack
joyride so you know this product to me
unless you even so here's the other
thing right just the way that it handles
video for example um HBO GO
they have they have a stream and it's um
they don't send you 4k streams but it is
an HD stream but because what happens
with the Apple TV is it basically takes
everything and tries to up convert it to
4k so anything that is not 4k from the
Apple TV so basically if you're not
watching iTunes movies from that our 4k
from an Apple TV it's going to convert
every other video source from every app
that you use on it to 4k but then when
it does that in the process it kind of
tweaks it adds its own flavor of HDR it
tries to optimize it but in a lot of
cases it actually made movies look worse
and so that are not native forbs it's
gonna say like anytime you you try to
bring the resolution higher it's gonna
make it look worse I don't understand
why there I didn't had no idea they were
doing that but that that's crazy that
they're doing that so it's like you know
on the surface look guess what again
this is as a general consumer someone's
gonna say see Oh Apple TV 4k this is
awesome I have a 4k TV that I bought a
year ago I'm gonna finally get a watch
4k but I think this is one of the one of
the products that really the devil is
really in the details when you talk
about this is not really this is not
trying to serve I don't know exactly who
it's trying to serve whether it's like a
mix of high end and a mix of consumer
and then sure Apple says they're gonna
get these updates to get dolby atmos and
whatnot but a lot of people when i when
i first put it out like apple for apple
TV 4k more like Apple TV for me like
some people got mad at me and one of
their arguments was look not everyone
has Dolby Atmos and when I hear that
it's
almost like people are now making these
built-in excuses for Apple like not
everyone has this technology Apple
shouldn't make it and that's like
exactly the opposite of how a technology
company or how we as fans and who love
technology should think we should not
ever say Oh only a few people have this
they shouldn't roll out with it
I don't that was telling me about how
maybe Apple has started to really build
this loyal following that is saying once
Apple gives it to me then it's ready for
primetime
I I didn't really seen that before well
I don't know if it feels like the
classic I'm thinking about like when the
first Apple TV the one before it not the
first and then one before this I feel
like we were all so surprised that it
didn't have 4k there was a thought of
like why it only goes 1080p like why is
that
and then even like the first the first
iPhone having edge instead of 3G at very
beginning of it oh yeah
oh yeah I mean we know they're not we
know that they're not always on top of
it's just that it's I just found this
product maybe I'm just bugged by it
because I have Dolby Atmos you know I
maybe that's why I bothers me I'm just
like just get it in there already and
they said they'll do a software update
if it's I'll be cool with it if it
happens within the next two three months
but if it takes six months to a year
that's kind of a joke to me you know I
liked about the whole 4k thing and I
think we talked about this before was
that they're not making you pay up more
for the 4k movies that if you built a
library of iTunes you can you get
grandfathered in which feels a bit like
razors and razor blades or like Kindles
and books where maybe if you have a
large iTunes library then you say well
now I might just spring for the 4k Apple
TV because if and all those
grandfathered in maybe that's the idea
but about I'm sure others will follow
suit I'm sure I'm sure that that will
spring I'm wondering when Amazon will
will do the same thing it would make
sense to upgrade your movie library
hopefully but I think it's a nice touch
but that has nothing to do with the box
that's just if you had a bunch of movies
that you had bought you have to pay more
yeah just one quick story
follow up just to add on a little
information that is recent that just
came out today a report or actually this
is based on an Apple support document
they are saying that with this new Apple
TV 4k you can download a local copy of
the HD version of the movie so you can
download it straight to the Apple TV
right
instead of streaming it because we know
even when streaming video it it's not
gonna be quote you know the highest
fidelity but at least with these HDR and
dolby vision ultra 4k versions of movies
that iTunes is offering it's only going
to stream them it will not download them
to the device for you to play so I found
that that's some kind of a subtle
interesting tweak that they are not
allowing you to actually download the
full 4k movie onto your Apple TV 4k
which also that's a bummer
yeah which also tells me that getting
the larger capacity unless you somehow
have God knows how many apps for your
Apple TV 4k isn't really necessary if
you're they're only allowing you to
stream the 4k versions of the movies so
there you go that's that's just a little
bit of news and information for people
that actually care I I don't know how
many people are actually running to buy
the Apple TV 4k but I don't know I want
it I wanted it to have Dolby Atmos
that's all I wanted that's all they had
to do for me and I'd be happy but I'm
not Apple TV now with 4k yeah that's
like basically how I feel and then yeah
it's not the ultimate box it's not going
for necessarily all the things that you
need but it's literally that and so
that's how I feel about it it was like
if I hadn't got one before I get the 4k
one having a please yeah I just get just
cuz yeah and and for the people that are
listening
look roku has 4k on their box and it has
Dolby Atmos support and it's only a $99
box and the Microsoft Xbox one also
supports Dolby Atmos so again it's not
like mainstream competitors don't have
this like this is it's actually kind of
normal to me so well so well we'll get
off the Apple TV 4k and you know we've
saved this for
later Scott because we kind of know
what's going on but let's talk about the
iPhone 8 and the iPhone 8 plus and your
you know you you have them right there
but let's talk about your impressions
and again you reviewed these so I'll
just kind of let you let you talk about
what what your what you thought so yeah
this is a tough review too because the
first thing you want to say is these are
boring and you think that when you're
hearing about what's new with them and
it almost feels boring by design because
at the same event instead of these being
the main event the intent is the main
event so they're instantly overshadowed
and maybe that's to drive your interest
in the tenth
so aside from that same design why do I
want that it reminds me of reviewing
MacBooks you know when I reviewed
MacBook Air year after year after year
we're doing an iPad
year after year after year where
sometimes you just say it's faster look
faster is a really good thing and photo
quality improving is always good because
folk cameras still need to get better on
phones they're not where they need to be
so I feel like any improvements that's
great and they were improved like
actually james martin was more impressed
than i was which was fascinating because
he noticed things i think as a
photographer i felt like they definitely
were better at low light colors seemed
richer but when i took a lot of side by
side photos with the 7 to 8 i showed
them to my wife she had our time telling
the difference so that's what you're
looking at is that i don't think you're
gonna get necessarily blown away by the
photos compared to the 7 but i do think
that they're better and also i think
video is the part maybe that shines the
most because that's something now we're
video quality in my mind on what you can
shoot on an iphone matches some of the
best quality video that you can shoot
period whereas were not quite there with
cameras and sor so i found that the
video quality I was shooting I was like
even more astonished and I thought oh
this looks really nice but they're
incremental and
the speed that you're getting on these
phones that's that's paper speed because
you're looking at in benchmarks and what
do you use it for maybe encoding video
editing movies and things like that but
are you doing that on your phone I mean
I clip some iPhone and share them I'm
not like going to be editing major
things so there's also the promise of
Apple repeatedly said that these new
chips and motion processors are used to
take advantage of AR but we've only just
seen the beginning of Apple's AR kid
apps and they work on previous iPhones
so you could just use your previous
iPhone and enjoy that for fun like
Google cardboard basically get enough
fun out of that for now
and wait for Apple to figure it out more
versus spending into this which will
eventually be updated by a future iPhone
that being said I think AR is the kind
of the coolest thing you can do and I
was surprised like I thought a R was
gonna overshadow the iPhone 8 before the
event started and you are waiting for it
right yeah I do it I just tell John I
was like this is gonna happen and look a
lot of them are gimmicky but some of
them are astounding and I just started
sharing some of these on Twitter and ask
you this some of them just one of them
blew up and all I did was just use the
capture and I just put them on just
having fun who knows they're weird yes
the world is weird it was like putting
IKEA furniture on a subway platform and
you can see it looks really good now
like the video quality when you capture
when you're an AR mode is slightly lower
than or is lower than what you get in a
normal video so that probably helps make
the placement of these graphics feel
more natural it's almost like everything
has been kind of blurred and gel
together but it works and the placement
looks really magical the it holds in
place pretty well considering they're
using regular cameras and that's really
awesome and I don't know where it's
gonna go next I think design and
measurement are the killer apps for
these things because that's something
that anyone could say I could use that
like dancing alligators and hot dogs and
all those other that
like those will come they'll always have
a limit because I feel like we've
already seen that with snapchat how much
more we argue snapchat already makes its
its little bit mochi dance on your head
and that feels like this so I think
everything is gonna keep getting better
Google's gonna get this too um but right
now I think it's the most impressive
thing you don't even need the new icon
for it yeah absolutely
um I wanted to go back really quickly
when we were talking about just the
camera in general and just a report that
actually just dropped today right we
have a DX Oh mark who is known for
basically kind of giving out the
official you know I I don't want to say
unofficial but really kind of the
industry official score benchmark of how
these cameras perform so according to
DxO mark they called the iPhone 8 plus
the best performing mobile device camera
we have ever tested so when it talks
about some of these screens it says in
its overall DxO mark mobile score of 94
the iPhone 8 plus camera beats out
pretty the previous top score which was
the Google pixel and the HTC you 11
which was at 90 the 8 just the standard
iPhone 8 measured in at 92 so pretty
much right we have the 8 plus and the 8
the top two cameras the 8 was 8 plus was
slightly better just kind of what you're
talking about ability to kind of be able
to do better low-light subtly just a few
subtle things I just gave it that extra
boost now they did say for video they
actually rated the pixels video still
tops at 90 and gave the iPhone 8 plus an
8 a score of 89 which is pretty much
basically right there but to your point
what you know when we talk about these
cameras James Martin our own scene a
photographer that went out and about
shot like over 2000 photos of it as our
phones are our cameras I mean this this
is the best camera on the market right
now overall yeah I would say so because
last year I mean that's what I'm saying
incrementally versus seven plus I mean 7
plus was a great camera and you know
since then
the difference is that a lot of other
phones have made really good cameras too
so I'd say there's a lot of great
cameras across the board
to the casual eye it's getting to the
point where it's kind of like reviewing
I don't know I'm not a TV review but I
would imagine it's like display quality
where you know sometimes you get into
nuances that the average person might
not appreciate but still we're here to
talk about and review it but I would say
like the notates camera pixel you look
at these phones that are taking all
really good shots none of them are
getting to the SLR level yet but they
you know the landscape feels very even
I'd say the 8 plus even more than
low-light yeah it's about the color it's
about like the general and that's that's
the ISP improvements here like there's
color and some detail things feel a
little different when you're shooting in
HDR and things like that it doesn't
always show up but sometimes you look at
it and go wow the colors are really nice
there and that's something that I
remember in previous iPhone comparisons
people had had talked about color and
said maybe you know that the colors
weren't as impressive on the eye on the
iPhone that that really feels like it's
been addressed with this so that can
make a huge difference for people if
you're really into photography on your
phone but if you're just looking to take
some good photos you could definitely go
with the previous generation and be fine
but you know yeah the best one is here I
only have pause because yeah we have the
10 coming up and now I don't feel like
the chip and everything else in there
might be more similar to the 8 + than
not because it shares supposedly the
same 8 a 11 processor I saw I saw a
slightly different speeds on our
benchmark between a 11 on the + and the
8 and the a 11 the plus I did get more
RAM on a recording - our benchmark app
so you don't know what the 10 is really
going to have but it does have an e 11
and it does have the same rear camera
wide-angle but it has a better telephoto
so that one's gonna have dual OAS in the
10 whereas the 8 plus only has OAS in
the wide-angle not the telephoto and
then it goes from what to point
to 2.44 close to the aperture and then
the front one is a whole different thing
because even though it's a seven
megapixel it's gonna have all that face
scanning stuff and the ability to do
depth of field not through dual cameras
but through they'll get like a very Xbox
Kinect type of a thing
that will take portrait mode photos so
maybe your your selfies will start
looking great
or even better but you know that remains
to be seen so that could be another
camera leap incrementally which is why I
would not you know for now the eight
plus is the best but if you're
interested in photos that much you might
want to wait it out yeah
alright Scott so what I'm gonna do here
because we are we're not gonna have you
hang for our phone calls because we we
appreciate your time
but I just kind of wanted to go down the
list for you if you would and just
personally being honest if you would get
them or not we already said for Apple
watch you would actually most more
likely recommend people to get and you
would get a series three versus a series
three LTE is that correct yeah unless I
really felt like the prices worked out I
just don't like getting word of my my
data plan I don't want to spend you know
it's if that we're not a factor if there
was nothing more added I might be
tempted to go for it yeah and if it
would share yeah if the carry isn't real
cool like that if they were yeah
but I don't like that's the thing that
bugs me the most and it you know and I
also think it's worth they should we
should see what happens when everything
gets ironed out if it gets a turn to
well I think it's worth pointing out a
lot of people in the chat room are
saying you get the first three months
free but I don't know if that you also
have to be locked into a contract or
whatever but with the LTE Apple watch
you get the first three months free on
every care on every carrier so it saves
you thirty but saves you 30 bucks 30
bucks yeah and also then you can see how
you like it and then maybe not use it
but again you know the fact that you
cannot set up the we didn't talk about
this the Apple watch cannot be set up
fully on its own you need an iPhone for
it so if you're traveling you can't
treat it as a second phone really so
that part actually affects it too is if
it was really a full standalone device
then I might get the LTE and say you
know what if I'm traveling
or something it could just be my one
phone and you sort of not really like
that
and also you know in terms of roaming it
seems like it's not being supported so
that there's a lot of questions about
how you set that up when you're
traveling that are unclear and roaming
the roaming issue internationally is
gonna be an issue because this ECM is
not does not work with all the carriers
that it would if it was an actual SIM
card chip right there's a lot of
questions there what happens
internationally and all that stuff and
we don't really know yet so that that
all sounds like a hold hold off on that
unless you're desperate to experiment
with it okay Scott's uh hey beat him I
need to ask you Apple watch Series three
are you yay or nay I'm an a I'm an a
right now based on a lot of stuff Scott
said I don't want to pay the extra $10 a
month and and he's saying it's hard to
you're not gonna get third-party app
notifications and stuff like that so
right now I mean now okay uh next one
I'm a yay I'm a yes but we'll see we'll
see if I turn to a name but I'm a ye I
actually they knocked on my door twice
already
they better left that box out there
because we're doing I mean seriously I
want to go get it but I'm not going to
okay
Apple TV 4k yay or nay start with you
Beach 4k I'm an a cuz it's what like a
hundred and eighty bucks or something
like that and it's Scott Stein oh sorry
go ahead
I feel like it's just like a glorified
Roku with 4k I don't know yeah Scott's
this this if I didn't have an Apple TV I
would be like yay or hope you like yay
or I would worry about another TV that I
just bought an iTunes library do have
things on iTunes I would I would say
yeah cuz it's not that expensive
compared to other it's compared to
stream boxes it's expensive oh yeah but
in the Apple store that is not an
expensive item so I am yeah I would do
it so I'm like I'm like flip a coin
because see I don't actually yeah I it's
frustrating to me but I'm gonna give it
I'm gonna give it a I'm gonna give it a
yeah even though I'm not happy with it
100 percent happy I'm gonna give it a
yeah cuz I would I would I would get it
I would get it I'm eventually gonna get
it I know I am so ok iPhone 8 or A+
gentlemen where do you stand on this
we're all in different places some of us
want to get the 10 some of us don't
there's all these reasons but where do
you stand with this Beach you go first
I'm actually seriously contemplating
selling my iPhone success and getting
the s e which is like 250 or 350 or
something so I'll actually make money
I'll make me you know and I don't know I
don't want a big ass phone in my hand I
like the smaller se size so that's I'm
kind of leaning towards that that's
that's that's legit I love that all
right mr. Stein i'ma wait I'm not yea or
nay I'm wait I feel like you have you
have to wait and see what the 10 is all
about and I think that unless you really
dead-set you're not on board the 10
which again it could be a huge a huge
pain or it could be actually good or it
could be you know just not ready for
right now or it could be amazing
you don't know if you if you decided you
don't want to afford that you don't want
to play that game fine but you know just
like what happens if that's the greatest
phone and then you already bought the 8
plus or the 8 it would be frustrating so
I would wait I also feel like if you
already have a 7 definitely wait don't
get this generation you don't need it
you can play around plenty of other
things they've been waiting a long time
and you want the same design and you
just won up-to-date phone then get it
basically it'll cover your bases and the
cameras great I still think I'm gonna
really miss having it a touch ID home
button I think I'm really gonna miss
that like I know already in my mind I'm
going to go for an X I mean I have to
just for the purposes of the show and
all this stuff but you know and at the
same time kind of to your point I I'm
like how the 8 isn't enough the 8
doesn't do enough different compared to
the 7 so it's like if I'm an upgrade I
have you know I want something that's
gonna be different but I think I'm gonna
really miss the home button a lot and I
think a lot of people aren't it's not
them bitching about like oh I'm not
ready to embrace new technology I think
it's just the way that it functions and
integrates within the OS across the
board
it's going to feel different and people
gonna miss it enough as we skipped using
that for any of our I really want about
your original headline without your
original headline for the review we
exited the Steve Jobs theater I feel
like it is enough was playing it mostly
and it never worked out
eight is enough on the cutting room
floor but I would say hate that I yeah I
just don't know about the face ID thing
and the problem is that Apple's
convinced it's gonna work we don't know
yet that's what reviews are for uh and
historically now there are moments when
Apple has introduced technology that
hasn't solved the thing that it
necessarily was going to and sometimes
it does so I could see it going either
way and that's the that's the problem
there it's like maybe it's maybe it's
magical maybe it's a huge headache and
that's aside from the security questions
which are we don't know about we just
don't know how it works really in terms
of security we don't know how apps fold
into it bunch of unknowns but I think it
could be really annoying just because
you're using this all the time every day
and it's your mission-critical device if
one little thing doesn't feel right then
it's like a keyboard then suddenly
you're gonna say forget it I don't I
can't put up with this unless you're the
person who want I think it's kind of
like in a weird way I think it's kind of
like the original iPhone
maybe that's giving it too much credit
but I mean in the sense that if you
bought that first iPhone it had
drawbacks compared to your average phone
interface you know no keyboard and at
that point things weren't hooked in and
take advantage of everything yet and you
kind of made do because you were into
the idea of Apple's new tech but it was
a hindrance between that and edge so I
feel like that could be what happens
with the 10 where early adopters will
have fun playing with it but it'll be a
tree that's a good point I like that all
right hey Scott we just want to say
thank you for hanging with us just they
for all your input and I hope you get a
little breather after all those reviews
I hope so tell John to help Falcone that
you should tell me I need it what was
that
we have a lot to do but I'm gonna try to
relax this weekend a little bit all
right excellent all right there you go
ladies and gentlemen Scott Stein thanks
again and we'll talk to somebody hey
thanks
okay Beach so um Scott you're free to go
and then we're just gonna wrap up the
show with our voicemails if that's cool
of course thanks a lot guys it's great
to be on eh thanks man
take care of multiple talk too soon
thanks so much always always men of
course it was awesome thanks cool thank
you okay it's just so we'll just it's
just just you me baby just you and me
and the 400 500 people watching all
right so should well I guess you'll just
put in some music transition then we'll
just come back and then get to the phone
calls sure we could just go straight to
him right now yeah let's go yeah I'll go
to him right now okay whenever yeah we
got a bunch of calls you guys thank you
very much for calling and everyone kept
it really short and concise - which was
nice we got yeah we're gonna I think
we're putting in like 10 or 12 calls
today we're giving we're giving it to
you also if you last this long on the
show you're a die-hard Apple Biderman
you're extra crunchy extra Munchie I'd
argue they want a longer show Brian they
want a longer one what seriously I get
that all the time why is it in an hour
why isn't it like giant bomb there's
like a three-hour podcast and they're
like well yeah yeah we're cool popular
 yeah that's cool I mean I don't I
ate over them on this show I don't want
to talk I don't want to hear my voice
for over an hour that's that's too much
already
yeah okay let's get this going all right
number one call is about wireless
charging which I don't feel is truly
Wireless but that's that's my opinion
here we go what up guys this is Lynn
from Denton Texas and I get to thinking
wireless charging that's cool and all
but what is Apple really trying to do
with that they're trying to get rid of
another port just some fodder for
conversation they're you know
wireless charging lose the port no
lightning port hey we don't need to plug
no stinking things into the phone do we
long live the iPhone 6s I'm gonna keep
rocking that for just a little bit
longer cuz it's paid for yeah
I'm cheap like that see you guys nice
because he's like we don't need no
stinking ports we don't need no stinking
ports yeah that's that that day will
eventually come though don't let's just
hope it becomes later rather than early
but that day is gonna come like did you
see Minority Report that's where we're
going with all this man oh yeah yeah he
definitely has a point he's right he's
he's hanging on to his success hang on
to it
the clutched clutching in your hands
okay we got another call here we go Roku
and Apple TV hey guys my name is Ahmad
I'm from Ann Arbor Michigan I love your
show I love everything Apple and I love
the keynotes and I always had a question
I'm gonna get the new Apple TV but I
keep a Roku around just because you
guys's app is not on Apple TV and I
watch it on the Roku and that's why I'm
keeping a roku long do you think that
you guys are gonna be as an app on the
Apple TV eventually or hopefully in the
near future
so I can get rid of my Roku and the
Apple TV only all right keep it up like
good question
wait was he Izone doubtful he's asking
are we gonna have a CNET app on the
Apple TV right now
Roku app we have yeah I don't even know
a station out but the road no we don't
the Roku app is pretty is pretty good I
only stoned out because I was pulling up
the mission the Michigan theme you know
the victory song the Victor song you
know that song it's like they played it
all the time in you know when I was a
big fat v fan like Chris Webber Jalen
Rose John Howard so I was like oh my god
anyways back to the topic at hand uh so
we've actually I'm just gonna tell the
audience
and keep it real for years I think it
probably for three or four years I've
asked if we were doing an Apple TV app
and I always keep on getting the same
answer it's in development one time I'm
like oh we're gonna actually test it out
in the next month I think that was two
or three years ago one that they gave me
that response so I don't I don't expect
us to have a seen an app on the Apple TV
anytime soon but if it pops up I was
totally wrong sense sent emails to see
net feedback at cnet.com really just go
to youth to honestly let's be real just
go to youtube seeds to YouTube and use
our YouTube channel has everything
pretty much yeah yeah you could do that
that works easier yeah yeah okay another
call here we go and I I ran into this
issue - a little bit the other day here
we go yeah hey guys I'm calling from
Stamford Connecticut my name is Bob and
I just had a question Brian quite a
while ago it's probably several years
now you had done a really good video on
how to create ringtones from tracks from
your iTunes library I have done the iOS
11 update and somehow erased all of my
custom ringtones and those steps that
used to work don't work anymore so I was
wondering if maybe you might be able to
kind of reprieve that video or just do
it on the show it would be awesome I'd
love to be able to get my well my old
homes back thanks man
Mike yeah so I did a little digging um
it's too hard to explain over an audio
podcast but I'll work on a video
basically guess guess what surprise
surprise
using this powerful tool called Google I
searched for how to get custom ringtones
on iOS 11 and there's actually a way
that when your phone is connected to
your computer and you can see what's on
your device like you can see the books
the audio books the TV shows and movies
your phone has to be connected to your
computer there is an actual folder
called tones and then basically you have
to navigate through the finder to
recover those tones and add them it's a
lot more in-depth than that but there is
according to a few articles ways to get
those ringtones back I
it's a huge issue and everyone's like
you know first people are happy that
they condensed iTunes down but it's now
been kind of a big pain in the ass for
even like 32-bit apps that no longer
work and getting ringtones that you've
had all this time so I will well we'll
work on getting it's just too hard
explain over the audio podcast so yeah
yes but there is a way the way if you do
update your iTunes make sure you do a
backup first of all your stuff put it
somewhere in a folder because after the
update Happ I did an update on all my
iTunes and all my computers after it
happens there's this little disclaimer
that pops up son said we're trying to
focus iTunes more on music and podcasts
so you're gonna have to like do some
work to get your ringtones back and it's
a yeah it comes up after you do the
update which is a big pain in the ass so
yeah that's a real that's a bad apple my
book that's a horrible
that's a horrible for about for about
APIs
let's horror bad new ones you know weird
but here's a good Apple we got a good
Apple so oh yeah I like that okay good
those we got bad apples let's check it
out a beach in tolling this is Brian
from New Orleans I wanted to throw out a
good Apple to Apple because they
preserved the lock screen with the
iPhone 10 which we're all really just
gonna call the iPhone X I do without
even thinking so good Apple I want to
throw it out there because I'm really
glad that the lock screen it's sticking
around that way our photos will stick
around I called a few weeks back
wondering if this was the death of it
but I'm glad it's gonna stick around
thanks yeah me too man nice baby yeah
that's a good thing but how long when
the iPhone X comes out how long is that
going to show up when you look at your
phone that's the question still well it
will actually here's the thing it will
show up because white pop or something
right yes exactly so you have to swipe
up once you look at it so you will be
able to see those dope pictures yeah
okay all right we got a face ID issue
here a concern hi guys my name's Evan E
and I'm calling from Detroit I currently
have an iPhone 6s
I watched the keynote and I can't get
mr. Howe no phone jack number one and
number two the safe ID
I personally don't trust it because I'm
african-american and I'm dark it and I
really don't feel like fighting with my
phone in a dark place to a lot of it so
I guess I'll stick with my 6s but I am
interested in the wireless charging and
I was wondering do they have any options
for wireless charging for that iPhone 6s
thanks for taking my call
bye I know what I hear man I love our
colors because you got to keep it real
she's keeping it real with us I love
that call um so there are way to jump on
about getting the wireless charging for
your 6s there are ways to actually do it
quite honestly uh one of my favorite
companies that's called Mophie they do
wireless charging cases and so what it
is it's basically a case that and they
make thin ones that you put on your
phone and then in addition that you'll
have like a charging base whether it's
connected to your desktop or connected
to like your car and it's magnetic so
for example it's kind of a system but
you can buy a case that has that is that
plugs in directly to your actual phone
and then you can charge a wirelessly but
again this wireless method requires a
case and then they have a variety of
different charging pads that you can use
so that's the way that I I was doing it
for a little while but I really just
like super thin cases and I was able to
get through the day so if you want to
look at it check out Mophie they have
their own you know forget iphone 8 and
stuff they do have charging cases and
there's other companies that do it as
well but i psych Mophie the most so you
can check that out oh cool
alright next call here we go another
face ID question hey Brian song huge fan
here DeAngelo from Atlanta Georgia isn't
the face ID similar to the face unlock
that googlies implement into their
systems
um a few years back I think even the
note 8 and I have it I'm not sure
I don't know seems like a little bit of
Apple pulling up old gimmicks and
reworking them making couldn't airplay
when they are putting Apple on it or I
on it and you know calling in new I
don't know moody they so DeAngelo thanks
for calling homie uh the thing is that
although they both are face recognition
type systems apples is significantly
different from a standpoint of the
technology under it is more specific so
for example like with the note eight and
the Samsung Galaxy s8 they use kind of a
combination of facial scanning and iris
scanning but the difference here is
really how much more in-depth it gets
remember you can you can technically
unlock an s8 or a note eight using like
a flat piece of paper with someone's
face or even holding a screen of another
phone up to it with the iPhone you can't
even you cannot even unlock it if
someone is wearing a mask
you can't unlock it if someone is not
looking at the phone so it's called gaze
right if they're closing their eyes or
they're not directly staring at it it
will not unlock as well and that's more
because Apple is and it you know it
takes time to get to this point but
Apple is using more advanced sensors in
their face recognition system again this
has there's really some interesting
implications of all this face scanning
stuff because although your fingerprint
and identity is protected by the
Constitution actually they said that
face face scans are not protected by the
Constitution so that's it you know and
what that really means is that if some
authority was holding your phone up to
your face you better close your eyes and
look to the side yeah because if you
don't they'll be able to not only get
access to your phone but it's not
protected by the Constitution so by law
so I think it really brings up some
really interesting things I really feel
like there is going to be a certain part
of the population that will refuse to
get a face scanning iPhone for now
because of those protections and trust
me there will be cases that end up
happening that
all this specific face scanning
recognition and what is now legal or
allowed under law moving forward there's
gonna be something that happens within
the year there's this yeah I remember
the San Bernardino terrorist attack that
happen yes and they would Apple refused
to unlock this phone for the FBI so I'm
wondering I have now the government will
have grounds and say well we have you
know there's this isn't protected so you
have to unlock right wondering I want
yeah that's that's a big question it's
really interesting yeah it's almost
that's scary because it almost feels
like it could be in more insecure than
previous fun absolutely I agree with you
man I'm totally there with you yeah okay
well let's keep moving on
while we chew on that in our brain
here's someone who was disappointed by
the event I was all together a bit
disappointed by the event I didn't think
that they showed enough of a real
warrant for me to upgrade from a 7 to an
8 or even intend for that matter I just
don't feel that Apple brought its a game
like it previously did but I just
haven't seen that last couple years
where they're breaking boundaries
they're just sort of kind of catching up
or keeping up with the other technology
companies but I just don't feel like
they're really making a great leap
forward or really innovating in a way
that I know I have to go by it I just
don't feel that as really yeah I've also
there's been lots of reports of like
smaller lines at the Apple stores for
the phone today and stuff like that
people aren't as excited I guess so yeah
I mean I the thing is that all the
pent-up demand is for the iPhone 10 I
almost called it X I don't even care if
I call it X 10 people just get over it
yeah but um you know everyone's waiting
for that but there's reports that
there's even more delays in production
and there are reports that they actually
have not even started production on the
iPhone X 10 yet whoa so honestly this
thing is gonna be pretty hard to get I I
think a lot of people are gonna be
whether your pre-order or you are wait
in line I think it's gonna be pretty
dang tough to get this phone initially I
don't think people are gonna be I don't
think the demand is the supply is gonna
catch up to the demand for at least six
months I really feel that way
they said there can only produce around
10,000 iPhones a day Apple typically
sells something like around a million
per day this is this is not gonna be
easy this is not gonna be easy so for
everyone that thinks it's just gonna be
like people will now understand what I
have been going through all my life
trying to wake up at 8:00 in the morning
7:00 in the morning trying to get the
latest Jordans or LeBrons or Kobe's
they're gonna feel this just like the
Nintendo people are feeling it now
they're like what this doesn't make any
sense
you're gonna feel it now and I'm just
gonna say welcome to my world
I'm just gonna say it's just like
Nintendo man with the NES classic and
all that stuff it's just gonna turn well
off welcome to my world just like you
guys are just being crybabies now wait
till it happens to entitled rich people
that can't get an iPhone X on an online
system there there will be hell to pay
for the for those people they will not
be able to handle it not be able to pull
it fire and fury yeah okay we got three
more calls listen it let's go through
them get them out of here
here we go hello this is John I'm
calling from Washington DC here's my
question I'm interested in the most
recent version of the Apple watch and
but I need to be accessible and when you
guys discussed it recently you didn't
indicate whether does it have voice over
on it or any accessible capability so
that someone with no vision can can
enjoy it thank you right so John my man
thanks so much for calling I actually
did a little digging on Apple's website
specifically with their accessibility
features in regards to the Apple watch
they do have a few really interesting
features for visually impaired people
they obviously have their voiceover
system which is a carryover from what
we've seen on their phone where you know
it can read what's on screen but it also
has this ability to through their taptic
engine actually tell you the time
through a discrete like you know tapping
through your it
that indicates our and minutes whether
it's through Morse code or digits so it
has that it also has the other visually
impaired features like for font
adjustment and zooming I don't know if
this is exactly gonna serve you the way
you want it's one of those things where
I'm sure you'll have to go to store and
kind of really check this out with
someone to see what it can really do for
you but they do have specific features
for visually impaired people so I'm
hoping that that at least is some sort
of an answer that you at least know okay
there is stuff there and it just comes
down as seeing how it works for you so
you know there you go that's a great
answer Brian actually but it is worth
mentioning what Scott said is it's hard
to hear that thing if you're in shouted
crowded place you know so totally not
the point team in air pods in new year
all the time you know what's going I
like we did a skit and everyone was
ripping on me like oh get those damn
things out of your ears I'm like I wore
them as a joke because they look so
ridiculous right and you don't address
them you just put them in your ears and
you let people say what they want to say
and it's hilarious the stuff that they
say like they can they can't contain
themselves they just can't yeah
it's also worth mentioning that when
Scott first joined our skype he was
using air pots to talk to us and it
sounded like crap it sounded like it and
it's how I like dude just get rid of the
just get rid of the air pods just talk
through your computer and the mic
sounded tense better so means Oh legit
yeah they need a way better mic for that
okay we got two calls left us do them
hey Ashley from Iowa and once a guys
always keep it very informative and
awesome listen should want to wait for
the new Apple TV to come out or would
one be okay with giving me one than is
currently available all right thanks we
gotta show love some ladies Ashley
thanks for calling I think we kind of
answered some of that earlier in the
show right yeah it depends on if you
have a 4k TV if you care do you even
which Apple TV do you have right now I
think all of those will factor into it
if you don't have an Apple TV I think
you're still okay with getting the
TV for Jen but if you don't have an
Apple TV and you have a 4k TV just for
purely future down the road stuff just
get an Apple TV 4k because I think it's
only like a thirty dollar difference
between the two models too bad oh this
is our last call and he just wanted to
lodge a complaint he's uh you must
remain anonymous hey Brian beating them
viewers I have to be anonymous for this
one because I'm complaining
Apple increases the price of Apple Care
Plus for iPhones by twenty dollars and
the iPhone 10 buy another $50 and they
increase the price of the 256 gig and
512 gig iPad pro configurations by $50
today
the only reason being it made sense in
their lineup so I you know what I think
that you should at least give us your
first name it's not like we're gonna
track you down Apple is not gonna come
after you man thing like I mean they may
not they might ban you from there a
whole ecosystem but you know they might
not invite you to the keynotes anymore I
mean it is people started like picking
up on that and they like like the fact
that we get we're not invited cuz it's
like yes like it's almost like they like
that would like yeah dude that's a badge
of honor Brian I agree I think you know
they don't want you there because you're
not good you're gonna tell the truth
yeah it's like what's I praise them I
also criticized the problem here
you know anyways I did want to address
the fact that we didn't talk about last
week cuz there's been it's hard when
there's so much stuff like big
high-level stuff coming out that we
don't get to talk about all the nitty
gritty all the time but in fact the
collar a mr. anonymous was right right
Apple increased the prices of certain
iPad pros because according to them in
the industry there's a rising cost for
NAND flash is becoming more scarce as of
late it happens especially when you
quite honestly Apple might be to blame
for the reason why the iPad pros have
increased in price because Apple is
sucking up all that as
as Samsung and Google right when it's
primetime for their photos they're
sucking up all of the available RAM a
flash memory sorry the NAND flash memory
and so it becomes scarce it increases
prices
I honestly think that's a direct result
of the new phones so make sense they're
indirectly
increasing the price of their products
yo I'm just glad I got an iPad pro when
it came out cuz I'd have to pay 50 bucks
more I'm not even trippin I think that's
that's one of the benefits of being an
early adopter the only time where I
could say it totally paid off that's the
only time so there you go man that's it
what a show bro yeah
this is like marathon out 20 or
something I don't know we've been going
