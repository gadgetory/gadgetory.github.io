they're kind of hard to find in stores
but we've got a pair of them today the
80 of book 9 spin an 80 book 9 Pro
they're basically Samsung's equivalent
of a MacBook Air at a MacBook Pro except
with a couple of quirks the spin flips
around on a 360 degree hinge and the pro
has a dedicated GeForce graphics chip
these are extremely high quality
machines with rigid aluminum frames that
don't bend or creak when you flex them
around and both of these computers have
core i7 processors eight gigabytes of
RAM and 256 gigabytes of solid-state
storage high-end specs all of them
they're also both touchscreen machines
with some pretty high-end touch screens
too
the spin has a 3200 by 1800 high-def
touch screen and the pro has a 4k screen
as well now perhaps you have considered
a Samsung laptop in the past even read a
CNET review and you've been put off by
their lack of ports well of these new
machines have a much longer frame design
it has room for more each of these
machines even the smaller 13-inch one
has three full size USB ports and a full
size HDMI port to connect to a TV no
more tiny adapters if you're a
photographer though you'll probably want
to go for the pro which has a full sized
SD card slot hidden under one of the
edges and a USB type-c port the
future-proof peripherals I've only used
these machines for a couple hours so far
but I really like their nice responsive
keyboards and touch pads the touch pads
on these machines
definitely rifle apples amazing touch
pads in the MacBook Pro and MacBook Air
that's unusual for a Windows labs
but you're paying a pretty penny for
this build quality in these specs the
spin will cost you $1400 out of the gate
and the pro the 1600 I'm also not too
sure about the battery life on these two
computers Samsung rates the spin at
about 7.3 hours on a charge and the pro
at about 6.5 but we generally find
computers last a good bit less than the
manufacturer estimates and practice and
if we're talking about manufacturer
estimates computers from Dell HP and of
course Apple's MacBook Air and MacBook
Pro line lasts up to 12 hours on a
charge so we're expecting these will
fall a little behind the pack but if
you're looking for an extremely high
quality laptop and you're willing to pay
for it maybe carry a charger along with
you these might be worth considering</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
