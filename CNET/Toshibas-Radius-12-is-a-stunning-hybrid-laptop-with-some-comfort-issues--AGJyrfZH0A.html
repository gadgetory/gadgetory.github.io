often been the way to go but now they're
shooting a little bit higher up the
totem pole hi I'm Sean Hollister with
CNET and we're taking a look at the
toshiba satellite radius 12 it's a
twelve and a half inch laptop with a 4k
screen a nice thin light convertible
system it flips all the way around this
laptop crams a Core i7 processor eight
gigabytes of memory and 256 gigabytes of
solid-state storage into an all-metal
body it's just 15 point five millimeters
thin and weighs about 2.9 pounds on par
with other thin and light laptops its
size only this one has a 4k screen
that's been Technicolor certified it's
got a 100% Adobe RGB color gamut and
from what we've seen if it's so far it
definitely is a bright crisp clear and
colorful display couple problems one of
them is the amount of glare you'll see
off of this screen it's so reflective
that when the display is off it looks
like a mirror and even with it on you
could be watching a 4k movie on this
screen and see reflections of what's
gone on behind you the other problem is
what you're going to watch on this
screen even though it has a beautiful 4k
display there isn't a lot of content out
there Netflix and Amazon both have their
4k videos available but not on the web
you can't view them on a PC only on a 4k
television YouTube does allow you to
watch 4k video on a PC but even with the
fast core i7 chip in here even if you
let the stream buffer a little bit let
that data cache we still see a bit of
stuttering and make no mistake what
you're paying for here is the 4k screen
not the rest of this laptops chassis
some of the creature comforts artists
students we'd like the keyboards a
little bit mushy even though the
touchpad has a brushed metal surface
it's a little bit uneven as I move my
finger around the touchpad some places
to smooth other places it's rough for no
particular reason still you do get a lot
speed for your money here and the
Toshiba Satellite Radio's 12 has a few
cool tricks up its sleeve you can bend
the screen over backwards like a Lenovo
yoga system it's a trick they picked up
from that line all the way back down
into a tablet configure
if you like there's a search button on
the side so you can jump right into
Cortana Microsoft's voice assistant and
ask her a question if you like the 256
gigabytes solid-state drive in this
machine makes it lightning fast to boot
up and there's a pair of facial
recognition cameras mounted right over
the display that'll log you in without
entering a pin or password you just have
to present your face there's a
full-sized HDMI socket that can output
4k video one of those fancy new USB
type-c ports we've got a full size full
depth SD card slot one of our big
concerns with a laptop this thin with
such a high resolution display is how
long the battery is going to last
we know that 4k screens drink up the
juice like nobody's business
the competitors in this space are
courting 9 10 11 hours of battery life
Toshiba says this one will give you 6
and a half hours for a $1300 laptop that
may not be enough for you and it's
something you may want to consider when
you're deciding where to spend your
money I'm Sean Hollister with CNET and
this was the Toshiba Satellite radiused
well
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
