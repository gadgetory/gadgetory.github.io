back with project Morpheus Sony's
virtual reality headset was demonstrated
back in the spring and it's here again
at the show with new games and demos
there's a castle demo there's a luge
demo and there's actually a a Valkyrie
playable here as well three different
experiences one is in a full recline and
some of them have you fighting at
dragons all sorts of experiences and I'm
going to be trying it out for the first
time and there's no release date
targeted for project Morpheus it's still
a project but the headset and the move
controllers all that stuff really is is
ready to go right now and it's a very
immersive experience and works with
PlayStation 4 so here we go
I'm an ego Montoya see you out they are
not trying on a virtual reality headset
so how do you communicate this what does
it feel like it feels like it's coming
at you but also the weapons have a lot
of physics so I was able to see the mace
swinging over my head a lot of accuracy
with the crossbow is able to hold it up
to my eye close one eye and aim through
it to be able to shoot at things and you
could bring the sword point right up to
the knight and tickle his chin or
decapitate him whatever you want to do
so the sense of the world around you
with those move controllers
feels a lot more present than you know
other types of VR like oculus that don't
have those motion controllers in them
yet there's also a Valkyrie which is a
standard DualShock 4 controller and then
you're looking around a space comment
and using all those controls eval free
shows how it could be more like a
console experience and maybe how you
take games like shooters and put them
into virtual reality but all of them
show that the position tracking is great
and then there's Street luge where I was
lying down flat and using my head to
navigate as I was sliding under big
tractor-trailer trucks and going through
weeds to try to get to the finish line
like a race each one really showed
different ways you can move your head or
control put yourself in different areas
the most visceral for me was the street
luge I could see my belly sitting here
and I was shooting down the road and it
felt like you were sliding out of
control down you know country highway
for my glasses it's really hard but the
project morpheus design allows you to
slide right on and work even with mega
thick prescriptions like mine no date no
pricing but project Morpheus is Sony's
interesting experimental and very real
virtual reality technology here at e3
