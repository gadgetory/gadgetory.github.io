few hours and we're already ready to
torture it the first common scenario is
that you're at home washing the dishes
with your watch on this isn't really
bothering it too much but please somehow
if it slipped off and you had a pot full
of water the watch has been in the water
for just over 10 minutes and it's time
to rescue it
and see if it still works so far it's
responding completely normally the watch
has no problem being dunked in water for
more than 10 minutes let's see what kind
of scratch damage we can do starting
with a grader
so far so good
something's coming off but I don't know
if it's from the grater from the watch
next a microplane one of my favorite
kitchen gadgets
Wow there's not a single scratch on the
screen did I miss anything there is
nothing wrong with this watch after we
just tortured it with every sharp object
we could find in this kitchen well done
since our watches band is white we want
to see how it reacts to various colored
foods like wine say you're enjoying a
little oh oh my gosh maple syrup soy
sauce ketchup mustard
Nutella
let's try to rinse this off
aside from a little grease from the
peanut butter no food lodged in the
crown nothing stuck in the button on to
the next one will the Apple watch
survive boiling water there's only one
way to find out
oh sorry I'm so sorry I'm so sorry okay
oh okay just a few minutes after we took
it out of the boiling water
the watch is rebooting itself and we
also got a high temperature warning so
this watch does not like boiling water
what happens when you drop an apple
watch there's only one way to find out
okay drop it and step on it in case you
have a really bad one
the watch is functioning as usual it can
definitely handle a fall impact is a
huge issue with watches let's see how
much it can handle I have a seven pound
cast-iron skillet here say you forgot
that it's on the kitchen counter I
forgot oh my goodness we destroyed it it
took several torture tests but we
definitely destroyed it
