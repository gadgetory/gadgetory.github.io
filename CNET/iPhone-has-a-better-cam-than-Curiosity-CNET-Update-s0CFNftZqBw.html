about megapixels I'm Bridget Carey and
this is your cnet up at the curiosity
Mars rover was a two and a half billion
dollar project and a technological feat
but as images come in from the rover
everyone's buzzing about how the camera
is just 2 megapixels why would NASA send
up a camera that's not even as good as
the one on my phone well there's quite a
few factors for starters the designs
were proposed in 2004 when 2 megapixels
and eight gigs of flash memory sounded
pretty good then had to go through lots
of tests to see if it can handle the
Martian environment because you don't
just switch a camera Midway and redo all
that expensive testing and then there's
the issue of data more megapixels the
larger the file and that makes it harder
to send back to earth plus the computers
have to transmit other data to NASA
besides those pretty pictures but don't
you pout they'll still be getting some
great images since everything is so
still on the surface it can easily
stitch together clear panoramic shots as
the juicy courtroom battle between Apple
and Samsung continues cnet has learned
that Google has been quietly helping out
samsung google has kept a low profile in
this fight over patents and accusations
of copying designs but Google has not
abandoned its popular Android partner
google has coordinated with Samsung over
legal strategies with advice doing some
legwork and for searching for prior
evidence you've been hearing about
NASA's successes with the Mars rover but
NASA also made news for a failure the
Morpheus Lander crashed and caught on
fire during an experimental launch more
face is a vertical takeoff and landing
spacecraft it's designed to land a
thousand pounds of cargo on the moon but
back to test she goes you win some you
lose some if you're used to term Metro
as a way to describing the new look at
the block style interfaces and windows
well time to drop that term because
Microsoft will no longer describe
something as having a metro design
because it's clashing with a European
partner that just also happens to have
metro in its name so it's just windows 8
no fancy little terms just keeping it
simple
and how about we end the show with a
super cute attack the angry birds
franchise is teasing us with a new bird
character this time it's a wittle peak
Street heart that blows bubbles but even
when she gets angry it's a durable rage
Rovio is keeping quiet though on when
she'll make her game debut that's your
tech news update but if you crave more
details just pop on by the blog sina com
