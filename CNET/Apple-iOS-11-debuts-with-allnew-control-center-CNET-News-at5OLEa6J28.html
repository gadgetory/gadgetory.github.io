11 but also some really big features and
what you'll notice is control center is
now a single page packs all the features
into a single page now of course it has
simple switches I'll just do an
orientation lock it's got a beautiful
little animation there for the
orientation lock it has sliders
available so you can adjust volume like
this but it provides greater depth
because with 3d touch 3d touching on
slider like this and get access to more
controls and this allows us to pack lots
of capabilities really easily into the
design so you see we have our wireless
controls so I could just tap on airplane
mode but if I 3d touch on the platter I
get access to even more features this is
really great with your music because you
can operate them here or jump in for
even more information so it's a really
great new control center and I think
you're really going to love it so for
iOS 11 we're making a big upgrade to
your primary interface and dealing with
Siri that series voice here's the
forecast for the next 10 days sunny
sunny and sunny
three different ways to say sunny very
powerful now Siri also has a male voice
and it sounds fantastic - I love machine
learning especially since I'm a machine
learning and it's able to provide you
with follow-up questions and answers
with just a tap and multiple results
when you make a query it's really handy
so you can now ask something like how do
you say what are the most popular dishes
in your restaurant in Chinese and Siri
can say even thank you you're nuts its
height so you sure Wangyal totally now
translation initially will support
translation from English to Chinese
French German Italian and Spanish and
will have more language combinations
coming in the months to come with Siri
intelligence Siri not only understands
your voice it understands the context it
understands your interests and
understands how you use your device this
allows it to ultimately understand what
you want next so can actually suggest
topics we might be interested in
learning about in news can help us
respond with our location for getting to
an appoint
to someone in messages and even helped
us make a calendar appointment based on
something we've just booked inside of
Safari on the web next let's talk about
the camera now with our latest iPhones
and iOS 7 they get we're using HEV C
which is giving us up to two times
better compression for camera captured
videos which means less storage space
used on your device and less space used
in the cloud and now with iOS 11 we can
take in low-light photographs using
optical image stabilization true tone
flash HDR delivers incredible image
quality</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
