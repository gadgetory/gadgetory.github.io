see that UK podcast and this is episode
421 for friday the 13th of februari 2015
walls have ears your samsung TV is
eavesdropping on your conversation the
apple watch will get you off your ass
before your laziness literally kills you
and the first up onto phone is on sale
for a limited time only you lucky people
I'm rich trinoma joining me on haight
upon us to do this week is and the oil
hello you came to me first off nice I
know yeah I get to say hello slightly
earlier look you can totally scoop him
in what you say is well ah alright
something ah no I ruin it for it right
look I'm try and beat that drives away
uh casual I've a late supper perfect
let's kick off this and I think you
fellows from the 90 where's the beef
catch the wave Oh cowabunga that's good
news
well if you have a samsung smart TV
there may well be that that TV is
listening in your private conversation
your living room and sharing it with the
world now good well no and that's you
know what we found out a while ago
looking at the terms and conditions of
samsung things it's a bit frightening
really mean what if it's listening to
private secrets and then giving out a
way to advertisers and what not but
before you get too worried to Luke I can
tell that you are getting a little bit
worried eyebrows are accelerating
upwards in line and rightly so but those
eyebrows can actually come down to a
more standard level yeah regular k so
what this actually about what it was
something tv's doing so samsung smart
tvs they have voice activation voice
control so you can you can say things
you know like go to BBC or you can tell
it to do whatever you want and it will
be able to listen to you and listen to
those voice commands yeah but what was
found out in some of the fine print it
says and i quote please be aware that if
you're spoken words include personal or
other sensitive information that
information will be among the data
captured and transmitted to a
third-party through use of voice
recognition well that sounds pretty
terrible right I feel stupid now for
making up a song out of my credit card
numbers well Andy I mean so they've
actually changed their policy so yes so
now that policy has been reworded i
think in response to because this just
came out as a bit of an errand right
absolutely yeah but using this is a good
idea that you think we actually need
this well I do yeah I think this is
important tech because the end of a day
is not listening to all your
conversation feeding all of that back
because it would the end of a day you'll
be listened to hours and hours and hours
of everybody's conversation all the time
and what's anybody going to do with that
job but the good thing is is that if you
have these devices are always listening
it means that you can always give them
orders you can always say you know k do
this and xbox on because the xbox one of
course had there's bit of an outcry then
when it transpired that would be always
listening and always watching really and
with with things like voice control you
don't want to have to physically go and
turn something on and then get a
controller to do something and go into
settings and activate voice control
use voice control the whole point is
that you can still walk into rooms a
cool Xbox on let's do this samsung on
yeah well as you see that's kind of a
good thing I only hear that disagree
because and I do think this is pretty
shaky stuff yeah for like for one thing
this is also happening in a post NSA
revelations thing well yeah I think
we've all realized that actually maybe
he's the worst case scenario stuff
without personal data is actually
happening yeah um so you know if there's
a bit of an outcry about Samsung being
like oh FYI don't because with this
we're collecting it and wisdom of doing
a lot of stuff with it don't worry about
it but you know just like just try and
keep it light in the living room you
know don't confess to any crimes
anything is fine ok ok hit back you know
that that that to me does sound
suspicious I don't like the idea and
also like I think at the end of the day
it's not like it's not like this is a
feature that's worth giving up that
privacy for either like like voice like
Andy said the voice recognition on these
TVs on the Xbox non-syrian stuff it's
not like something that's always
listening for your voice commands it's
like someone who's half listening but
you're talking to someone well and they
sort of zoned out so you're like Xbox on
so mum like I do you in all that even
now yeah what this late I just I'm
sending some tech at present I think the
problem is Izzy the brolly map what oh
you've run about volume volume up no no
problem ah that's called mute there's a
super sorry I wasn't listening ah but
it's an issue here right it's not so
much that it's listening all the time
though because obviously this could this
conflicting pins Manus yeah good idea
it's more that it's sending it to the
third party so who are we talking about
this third party so it's nuanced okay is
the company that does it and they they
are a voice recognition yeah they're
they're about voice recognition to their
about using these two why do they want
to hear listening on our private
conversations loose lips sink ships and
all right what are they worth yeah
that's some laughs inner they're trying
to sink the ship step well knew what
nuance is a voice recognition company so
companies that like Samsung that use
voice recognition in their products that
voice data gets sent off to a third
party I believe Cirie users and you want
although that hasn't been officially
like a firm
and that that company sort of crunches
all the noises yeah and spits out the
words it's like a rough approximation
not volume or whatever and and then
sends it back okay so you know and what
do it wouldn't that sense it is a third
phone well something i will say that
samsung has updated it so its policy on
this to say that isn't that it's not the
wording is different i will i will i'll
read this app to you it says samsung
will collect your interactive voice
commands only when you make a specific
search request of a smart TV by clicking
the activation by the toilers to you can
also turn this setting off so if you go
onto on to see that you'll find and ask
what's ethical cool it's called how to
turn off Samsung's voice activation fee
you look at look from just shatter your
laptop then it'll be like I was
listening the whole time and I've
already opened it yeah what are we to
say about this one really quickly well
broadly speaking and tried to find a few
balanced comments on this but there
aren't any really am because paranoia is
rampant among our commenters apparently
yes but is it paranoia Justin are they
actually how to get you it's not
paranoia if they're actually oh that's
good cer 99 says the possibilities for
misuse of conversations far outweigh the
advantages of this feature I would not
pay extra for this feature I'm doing air
quotes with my voice there okay because
I sure as heck wouldn't trust or use it
as is meanwhile candied ape says note to
self don't buy anything from Samsung
damning and jg hangin says for one thing
that's really disturbing however what
doesn't anymore with all this smart home
stuff out there pretty much everything
you say and do is tracked i'll stick
with old-school appliances thanks oh
well alright then grandad I don't stick
with old-school appliances because we
had this rubbish computer in my first
school and all it could do was make this
turtle move around it sounds like he
couldn't even do that very well you have
to give it loads of instructions it was
a coding game though the point was that
you give it a stir like a step down from
a regular turtle which only move one
space left we also had like a rumba that
you could that you could code you could
sort of put all the instructions in the
Rumba and you could be like okay from it
wasn't remember but like I know you had
a house cleaner
lame at the kitchen clean the kick oh it
was more like move it was like you could
make the robot go say eight feet forward
and then rotate a certain number of
degrees and then go back it wasn't
cleaning I was just just wandering
around making Lauren s if anything she
teased makes on the side to grab cables
and every 50 feet it would cough out a
big like a chocolate dislike little
glitter yeah LEGO pieces and take the
back off your hole punch so all the open
polls will just be scattered all over
the room and special sensors for like
white leather remember this it's red
wine has some treatable anyway I'm going
to move on to the apple watch now if I
may because Tim Cook has been talking
about the Apple watch which is due to
come out sometime in April and tim has a
war on sitting and in fact he says
sitting is the new cancer or you know
some pretty much means being big big
words there his point being is was
watching to do about it if you're
sitting down to them well the watch is
going to vibrate and tell you basically
to get moving get up off your ass and go
and do some things I'm seeing in this
chair wait so like it sort of buzzes
every now and again to be like you sat
down for a bit so did you mean to it
looks like you're having a sit-down you
got something really important going on
in that chair is that why yeah that
sounds like quite a nagging to me that
it's gonna you know if you sit for a
while that this watch is gonna tell you
although having said that though we
looked into this studies have linked
excessive sitting with being overweight
and obese type 2 diabetes some types of
cancer and premature death so there you
go is thought to slow the metabolism and
yet there's a piece of research that was
published that we found with from the
NHS involved almost 800,000 people found
that there was a ninety percent increase
in death caused by cardiovascular events
with among people who sit but much less
I lose that is why we do our podcast
standing up exactly that Lance is that
question otherwise we look so damn
healthy all its keepers there is also a
hundred and twelve percent increase in
risk in bit of diabetes I don't quite
know how you can have a hundred and
twelve percent increase
means some people get diabetes twice
sitting is soap is that that looked
terrible isn't like Elvis if attentive
there is also 40mm percent increase in
death from any cause so there you go but
I mean you know well I like some
downright not from any cause not from
like jogging ninja being over yeah for
me out of a plane and yet so so I mean
you you quite like seeing down deserve a
good sitting down I don't I mean who
doesn't enjoy a good citizens where I
remember burns I just sat down and they
talk about all the virtues of sitting of
which there are many rights I mean I
don't like the I'm not arguing I'm not
disputing this bad for me and that that
is very distressing news yo get it gave
me today when we were discussing the
podcast and you said you're gonna go
diabetes twice as you know that you're
dying just sat down mmm I would row but
I don't like what the Apple which is
doing I would rather die sitting live on
my legs that's fair enough what about
what about readers desert does anyone
have any interesting insights into this
subject those guys yes they do amira me
says my question is what other than the
heartbeat can the Apple watch do that
the health app on my iPhone can't okay
do I really need a separate watch I know
wearables are supposed to be the next
big thing but so far none of the watches
I've seen particularly impress me harsh
words resin yeah well as a thing like
with what we up a watch there's quite a
lot of it's still very much unknown and
particularly salwar apples been doing
with third-party developers which
historically is what Apple's done really
well but you're getting all the apps
into the iphone and stuff so there's a
lot of things that we just don't know
when that's why we're so excited to
actually get it in our hands since I
light it in April and yes we will miss
200 says apples business model is rather
brilliant let other manufacturers do all
the innovation grunt work spending and
stumbling through initial product
releases while it tweaks away at
perfecting safe to say Apple didn't
invent the computer telephone or watch
but they sure are good at making them
really thin and what I like about that
comment as I can't tell if it's
sarcastic it's like obviously innovate
or if it's like well done that really
needs a sarcasm tag around it doesn't it
to find out well Joe actuary says I
think an hourly reminder is actually a
really good idea this way you'll know
it's time to recharge the Apple watch
hey
I boobs are with a girl injection I
would actually like to try to watch that
sort of vibrates on my wrist to tell me
to get up and move around yeah
interesting experiment so it is like
yeah electric shock I think would be
more at a massive at once so large that
you can't stand up but it delivers it
until you do get right on that I'd like
to have one that makes this podcast
easier because i had whiplash last week
and we having to stand facing forwards
but looking at you it's really hurting
my neck so i'm going to move on to
spider-man okay that's why when he said
when he's an ad whiplash last week I was
trying to think what happened on the
podcast yeah you weren't on the potholes
on the bus goes on you're away or
something with and that's when I got
whiplash anyway I'm going to talk about
spider-man specifically I'm going to say
the word spider-man and then say rich
something's happening with spider
excellent research yeah that's a great
news for spider for hands spider-man man
spider-man sorry that's a common mistake
rich man is the name got it got it
spider-man mr. spider John spider-man so
yeah so spider-man is gonna be in the
Marvel Cinematic Universe oh you know
how all the mobile movies lately like
the Avengers Iron Man Thor all those
kind of things they're all linked
together they're all in the same shared
universe they hear of this crossover and
spider-man hasn't previously been a part
of that because even though he's a
marvel comics character the film rights
have been owned by Sony which is a
different film studio and they've made
their own series well now Sony and
Marvel have got together and they've
agreed a deal so that search by the man
will still be in the Marvel movies and
yes that's a great news it means we can
have her I mean sets up other such
stories like civil war which is comic
story that will be adapted into a movie
in a few years and spider-man is a big
part of that so it's excellent news in
that exciting regard yeah absolutely and
they've come to deal with the money as
well so the in spider-man's solo movies
that have made by sony Marvel doesn't
get any money but when spider-man
appears in a crossover movie like The
Avengers so he doesn't get any money so
it's a kind of you know it's a nice way
of sharing their playing nice together
it's a deal interestingly it's slotting
in an extra spider-man movie means that
the
the Marvel movies are being moved back
so Captain Marvel and black panther and
like that can think I've been delayed a
little bit longer okay but there you go
okay it's spider-man good yes spider yes
bye bye spider-man man spider-man and a
bit with a little bit but spider-man is
the best superhero yeah now that's not
to say that I enjoy the spider-man
movies more than I enjoy other superhero
movies but I think they're rubbish lots
lots of them are some of them are good
and some of them are bad okay but I i
think if you if you listed all of the
superheroes and you you sort of you talk
to a child who hadn't seen any films or
read any comics or anything and you just
described them spider-man is the one
with the most potential he's the coolest
he swings around on Webb's from his
hands and he's got the strength of a
spider so he can throw cars like not
like a spider can but proportionally to
what was fighting did and he can walk up
walls and he can do all sorts of lovely
stuff and he's cool he's like half
spider half man he's brilliant you know
it's way better than wait a minute what
about Batman Batman is rubbish okay no
even I know Batman's rubbish because
like I think I think the thing about
Batman is I'm tired of him he doesn't
have any doesn't have any superpowers
which come on for a superhero that's a
bit of a bunch of failures ever miss
been made fazia superhero there was just
a hero point he's a rich hero well this
is the thing he's the exception that
completely ruins the rule when it comes
to what superhero yeah I think the thing
with Batman is and even don't get me
wrong i really enjoy a lot of batman
stuff but that man is that euphemism
when the bedroom yeah in the week or the
Batcave em but the thing about Batman is
that like he is benefited from loads of
really really talented incredible people
on TV and in film sort of taking up his
I ideas ok so like loads of the Batman
stuff is amazing way better than the
spider-man movies so I'm not debating
that I'm just saying that on if you
bullet pointed everything about
spider-man everything about Batman
spider-man is half spider and you can
shoot Webster his hands and also like
that man's just like a bat which is a
bit on the nose spider-man's not dressed
like a spider please dress it's got like
a pipe cleaner legs enemy guy the guy
with the arms
yeah he's looks like more of a spider
because he's got this several arms yeah
also gonna have to say the obvious here
but the other day I had a shower and I
saw a big spider on my bathroom floor
and it could barely walk because of the
steam on the floor spiders are terrible
I read that that's a that's strongly the
film's must suck lots of spiders can do
all sorts so that answers that yeah and
we'll do what the readers and listeners
think about this particular piece of
spider news are they agree with me um
very broadly one commenter here says
Luke's right um Batman it couldn't joke
on isn't there is blue cancer said
another one says quite another one says
Batman needs to get over it my parents
died years ago yep doing a support group
no I feel me I know that's what I said
earlier all the podcast but I feel mean
about it now I think not yeah that is me
in the comments Crytek says oh great
time for another reboot which is the
second comment this week that I can't
tell if it sarcastic Mike underscore
failing meanwhile says that is a pretty
wise business decision a straight
business decision I wonder will Fox also
follow suit with the x-men franchise
when they're ready to reboot well that's
it i mean the x-men franchise is kind of
chugging along nicely there they're
making loads of money out that they've
got a bunch of other films plan so yeah
I think they're gonna be training too
it's interesting though because the
thing about the spider-man deal is is it
I didn't think it would ever happen
because I don't think so need not making
money with this spider-man those movies
must have made I think yeah but only if
they tell the story of his origin
apparently that's what songs only knows
attitude but what's what's kind of
interesting about i think is that
obviously marvel world disney and and
sony you've come to an agreement which
is basically everyone benefits when we
all use spider-man yeah so i think i
don't see why they couldn't do the same
thing works by the man's all around it's
fun yeah but spider-man in everything
but spider-man in temecula next James
Bond spider yep it's time and I today I
could have got like who's there yeah
nope jurassic world isn't out yet
there's still time to add spider-man
today is that's a good idea if it turns
out that the dinosaur that they created
I was kind of prac me like is it
technically a dinosaur and then
spider-man will eat him well you know
where else spider-man could pop up he
could pop up in Westeros I'll be good
runner game spiderman and gave me my
drones yeah incredible yeah segue into
I'll tell you what you get up the wall
quickly sorry well anyway but with with
that nice segue into Game of Thrones
luke and I went to visit the game of
thrones exhibition this week which is
happening where we saw up close all of
the the props and weapons and the
clothing and some of the jewelry and
whatnot actually used in the filming of
Game of Thrones so realistic in fact
they actually do some of them still have
the merge and things on from the films
I've work from when they are actually on
locate some of them still have like the
severed heads and arms deal yeah yeah
yeah so this is on where is this on this
is at Theotis and it's yeah it's on the
sky atlantic studios it's guy backstage
there it's skies event space in the o2
for venting o2 arena when you walk in as
a big bit on the left that sort of sky
is planted it's a culture we have loads
a picture this as well that we on the on
the site so good yeah as well taken by
someone great was Andy well there are
okay and there is a bitten by me who
knows a lot about Game of Thrones and
had to google surprisingly little of the
Spelling's nicely done there there is a
bit of a catch to this though isn't it
you do have to be there Luke in action
there you go if you're watching the
video version I'm not going to describe
it so if you listen to audio version
you're compelled to see what Luke in
action me mr. Luke doing some Batman
stuff yeah so there's a bit of catch to
this there is in the small caps you do
have to be a sky customer yes right wow
you can apply for tickets for free yeah
when you're asked our customer don't
temporarily as well so it's only it's on
from the 15 to over 17th and it's in
London so you know it is pretty specific
but the great thing is as a weave bean I
have taken all these eggs to show you
don't even need to get down
we get out of your house we've got many
many photos it's very comprehensive and
and yeah it's just really really cool
there's loads of little details on on
the props that that are about a pixel
big on the TV show when you watch it I
imagine but and you would never notice
them but they're really cool like a for
example Stannis's scabbard where a keeps
his sword it's a it's covered in little
golden stags and burning hearts which is
anyone who's familiar with the show will
know is a remix of his familial heritage
and adopted religion those electr sounds
a bit emo frankly he's drawing burning
hearts on his clothes yeah but you know
he's he's basically started hanging out
with like an emo a burning car crowd
okay and Dave persuaded him we're
getting a little bit worried about him
but it's perfectly harmless it is a face
ok Toph well there you go so yeah we're
going things so you don't have to anyway
why don't we move on to the big picture
we love iOS and Android but they have
been around a while and you can't blame
us if our eyes start to wonder every now
and again so what are the alternatives a
couple of years ago a few new contenders
through their hats in the mobile OS ring
and these upstart OSS are finally
available this week I got my hands on
the first phone to run on a bun to the
BQ aquaris a 4.5 Ubuntu edition which
swaps apps for scopes and does things a
little differently Mozilla's Firefox has
had a good year while Tizen has
Samsung's considerable resources behind
it but why would anyone want an
alternative when Android has been good
for everyone upstart OSS are a good deal
for phone manufacturers and networks
because they wrest control and money
back from google and give you a better
chance differentiating their kit from
all the other Android devices out there
so where are they all up to Luke why
don't you tell us about Firefox well
Firefox is an order one Firefox OS
because I I would say this is the
operating system of all of the those
alternatives that isn't really grabbing
the headlines sure but arguably has
actually made some real progress so it's
running on I think 15 low-end phone
that's our phones yeah and these are
things that are actually on sale um you
know in parts of the world yeah that's
deal of thing though isn't it they're
not quite then exactly in shocked or
anything on him no and also that tend to
be aimed at developing markets so you
know not the kind of thing that will
probably see in the UK or the US or
anything con in a really big way but
like 15 phones us a lot of phones and
we're talking about manufacturers like
alcatel Zed t yes I think alcatel is
probably the biggest name name one um
but yeah there were different
manufacturers on LG as well that's just
where the biggest one thing really well
gee algae I think they do one yeah
that's cool but yeah i mean i've used
firefox OS and i think it's i think it's
fine um yeah the big question with all
of these things really is is it better
than android which is extremely cheap
also i mean i can see why it's better
for manufacturers but sort of for
customers either head off with
android fine roads in those of apps but
firefox OS doing well yeah that's in
here endeth my report that's the
takeaway the bottom line yeah okay and
Andy what about Tizen well tysons
actually quite an interesting one
because it's it was originally sort of
started up by various companies also
working together on to this one platform
but we have in the past year or so seen
like Samsung his heavily got involved in
in Tizen where she saw Tizen on on a
galaxy s4 last year at MWC and it was
showing us or how far it's got with
Tizen on this and and there was a lot of
discussion at the time about whether
Samsung itself would want to move away
from Google's Android and have and be
able to have an operating system it's a
bit more but it can keep a bit closer to
control over sure but more excitingly is
it ties in is actually we've seen it on
on a far greater number of devices
including sit in watches in cameras
there's been taught about going into
cars and fridges and things which is
more difficult to do with Android
certainly in its in as Android as you
see it on the phone mean Google itself
we've had is how to develop its own
Android wear for watches and chromecast
for TVs so I very different versions of
the software but ties them could be a
bit easier to put onto everything to
maybe have everything communicate
together so look at sort of you know it
is an Internet of Things they're smart
home Tizen may well have quite a big
place in that ties in nicely to the
smart home ah this guy I think that's
why they pay you the big bucks what okay
you guys get paid by him who knocks and
then ascending I mean yeah I think
that's actually really good point
because the i think the gut reaction
with lots of these are praising system
is why they even trying the race is run
landing on what Android one but yeah
when we think about the next step which
is things like smart home and things
like that that's basically a whole new
battlefield let's train so yeah and a
bun to as well they mean they finally
got their first phone they would look
kind of a couple years ago when first
like seeing these upstart OS is when we
saw the mobile world congress in 2013 on
the one place Tizen was unusable it was
just an absolute mess oh it was absolute
terrible it wasn't just ready wasn't
ready basically Firefox was kind of
there but but was you know wasn't most
Henry hadn't read a very much and I
bunty really seemed to work it was the
most developed than the most the most
elegant and it kind of worked really
well and in terms of the software not
much has changed they kind of they
haven't really evolved much because it
was already up that finished product
what they've all taken them a long time
is obviously building a relationship
with manufacturers and networks and that
kind of thing and they're still only
selling in a flash sale in European
limited limited numbers but um yeah but
but they but you know like you say that
so bun to is much more open to other
devices so it's already well known for
being on PCs and it could potentially
run on other devices well they've just
announced something called a bun to core
which is all about smart devices and
even drones so you can use a bun to to
power your drone and have an app store
for your drone I guess yeah yeah which
is pretty cool so yeah it's all still
wide open which is good it's good that
we're actually finally see some devices
we can buy Selia I was quite excited
about it Bunty when I first saw it and
it was yeah we have been about two years
ago I think when they first showed off
his device because that was one of the
first times where they'd really talked
about instead of having I'll gay should
you'll buy your phone you buy a tablet
and you buy this it was really about the
phone is is the core for everything and
yes i'll plug it into a monitor it'll
act as your desktop and i thought i was
really exciting and that's really what
you what you want i've talked about that
so many times at well why are we still
pushing towards multiple devices we need
to be pushing towards a brain and yeah
and now on convergence yeah and that was
that was great and it's a shame that it
kind of we haven't had a big update on
that and had a bit more of an excitement
stool right there with lock we're there
with this particular one to phone the
the BQ aquaris which we have got a
hands-on video and photos and first look
review kind of preview on the site so
have a look for that if you're
interested it's on sale in various
different flash sales over the next few
weeks there you go so one of our readers
been saying what are those guys well
your ipod boy says excellent an
alternative to android is a comments on
the bun to the history yeah and if you
want to true open OS this is the way to
go at least this open source OS won't
spy on you like android does it yeah
it definitely well exactly in the same
way all the other ones do as soon as you
start using any app services or anything
else of course it will so don't know
well yeah that's so just get used to it
you've been told Rosco tsc says if you
want a truly customizable phone I think
you just found it this should be very
interesting i hope they make and sell
tons of them sitive while osman
underscore shez says pretty novel i love
all this competition in phones i can't
wait till most phones cost as much as
the ones on contract and then everyone
will start going off contract whoo take
that cell phone company take that yeah
it's like while evil pink lolita says
that's too bad the phone won't be
released in the US I'd love to get to my
hands on one well there you go maybe if
they do actually have plans for the US
and they're going to be announcing
something very soon so will that will
keep you posted when that actually
happens we can also give a little
honorable mention to sail fish no I just
remembered that yeah well yeah well get
was with giallo rajala phone still is
selling is selling quite well apparently
oh well in but it's in in finland in
china but they have because they they
did their kickstarter campaign not she
was IndieGoGo campaign for the jolla
tablet and that did phenomenally well
and within a few hours at his target and
it massively exceeded it over the week
it was actually online and they're
actually showing that physical unit of
that at mwc so really looking forward to
actually going getting hands-on with
that and seeing what sailfish is like
I'm an OS cuz on a phone it was it
looked really neat and it was fancy
Hughes actually it really was quite
quite exciting so I didn't have dive the
app support but it did use like html5
app so a lot of web-based stuff will
work quite well so you know we'll
definitely on them go stuff right and
their bare mind all this stuff we're
talking about we're going to be coming
from mobile world congress will be
seeing all these things there'll be
loads and ideas and videos and new
phones when is Mobile World Congress it
soon it's very soon it's not anything
sooner than you want yeah yeah well
we're going over there in for so we'll
bring you all the cool stuff from there
all right then let's finally as we want
to think back
Gary McAnally says why is the sky blue
but because it reflects the sea
obviously I don't think that's true
ladies term in fact if I google it I
don't those days of sick joke you
reflect to see what else is happy Gary
that's a question I'm true it's
something to do with particles we're
going to do with molecules in the air
there's got a blue light from the Sun
more than they scatter red light yeah
that doesn't sound right i think it's 30
i'm collecting the sea thing yes the sea
Whitaker says when is the new google era
coming out as it obviously isn't January
2015 anymore um good point yeah no
probably not January after a 10-15 now a
project ara for those who may have
forgotten is Google's concept slopped
together modular phones anything looks
really cool doesn't it does look cool
you can just swap out the screen when it
gets cracked it looks really cool but
I'm refusing to get excited about it
because Saudi google glass and all the
other Google's don't they do aggressor
ever looked cool but I all right I
didn't look cool but it was like wow um
so yeah but you eat the idea is that
you've got like a phone you can slot
different cameras and different screens
under the screen smashes you can just
pull the screen but out and slotting a
new one and stuff it is really cool but
where is it is it ever going to be real
and Google's actually said that it is
going on sale with Puerto Rico one of
the first places it goes on way also
Puerto Rico well good well so keep were
tariq ins yeah definitely um that's a
bit random I've never heard if someone
is saying like someone launching a
product in in Puerto Rico and I'm not
sure about this by I definitely read
something about like they're gonna be
selling it out to sort of food fan style
that's such a google thing to do isn't
it that's so Google as Google right
there well we've got this amazing new
thing which might transform technology
in the industry and that kind of thing
what should we do with it let's a little
food vans Irial in Latin America um
which you know we'd love to get hands on
one and yeah good for them when start
happening sometime this year yeah like
in 2015 is although that is indeed is it
so I mean fingers crossed yeah it looks
like it's sort of still happening slowly
but surely yeah meanwhile I know I Rin
wave I pronounce
right and you're in pile says I got
older all the marin poem cool how's it
going I'm sitting for ages well let's
find a still owes me a tenor I have a
question for your amazing podcast oh
alright you can give it 10 if you had to
choose one household item to become
smart in 2015 what would it be and the
ad nan and I the end we're not rigid of
what that means but we love the fit can
I just say that after last week we're
due to some quirk of like the planets
aligning not in our favor we had
absolutely no feedback well we did get
three likes so we've been doing likes on
the facebook status but like going to
say that loads of people have written in
this week would look with feedback thank
you it's really nice that it's very
heartening I don't know how much we
appreciate that outpouring of support it
does Khloe's we just feel like we
shouting into the void and then I know
it can seem like we are big stars in up
on So You Know unattainable yes I'm a
pile of money yeah honoring on a
pedestal like they're probably get loads
of feedback they're never going to read
out mine but in fact no we really
appreciate we do we do appreciate its
most here for me a lot of see how does
giving some and feedback well you didn't
come easy go don't yeah and you lost a
question that it was what do you want if
you one household item to become smart
in 2015 Andy what do you think Oh for me
it's a better system for remotely
shutting off your household plugs
because yeah every single day without
fail I will get to my friend or my house
and I think have I left my hair
straighteners on and even though I
always like how there it is always have
to get back and check and often i will
walk halfway to the tube station and
then double back and go home just
because as soon as you start thinking
how i left it on that thought is not
going to leave i'll drive you mad so and
go back and check and I've never left
them on but let me go or smart chairs
really comforting you know those
American lounge chairs lazy lazy boys
yeah fridges and phones and whatnot put
into the arm rests why none of those
cool over here I want those
think it's because our living rooms
aren't big enough Oh bigger than those
chairs that's Jennifer also the good
thing about that is that when you spend
too much of your time sitting and slowly
contracting diabetes and having a hot
yeah your check every light every
half-hour your tie you in like the
ceiling bit you hell yeah yeah bang yeah
just like fire you out and send you
jogging absolutely yeah um I would like
a smart floor and I would like the floor
to be connected up with like millions of
little stickers bear with me yeah and
those little stickers you can put on all
of the things that you own and that way
whenever something's lost you can be
like where did it go and you look on
your phone and your floor has been like
ooh searching for that sticker be like
oh here are the key they could light up
the floor might look good like yeah do
you that with RFID tags and NFC tags
prada group of players also missing
probably everything an RFID texture if
you have any part for you when you
definitely want to lie to dance for yeah
definitely ideally many more questions
when that smart house goes mad that's
what that's what they do um yes lots
more questions David B says hey guys two
questions no questions isn't one here I
know you guys don't watch the Premier
League much her you were forced by
gunpoint to choose a team which would it
be and then David puts arsenal brackets
which presumably hinnies a correct
answer and is right with our thoughts on
this thing well yeah I mean I I
manchester city would be my physically
closest team when I was growing up so I
supported them also cities home kit was
a delightful baby blue which I always
really liked I don't if they refer to it
is baby blue well it wasn't a my baby
blue whatever it was the others are like
their baby poo actually call it duck egg
and I definitely the city not United
because it annoys me that their team is
called Manchester United yet clearly
they're not United when there's a
Manchester City there's two teams in
there you can be called Majesty United
when there's only one Manchester team
they are united okay well i can't swear
any allegiance to anyone other than the
mighty tranmere rovers so pride of
Merseyside so right there amelie any
more questions
oh yes David also says coming to London
from the USA is there a must go to pub
in central London Oh many many yeah now
that is an excellent question there are
low actually like in really really
central London there is a bright there
are lots and lots of good pups they tend
to get busy yeah but check out the
Admiralty on Trafalgar Square which
despite being on Trafalgar Square is
actually quite a nice problem there are
no debris no verte themes and it's kind
of yes got it seemed like I think it
seemed like the HMS Victory in being on
by Nelson's column in Trafalgar Square
and Nelson's ship and the boats they did
there are some really really good
historic pubs like the black friar in
plat friars right um and ye oldie
cheshire cheese which was rebuilt after
the great fire in 1666 that's great
really hard got the toilet in there
though because got very low ceilings on
the generally but also in the in the
stairs down to the toilet certainly
we're giving proper consumer has never
happened before so I suggest buy a
bottle of cider and sit in Hyde Park but
there's also the viaduct tavern is worth
checking out that's a Victorian gin
Palace yes all the lovely reason windows
system that's where I hired for a 30th
birthday which went down very well hmm
and also our local is the Lord Nelson
which is fantastic pub and does great
burgers but you do have to go to
Southwark though which is yes I century
it's by water though I would know that
was your excuse for not coming to my
birth I wouldn't go out of your way
David um producer Mark oboe and David
also says keep up the hilarity so ah
thanks right producer mark you'll never
see for some reason thinks that it's
appropriate for him to leave feedback
and said why go out for burger when you
have steak at home my god that's that's
a good point make of that is you it's
part of a breakdown long extended break
down here playing out in the pages of
our feedback section mm-hmm
you'll do that great and one more
question and Joe has been in touch to
say hi guys not many questions recently
so i'll throw you a bone why would i
want pity questions we do we do want
bitty questions we my ideal what above
this bone he speaks up there was Joe
question one of the main reasons google
glass failed yes because it was
considerably to imposing right so don't
AR devices like microsoft hololens which
is arguably even more noticeable so from
the same shortcomings or do you think
because hollow lens is so much cooler
people won't mind being seemed dead
wearing one well people even wear a our
headsets out and about great podcast
also says keep up the good thank you
thank you thank you so much appreciate
that yeah I think that's trad I thing
anyone's gonna wear them outside are
they no I think that you definitely they
need to become a lot smaller all the
ones that their proper headsets like
Samsung's VR an oculus rift Nova stuff
they're not they're designed for home
use at the moment there needs to be a
lot of change before that becomes even
remotely user bowing out and about yeah
basically want them implanted into your
eyes thing that's ideally yeah or just
replace your eyes yeah yeah yeah I'd be
fine sorry let any of those great all
great ideas keep up the good work cheers
thanks a good kisser all right cool um
all right yes thank you and keep the
