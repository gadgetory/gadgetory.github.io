newest wearable from Samsung the gear
fit this little device can track your
steps display notifications from your
smartphone and even measure your heart
rate it's one of the most interesting
wearable devices available today but
there's one big problem it only works
with a select number of Samsung devices
meaning people like me and my Nexus 5
are left out of the fun luckily there's
an easy workaround that enables some of
the gear fits features for non Samsung
users for this to work you will still
need to sync the gear fit with a
supported Samsung device so it can be
updated you must then download the gear
fit manager app to your Android device
the easiest and safest way to do this is
to copy the app from existing samsung
device this can be done by downloading a
file manager from the Google Play Store
such as the free ES File Explorer app
open the app on your Samsung device
click on the app manager option under
the Tools menu long press on the gear
manager app and hit backup I usually
then save the backup to my Google Drive
or Dropbox accounts for easy access the
app can also be found on the web
however download it from a third-party
marketplace or an online form can open
your device to malware before you can
actually install the gear fit manager
you must first enable the unknown
sources option on your device to do this
venture over to your phone settings menu
and click on the security option then
just simply click on the file and wait
for it to install once that's done open
the gear fit manager app and sync your
device with the gear fit it's as easy as
that obviously since this is a basic
workaround some of the features aren't
available for example you'll be unable
to create or sign in to your Samsung
Account you also won't be able to do
anything with weather or location
however you can still do all the basics
like receive notifications track your
steps measure your heart rate and even
use the device's nifty find your phone
feature for more information about
pairing the gear fit with other Android
devices check out my article on how to
dot-com
