Conte and it's time to get loaded iPhone
owners can enter into a class-action
lawsuit that calls into question the
legality of their contract with AT&amp;amp;T
this lawsuit was just awarded
class-action status so if you bought an
iPhone between june of 2007 and now you
can join in the lawsuit challenges apple
and AT&amp;amp;T on whether it was backing
customers into a five-year contract
rather than a two-year contract because
of their exclusivity deal and youtube
now supports 4k video that standard
resolution for film that measures 4096 x
3000 72 pixels that's nearly four times
the size of hi-def video at 1080p now
why would you tube do this my guess is
that it's part of their push to get on
your home TV set but you will of course
need high end gear to enjoy this video
which could include a large display or
4k projector Doc's calm is now supported
in facebook fan pages this means that
administrators of fan pages can post
documents if they choose to and another
facebook news the site is going to
launch a panic button in the UK if
clicked the button will notify the UK
child exploitation and Online Protection
centre of inappropriate behavior this is
of course mostly for teenagers to report
sex offenders the problem with this as I
see it is that it requires the young
person to self-report most research
shows that teenagers are slowly coaxed
into engaging in behavior that they're
not sure about right away by the time
they realize the behavior is
inappropriate they feel like they may
have been too involved and possibly at
fault the fenders don't just suddenly
attack teens online they were my way in
so in my opinion a button like this will
not really be all that effective what do
you think right in it loaded at cnet com
m sony is giving you a lot more options
to express yourself with your laptop the
new line of bio machines can be
customized by changing the color of the
machine itself or even the keyboard and
the mouse you can do this at the vaio e
color combo site there are over 25 color
combinations to choose from and finally
a new bicycle lock notifies you if
someone
is messing with your wheels the halo by
clock uses an i phi SD card when it
notices someone tampering with your bike
it then shoots a notification to your
mobile device of course I five needs a
Wi-Fi network in order to communicate
but if your school or job has public
Wi-Fi then you're golden then again you
would also have to get to your bike rack
in time to stop the theft that's your
news for now thank you for watching I'm
Natali del Conte for cnet.com and you've
just been loaded</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
