the launch of the Samsung Galaxy Tab s
this is Samsung's new premium tablet
comes in a couple of different sizes I'm
holding the 8.4 inch model there's also
a 10.5 inch model and Samsung is touting
its AMOLED display is a 2560 by 1600
pixel display that equates to two times
HD or about 2k that's not 4k that's 2k
resolution and Samsung is touting this
as the best display out there on a
tablet the price for these tablets is
very similar to what you see with the
iPads this 8.4 inch model is 399 comes
with 16 gigabytes of memory along with
three bytes of RAM that memory is
expandable however there's only one
configuration at this time 16 megabytes
but you can add cards up to 128
gigabytes the step-up model the 10.5
inch model is $4.99 with that same 16
gigabytes of memory and three advise of
RAM some other features worth mentioning
there is an 8 megapixel camera on the
back of the tablet and there's a 2.1
megapixel camera on the front there's
also a built-in flash Wi-Fi is AC and
ends a little bit higher grade Wi-Fi
there's also a built-in fingerprint
scanner that's the first Samsung tablet
with a fingerprint scanner so you can
make PayPal payments with your
fingerprint the device does share a lot
in common with the galaxy s5 samsung has
a unified design theme you'll see those
dimples on the back this does come in
two colors a titanium and a white color
and that's available in both the larger
and smaller models as far as the
processor goes this is an octa-core
processor but it is split in two there
are four processors running at 1.9
gigahertz and four running at one point
three gigahertz for sort of a power
saving mode finally if you're wondering
how the battery life is with this new
display Samsung is saying it's right
around 11 hours with video that goes for
both the larger and small
our tablets as you can see this is
obviously a slim tablet if you're
wondering how much it weighs
the smaller a point four inch version
comes in at ten ounces and the larger
10.5 ounce version comes in at just
around one pound I'll end by talking
about some of the accessories that can
be available for this tablet Samsung is
talking about a few different colors
there's the book cover that wraps around
the tablet has a couple of different
viewing angles and then there's the
simple cover which is a very thin cover
and really provides slim protection for
the device and finally there is also a
Bluetooth keyboard cover it is
customized for the Tab s so it has the
same color and also some of the same
design elements so there you have it
samsung's new Galaxy Tab s tablets this
is the company's premium tablet and yes
it is designed to compete directly with
Apple's iPad I'm David carnal thanks for
