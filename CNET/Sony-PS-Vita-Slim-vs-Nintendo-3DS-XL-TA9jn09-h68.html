I'm Brian Kong and welcome to the all
new look and feel for Tech's biggest
Throwdown showdown
sonia nintendo won't be playing nice at
any time soon so we're throwing them
into the Octagon it's a battle of ground
and pound between the sony PS Vita slim
and the Nintendo 3ds XL our judges for
this fight are senior editor Scott the
bottom line Stein editor Jeff don't back
down Bakalar and yours truly can't go
wrong tom now we'll take all three
judges blind stores and average them out
to the nearest tenth each round the
final prize by score will be an average
of all rounds using the same decimal
system it's six rounds to the finish
round one the PS Vita slim gets even
slimmer and 20% lighter than its
predecessor with curved edges that make
it the sexiest gaming handheld the
biggest change is that it loses its 5
inch LED goodness and replaces it with
an LCD screen that's capable but not as
vibrant as the original fits nicely in
your hands but I found the first Vita to
feel more comfortable size-wise
now the Nintendo 3ds XL keeps a similar
form factor from its BS lineage with its
clamshell design that protects its to
screen it's thicker than the Vita and it
might feel a little dated but there's
still a retro charm to it it's four
point eight eight inch glass with 3 HP
might have the same resolution as
yes but the bigger screen makes a big
big difference and it's 4.18 inch
pressure-sensitive screen on the bottom
gives you 90 percent more screen from
the 3d s total now sleek and sexy does
it for us and the Vita slim gets a four
and the 3ds XL depth of three next round
of controls in using the Vita slim
brings dual analog sticks PlayStation
like buttons a capacitive touchscreen
and a rear touch panel now some games
use these features nicely and some of
them are really forced the rear touch
was a cool idea at first but it's more
of a gimmick and no game has made me say
I'm glad they did this
now the analog sticks just aren't nearly
as accurate for shooters and I don't
expect them to be perfect but it's still
hard to get that tight aiming you need
this gyroscope can be used with some
games and the front side touch screen
complements the Vita's icon based UI
that's easy to navigate and really made
for touch now the 3ds XL brings an
analog pad and a directional pad the
lack of two analog sticks limits it from
certain types of games but that has
never dictated the quality of a game the
bottom touch screen is a second screen
for more interactive experiences and
it's the key for navigating the 3dsxl
the user interface is clean but it
really feels extremely dated it doesn't
come close to anything we've seen on a
phone or tablet in it can hang at times
the PS Vita takes another round with the
four and the 3ds gets another three
after two rounds
the Vita leads by a full point round
three is
nintendo's flagship feature is it's
flashes free 3d as long as you're
looking at the perfect sweet spot it has
moments that while you but that only
lasts until you start getting dizzy or
uncomfortable after playing fifteen or
twenty minutes
most people just end up turning it off
now it takes some fun low res 3d
pictures and videos but it's really more
of a novelty there's a standard sized SD
card slot in this is really important
there's Wi-Fi Netflix and Hulu Plus but
probably aren't going to watch too much
video on a screen like this the PS Vita
brings a feature packed handheld
especially if you're a ps4 owner that
allows you to play games on your console
on your Vita when you're on the same
Wi-Fi network game saves transfer over
console versions on some games like
Borderlands it's touch screen is great
and it brings not only Netflix and Hulu
but YouTube Twitter Facebook and more
that really make this a versatile media
consumption gadget now changing over to
a micro USB cable is a huge plus
but the biggest drawback is its
proprietary SD cards that are so
overpriced is laughable if you like 3d
and Nintendo Go 3ds and if you're in the
PlayStation ecosystem you got to go Vita
we're calling this a tie at four points
apiece next round is game library
both of these handhelds have had enough
time to really develop their game
library the PS Vita brings amazing
looking games like Uncharted golden
Abyss platformers like gravity rush and
unique experiences like tearaway and
also some indie standouts like
guacamelee now the 3ds has a staple of
Nintendo classics from Super Mario 3d
Zelda a link between worlds and Luigi's
Mansion dark moon and really almost
every one of their top tier franchises
are represented on the 3ds this really
isn't an exact science but our sister
site GameSpot has handed out a review
score of 8 or higher 228 3ds games
compared to 24 the PS vita so far and we
know exclusives ultimately dictate which
way you go but in our eyes Nintendo's
overall breath of triple-a titles indie
and retro titles best what the Vita
brings and I'm not forgetting you Animal
Crossing fans the 3ds gets a perfect 5
and the Vita gets a 3.7 so after
averaging four rounds Sony leaves by
just one tenth of a point round 5 in
performance
there's no dispute that the Vita brings
the best-looking graphics on any
handheld including smartphones and
tablets and it's lived up to its promise
of ps3 level visuals now going to an LCD
screen took away just a bit of its
visual vibrancy but in return an
improved battery life of roughly 4 to 6
hours depending on how you use it
now the 3ds XL won't blow your way with
this graphics but it makes up for a with
charm it also boasts an improved
three and a half hour to six and a half
hour lifespan with its dual screen that
edges the Vita we still can't ignore the
Vita's graphical prowess and the Vita
gets a 4.3 and the 3ds XL gets a for the
final round that besides it all it's
about both of these systems retail from
$1.99 the PS Vita slim comes in a
Borderlands 2 package at the moment that
includes an 8 gig SD card as well the
Nintendo 3ds XL comes with a 4 gig SD
card but gets a seasonal game bundled in
as well now it's a great value on both
sides but what kills us
is the price of Sony's proprietary SD
cards now we know eight gigs fills up
fast when games are around one to three
gigs so consider this a 32 gig PS Vita
SD card cost around 89 bucks where any
standard 32 gig SD card costs around 18
bucks and as an owner even 16 gigs
wasn't enough for me and it's a cost you
won't think about until it hits you now
expanding memory is just cheaper on the
3ds over the life of the systems so
we're giving the 3ds XL of 5 and the PS
Vita slim of 4 alright let's average out
all six rounds and enterprise by that
state incredibly close throughout
Nintendo had to make a late charge and
it was just enough to push us to a tie
that's right we're tied even at four
points apiece now it's the first time
ever for a true tie here and really what
makes this price buy unique is that
design and features can't really decide
this for you it always comes down to the
games and the ecosystem that you want
but guys and gals you know what I just
want to flip a coin to see who wins this
so we're going to call this heads for
3dsxl and Tails for the PSVs line i'm
going to leave it a chance alright here
we go
and the winner tails the PS Vita slim
alright guys I'm Brian Tom thanks for
watching and we'll catch you guys next
time for another prizefight</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
