Megan Willerton forseen and appliances
here with the complete 478 dollar myfox
smart home security system so right off
the bat you do have the option of buying
the camera and these other accessories
separately so the camera cost 199 bucks
alone and the rest of the kit costs 279
bucks alone but the complete kit that's
the whole package really encompasses all
of these devices and that comes up to a
whopping 478 bucks and I really am
struggling to find a reason why anyone
should pay that much for a DIY home
security kit when there are so many
other options out there that cost so
much less and if the cost wasn't already
enough of a negative the accessories
themselves are really confusing this is
giant thing here that actually looks
like a hub is a siren just a siren
that's all it does this small thing here
is the plug in hub why wouldn't they
just combine the siren with the hub to
make a more streamlined experience
instead you have all of these different
devices and you have to set them all up
individually as well making it way way
way more complex and time-consuming than
it needs to be the one device here that
actually does make sense as a standalone
product is this little sensor right here
it actually senses vibration so you
stick it on a door or a window or any
other spot you think could be vulnerable
and it can actually tell the difference
between someone knocking on the door or
someone using a crowbar to try to break
in so forced entry or any other concerns
like that can be stopped right in their
tracks because the sensor will
communicate with the siren and scare
away anyone that's trying to break it
overall while performance was generally
alright it just doesn't offer enough
features or functionality for the price
especially when they're stuffed like the
$279 Piper NV that's Piper's newest
camera it's their night vision version
which comes with a built-in siren a ton
of different motions
and environmental sensors all-in-one
simple to set up Wi-Fi enabled package
basically even though my Fox looks nice
at a glance it is really really really
hard to recommend given its inflated
price that is just too cost-prohibitive
for too many people and it does too
little for more on my Fox check out my
