I have some bad news for you I'm Bridget
Carey and this is your CNET update
lenovo has been caught pre-installing
adware on its computers and that
activates when an owner turns on their
computer right out of the box this ad
where leaves Lenovo computers
susceptible to being hacked Lenovo
poisoned its own computers just to make
some more money by forcing you to see
extra pop-up ads on websites it's so bad
it borders on the hard to believe
screenshots shared online show that the
ads pop up when you hover over certain
images on a website people report this
happening when using Internet Explorer
and Google Chrome
although Lenovo has said in statements
that it's safe other security experts
say otherwise
the adware is called super fish and it's
programmed with a bad security
certificate that can break their
encryption hackers can use this weakness
as a backdoor to spying your browsing
and steal sensitive data with this on
your computer you wouldn't know if
you're visiting a fake banking website
superfish is reported to have been
shipped on Lenovo pcs since mid-2014
lenovo says it stopped putting super
fish in computers and January of this
year we didn't find it installed on some
lenovo laptops that we have in the CNET
lab but if you have a Lenovo computer
you need to do a quick check if you're
infected search for a program called
visual discovery and uninstall it you
also need to manually remove the bogus
superfish security certificate and then
follow that up with a virus scan because
antivirus programs have flagged this as
a bad thing you can find a detailed
explanation of how to remove it on
SEANET I don't know how anyone will
trust a Lenovo computer after a dirty
move like this well in other news
samsung has a new tool in the battle
against Apple pay the company just
purchased looppay
which is another mobile payments company
that works a little differently than
Apple pay or Google Wallet it doesn't
use NFC it actually works on old card
swiping machines looppay is integrated
into a smart phone case you press the
button on the back of the case when
you're next to a traditional credit card
magnetic strip Swiper and
wirelessly sends the payment data
through retailers don't need to buy
special machines or software to accept
this mobile payment now that Samsung
harnesses this technology the company
could combine that with NFC to create
some sort of mobile payment service that
works on all types of machines old and
new and instead of a bulky case maybe
it'll be built into the next Samsung
Galaxy phone the Galaxy s6 will be
unveiled at an event on March 1st and
samsung plans to show off new mobile
payment offerings
