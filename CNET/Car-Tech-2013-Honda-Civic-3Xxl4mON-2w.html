stern for the 2012 model year why are
they redoing it rather heavily for the
2013 couple of reasons the interior was
shall we say rather soviet-era and the
ride quality was to be generous somewhat
intrusive they say they've addressed
both of those counts to make this car
more competitive in a very competitive
field and they've got to get it right
this is their bread and butter let's get
inside all right now inside you
immediately see lots of materials that
are more or less soft hard plastic we
were greeted with before the little faux
molded stitching bezel surrounds these
knobs it's almost getting over the top
little faux aluminum things around the
vents overall they've brought up the
level of quality and quality appearance
so this car seems less of a utilitarian
transportation appliance over here a
button gives you another insight into
what's happening on these cars lane
departure warning they've got more
driver assistance technologies on civics
now no change for the power trains
though in the new Civic that means the
same 1.8 litre for you got the hybrid
motor the bigger 2.4 in the SI another
thing I'm going to wait to check when we
get one of these is how they've handled
the ride quality it was very utilitarian
before nowadays you've got to have a
certain level of compliance that's just
the price of admission now other
upgrades happening is you'll find when
you're driving one of these is a lot
more attack across a lot more trim
levels like rear view camera Bluetooth
hands-free hello it's the 21st century
Pandora support even SMS text support in
many if not all trim levels this car
will no longer be back of the pack for
the tech it's about time these are
already heading the dealers as we speak
so no way to go try one out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
