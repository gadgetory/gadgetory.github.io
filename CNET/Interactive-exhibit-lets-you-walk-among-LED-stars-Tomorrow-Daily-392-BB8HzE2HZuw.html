best gift talk show in the known
universe i am jeff kannada ashley a
skill that is out sick today but i've
still got your daily dose of science and
tech headlines last week we spent a lot
of time talking about the intersection
between technology and art well here is
another interesting art exhibition
happening in japan DM m dot planets is a
large-scale art exhibition featuring a
piece called wander through the crystal
universe a huge immersive maze of light
the walk through exhibit has light
points reflected off of mirrors that
create a look that's almost like a
sculpture of light visitors can walk
around inside the space and can also
pull up the exhibition smartphone app to
trigger interactive elements while
inside other installations include a
soft black hole and a real-time rendered
koi pond that changes based on visitor
movement the entire exhibition is on
display in Odaiba Tokyo from now until
August 31st so you have to hurry if you
want to catch the show I love it when
artists use technology to create these
interactive experiences especially this
cool use of actually me on my phone
being able to interact with the
environment very very cool stuff we also
talked last week about the advances in
cybernetic arm technology this might be
one of the coolest uses for that kind of
tech ob aims to improve the quality of
life for anyone afflicted with injuries
or conditions that impede their ability
to eat it's a simple two button system
one button chooses which bowl and the
other tells OB to get a spoonful of food
in that bowl and bring it to the users
mouth there are a variety of ways for a
user to activate the buttons ranging
from foot pedals to responsive pillows
to mouthpieces
so most people can use OB regardless of
their disability the bowls and spoons
are all dishwasher safe and OB provides
about three hours of eating time per
charge it's available to buy but it'll
set you back at least forty five hundred
dollars which is pretty pricey but in
the few
we hope products like OB will cost as
much as any other kitchen appliance this
tech will undoubtedly be life-changing
for the people who need it but we got to
get those costs down that's really the
next frontier to make this affordable
for all we'd love to hear your comments
about these stories I think we'll
probably be talking about that
interactive art exhibit on Thursday when
Ashley's back and we do the long-form
show but you can provide your input into
our conversation by using the hashtag
hey TD on Twitter that's how we know
you're talking to us we'd love to
incorporate your comments into our
discussion all right let's get to phon
tog referr of the day today's phone tog
refered of the day is Andrew who took
this on believe it or not a blackberry
Passport
Andrew writes hike tomorrow errs here's
my entry for phone tog refer of the day
I bet you don't get many pictures taken
using the blackberry Passport
he's right it's actually the perfect
Instagram photo
due to its one-to-one aspect ratio it's
a good tech fact here's my story this is
Jack yes Jack Nicholson an inquisitive
multi pug he and I have walked pretty
much everywhere while chasing Pokemon on
this particular day we walked to
Hillberry Island a Nature Reserve and
bird sanctuary
he loves the rock pools and enjoyed a
bark off with the seals this scent birds
flying and won us disapproving looks
from the bird watchers we've not been
back since of course you have my
permission he used this photograph on
the show keep up the great work thanks
Andrew oh what a cool photo he looks
like he thinks he's bigger than he is
barking off with those seals that's fun
