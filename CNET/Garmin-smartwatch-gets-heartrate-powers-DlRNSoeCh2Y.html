tracker to its SmartWatch this is the
vivoactive HR it's got some other new
features too let's take a look so if I
spin this around the first thing you can
see under these glowing green lights is
the optical heart rate sensor so that's
going to give you a better idea
hopefully of exactly how hard you're
working when you're exercising there are
some other new features as well so for
example this watch can now track how
many floors you've climbed and it'll
also keep track of intense periods of
activity other than that you get pretty
standard SmartWatch features so you get
things like notifications calls calendar
alerts coming in to the watch so you now
have to keep checking your phone now one
thing I want to point out is the screen
garmin uses quite an interesting screen
technology it's not quite as sort of
bright and vivid as things you get on
maybe for example a samsung Smart Watch
but Garmin reckons that this will be
easier to read in the daylight and
better for battery life specifically you
can expect around eight days of battery
life with the vivoactive HR or 13 hours
when it's got an active GPS signal going
it also works with iOS and Android via
an app it's going to be on sale in the
next few months and expect to pay about
250 dollars alright that's all for now
but be sure to check out cnet.com slash
