appliances and we're at the
international house where show 2015 in
chicago taking a look at the three
squares superb the lender and what makes
this thing different from other blenders
is that it is designed specifically to
be used with hot liquids so if you want
to blend soup or other types of hot
stuff that you take out of the stove or
even if you want to heat up the liquid
it has a built-in heater that you can
set to the temperature that you want as
well so it's a very interesting looking
product and we definitely like it so
another product that three squares is
launching at the show is the duet this
machine is a combination slow cooker and
suvi contraption essentially you can set
the temperature that you want and it
will heat everything inside of it to a
very exact temperature so you can say
slow cooked eggs or maybe even get these
very long cook times that will render
pork down really nicely or get a very
creamy soft boiled egg so it's very nice
product so there you have it folks we
just took a first look at the duet and
superb machines from three squares this
is bryan bennett for cnet appliances</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
