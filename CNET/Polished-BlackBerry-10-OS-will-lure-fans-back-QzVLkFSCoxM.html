BlackBerry OS has seen the light of day
but here it is blackberry 10 and it's
pretty good too I'm Jessica dual-core
with CNN and i'm going to show you
what's good what's bad and how to get
around the first thing to know is that
rims new operating system is completely
gesture-based you swipe left right up
and down to access most menus and
submenus to check your email and also to
close apps I'm not going to lie to you
finding your way around can take a
little bit of getting used to especially
the gesture to close an app which is
basically just pulling up from the
bottom of the screen to minimize it you
can store up to eight open apps this way
you'll also find that you're using a
gesture to wake the screen from its
slumber and that's just by dragging up
so let me take you through the screens
themselves rim winds up your essentials
in a row with your apps laid out in the
icons to the right but if you swipe over
toward the left you'll see your active
windows if you have any open and those
are the thumbnails of your running apps
if you keep swiping left again you'll
find blackberry hub which shows you your
email messages missed calls and social
networking notifications pretty much
everything you see is customizable you
can make folders and rearrange the app
order you can change what you see in hub
you can also peek at the hub from any
time from any screen pretty much with
just one little gesture it is possible
to get lost in all dis gesturing around
at first but like most mobile platforms
it doesn't take too long to figure out
the flow rim spent a lot of time on the
virtual keyboard and it shows blackberry
10 has some strong word prediction
that's built into most apps and you can
customize where you want those words to
appear either the top or scattered
throughout the keyboard you can also
select up to three languages for the
keyboard to remember at one time plus
rim put a lot of thought into how people
copy and paste text how they add extra
characters and how they delete a few
words at a time despite rims effort
certain things like highlighting a
paragraph for example are either
overcomplicated or not quite as
intuitive as I'd like now blackberry
messenger is another rim claim to fame
and in this update it's the best it's
ever been you can use NFC to get new
contacts in real
I'm like if they're standing right in
front of you and in addition to free
messaging one-on-one or with group you
can now do voice and video calls as well
only did one test call so far and it
worked great stop me if you've seen this
one before a digital voice assistant
that talks back to you yeah i think that
blackberry 10 siri-like voice control
app is basically rim getting back at
Apple for using blackberry messenger as
its I message inspiration the app does
helpfully give you a list of things that
you can do but it isn't as flexible
Syrian what you can say and it sounds a
lot more robotic searching the internet
for peanut butter brownie recipes
overall rim did a great job making
blackberry 10 look polished and
professional while still keeping the
look familiar for long time fans I like
that the gestures really support
one-handed operation though that really
depends on the size of the screen and
the shape of the phone as well I also
like the simplicity of some of the
corporate security apps as well as
bedtime mode which turns off every bit
of buzz except for your morning alarm
and i also just love Universal Search
which I've always loved and I like
BlackBerry's built-in photo editing tool
however a few things don't work as well
as i'd like the weaker maps app doesn't
use google maps and it doesn't have
walking or transit directions the
cameras time shift mode is really cool
but it's a bummer that it isn't built
into the main camera option i also feel
like rim could have added HDR and
panorama modes by now blackberry 10 OS
as the result of years spent overhauling
an outdated operating system and making
it new and modern again without losing
its former identity and that i think
room was completely successful i think
that blackberry fans are for the most
part really going to like what they see
however the OS does have a bit of a
learning curve and some of the weaker
apps like mapping are going to keep some
people on their current os's I'm Jessica
doll court and that's your overview of
blackberry 10 there's a lot more to
uncover so keep your eye out for more
