I'm Bridget Carey and this is your cnet
update in honor of data privacy day it's
good to reflect on all the data that's
collected about you on a daily basis
from apps and websites and connected
gadgets and how nothing these days is
truly safe from hackers I don't want to
sound so negative but it's hard not to
be when you hear this news black phone a
security focused smartphone with several
encryption features built-in was
discovered to have a major security flaw
that allowed hackers to access and
decrypt messages steal contacts and even
control the phone remotely the bug has
been patched but it was found in this
encrypted text messaging app called
silent text it's bundled in the black
foam and it's available for anyone to
download from the Google Play App Store
to pull off the hack you needed to know
the users ID or phone number it's a good
reminder that nothing is hack proof not
even a phone that markets itself as the
most secure smartphone now of course you
should still make an effort to protect
your privacy and use apps with
end-to-end encryption recent studies
reveal that people feel they've lost
control of what data is being collected
about them online there are some small
ways you can better protect your privacy
start by reviewing how much personal
info you share with social media
accounts and apps you don't need to give
an app your real birthday for example
and if you want to avoid your search
history being tracked use the search
engine DuckDuckGo instead of google or
bing it may not be practical to give up
cold turkey on using a service like
facebook or snapchat because all your
friends use it but if you want to send
something extra sensitive convince your
friends to message you with an app that
has end-to-end encryption like wicker or
telegram now let's switch gears and talk
about streaming music Spotify has teamed
up with Sony to launch PlayStation music
not only can you sign up for Spotify
with your existing playstation network
ID but also you can play music from
Spotify in the background as you play
games it launches sometime this spring
on the ps4 and ps3 as
well as on sony's xperia smartphones and
tablets this is replacing sony's music
unlimited service which will meet its
end in march and as dishes internet TV
streaming service sling TV launches this
week expect to see more streaming TV
option soon ATT maybe the next to offer
a way to subscribe to video online the
ATT CEO said that the company is
considering offering an alternative to
traditional cable so customers can get
video over an internet connection
verizon also said it wants to launch a
similar service later this year that's
your tech news update and there's always
more at cnet com and you can follow

York I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
