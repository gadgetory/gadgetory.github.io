a society have worked very hard so we
don't have to work very hard these are
the top 5 tech innovations fueled by
laziness by the way we all know the
wheel should be the true number one on
all lists but let's stick to recent tech
at number 5 QR codes let me get
something straight you want me to get my
camera app out or a QR app instead of
typing in something in an app store or a
browser that almost sounds like a
victory for laziness at number 4 smart
lightbulbs getting up to flick a manual
switch to turn on or turn off the light
bulb is practically living in the Stone
Age I'm either gonna grab my phone to
talk to a hub that controls my light
bulbs or I'm just going to yell to Alexa
to take care of all the lights at number
3 wireless charging pads because
connecting a cable to your device was
just too much work we've got these
things you buy a charging pad you plug
that into the wall then you place a
compatible device onto that charging pad
boom you're charging your gadget without
directly using a wire at number 2 Amazon
- buttons when these things were
announced I thought they were part of an
onion headline but Amazon made one-click
shopping happen in real life by offering
the Amazon - buttons if you're
unfamiliar you can get an Amazon -
button which is linked to a particular
product when you click that physical
button you're actually ordering more of
that product Amazon has buttons for lots
of things including dog food
toilet paper and of course Doritos at
number one remote control apps the mote
controls are amazing when I was a kid
our TV had all the buttons on the front
because it was a good chance it actually
uses them remote controls have gotten a
lot better since I was a kid but remote
control apps changed everything instead
of searching all over the house were a
lost remote I could just launch an app
to control my connected TV or receiver
or Roku box or Apple TV or whatever then
there's the amazingness that is the
Harmony line to ensure maximum loser
there you have it another top five that
will live forever a top five see Netcom
that's where we keep all our top fives
thanks for watching and we'll catch you
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
