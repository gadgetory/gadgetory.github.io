is becoming a reality
this summer I'm Bridget Carey and this
is your CNET update self-driving cars
will be on the roads this summer Tesla
Motors announced that it will add
self-driving software to current model
as sedans within the next three months
these are cars people can buy right now
with the software update drivers don't
need to put their hands on the wheel to
drive technically you don't even need to
be in the seat for it to work but this
is very questionable legal territory
we're getting into because the laws that
exist for driverless cars were written
for testing cars not for every Joe
consumer to try out the technology has
the capability to be able to go from one
destination to another on a road trip
without a human touching anything but
Tesla says it won't allow that much
autopilot freedom in this update also
Tesla's electric cars will be getting
another update to monitor the status of
charging stations so drivers won't have
to worry about running out of battery
power which is a scary feeling although
not as scary as driving next to cars
without people in the driver's seat
Amazon is also about to take off with a
different sort of autopilot delivery
drones have been given the green light
to take flight by the Federal Aviation
Administration Amazon has permission to
conduct research on its prime air
delivery drones as long as these are
remotely controlled by licensed pilots
in the daylight and the drones cannot
fly higher than 400 feet Amazon also has
to give the FAA monthly reports on all
the data from these tests Amazon is not
the only tech company working on drones
that can drop off packages Google's
working on a new project wing prototype
after the first single wing design
failed the head of the project said the
drones had trouble hovering in high
winds and cargo shifted too much and
since we're talking about futuristic
technology the company magic leap is
teasing the world with a video that
shows how it could bring 3d animated
images to the real world with special
goggles in the video we get examples of
how apps and email may be controlled an
augmented reality with menus floating
around our
field of vision and then we see the
wearer starts to play a video game
picking up virtual laser guns with his
hand to shoot robots that are appearing
in the office magic leap has yet to
reveal what its headset or goggles will
look like so this is all very mysterious
and this video is likely taking some
creative liberties and stretching the
truth in this portrayal of how in
advance the technology could be but
maybe someday it won't be so far-fetched
it's an area many are researching now
including Microsoft with its hololens
augmented reality headgear that's your
