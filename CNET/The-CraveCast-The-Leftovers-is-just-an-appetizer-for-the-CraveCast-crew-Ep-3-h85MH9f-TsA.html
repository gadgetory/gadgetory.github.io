us just slightly south in albuquerque
new mexico cuz we got to cover all bases
so calm down get home at the turn
prepared Oh click that we so Eric you're
going in and out it sounds like you're
either doing a dalek impression in honor
of us talking about Doctor Who or you
your Wi-Fi is um miss messing with you
internet scaling if you're kidnapped by
aliens during this thing that will be
pretty odd just do a Dalek impression
it'll work out let me have let me kill
some stuff here how am I not you guys
hear me now can you hear me now yeah
we're fine we're good you killed the
right thing for once just like a Dalek
oh he's totally friend now he's frozen
Oh see I thought Eric was just really um
I I never no one ever listens to me like
that anymore it was good I was like my
first boyfriend well sharing on creative
cast in my bag yeah you're back all
right skype we just thought you're a
really good listener we're very very shy
yeah well then I get to introduce
everybody do we get everyone's names and
at least not yet we can now if you want
alright well this is the clave cast and
we're back I am hopefully able to be
heard now I'm in taos i'm joined by
Kelsey Adams Bonnie Burton Jeff Sparkman
and Stephen Beecham at the scene at
studio there in San Francisco and Amanda
Kooser is joining us just slightly south
in Albuquerque how you guys doing can
you hear me yeah we can hear you but we
don't see you now your video disappears
your ominous ok this is we got lots of
technical diff that's ok this is nothing
compared to the most most like Google+
and YouTube shows I'm on it's like if
we're lucky if someone doesn't get
electric electric it by accident this is
good
that could be interesting I know yeah we
could we can reenact that new Doctor Who
trailer that's fine TARDIS blowing up
things electrocuting it'd be great huh
unfortunately I'm not gonna be sending
you the video so we can let's work
through our issues technical and
otherwise I'm sure we've all gathered
here today actually to discuss
television which used to be one of the
most boring things you could talk about
in the summer but not anymore and
actually just like last summer some of
the networks and cable channels
including HBO are testing out some new
sci-fi shows with short summer runs last
year I actually got into under the dome
and Siberia and I wound up disappointed
but mainly because under the dome was
terrible and Siberia was intriguing and
interesting but it didn't get a second
season now this summer there's a few
more new sci-fi series probably the most
high-profile being HBO's the leftovers
which I think we might have a trailer
for and it stars Justin through and some
other folks and the basic premise is
it's a couple a couple years after what
seems to have been some sort of a
rapture but nobody should basically but
one percent of the population just
disappeared in an instant and the show
takes takes place a couple years
afterwards and how people are dealing
with it and it's had some some mixed
reviews I've watched all three episodes
so far and I just have no idea where the
thing is going or if I'm going to stick
with it what do you guys think hi I've
been watching I actually kind of like it
I don't know I um I'm just glad because
it you know now we'd have to worry about
population control um in the rapture I
mean if you actually I was I was raised
Catholic so I remember you know you
hearing about the rapture and that sort
of thing and that's a Christian
definitely a Christian phenomenon to
think about and it's supposed to be a
lot more dramatic like angels coming
down raining fire all that stuff and and
this is just blink and it's gone like
people just disappeared um so it's
interesting and it's interesting how
people cope with it it's interesting how
quickly people go into denial like Oh
everything's fine let's not think about
it but when you think about this is
damon lindelof so there's going to be
something happening
towards the end that either all of us
are going to think is awesome or we're
all going to go to his house with
pitchforks because I I still I self lost
wounds so yeah I mean it lost wasn't
that long ago when we're all like hey
wait a minute that's anything we all
thought so I mean with this hopefully
there's still some surprises left in him
but it is compelling show I i I'm giving
it a chance but I I don't know about the
rest of you but I've become cynical and
bitter as a TV watcher because I'm like
this isn't gonna get renewed this isn't
going to get renewed I'm going to waste
all this time watching season one and
two of something and nothing's gonna get
solved and I'm just gonna wonder the
rest of my life how did gravity and you
know how did yeah you know I already you
know pudding pops still waiting yeah the
Pepsi right yeah right i mean not so
much Zima but you know what there's a
lot of TV shows that i invested in that
people warned me not to like I was at
Park Avenue 666 I'm like wait what
happened that was the devil and things
and he was in charge of no hotel yeah so
I don't know I'm trying I'm trying to
have faith because I don't want to
invest too much and leftovers and then
not have leftovers I guess one long has
the thing has HBO done that have they
just left something for dead so much
mm-hmm I don't know I think it why I
can't I can't I don't know because
that's a thing when you have when you
have networks like HBO Showtime and
stars stars is a great example where's
my hello Torchwood I just sort of went
nowhere after stars to get over right so
I don't know I guess it just depends on
the network and same with like things
like Netflix Amazon and Yahoo they're
starting to take no pun intended pun
intended leftovers be honest here and
we'll talk about that to you a little
bit but i think these types of networks
give shows more of a chance than let's
say ABC NBC CBS fox now so maybe we
have a chance to have closure but I
don't know I don't know probably don't
have to deal with sponsors getting all
angry about content yeah that's true I
don't know it's not a question font ways
yeah do you guys really find it
convincing that their world would fall
apart this much losing only two percent
of the population cuz we've had bigger
losses than that in the past yeah we've
lost more than one percent of the
population out of nowhere Black Death I
mean recently yeah well when I was like
the tipping people have actually become
that much more sensitive than they were
in the Middle Ages I mean I think now
that the world is connected I think you
know we're also interconnected and we're
also i imagine people going like
nobodies like I know I just kept
thinking ever since we if we lose one I
think it's one percent not two percent
right okay if it's one or two percent I
don't know this sounds very mathy I also
feel like how many Twitter followers
would I lose sorry those very sad things
with it that's all I care about oh there
goes my Klout score yeah I don't know if
we would care or if we would be in
denial or if the government would try it
because that would be really hard to
cover up to um I don't I feel like
everybody would just put a positive spin
on it like you know hey there's more
room hey there's more places to live hey
there's more parking spaces the idea is
a big label crowded yeah the killer are
blown away by the randomness of it right
yeah I can't count on anything how do I
even plan my life no one is that the
idea right yeah and that's kind of the
show too as you see how people deal with
it it's more it's not I mean obviously
there's that over looming question of
where'd they go but then there's the
okay how do you deal with this like you
know how do you deal with someone you
love just gone here kills a lot of them
are asking why aren't we why didn't we
go yeah why didn't we go cuz rapture is
like you know the tikati all the good
people it's the really good it's a willy
wonka it's like the Willy Wonka elevator
too awesome here's the thing okay so we
saw baby disappearing so shouldn't all
the babies disappear or some babies
better than other baby never seen oh man
there's a lot of evil babies out there
seriously blood type maybe there's
taking a certain blood type yeah yeah
and and we still don't know what it is
so it could be aliens it could be
rapture it could just be this trailer
totally terrifies my
if we watch it after game of thrones
before Game of Thrones or something for
the baby just know this shows horrible
yeah yeah I'm like for a split second I
go Oh quiet yeah that's what I would
think I just I I've been watching a lot
stuff on netflix recently and and World
War Z was on and all I kept think he was
the kid cares about her blanket and
zombies are attacking and she's whining
about her blankie missing that's a
rapture victim right there and I'd be
glad will blanket I just yeah I don't
know I'm not a parent so I sound
horrible so I'm just like I am can just
the noisy drunk people be raptured cuz
that would be great ya on the next great
cast no one no one no one I don't know
it is a very interesting concept and I
do like the idea of it because it's it's
a it's something that people are
definitely talking about and it's it's
not your typical sci-fi horror type show
you know what I mean it's definitely has
things left over to talk about yeah
anyways like they've been really Egypt's
there's been delving deeply into these
characters like the episode this week
was just all about one character and
which you know either they're building
to something great kind of another lines
of a breaking bad we have this just
really amazing just characters that you
follow through crazy stuff and it seems
like maybe that's where it's going but
right now it's just like really slow and
i'm having a hard time keeping up with
it no I've lost it too didn't lost focus
on like a couple characters each episode
instead of you everybody and then you
got really super invested in those
characters and then when they started
killing them off you're like oh that's
sad I like with way more crazy weird
stuff way there's a lot more mystery
going on like this show doesn't really
even seem to care about explaining you
know the context yeah I mean if they
replaced everyone that they took away
with invisible smoke monsters and polar
bears I'd be totally down so that's kind
of a given yeah so I don't know I i I'm
giving it a chance but again you're
right if they need to speed it up a
little bit more and maybe we're just all
a little bit um a DD but there needs to
be a bit more excitement for me to keep
going so anyway that's what I think I
left overs the end
amantha did we get amanda's take on it
okay here's my take I've got pretty much
two things to say about it um one kudos
for casting former doctor who
Christopher Eccleston always nice to see
him he plays the Reverend uh-huh but a
for them especially the first two
episodes I was watching him and I was
thinking this really feels like a
Stephen King miniseries did anybody else
yeah you know it's funny you said that
because Entertainment Weekly had an
interview with both Damon Lindelof and
Stephen King because Stephen King has
his own TV show that's doing really well
too is that under the dome that's under
the dome right and they discussed each
other like each other shows and plot
points and stuff and I think Stephen
King made a reference that he's a big
leftovers fan and so you can kind of see
that kind of influence for sure I'm glad
Eccleston xin that too by the way even
though you know I don't know I was kind
of hoping that I would see him in more
British programming but I'm glad that
Americans are sending him paychecks I'm
sure the second yeah it'll take him back
I don't know after heroes I don't know
if he's allowed back into the country
but we'll see but ya know it's good to
see I loved seeing is it Jason through
there are Oh missed mr. Aniston so um I
like seeing him in stuff so uh hopefully
they'll keep keep going I'm gonna pick
up the golden segue right here since
next up on our list is actually doctor
who so the season 8 trailer for the BBC
series actually aired during the final
the world cup on sunday giving the
entire globe something to fill our
football avoid or at least some of us so
I for this I think I'll just hand it
back over to you guys because you guys
are more yeah that's that's universal
that's actually not the trailer for the
TV show that's the trailer for their
tour that they're doing I wrote an
article about this on cnet but they're
going i think is like seven cities or
something and it's Capaldi and Coleman
RN Moffat Moffett's only going to be at
a couple of the cities because I've been
stalking Moffitt for a while so I know I
did all of them but that's kind of cool
because they're doing kind of a world
tour there we go there's the major
life returns I don't think I know who
the doctor is a new life hey payers
I'm the doctor I've lived for over 2,000
years I've made many mistakes that's
about time that I did something about
that
join into darkness here we go again
glad I tell me my good man I don't know
Doctor Who saturday yay I'm getting
chills I get chills every time i watch
that because I'm like yeah it's gonna be
a dark doctor instead of a goofball like
I like Matt Smith and I like the other
doctors obviously 10 tenant and the
other Tom Baker was always my favorite
but I've been waiting for super dark
going into you know battling the inner
demons kind of doctor I found tenants
dr. very dark he was very dark and he
got dark towards the end for sure and
that's one of these things where I'm
like finally because I mean you can't
live that long and not be bitter and
angry at some point and I'm glad that
they were kind of bringing that out and
it's fun to see like the snippets of
things like I like anything with t-rex
and dinosaurs I'm glad they're bringing
that sort of thing exactly I know me too
I know me too i mean i don't know what
it is like i was like oh great space
battle it whatever and I'm like a horse
chase that's kind of cool okay dialyze
blah blah t-rex so I don't know I'm
excited for it I'm sure Amanda and the
rest of you guys will chime in because
your doctor who fans too but there were
two other teaser trailers that I covered
for cnet as well and one of them you
actually get to see the two beating
hearts and as usual and Doctor Who
tradition the TARDIS has to go through
some major malfunctions and blow up and
have things go wrong the the control
panel so it was great to see that again
and I'm just excited that may or may not
be Davros his voice I mean that's the
big discussion it don't like style it's
definitely sounds like him to me and I'm
just excited to see it so I'm gonna stop
talking because I could talk about this
all day I'm just you know yay gave more
Doctor Who I really want to hear a man
down yeah Amanda chime in okay well
first of all I wore my Tom Baker TARDIS
cute I did too i wear my TARDIS too yay
so the top figure is my doctor I've been
a fan since way back I do enjoy the new
series considerably Eccleston was
actually probably my favorite of the
doctors so far I enjoyed tenant love
Matt Smith but I am super excited about
Peter Capaldi I took I took a notes on
that trailer the long trailer and it's a
three words
dinos Daleks darker yep you know I
gather that from what I the rumblings
I've been hearing this they really want
to take this in a different direction
than what they've had before especially
with matt smith and i'm curious to see
how bold they're willing to go with that
if this season is about answering that
question am i good man i think it's
going to be very compelling and I'm
can't wait I'm just excited we're gonna
get a doctor that's not like on the
cover of teen beat I mean not to say
Peter Capaldi is it you know isn't
adorkable in his own way but I i'm so
tired of companions falling in love with
the doctor and smoochy flirty doctor and
companion stuff I think that's why I
know I mean I'm just saying that could
happen to you but I you know I don't
think Jenna Coleman I don't think we're
doing that because that you could see in
the new trailer she's kind of like her
body language alone that pretty much
proves it but a very little girl thing
yeah it's just i I'm just excited to
have a doctor where it's not all the
will they or won't they kiss he's crap i
just want to see will they or won't they
go really super dark and i'm very very
excited to see a Capaldi's version of
the doctor even though i know i'm gonna
be on the edge of my seat thinking he's
gonna swear at some point cuz all the
other shows i've seen Capaldi and give
two bleep of every five seconds that
would be awesome that would be so great
i know i know i'm excited yeah I'd like
I've been trying to catch up trying to
get into and with my schedule the way it
is um I get to watch more spongebob than
anything else and same thing yeah well
you know big my actually you know maybe
the pineapple is a town I know I just
blew your my head Bikini Bottom is now
space yeah I think they actually have a
couple doctor who references in
SpongeBob's oh yeah they have everything
in there after the first couple times i
watch i think those Patrick would be the
worst companion i'm just saying they
talk about blowing up the TARDIS every
five seconds yeah you totally oh my god
it's so i have a question i think i'm
actually asked you guys this before but
like I'm kind of a dog
newbie every were watching something
with my mom in like the 1980s but like
I'm a little more familiar with it now
but I don't know where to start like
where do I get caught up with 2005 make
everyone I think everyone has their own
viewpoints on that like I I'm if you're
going to start with the reboot I say
start at the very beginning with
Eccleston's reboot because that it's not
even a reboot I mean obviously it takes
you know it follows canon but I am and I
might have a different suggestion by
would say start there and then watch all
the new stuff and then go back and all
the old steps on hulu that netflix has a
bunch too so you can watch a lot of the
I think hulu has hulu plus has the very
first one and you can go from there and
it's a pretty it's pretty slow and it's
black and white 16 years my hands been
retrospective from beginning and hearing
a lot about yeah it's kind of slow but
then again you'll get all these really
great references because Moffat is a
huge Doctor Who fan russell t davies is
to obviously a lot of the writers put in
these little easter eggs from like old
old old old episodes but amanda what
would you suggest people start i'm
actually with you on that i think new
people coming to it i think it's great
to start with Eccleston for the new
series you know it's got the production
values and the pacing that that current
viewers can really accept and if you
like that then I suggest digging into
some the older ones but I usually drag
people at Tom Baker probably because I
love him and probably because I think
that those also still resonate really
well with so the modern viewership for
the most part yeah it's also in color
yeah and you'll know what the scarfs are
back yeah yeah yeah and also I think
some of the better companions are were
Tom Baker's companionless then you get
you know Sarah Jane and Sarah Jane has
her own show which I just started
watching sarah jane adventures because
it's all on hulu plus because i never
got into that and i was like I had a
doctor who void and I was just like I'm
gonna watch it now and it's very very
entertaining and even though it's meant
for kids there's great references of
old-school Doctor Who stuff and it
connects really well to the new series
so I and you know she's no longer with
the actors that played sir james no
longer with us but I I love thats it
that serious so if you
a chance check it out on hulu all right
you've not just planned my next sci fi
date night with my wife yay moving away
from Sify for just a little bit we want
to talk about community the NBC comedy
that's laced with all kinds of Awesome
geeky and subculture Hubert has been
going for five seasons and it's kind of
been cancelled and resurrected and it
got cancelled again and then Yahoo
picked it up and the sixth season is
gonna be on yahoo which is interesting
and kind of nerdy actually seems like a
good home home for it in certain ways
but we didn't have a little debate
internally here on whether or not you
know this is actually a crave cast
worthy show and I'm curious what
everyone thinks I think this is one of
my favorite sitcoms ever and there's you
know so many geeky in jokes and and and
references and I am totally psyched that
this is going to continue online it just
seems perfect what do you guys think
well I don't see how that's even a
question I mean if you just watch the
trailer there's every there's you know
reference to every single thing you
could possibly think I've learned the
Rings Terminator I mean just it's all I
think some of the episodes not all the
episodes i mean i've been watching
community since it started and they have
specialty episodes that have doctor who
references cuz obviously he did his own
doctor spoof and there's you know but
nowadays there's a star wars reference
and everything i just watched law and
order special value unit or whatever and
it's you know they had a star wars
reference I mean there's always you know
I and I'm not saying I don't like
community I'm a big community fan but of
all the shows i mean there's a crapload
of sci-fi shows coming out as well as
horror and fantasy that we're not
discussing today and so i think i just
pointed out that community I love
communities coming back but it's you
know it's not Constantine as that
Dominion it's not the quest it's not
Outlander I mean there's plenty of other
stuff too but I am glad that Yahoo
picked it up we'll see what happens is
this the first show that Yahoo is doing
because I didn't even know yahoo had TV
we have an article about that I guess I
should read seen as oh oh there you go
no it's not what's the first show then
cuz I didn't even know yahoo was doing
TV until
all we reported it so yes but I thing
like I'm sure nobody wants to pass yahoo
so I'll do it yeah nice meal yahoo mail
i used to use before gmail so i love
that show yahoo i am is what i used to
use before gmail so several years ago
their site is I mean I thought I know
they're trying but I thought nothing
could make yahoo cool again and they
actually went and did it they scooped up
one of the coolest shows yeah so Wow
okay I I'm all for it I just honestly I
had no idea Yahoo even had a TV
component that actually could show TV
shows like it so I'm excited um well
they've been getting like the SNL
archives and stuff like that okay all
right go yahoo building i get our then
i'm biased for coming you know the main
characters yeah narcissus named Jeff
there's a guy on the show who's obsessed
with pop culture salt I need it like
right and to watch the show right um so
I'm I'm always leery when a show comes
back like for like one more season like
when scrubs did that yeah it was like
they actually kind of like tidied
everything up and you're like okay
closure and then Oh another season on
another network in it I know I was going
for six seasons and a movie well yeah
them this could be totally different I
am cautiously optimistic I think it just
depends like IT Crowd granlund IAM did
one last episode which is one last it's
like one episode one season we complain
about Sherlock and within three episodes
of season is like the last IT crowd
season was one episode but that was to
wrap everything up so you know he got
that chance to like tie up all loose
ends and it was like a nice ending to a
show so I'm all excited to see what
communities going to do on yahoo and
like i said i'm a big proponent of other
networks that to do new stuff like
amazon's a great example netflix
obviously prove that you can do this and
i'm a big fan of Hemlock Grove so I'm
glad that that second season just
launched over the weekend for hemlock
grove so you know more power to yahoo
hopefully community can live strong
there and it has dan harmon back again
yeah yeah
I will say one thing that gives me some
pause about this was arrested
development is huge arrested development
original series came to netflix for you
know whatever the extra seasons were and
I didn't finish the netflix once I like
lost something I think it actually want
something in that it lost its structure
a little bit because some episodes were
30 minutes somewhere like 50 minutes and
it felt like actually lost some of the
constraints that they were operating in
do you think maybe do you think it's cuz
the hiatus was too long between seasons
because then all the actors some of them
had more plastic surgery than others so
it was a bit I mean they use these jokes
about that I think porsha arasi had a
few jokes about her plastic surgery and
how her character look drastically
different than the last you know season
we were used to with the rest of
development but I mean here's the big
question every time a show gets
resurrected or saved every fireflies
dressing it's like you know that Joss
Whedon guys that he's not doing anything
right now right so and you know Nathan
Fillion got that little tiny show castle
that that that should be cancelled any
minute now so why don't we just bring
back Firefly I mean that's I love that
Firefly you know the Browncoats are just
so adamant about you know we could bring
that back we could just kick start that
like that's a you know gonna resurrect
anything I'd like that kicks it's early
death is what made it so beloved yeah
not a chance like that yeah I don't know
we'll see maybe it'll come back fingers
crossed come on browncoats write your
Congressman where's our Kennedy yeah it
really is so we got a couple more
minutes here and so let's just wrap up
real quick there are two other shows we
wanted to try to get in maybe we can
throw the strain in here too so let's
just go round to the real quick 60
seconds Gotham Constantine or the strain
which one excites you the most and why
uh-uh Constantine because i love the
comic and i'm one of the few people love
the movie so I want to see what they do
the show but I did watch the strain and
I loved it and it's a great book and go
del Toro so I say both okay Jeff um can
I can I go for a fourth option not
actually I'm it like intrigued by all of
them but I'm really
curious to see the new flash show just
uh because like the I've watched the old
flash show and it was really awesome
cool that was it okay I'm trying to keep
it short here no no that's good oh look
we even have a trailer oh look at look
how on the ball everybody is ours that
arrow Oh Carol yeah that's nice ya know
it is there's an arrow is a flashes
arrow doesn't match the flashes
interested on arrow that's right that's
right that's right who's playing flash
do we know oh yeah hit Brandon Routh no
cuz he's supposed to be on arrow this
neck yeah and he's gonna be this up we
IMDb this last time right yeah I know if
only there was an Internet service that
told us these things things didn't we
write an article maybe we should read
seen it once in a while that's probably
on their everybody thinkin Gotham and
tosin mmm well I have questions about
Gotham because they seem to be doing a
very dark gritty kind of thing but
that's Constantine Constantine right
here yeah right well i don't think i
have Gotham sorry I was like I'm just
turning into the question okay so um but
then the description sounds really camp
like there's a character called Edward
nygma who's a forensic scientist who
speaks in a cryptic language I mean he
imagined being introduced to the guy and
then like one guy says the other so he's
this he's a code guy who speaks in code
yeah it's funny he's right like how can
they possibly do this in a very serious
you are away and then in a scantily-clad
vilnius named fish Mooney with the
right-hand man named butch camp you know
so I'm puzzled I'm the one I'm actually
interested in those Constantine because
I just I don't know a lot of charisma
and that guy I meet style he's finally
British right yeah if you watch the yeah
if you watch the TV shows oh there we go
yeah there's an eye this is a major
network so hopefully they won't cancel
it i have high hopes it didn't castle
Graham didn't cancel Sleepy Hollow yeah
that's so that keeps going so I feel
like maybe mainstream America is ready
for more scary gothy horror stuff so
never tell Amanda will you add on these
uh the fall sci fi de beauté yeah for
me
the toss-up between constituted Gotham I
think you know when Gotham cast donal
logue I was kind of signed up to get
invested in that but now that
Constantine trailer looks really cool
yeah cool dark and gritty and the more
of that the better if they can actually
pull that off on a regular broadcast
over to your television then I'll be
pretty pleased but for me both of those
really yeah i mean the production value
on that Constantine trailer and you know
it definitely seems like they're
throwing the most move behind that one
the Gotham tour is kind of like okay
this is kind of like the origin story I
don't know if I'm totally that into it
the strain I keep hearing how awesome
and gross it is it is it's both of those
things and it's great I actually really
liked it here's the thing to keep in
mind is a new TV viewer to a show that
hasn't been tested out yet that's a
brand new show keep track of how
expensive the effects look because this
is what killed off heroes pretty quickly
too i mean writers strike aside it was
how expensive is each episode because
that's what networks look at too because
if the numbers aren't their ratings wise
they're going to get rid of their
expensive show so sleepy hollow has
great effects it's still round grim
house good effects but it's mostly
character-based too so I don't know I'm
fingers crossed that's good advice for
the chromecast to we really need the
keyboard now water that plant Eric
seriously it's like little house of
horrors over there electrician feed me
seymour feed me I know I'm just I was
feeling scared for that plan last time I
was in the mist prison and so I had to
bring something back it's all about the
it's all about the set yeah and i do
want to give a shout out for the quest
by the way because it's a sci-fi fantasy
reality TV show and they call it an
amazing race meets Lord of the Rings
meets Game of Thrones I'm scared of that
I'm gonna write something up about I'm
gonna write something for Cena because
they're auditioning people at san diego
comic-con this year which is like the
worst place to audition anyone for
anything oh it's gonna be an actual it's
an actual reality show
yeah like no it's gonna be a LARPing
while they might dump a bunch of larpers
in Siberia I'd watch that but it's it's
going to be interesting so I just wanted
to even though we're all about scripted
stuff I need to throw in that reality
show because I just I can't wait to see
nerds in peril which is really what they
should call it yeah yeah I want I'd
watch that as long as it's not naked and
afraid in the woods or whatever it is
that's great I haven't watched that yet
I just been thinking splinters
everywhere yeah yeah Lord yeah game of
Thornes yeah oh sorry puns are coming
wrap it up wrap it up that funny note
that is the grave cast for july thanks
so much for for joining us if you got
any suggestions for future shows tweet
us at crave and of course keep track of
everything on cnet com / crave that
we're working on say goodbye guys and
we'll come on guys bye guys thanks
