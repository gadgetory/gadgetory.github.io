your Google alysha's for everything
video that we can pack inside of a show
and the top story this week comes from
patently mobile after a filing released
by the united states patent and
trademark office revealed samsung could
have plans to build all new form factors
for mobile devices now some of these new
designs include a concept for a
scrollable smartphone that's shown in
two states rolled and unrolled and
buttons would be located on the rolled
up side of the scroll is a scroll phone
now another concept is a foldable
smartphone that uses a hinge system it
folds in half and can open up like a
mini organizer there's also another
foldable concept where the design is
folded off-center which results in a tab
expose on the left side of the device
for quick access to apps and
functionality and in the last concept
Samsung shows off a bendable smartphone
we've even seen some similar demos of
this impasse CES shows again this is the
filing and none of this may see the
light of day but it's Samsung and you
know they'll try everything to see what
sticks with people now I love the
potential for unique designs and
functionality with more screen real
estate that makes sense for us as our
gadgets keep getting thinner and thinner
so what do you all think to fold or not
to fold or scroll let me know in the
comments and I'll read some of them next
week alright Samsung gear VR is also one
of the best values to get into VR right
now with the $99 headset that supports
multiple galaxy phones and phablets we
told you about the new game lands and
last week that's worth checking out for
the platform and now a report from
sammobile says Samsung is working on a
wireless gamepad for the gear VR a
patent application filed in February of
2015 by the Korean giant shows off a
bluetooth gamepad that is described to
be used with a head-mounted apparatus
now the images are what you would expect
from a controller but its progress for
pushing the VR platform forward and
Google's Play Store gets a bad rap for
getting apps later than iOS sometimes
but it looks like androids version of an
Instagram is getting a rollout for multi
account support on the app before anyone
else it's in its testing phase not
everyone has it but now you can have
multiple counts like one for your
personal life maybe a work account and
one for your
Instagram modeling career seriously you
know who you are and adobe is finally
bringing their premier clip video
editing app to Android as well it can
help produce a video using your photos
and video recordings you can add a
soundtrack to it as well but what makes
it unique is that you can also transfer
your project to the desktop version of
premiere without losing your edits and
Nexus phone users and I'm one of those a
vehicle Bluetooth call problem is being
reported on the android open source
project and it affects all nexus phones
from the 565 x + 6 p what happens is
that when you're attempting to call out
to a phone number when it's connected to
your car's bluetooth the call will fail
and the car will resume playing whatever
songs are audio you were listening to
before that call now meanwhile your
phone will still be calling and if it
successfully connects the call neither
side can hear either party now this bug
wasn't even present in the developer
version of Android marshmallow so
something is clearly changed it's
unclear how widespread the issue is
right now but google has not made any
comments on this yet now on to wearables
the Huawei watch arguably one of the
best smartwatches this year if not the
best is getting some updates with better
optimization and a new watch face that
looks like this and it also looks like
the fossil Q founder another fashionable
SmartWatch with fossils design influence
that's running Android wear is coming to
the google play store soon it will
retail for 295 and what makes this one a
little different is that it will be
using intel's brand new adam
ultra-low-power processors and has
doubled the ramp with a full gig
compared to the Moto 360 huawei watch
and LG's watch or Beynon it looks like
an actual watch pretty sweet alright
that's going to do it for this week's
show you can email us at google issues
at cnet com or tweet me at brian Tong
thanks watchin we'll see you guys next
time for some more of that google it
