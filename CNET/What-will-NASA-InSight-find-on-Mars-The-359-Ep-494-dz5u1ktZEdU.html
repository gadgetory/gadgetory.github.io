Ben Fox we're even let's get some props
to NASA for successfully landing the
insight spacecraft onto Mars is the
first robot to land on Mars since 2012
then what are you hoping to find on Mars
with this robot I'm like quietly hoping
that we find microbes but I feel like it
would be kind of like down come up what
what are you talking about life on
another planet is a boring answer you're
being alien artifacts or something cool
like that
way too many movies give me a break
if you didn't catch a lie though you you
missed six harrowing minutes when the
insight Lander was descending through
the Martian atmosphere it's kind of
shaky six minutes where we're sure what
was gonna happen and then you know NASA
later I'll confirm the solar arrays
we're out powering the robot and instead
of moving around this robot I'll
actually dig into the planet and get
some more information on how the plan
was formed and hopefully we'd learn a
little bit more about how earth was
formed because of this right and also
give some very useful data to Elon Musk
to ensure that I don't know his Mars
colony will be up and running by 2025
chances moving there so she's definitely
ready to go but it'll be really cool to
see what this comes up with and I was
personally very tickled or very happy to
see that so many people were really
excited about this yeah because it's
it's very you know fun and exciting to
see people get really excited about
space exploration
especially during cyber monday which
granted is like a very you know retail
centric type of thing I mean that's a
great Segway cyber monday is over we've
got some numbers Ben runs down how big
was Cyber Monday so cyber monday was
another huge shattering success broke
sales records up and down but it's
really hard for me I mean I cover
ecommerce I've been doing it for the
past three years and it's hard for me to
get too excited about that because if it
didn't break records then everybody
would be freaking out like much more
money is moving online versus offline
into traditional stores
so you would expect it to break records
the biggest like drivers this year were
mobile phones and a lot more people are
buying stuff on phones including
big-ticket items and also this thing
called bow piss or at least Adobe calls
it opus buy online pick up in store oh
okay I thought both this was a product
of like a hot toy for the holiday season
no and as you would expect like there
were a lot of like here I'm gonna try to
find like some of the hot toys that were
selling or just a generally hot stuff
I'm just surprised that phones is a big
seller because generally people still
get their phones through their carriers
I guess they're doing I know buying
stuff through your phones what was
really driving traffic yeah so some of
the stuff that people were buying using
their phones included the Nintendo
switch little live pets Red Dead
Redemption - that's not a surprise me LG
TVs drones Dell laptops for real pets
I've never heard of these toys and of
course the Amazon echo smart speakers I
was waiting for that to join the list
all right well lastly seen a review of
the PlayStation classic is out and our
own Jeff Bakalar notes that you know the
original PlayStation games don't hold up
so well hmm yeah he kind of makes me
wonder if the whole classic gimmick of
these retro consoles has run its course
I mean yes that that feels true to me
don't you think they overdid it a lot
Nintendo found huge success at the NES
classic NES NES classic but those were
some of the very earliest gaming
consoles the Atari one I think also came
out but what it was really like do you
really like talk to your friends and
Pine over PlayStation games like the
PlayStation guys I think the Metal Gear
Solid game Final Fantasy 7 those those
are classics but I think as Jeff noted
like these are the first 3d games and so
they're they're more keen to the games
that were playing now and except they
look uglier like way way uglier so they
don't hold up as well as that kind of
the kind of 8-bit 16-bit
action it's like playing contra with
your friends with that guy that like
jumps like three flips like three times
in the air
single time all right that's all the
time we have for a full coverage chicken
sounds seen it I'm wondered Chang I'm
Ben Fox Ruben thanks for listening
it's like the countdown music for like
NASA itself or something and always
there's this weird like serendipity when
I when I just let the playlist shuffle
and our library music beds just kind of
figures it out and it legitimately felt
like we were in like control room master
control waiting for the lander it was
like that was the TV movie dramatization
version soundtrack okay thanks everybody
for joining us for the recording of the
audio a podcast that we'll publish later
you can download that and take it with
you on the train in the car to bed
whatever you like for the meantime we're
going to take your questions and
comments about today's stories and
topics at hand so go ahead and send in
whatever thoughts are going through your
top of the neck balls whatever they call
those they're sorry I'm a little burnt
out this morning totally fine let's talk
a little bit about the PlayStation since
we're still on topic here I think I like
the point that you made that there's
less of a nostalgia factor for that
PlayStation because it's not as old and
we were kind of talking about this like
when does classic run out are we gonna
get a Gamecube cl√°sica we're gonna get a
Wii classic are they classic enough to
be classic me and I think that's
something to be said Glenn cute classic
yeah I mean as much as I'd like to have
it again I can't classify that as
classic nor can I really the PlayStation
as much as there is a beloved fan base
for the PlayStation that was kind of a
turning point into the modern era
I feel so there's less of a nostalgia
factor for the sake of like the the
8-bit art and such Jeff notes you know
the lineup of the games aren't that
great half the games are ok I wasn't
really a PlayStation guy but even I
understood the importance of Final
Fantasy 7 as sort of as one of those
hallmark RPGs but they're remaking Final
Fantasy 7 into like a new high
definition version for you know current
consoles so like why why suffer through
the the crappy graphics of the original
one we can get sort of the revamped
version I know there gonna be some
hardcore PlayStation fans who are gonna
want this thing I know the classic is
already sort of sold out like it was
selling like gangbusters just see the
appeal of it Scott Scott MyID agrees
with you he says I
understand the mini retro consoles or
Playstation if I want to play the
original Metal Gear I'll just dig out my
old PlayStation not a classic Nintendo
people still own their Playstations and
I say one of the the cutoff point should
be if there's games out there and no get
me wrong PlayStation awesome I'm not
trying to discredit it at all but right
if you're better off and finding greater
success taking things like Crash
Bandicoot and Spyro and remastering them
and reissuing them on modern platforms
go that route don't dig back into the
well people who had those probably still
have those if they wanted them if they
want to get him again
give them the Refresh get the remasters
out there I think that's a better course
of action than trying to read up the
hardware itself yeah and just he notes
that some of the games that you would
have wanted on the PlayStation Classic
one of them but that's obviously a
licensing issue I think Tony Hawk and I
think that was also oh man they don't
one of the only ones that I actually
yeah yeah that would be a nightmare yeah
oh man that soundtrack was dope yeah it
was I mean think about it we've got like
the the crash bandicoot insane trilogy
and what spiral just came out with the
reissue HD remaster trilogy and it's
doing really well and it looks really
really good I would rather see them do
more of those than get like a ps2
classic yeah I agree
all right let's go ahead and take some
questions from the chat this isn't a
question as much as a testament to my
heart Stream joy says I and my friends
drank a shot of vodka every time they
clamped it in the control room sure
enjoy are you alive are you sure you're
okay I'm concerned because that sounds
terrible every time they what clapped oh
yeah yeah that that was a lot of
clapping also can we talk about the mean
elephant in the room and the dancing
dancing the dancing handshake that was
absolutely precious I loved it I mean
that was just a good honest moment yeah
totally I mean it was clearly rehearsed
but they're like okay when we land on
Mars we're gonna do this do this
I mean listen let's be honest we'd
probably do the same that's how I end
every iPhone launch event I do it does
make me feel like I should at least try
to add to my bucket list like be in a
control room like a NASA control room
for a major effort but like that would
never happen so I I don't know ever say
never I guess I could quit my job and go
into science right now it's okay so what
were some of the hype what were some of
your highlights guys from yesterday's
broadcast I honestly I thought that was
really really well done I fear what some
of the backlash is gonna be from the
audience who are already skeptics
because it looks like it was super well
produced but I give that to them as a
credit I feel like I was watching an
episode of Bill Nye with all the
animation and the personality and it was
just I thought was a great presentation
from like a TV producer standpoint yeah
yeah same here I mean I didn't really
have any issues with I didn't realize
that there would be a backlash that if
like it was too well produced I didn't
realize that was gonna be a thing but
I'm sure people find some people find
something to complain about
it was also kind of cool to see so we
were talking about like the grainy image
originally yeah so Brian I don't know if
you can grab this off of Twitter or I'll
try to send it to you through slack but
after the grainy image they actually
sent a much clearer one later in the day
yesterday which looked really pretty
cool so if you want to follow some of
this info you can follow NASA or you can
follow NASA insight on Twitter just to
see what it's actually doing out there
and I don't know get your mind blown
yeah like what looking at a robot take
pictures on Mars which is pretty cool
that is so cool
I hadn't seen the new image I was here
for the stream like we carried the
stream yesterday so I watched the whole
thing and and saw that initial one which
is like that's just kind of cool yeah it
was kind of a lame image it didn't
really give you much as a feeling you
know I bet outside of the feeling in
your heart but like wow yeah I mean you
would expect a much more modern
like much more modern equipment to
provide that type of imagery so when I
first saw the original like kind of
dusty image I was just like what what
what is this this is kind of a letdown
so yeah this was a lot more impressive
what do you think they're using a pixel
yes yeah so no surprise here people want
to talk more about video games
I just know audience - well Scott Myatt
says I wish they'd remaster the original
Metal Gear that would be an amazing
remaster you are not wrong there
agent mulder awesome name by the way I
want the 80 Star Trek and Star Wars
arcade games to get reissued those were
solid games also correct and then
Gabriel says I like this comment well
why refresh create new games they out
did the old function already new
versions and new ideas and new outcomes
are the way to go and that is also an
excellent point
nostalgia yeah I'm down with both the
styles is a powerful thing some of my
favourites games existed on the
Dreamcast which is why I still have a
Dreamcast so you still play it yeah Wow
I loaned it to a friend recently so he's
had it but yeah I still played it
actually I when I first moved to New
York in 2008 that was the first thing I
unpacked and set up and within two weeks
and that was like the original one I got
in 99 yeah it blew up it died so I had
to go get a refurb so I got a refurb
no.9 and I've been running that ever
since yeah which is I guess you're a
perfect candidate to get these new types
of consoles because I don't think
there's a new Dreamcast but if you
really love the games but that's
extremely old hardware and it's really
hard to find like refurbished ones would
you want to buy a Dreamcast classic no I
would keep buying like it wouldn't be
hard to keep finding a refurb Dreamcast
out there with how adamant the audience
base is any console somebody's out there
keeping them alive remaking them I would
rather have that og Hardware sitting on
rather than like a pocket version no I I
still loved the idea of the NES classic
and a cns classic they did a really nice
job bringing those
back it was a nice one-off I don't think
it's a wise decision for them to turn it
into a trend and do everything down the
line until we've come completely full
circle yeah well a year after the
concert comes out the classic comes out
it's which classic it's just basically
the Nintendo storage but made out again
a gameboy classic it's like an even
smaller version of the Gameboy that's
actually I like that idea of the
original Gameboy bring it to your phone
I yeah see that's it but Nintendo so
apprehensive about mobile development
that that's such a tricky place for them
to get into it don't know why it's
obvious that that trend is it at the
very least cooling down there were so
many that we're coming out why I mean
it's clear - I can see what they're
thinking I mean it's wrong but you know
they've always been apprehensive about
mobile because they're in the handheld
gaming business and they don't want to
cannibalize it you know I've long said
that's that's a stupid fear to have the
fact that they they kind of dabble in in
these games these kind of mobile
specific games is you know like their
test mission that they should be in
smartphones but why not just go all the
way bring in some of these games port
them straight into your phone
I would definitely you know I'd pay good
money for accurate ports of the Metro
Legend of Zelda I don't even complain if
the console developers created dongle
and hardware peripherals to turn that
your phone into that console so that you
could tap in like a Bluetooth controller
that's reminiscent of the original
PlayStation oh yeah then essentially
generate the HDMI out from the phone
into the TV to get the better more
authentic big-screen adaptation I'm I
wouldn't be opposed to that I'd pay for
that well ok while I wouldn't agree I
wouldn't disagree with your point Roger
about that maybe Nintendo should be
doing more of this it's pretty clear
from a business perspective that they no
longer have to as much as maybe they did
maybe a year or two ago like they're
doing way better
yep and the Nintendo switch was a much
bigger success than I think a lot of
people were anticipating so it was it
was kind of the situation where
everybody was yelling at them like get
into mobile so your business survives
that's not really the case now they've
got the switch and
yeah the Heat's off yeah for sure so
it's possible that he will be back on a
couple years from now but for the time
being I don't think they have any need
right to get into mobile as much as they
did before I just love that we've opened
up this Pandora's box and people are
just listing their favorite games they
want to come back Chris Wesley says
twisted metal priority once it's contra
Carlos Carlos says Megaman I'm down with
all of these syringes asking if any of
us ever played the driver games on
PlayStation and I did I loved that game
that was my favorite thing precursor it
wasn't really precursor to but I thought
it was better than at the time grand
theft auto hmm it came out before grand
theft auto 3 so before they went like
full-on 3d so that 3d driving crime
spree gameplay kind of originated with
driver to my knowledge maybe there's
other games that predated that but I
thought that was one of the best I love
that game I don't know that was really a
PlayStation guy neither was i but I was
like it was before and then I jump
straight to xbox I had in 64 my
neighbors had PlayStation so we'd just
come back and forth and 64 what it was
it and then GameCube and then yes - yeah
yeah and GameCube it was awesome I'm
still really hoping they bring back the
game came came classic we had 64 classic
before a game festro that's Joe I
thought they were gonna bring one out
this year like I thought Nintendo was
gonna keep the trend going but it's a
good thing they probably cooled off on
that I feel sure if PlayStation misstep
not to mention the Atari one kind of
sucked the Sega were not done by right
they were licensed games they were not
and they weren't great like the second
one had like I think it boasted of like
a hundred games but most of the games
were not shovelware
yeah they weren't part of the Sega
lineup they were just like random crap
games that were thrown into it that
sounds lame also the sound emulation was
total garbage
oh yeah there you go like you can sit
there and be like this isn't the Sonic
the Hedgehog theme I remember you know
something's wrong
that's nostalgia done completely wrong
Priority One is asking what was the
mobile
a console from the 90s that was the game
gear sir there was also the Nomad magic
deep on this one Jean knows so many
things I was I was a gamer kid also this
is a great setup for a little self plug
here dad says I'm sure it's out there
but is there a reasonable reasonable
price for an arcade console like full
height box with all the great games from
the 80s
that's the retro I want I myself was
investigating this if you dig around on
ebay you can get a box for like 30 to
300 500 bucks but that's just the shell
you'd have to put in a screen and like a
Raspberry Pi for yourself or or very own
Bridget Carey went ahead and dug into
arcade one up and yeah it was great this
was really neat and now we have this
console the Street Fighter console they
let us keep it
Bridget built it herself we'll see that
here in a second and then our very own
John Falcone bought a classic retro box
that had Galaga no wait galaxia yeah
yeah was a Galaga I think gal goes in
there centipede yeah yeah and I had the
roller ball like that they're their mini
collections like there's turned on no no
I don't think yeah I need to play them
right now so yeah these things are these
are shorter but the art is authentic and
you can easily prop it up on a box seat
and of course they sell a convenient box
you can pay yeah yeah oh risers yeah
it's silly but you can also put it on in
about an hour
it's basically IKEA furniture okay yeah
that was really I like that you can
build it yourselves like the legit like
I mean not size wise like it's
scaled-down but it looks great it looks
like exactly what I played in the arcade
yeah
next up that Teenage Mutant Ninja
Turtles game no but see that's the one I
want I want the only like mega
multiplayer the turtles turtle time or
turtles or ash man x-men was my favorite
cuz he could do like six yeah they need
to release those as special editions
charge extra have all my money yeah
all right we are just about out of time
so getting any last-minute questions we
didn't spend nearly enough time talking
about space because we got distracted by
a nostalgic see what I said nostalgia is
a powerful thing so what are do we know
what the timeline is for develop I love
that during yesterday's presentation she
kept saying so when are we going to see
science when we go see some science
it's like phrasing that she could have
used but what do we know about NASA's
timeline and what their projected
projects are gonna be in 4th coming
months and years with insight well
they're the like I said the robots gonna
be drilling down into Mars and
collecting data sending it back I think
the idea is that this thing will be
around for the next at least two years
collecting data it'll be around for a
while
how long do the Rovers usually last I
don't that's a really great question I'm
not entirely sure but this one isn't it
doesn't move around it actually is
stationary because it's really focused
on the drill bit it should last a while
I mean it does yours
yeah it doesn't it doesn't move around
so there's a lot less risk of it running
into issues okay and what do we what are
we drilling for again okay I guess
seismic data looking at how the planets
crust was formed really kind of looking
at that and kind of comparing it to how
Earth was was formed trying to get more
of the I guess more insight into just
how these planets were formed beginning
right and whether we can terraform it
but yeah this is apparently this what
this robot is the first time that we're
gonna be able to thoroughly investigate
what's inside of Mars for the very first
time and so they're really in that
really what it's gonna be
and drilling down may be getting some oh
gosh sorry and may be getting some
microbes as Ben is hoping for
underground microbes underground
microbes who know possible I don't know
if fossils gonna be amazing if this
robot that they set up there to build
Ilan's new house if it actually found
life and their amazing development yeah
yep yeah Elon would um you know I have
to
the margins you know it's interesting
guys you gotta move legs in Hawaii yeah
yeah that we're on we're back on Mars
now but over the weekend I spent my time
watching
mst3k is the gauntlet including Mac and
me which is about Martians oh yeah a
true classic I felt like that was maybe
a documentary presentation of what we're
going to see now CT yeah it's a poor
man's et mixed with a McDonald's
commercial oh yeah that's right but
anyways we are out of time thanks
everybody that was a fun chatterbox
today we'll be back tomorrow with
episode 495 until then Roger take us out
