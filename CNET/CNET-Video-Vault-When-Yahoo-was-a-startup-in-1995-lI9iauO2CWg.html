of two Stanford PhD students david Philo
and Jerry Yang a lot of fun discovery
finding information you know that's what
Yahoo's all about so what you guys do
all time this is it yeah this is faces
to recreation as well it's really it's
really stress you're leaving so how did
you guys come up with Yahoo where did
this come from
well used to be called Jerry and Dave's
guide to the web and that was pretty
boring so one day we decided to come up
with something a little more interesting
when we consider ourselves a couple
Yahoo's and it's pretty fitting to I
think the site and the Internet in
general
so here we are right in the middle of
Yahoo what what drives how fat of a
connection if you guys got well we just
installed a t3 which is 45 megabits
we're not gonna use all that we're
actually sharing with somebody else but
we're probably gonna take a big chunk of
that it's fairly unimpressive as far as
the spaciousness where most people think
it's gonna be used space with all kinds
of computer stuff but you know maybe 10
computers that are doing all the work
here
recently over the last week we're
getting over like 6 million files
transferred a day today we're adding
between 500,000 site today did this
rapid expansion
catch you guys by surprise while you
were at Stanford well we certainly never
we never thought we'd get this point
when you find these sites how do you
decide if one is cool if we find
something as we're adding these that
really catches our eye and interesting
we think that other people will think
it's really interesting
then we designate that as what's cool is
a watch which shows okay there's bug
watch for all you entomology freaks Robo
cut and for all you fans of the mighty
flow be committed to keeping the service
free David and Jerry have yet to make a
profit but to pay the bills they've
taken on a few sponsors it's kinda like
yellow paint when you go to the yellow
pages
you don't really mind seeing the ads
that are in there that type of
advertising I think is is more useful to
the user do you need interns absolutely
we need people pretty much and every
thing you can imagine what is the future
for Yahoo well I think what's gonna
happen is we're gonna I really have to
stay in top of the internet cuz it's
gonna change really fast you know what's
really important to us is our brand is
our recognition we wanted people to
associate a lot of fun discovery finding
information you know that's what Yahoo
is all about</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
