but Bentley kind of is the Riviera let's
take a ride in a car with as much class
as it has sat because it's an ex model
the Bentley Continental GT Convertible
v8s and check the tap
what makes this car an ass for as a
standard GT continental with a drop-top
s starts with more power we'll take a
look at that under the hood in a moment
look at the subtle body kit around the
chin and around the lower sides of the
vehicle not too extreme but that's
different you've also got a sports
suspension sport calibrated steering
which we'll try out on the road in a
minute and a 10 millimeter lower ride
height just barely it's also got some
really hot looking 20-inch open spoke
wheels these I'm afraid are not them
this is another optional wheel that's a
little more Miami Beach than Kapton 10
oh do I talk now I think just sit here
all day sleep have a nice clear ass this
is a fantastic place to spend time Oh
nice to drive to but I'd be happy to
just sitting in front of my house doing
my work
it's a beautiful living room in this car
I don't use that term ridiculously it is
comfortable spacious nicely appointed
Bentley does that with exceptional taste
the technology is not quite so cutting
edge good but there's nothing that's
going to be telling you about the
cutting edge of where the industry is
going you've got kind of your usual
stuff your radio settings are here with
satellite am/fm your media choices
include an optical disk you've got 15
gigabytes of hard drive space that no
one really cares about so all this stuff
you're looking at here it's kind of you
could have seen in one of my videos
three or four years ago nothing cutting
edge but notice how big everything is
and clear
I give Bentley kudos on that they have a
unique proprietary interface here that
is impossible to miss touch all the
zones and buttons are nice and big and
that's important in a car they've also
done a pretty good job of making it look
like the car that every car maker does
that the typefaces for example are
actually common between the gauges and
the LCD I can't tell you how many car
makers drop the ball on that one what
you won't find anywhere in here is any
kind of connected services no app
support this is a few years back now I
don't know we talk about audio systems
you know they all sound pretty good
these days I stopped picking them apart
a couple years ago but this one I'm
gonna talk about this is what they call
name audio for Bentley name is a
high-end British audio maker that
Bentley's got an exclude
with well that's a great amps and ESP
and all that but the key thing is over
there on the door that speaker looks
normal but behind that grill is
something flat like a pancake it's
called a balanced mode radiator it moves
on a piston electromagnetically like a
speaker for good bass but being flat
it doesn't aim the high frequencies like
a laser shot so they tend to disperse
over the cabinet this is a great
sounding sound system coming from
someone who is not that impressed that
often now the last thing I want to talk
about are Drive control technologies
your shifters pretty traditional
beautiful traditional PRN D and then
sport kick it to the right for a
shifting gait you can also shift up here
on the paddles but they're missing half
the paddle they cut off the bottom half
I don't get the logic of this because
most drivers are down here on the bottom
hemisphere of their wheel these days
nothing to reach for you can't get a
shift until you go back to old school
10:00 and 2:00 like you were taught in
high school and finally you've got a
suspension button here this little shock
absorber icon press that and you get to
a screen that has four touchscreen
ride control settings but why is it a
two-step dance to get there just give me
a knob from comfort to sport that's bad
interface before we head to the engine
bay just take a note at all the stuff
here that's kind of real and in many
cases metal this is a nice cold metal
shifter these are metal organ poles to
open and close these vents around the
car quilted leather up here ah and the
coup de gras or the coup de stupid is
this perhaps the most beautifully
rendered sunglass case in all of auto
'dom this tells you what kind of folks
buy Bentley's they spend a lot of money
on their fashion eyewear I want a nice
place to put it now one of the front of
the Bentley you're gonna find an old
friend of ours you watched our video on
the Audi rs7 you might recognize the top
of this engine unusual architecture the
turbos and the exhaust manifold
apparatus are on top inside the V
cylinder Valley intakes are on the
outside kind of under this is the four
liter twin-turbo motor of the VW Audi
Bentley family and it's a heck of an
engine some numbers 521 horse that's 21
more than an on s car 501 foot-pounds of
torque that's 15 foot-pounds more 0 to
60 and 4.5 only at
point two seconds faster than an on s
car but we'll see how it really
translates on the road and that's really
impressive considering this car is a
beast 5,400 pounds plus before you and
your friends get in all-wheel drive by
the way with a forty sixty front rear
split that eats meat automatics your
only choices we saw the mpg is not
actually bad 14:24 yet it still gets it
with a gas guzzler tax of a grand not
much on the car of this pricey the nice
thing about the S car is that it
actually adds just enough of an extra
edge in terms of the way it operates in
sport mode of this car isn't this big
ponderous beast if you look at this
vehicle it's got a lot of mass a lot of
physical presence it's the color of a
beluga whale I mean it has all kinds of
external cues that say wow what a big
pledgie ride that is but it's not it's
fairly sharp while being utterly
comfortable in sport mode three things
primarily take place you're going to get
sharper shifts they're gonna hold rpms
longer in automatic mode and you're
going to get more aggressive tip in on
the throttle and you get this great
sound out of the sport exhaust which is
optional but how does it sound good not
overly obnoxious good and ballsy but
still with an elegance good that befits
the car I love listening to this
but listen to Bentleys concerto in E
minor that first movements pretty good
the adaptive suspension as I mentioned
follows a different set of controls than
the power train sport mode it doesn't
make a huge difference this car never
gets a hard really gutsy ride it stays
comfortable and luxurious at all times
but it does seem to level out body roll
adjust a bit
it's an adaptive air suspension so it's
got that ability rather innately and
when it's not doing sport duty it's
doing excellent Road modulation duty
this is one of the most comfortable well
damped luxury car rides out there not
flabby but not a bit of harsh annoyance
comes through the Big Bang Can Dance I
got to tell you I don't mind taking this
contra corners
it likes it so the line I'll get this
price our big beautiful friend here
starting at about 224 an S Convertible
and that by the way includes a gas
guzzler tax and a very stout destination
charge of almost 2,800 bucks after that
interestingly the options that appeal to
me
are kind of cheap the most expensive is
the optional sport exhaust it sounds
great and it's about 2,500 bucks which
is way less than the destination charge
neck warmer technology great for a
convertible just over a grand a power
trunk I mean come on under $1,000 and
massage and ventilation in the front
seats is only 900 bucks more these
prices are nothing compared to the base
price they're being added to I'm almost
puzzled by it all in about 225 seen that
style there's not a ton of tech options
you could add in this vehicle as you can
