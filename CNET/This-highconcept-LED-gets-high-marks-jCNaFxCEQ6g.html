here with the cloud led a br30
floodlight from green creative and this
is a new bulb that has a very
distinctive design if you look it floats
the diodes on this disk up above the
base of the bulb so you can see right
through it now what that does is that
makes it a lot lighter than the average
PR 30 and cuts down on the materials
needed to produce it and also helps with
heat management so this bulb separates
the diodes from the base of the bulb and
the heat doesn't affect things quite as
much now take a look at this graph from
our testing lab that blue line there is
the cloud led the red line is the
Philips slim style and you turn an LED
on it's going to lose a little bit of
brightness as it gets hot and then
flatline once the heat management system
of the bulb kicks in so you see here
both of the bulbs kind of hit that
steady state at about 15 minutes in but
the cloud LED hits a much higher steady
state it stays above ninety percent
that's very very well the filled slim
style was our previous pick as the best
VR 34 heat management but the cloud led
beats it so that's a fantastic result
the cloud LED comes in a variety of
color temperatures ranging from 2400 k
up to 4000 case if you like that
daylight kind of white light you have
that option which is nice whatever color
temperature you go with you're going to
get a very efficient bulb all four of
the varieties are 8 watt bulbs and
that's more efficient than any other
br30 that we've tested each one we
tested also scored above it stayed to
lumen output so brighter than they say
on the box a very good result very
bright bulb best of all the bulb retails
for thirteen dollars which is very good
for a br 30 LED and better than you'll
pay for manufacturers like Cree Phillips
and GE I still like the GE revealed BR
30 LED as my editor's choice it's got
slightly better performance on dimmers
and a much better color rendering score
so it'll make colors pop in your home a
little more but still as a value pic i
like the cloud led a lot and think it's
one you should consider thanks for
watching check out the rest of our light
bulb reviews and smart home reviews at
