through as a parent when I was a kid car
seating safety for little ones consisted
of dad saying hang on when he locked up
the drum brakes today of course you've
got three major phases your kids are
gonna start off in a rear-facing little
guys seat
then they're gonna graduate to a
front-facing fully harnessed seat and
then the one we're talking about today
the booster which is often misunderstood
by folks this is the one that interfaces
them to the cars seating and they
eventually graduate from this to sitting
in the car like everybody else now when
you're gonna use any of these in your
kids development is gonna vary by your
state's laws and regulations here in
California goes like this a newborn to
one year or 220 pounds uses a
rear-facing seat over one year and 20
pounds a forward-facing child seat with
full harnesses and tethers to the cars
seating then under 8 years old or 4 foot
9 is a booster seat and make that a
high-back one if the car is seating
doesn't come to the child's ears then
over eight years or four foot nine
seatbelts as long as the kid fits in the
seat properly basically a booster seat
is kind of a filler panel to get your
kid up so their body lines up with the
shoulder and lap portions of the belt in
a safe way they're basically using the
vehicle seating now but with a little
bit of a bump up in height and while you
would think any company making this kind
of product would get it right sometimes
they don't
that's where IIHS ratings come in handy
at their labs for geometries are
measured that result in four kinds of
ratings different than the stars you may
see for other kinds of vehicle safety
they're our best bets those receipts
that provide good belt fit in almost any
car minivan or SUV good bets provide
acceptable belt fit in most cars not
recommended those seats don't provide
the kind of fit you need and should be
avoided and check fit applies to booster
seats the Institute has tested but have
found varied results depending on the
child's size and the model of car bottom
line there are two things to eyeball
carefully to get it right
any booster seat you use with your kid
shoulder belt should not slide off the
shoulder on one side or put force across
the child's neck on the other direction
lap belt not too high so it's
distributing force across the top of the
thighs and not the vulnerable abdomen
area two things about a booster seat it
pays to double check</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
