the Apple buy for everything good and
bad inside the world of Apple the first
impressions the iPhone 10 are in you
know I don't have mine yet it's coming
November the third and I'll be doing my
own style review once I get it because I
don't get a free one from Apple like I
spend my cold hard cash on it just like
you and trust me it makes a difference
when you're actually paying for
something now the consensus for most of
the reviews is that it's a well-built
phone the screen looks great the notch
is there and is kind of annoying but can
be forgotten to a certain degree face ID
works and works pretty well in most
cases Mashable even did a video with
twins and in both of those situations
the other twin was able to unlock the
iPhone but there are times where it
isn't as fast and the biggest adjustment
is really getting used to the removal of
the home button and learning new
gestures now Apple gave most reviewers
less than 24 hours to get their first
impressions out and even showed love by
giving early access to a select few
youtubers and finally validating the
influence and power that the YouTube
tech community has the interesting thing
to me is that there was really not much
of a mention of an emojis it was more of
an afterthought and most the first
impressions you know one of the most
distinguishing features of the 10 that's
really a gag but the power of this
device will be unlocked by developers
once they get time to leverage all of
its hardware and a our kit potential
overall the first looks are great for
this top-notch phone now I'll post my
review next week after spending some
real quality time with it but I'd love
to hear what you think in the comments
since some of us will be getting it at
the same time so then what's next for
many of you obsessing about when your
iPhone 10 will actually arrive well
check this out you can actually track it
in the air going to this link from
flight aware now once you receive your
UPS tracking number from Apple the
departure scan should match a time for a
flight listed here click on the flight
and you'll be able to see exactly where
in the air your precious iPhone 10 is
pretty cool and pretty obsessive now
face ID is the feature on the ten
bidding adieu to apples touch ID rumors
claimed Apple was working on touch ID
under the screen but in an interview
with TechCrunch apples hardware
engineering Chief Dan Ricci Oh said we
spent no time looking at finger
on the back or through the glass or on
the side because if we did those things
which would be a last-minute change they
would be a distraction relative to
enabling the more important thing that
we were trying to achieve which was face
ID done in a high quality way Wow
so you're saying you spent no time at
all I present to you the Apple byte
court Exhibit A Apple's u.s. patent
number nine five seven oh oh oh to filed
on November the 12th 2013 and made
public on February the 14th 2017 for an
interactive display panel with IR diodes
that depicts using a fingerprint scan
through a screen without a physical
sensor you know just saying now new
updates to the entire family of Apple
software has been released iOS 11.1
brings over 70 new emojis that we've
been talking about for like over a year
the return of 3d touch multitasking and
affixed to the crack Wi-Fi bug and more
now it's not a new feature to iOS but
image recognition search has been part
of the Photos app for about a year it's
not nearly as good as Google's but
Twitter user Ellie WBU revealed that if
you search for the word brassiere the
iPhone categorizes photos featuring bras
automatically in a group like most user
searches show photos of bikinis lingerie
or bare skin and just to be clear it
organizes them and does the search on
the phone and doesn't send them to Apple
in a folder but the real question is why
did Apple feel the need to make
brassiere one of the search words
Chrissy Teigen took to Twitter to
confirm it and also to show off her
extensive collection of look at me I'm
so hot pics like I even tried it but
unfortunately for Apple by nation there
are no pictures on my phone Your Honor I
would Jeff and I also like to bring out
Exhibit B
come on Mitch you can't show me that I
was young I told you I needed the money
it was it was a tough time so wrong
now watch OS 4.1 is out and you know I'm
a fan of the new series 3 LTE Apple
watch right here especially its battery
life now 4.1 brings LTE streaming to
Apple music and a new radio app with
stations like ESPN Bloomberg and our own
CBS News radio and your favorite genres
of music it's awesome now Apple says the
series 3 watch will get up to 7 hours of
battery life when streaming Apple music
over LTE 5 hours when streaming live
radio and if you're using the workout
app streaming audio GPS and LTE all
together that's good for 3 hours and
that's only one hour less than you could
before streaming music was even
available now this just makes the Apple
watch series 3 even better and I'm
loving it you just made my Apple watch
even better you know what that's a good
Apple plus they also fix that annoying
messages app scrolling issue that would
drive me cranked right alright Mac OS hi
Sierra gets new emojis in its update and
TV OS also received updates and give
this video enthusiast the ability to
manually tweak the Apple TV's 4k output
settings you can do things like switch
the dynamic range and frame rate options
on or off but I'm still waiting for you
know Dolby Atmos support also Apple's
acknowledge an issue where edge stripes
are appearing on some Series three
watches and appears to be a
manufacturing defect that will be taken
care of for free under the standard
one-year warranty
Apple's internal memo obtained by Mac
rumors since GPS models are being
affected by this and not cellular models
the edge stripes may appear due to
moisture collecting under the display an
apple is never released a price point
for its maxi pad looking air power
wireless mat but a Polish retailer
published an online listing for air
power that comes in around 199 US
dollars it sounds about right it's not
cheap but you know you're gonna buy it
and we'd also like to take time really
just take a moment to honor three Mac's
that have now been declared obsolete or
vintage by Apple who will no longer
offer repair services or replacements
for them so right now we just like to
take a moment to honor them
alright let's announce our contest
winners from last week for the Mophie
goodies I asked you what did I do after
the Eddy Cue quote and the correct
answer by over 1500 of you was that I
wiggled it back and forth you know that
tongue tongue thing so yeah I did so the
winners for the two Juice Pack err cases
are on Twitter Aliana Sabrina and Erin
deal on email who said you put that
tongue all over the place now the gift
responses you all sent me yeah they were
funny but the winner of the Mophie
double XL USBC power station goes to
this guy Randy Vasquez it's better if I
just showed you you win I did it better
I did it better you know it gross that
was disgusting
and it totally worked so congrats y'all
I'll be in touch alright that's gonna do
it for this week's show you can email us
