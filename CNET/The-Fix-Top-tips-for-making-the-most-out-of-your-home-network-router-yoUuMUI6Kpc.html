about DIY tech and how to's I'm Eric
Franklin and I'm Sharon Profis you know
one of the most important devices you
probably have in your house right now is
your Wi-Fi router right that's how all
your devices connect to each other and
connect to the Internet yep so we start
off with a few tips on how to sign it up
the right way just because you own a
router doesn't mean you're using it to
its full potential
maybe someone else did the initial setup
and you may or may not even be aware of
their settings and options you can even
change don't worry though I'm gonna show
you a few tips and tricks on how to
improve your network experience and how
to access your router settings first
access your router settings by going to
its IP address you'll usually find this
address on the bottom or back of your
router use a username and password
provided but be sure to change it to
something more secure when you get a
chance once you're in the first thing
you want to do is change your routers
name or SSID too many times I've gone
over to a friend's house only the seat
of the router is listed as d-link
such-and-such with a bunch of numbers
and letters behind it no name your
router to something easily recognizable
at least for the sake of your visitors
next update your firmware sometimes
connection or performance issues will
crop up and having the latest firmware
which is just the software program for
your router can improve performance and
fix issues you also want to change your
networks password this is the password
required for devices to access your
Wi-Fi change this to something secure
but something you're likely to remember
not just a bunch of random numbers and
letters if you only have a 2.4 gigahertz
band router you should know that it uses
some of the same radio channels as your
baby monitor and your microwave not to
mention that if your neighbor is using
the same Wi-Fi channel as the one you're
using or one that shares bandwidth with
yours it's gonna interfere with your
performance so what are the fastest
channels to use 1 6 and 11 using those
channels should optimize your router
speed if you have a 5 gigahertz band
router you'll likely get faster internet
perform
if you use that ban on five gigahertz
there are more radio channels to choose
from and each has its own bandwidth also
be sure to choose either Auto
or 2040 for your channel bandwidth this
will give you the fastest speed while
making sure that your network is
compatible with as many devices as
possible there are plenty of other
options in your router settings however
the ones I just pointed out are the
easiest and most efficient changing the
name of your Wi-Fi router is such a
simple tip but when you do it you can
finally feel like it's yours
call us nice and homey yes alright it's
time for a quick break and when we come
back donald has a few steps to extending
your Wi-Fi router to places in your home
that are otherwise dead zones
you
welcome back you know once you have your
router all nice and set up what do you
do when it barely reaches parts of your
house well we have a few solutions for
you Wi-Fi routers are a great way to
take your internet connection and share
it wirelessly but there always seems to
be one or two rooms in your home that
don't get great Wi-Fi reception I'm
gonna show you two inexpensive ways to
get your internet spread across your
home
the simplest one-stop solution is a
wireless range extender I got this one
from tp-link for about 30 dollars online
it may look like an air freshener but
what it really does is act as a relay
for your Wi-Fi router we broadcast a
signal and rooms in your home that
aren't getting great reception here's
how to set it up first
find your Wi-Fi router and plug the
extender in to a nearby location next
find the WPS button on your router WPS
stands for Wi-Fi Protected setup and
it's an easy way for routers to pass
along their login information to other
devices automatically press the button
until it registers then then go back
over to the extender and press the
button on the front after a minute your
router and extender will find each other
and perform a little virtual handshake
you'll notice that when you can see the
rest of the lights on the extender all
lit up which indicate the signal
strength
now that the extender is configured to
act as an extension of your router it's
time to move it to another room plug it
in and after a minute you should see
everything light back up on the extender
and if you don't you might be too far
out of range for the extender to
communicate back to your router so try a
room that's slightly closer and see if
that does the trick to test it out
take out your phone or laptop and
connect as usual you'll see your Wi-Fi
routers name listed you'll select it and
you're up and running now in some unique
cases a Wi-Fi range extender might not
be the best solution maybe you're trying
to get internet out to a garage that's
not even attached to your home or you're
trying to get internet down to a
basement that seems to just block out
any kind of Wi-Fi reception in this case
I would try a powerline adapter these
things work by sending your wired
internet connection over the copper
wiring in your home they come in a pair
and you plug one in your router and run
an Ethernet connection from an available
port on the back of your router
the connection on the adapter plug the
second adapter into the room where you
need internet and you can basically
treat it like a wired Ethernet port
connect to it directly or set up another
router here to make it wireless so there
you go two tricks for extending the
Internet to every corner of your home
that does require some setup but it's so
worth it if you want that solid Wi-Fi
connection throughout your home
definitely now if you want to share data
with friends and family but you're not
really sure how to do it we've got a
simple tip using devices you probably
already own like many of you I have a
bunch of photos from a recent trip I
took and I want to be able to share them
on all of my computers and devices at
home without actually uploading the
photos onto every single one the
solution is to use a networked hard
drive once it's set up I'll be able to
view photos videos and any other files
stored on the drive from any device
that's connected to my Wi-Fi network
there are a few ways to go about this
one is by using a network attached
storage drive or an ass drive for the
power user they're great but if you're
more of a casual user who only wants to
share media there's a better and more
affordable solution on the back of most
current routers you've got all of your
standard networking ports plus a USB
port when a hard drive is plugged in
here you can share whatever's on it with
any other device connected to your
network here's how to set it up on
windows first choose your storage drive
it can be as small as a thumb drive or
you can attach a bigger external hard
drive plug it in and head to your
computer launch your browser and go to
your routers IP address in my case it's
192.168.1.1 but you can find yours in
the device manual unless you changed it
yourself every routers interface will
vary but if it has a USB port you'll
likely find a file sharing option under
the administrator settings here be sure
to enable the file sharing server apply
the settings and
get out of there now you're ready to
access the drive so head back to your
desktop launch an explorer window and go
to the network folder at the top clear
out the path and enter backslash
backslash followed by your IP address
with that your drive will appear you can
double click it to access it like any
other folder you'll be asked to enter
your login which is the same one you use
to access your router once I'm in I can
see all of my vacation photos and so can
anyone else on the network the process
is the same for all other windows
computers as well as my Android tablet
at this point you might want to map your
drive so that it always appears in the
sidebar for easy access to do that just
right click the drive and select map
network drive and there are all my
photos from my trip whenever and
wherever I want and the best part is
that if I ever need to take my drive
with me somewhere it's as easy as
unplugging it and stashing it in my bag
that's it for this week's show
thanks for watching you can reach out to
us with your comments your suggestions
your how to's or even your own DIYs we
want to see them I'm not sure and
professed and I'm @v doable and we'll
see you next time right here on the fix</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
