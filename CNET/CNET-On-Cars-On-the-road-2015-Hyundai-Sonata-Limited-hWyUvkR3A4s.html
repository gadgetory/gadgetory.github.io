the auto business you don't have to be
hot-looking or super fast or anything
superlative you just have to be a nice
car let's see how they all-new heavily
revised 2015 Hyundai Sonata goes after
that bull's eye they hit it now the
Sonata as you may recall got serious in
the market with the 2009 model all of a
sudden it became a real threat to Camry
Accord Fusion and the rest but it always
had this unfortunate Hyundai trait of
looking a little bit ornamented shall we
say just not a handsome car that's
changed now and that's the big story on
the outside of the new Sonata refined
more urban lines now call your attention
to a couple of exterior features first
of all the panoramic roof which is
optional even on this limited trim
there's one bar in the middle but it
opens up a lot of sky and an interesting
take on the trunk just walk up to the
rear of the car with the key in your
pocket and stand there for three seconds
and the trunk opens automatically if you
don't recall what the previous Sonata
look like here's a look now here's what
we have today this is completely
different kind of Teutonic it's got a
little bit of an Audi layout to it it's
clean its handsome it's modern its
angular that theme continues now our
cards pretty loaded up was a limited
with almost every option CNET style
navigation system as you see here
Hyundai's always did a pretty good clean
job of that and they've tended to have
the fastest touchscreen response in the
industry by a big margin I'm afraid to
report that that's a little bit muted
now it's just you wouldn't notice it
watching me on camera here but I can
tell you shut up just little
milliseconds little heartbeats worth of
difference or happening now when you
touch the screen I will say this when
you're in navigation mode it's got a new
I believe split screen option plus auto
zoom and a lot of things going on makes
it kind of busy your standard audio is
going to be iPod and USB and aux jack
all down here in this new and large bin
Sirius XM is standard and bluetooth
streaming are also standard HD radio and
more comes in an optional level which
includes our navigation that we've got
in here now check this out you don't
recognize that little orange icon right
there that sound hound let's say I'm
listening to something on a station that
doesn't do a good job
up of putting those RDS tags on the
screen so I can hit the SoundHound
button and it's going to listen to the
broadcast for certain amount of seconds
here get a nice sample figures out what
it is pulls it right up on the screen
and it's a really cool tool to have in
the car where you don't want to be
fumbling with your app on your phone to
do the same thing you can mark it as a
favorite go back later figure out what
it is there is something as advanced as
an online buying store for the track
just yet but maybe it's a matter of time
this car also supports Siri eyes free
with your iPhone and later in this model
years run in 2015 they'll also support
apple carplay they're one of the early
adopters on that another interesting
feature especially for a popularly
priced car you've got start/stop and
replay on satellite radio at 22 minute
buffer here to let you capture and go
back install the blue link telematics
app and you get a wide array of sort of
auto remote control functions and most
importantly you can get a live online
search utility that can tie into the
car's navigation system there's also
remote start via the app with the
interesting wrinkle of a delay timer of
1 to 10 minutes now under the hood all
sonatas continue on as four cylinders
only this or the 2-liter turbo sport
that's a different video here we have an
interesting story the horsepower and
torque have come down a little bit to
185 horse and 178 pound-feet of torque
down 5 and 1 respectively
but what Hyundai says they've done is
move the responsiveness lower in the rpm
band where real people drive not revving
their car out to a yellow or red line
but loafing along the numbers changed a
bit as they did that these guys are all
front-wheel drive and go out through a
six-speed automatic with a little shift
gate but there are no paddles on the
wheel you've got some drive modes sport
eco and normal very straightforward 0 to
60 happens in 8.1 seconds a car the way
it's about 3400 pounds but delivering
quite good fuel economy
24:35 you're not seeing any turbos no
brake energy regeneration no
electrification of any kind no auto
start/stop pretty straightforward
powertrain but gets it done
now that whole theorem about just be a
nice car really is where the sonata
prints on the road its overall quietness
and ride quality are really exemplary
the power band is used for where I want
it to be the transmission is unobtrusive
it never leaves the car flat-footed when
you need power there's a meaningful
difference between eco normal and sport
the steering is surprisingly heavy for a
car made today of many cars have over
assisted very light steering I think
it's part of giving the car a feeling of
more mass and more quality to the driver
now the driver assist technologies are
primarily passed if the one exception is
your active cruise control which will go
all the way down to a full stop with its
own braking and back up to full freeway
speed should conditions warrant what's
interesting is what they've done with
the blind spot technology here it's a
little more um contemplative if you will
when you have that on and it indicates
that you do a turn with your stalk here
it's going to read not just where cars
are so if a car off your side is closing
rapidly will have a different
sensitivity toward warning that if it's
not okay let's price our 2015 Sonata
this heavily revised version we have a
limited which is a really good place to
start
27:3 with destination but there are two
chunky options you've got to go for
packages there really take it seen that
style one as you can imagine is called
the tech package that's 3500 bucks for
the panoramic roof the 8 inch nav screen
xenon high-intensity discharge
headlights HD radio with infinity sound
backing it up a heated steering wheel
and ventilated seats and the ultimate
package for the louver 1500 is a lot of
your smart driving stuff adaptive cruise
lane departure warning forward collision
warning automatic high beams and rear
park sensors on top of the already
existing rear camera all in about 32 for
recei net style Sonata limited the other
one you want to look at however is the
sport 2.0 T smaller but turbocharged
engine more power roar to your
performance in fact they think it'll be
their biggest seller among all the
sonatas bottom line is this is the
Sonata that should end excuses for
buying a
this is an outstanding car in the top
tier with all the other big boys don't
forget they got a hell of a warranty
five years 60,000 mile bumper to bumper
and 10 100 powertrain we don't normally
talk about warranties but this one is so
outstanding it's worth a mention for
cars driven CNET style standing by now
