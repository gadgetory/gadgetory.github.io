watch OS 2 it shows up here in the Apple
watch app and you can hit update what do
you get with that well we're just
getting used to it right now but here
are the things that stand out right away
watch faces we've been waiting for more
watch faces now there's one that taps in
your photo gallery there's also one that
lets you put a particular photo on Oh
cute and you can also do a time lapse so
you can look at various cities with
super fast time-lapse animations in the
background that's about it complications
now those little bits of information
that are inside the watch faces those
are complications weather and lunar
cycle and battery life you can now add
those from third-party apps there aren't
that many of it seems like those can
make things a lot of fun depends on the
apps time travel know this watch does
not literally travel back into the
distant past but it actually allows you
to spin the digital crown and find out
what happened before what's going to
happen coming up on your calendar look
at the weather forecast anything that's
on your watch face including things like
maybe upcoming flights or stock prices
if you go back not stock prices if you
go forward it's not that cool
there's also baked in transit directions
in the Maps app on the Apple watch it's
supposed to give you local transit
information we have got a lot of like
setting that up yet but it does clearly
show some of the subway lines so stay
tuned for more on that a nightstand mode
you can now plug it in and when it's
charging it will turn into a little
sideways alarm clock on the side of your
bed you can't set the alarm it seems
from the watch but when the alarm goes
off the top buttons act as snooze and
off buttons you can keep tapping and
napping finally there are a lot of apps
that are now able to run offline meaning
when your phone's not connected they're
called native apps this is stuff that
runs on the new watch OS 2 apps are
gonna have to be updated to take
advantage of this right now there aren't
that many we did find a calculator app
though that's watch OS 2 in a nutshell
there are a lot of other tweaks and
updates still pretty much the Apple
watch but a lot of features that
we've been waiting for I'm Scott Stein
and seeing out with the latest on Apple
watch</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
