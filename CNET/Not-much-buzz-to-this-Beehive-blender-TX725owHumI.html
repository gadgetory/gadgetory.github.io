I'm here to review the austere beehive
blender this blender looks a lot like
the classic austere Iser blenders from
way back in the 1940s those hulking
tank-like machines had an all-metal base
with a giant rounded jar that's actually
where the beehive name comes from the
switch though keeps that old-fashioned
simplicity to make this thing feel like
an update of a classic the austere
beehive blender is available now
starting at $60 the base comes in a
variety of colors from the silver to a
metallic red to a blue the jar you can
get in either five cup or six cup glass
varieties I was excited to see what this
austere beehive blender could do the new
technology for blenders we have combined
with the old sturdiness that the
authorizer is known for that seemed to
me to be a winning combination
unfortunately a lot of the design
changes really hurt its performance for
one it's missing a lot of the unique
presets and speeds that modern blenders
have I can forgive it for that
simplicity has its place but this
squared-off jar stops food from being
able to cycle well get on the basics
like smoothies whole strawberries would
be left on top after 15 to 20 pulses and
most other blenders in fifteen to twenty
pulses already have a nice consistent
drink with a little shaking and a little
stirring this thing can complete the
basics from crushing ice to making
smoothies yeah it'll do the task but
with only 600 watts at its disposal the
beehive blender didn't have enough power
to pass any of our stress tests all in
all this is a functional machine so if
you get it as a wedding gift I don't
recommend fleeing in panic that said if
you're looking to make a purchase I'd
recommend the $40 Hamilton Beach
smoothie smart blender instead it's
cheaper it does the basics with less
help on your part and it even did okay
on the stress tests for $20 more I said
this thing is functional but that's
really about it
if you're the one making the purchase I
would strongly consider other options
for seeing it
