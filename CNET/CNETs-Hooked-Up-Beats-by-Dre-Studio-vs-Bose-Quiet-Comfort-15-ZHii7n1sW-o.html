man Brian Tom seeing that senior editor
and he is going to test your knowledge
in check your tech thanks Kevin
so we talked about how Paulie switched
over from the Bose QuietComfort 15 s
over to the beats by dre studio
headphones they're both $300 and they're
really great for different reasons so
what we wanted to do right now is really
break down the differences between the
two to find out which headset is the
right one for you now design wise the
Beats Studios really bring a unique and
flashy styling with multiple color
options and I just love how they look
compare that to the Bose which really
brings a more understated and classier
look with silver and black as the color
combinations when it comes to comfort
the beats are really stiffer and heavier
on your head so they don't feel that
good whereas the Bose QC 5
the lighter and weight and their ear
pads feel like soft baby pillows
durability wise the beats really have
this solid chunky construction that you
know can take a few hits and it's
headphone cable is thick and sturdy as
well
now the Bose headset those guys are a
little different they feel more plasticy
the swivel joints have cracked on me and
it's cable is this thin flimsy little
wire but headphones always come down to
sound quality and it's gonna be
different for each person depending on
the genre of music they like so we start
off with Bose they really have the best
noise cancelling that you can find but
lacks bass with an umph
you have some great mids and highs that
give you a really clear sounding tone so
think about more like Coldplay
and classical music for this headset the
Beats Studio brings a richer and fuller
sound with some serious bass that you
can feel and that's why everyone loves
these now you're not gonna get the
cleanest sounding music but really for
genres like hip-hop and electronic this
is what you want to have so guys really
what's the verdict here we've got the
bose QC 15s we've got the Beats Studio
Headphones
they both sound great depending on what
your ears like but if you had to ask
someone like me I think I'm gonna go
with the noise cancelling of the Bose
headset oh they they feel nice and soft
and the style of the studio beats yeah
this is this is cool it sounds real good</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
