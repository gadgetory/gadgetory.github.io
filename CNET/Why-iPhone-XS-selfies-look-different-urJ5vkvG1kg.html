eyePHONE tennis you might think it looks
a little bit different from any other
self you've taken before especially when
you compare it to last year's iPhone 10
some people are calling this a smoothing
effect or even a beauty mode and there
is actually a difference between what
the photos look like on the 10s compared
to the 10 I've been taking a lot of
different images on both the front and
the back cameras and I'll tell you why
they look different the first part is to
do with how the tenant's takes photos
through HDR and computational
photography now HDR is high dynamic
range you've probably heard of this
before it's essentially taking multiple
different exposures either underexposed
on the meter and overexposed and then
blending them together in order to form
an image that has an increased dynamic
range so this means that you'll get more
detail in those shadow areas and also
more detail retain in the highlights so
like from bright lights or light coming
in from a window so that's essentially
what HDR is and because of that blending
technique some photographers have been
able to do kind of cool things with this
in order to make HDR look a lot
different from a regular photo so they
can make images look a little bit more
hyper real or they can make them look a
little bit more airbrushed because of
the way that they map those tones and
the way that the shadow and highlight
detail is distributed so that's one
reason why images look a little bit
different the 10s is doing a lot of this
computational photography behind the
scenes and blending exposures and it's
important to note that Apple isn't the
only company doing this on phones Google
Samsung and many other manufacturers
have HDR and blended exposure modes in
there as well now Apple also has the
addition of smart HDR on the iPhone 10s
and this is Apple's Phil Schiller at the
iPhone Tennis launch event explaining
how it works
what the hom ionic is actually doing is
shooting a four frame buffer so I can
capture that critical moment d-12 Ione
was do even more than that it's also
capturing secondary inter frames at the
same
and those interferences shot at a
different exposure level to bring out
highlight details and it's doing more
than that it's shooting a long exposure
so you can get better shadow detail as
well and when you're taking that picture
it's analyzing all of those finding out
how to match up the best parts of each
and merge them into one perfect photo so
here's a selfie I took to kind of show
you the difference between smart HDR on
the iPhone 10s and not having smart HDR
on the iPhone 10 as you can see the
window in the background on the tent is
pretty much completely blown out it's
not as much detail captured there on the
10s though on the other hand even though
it has a much more even spread of tones
and shadows and highlight detail does
look a little bit smoother and because
it looks like there's actually less
contrast your eye thinks that maybe
there's less detail there and therefore
less sharpness so that's the first
reason that photos look a little bit
different the next part is to do with
noise reduction so when you're taking an
HDR image or blending multiple exposures
together you pretty much need to make
sure that all those photos have been
taken at the same time otherwise you're
going to introduce things like camera
shake or subject shake into your images
now to do that a phone Cameron or any
other camera pretty much needs to rely
on a really fast shutter speed and to do
this either in bright light or low light
you usually have to ramp up your iso
unless you're shooting in like outdoor
sunlight with a lot of ambient light
there now by shooting with a really high
iso or higher than you normally would
use you usually introduce quite a lot of
noise into your images and then you have
to apply some sort of noise reduction
otherwise their photos are going to look
really grainy and they're going to have
speckles all over the image like no one
wants that on their photos so here's an
example that I shot on a DSLR at ISO
3200 it's an extreme low-light situation
but you can see without any editing at
all from the raw image there is a lot of
noise on this image if I apply some
noise reduction to this in Lightroom
this has been an extreme example but it
shows you just how much detail can be
smoothed out in order to remove that
so that's kind of one of the byproducts
of some noise reduction algorithms so
when you're shooting photos on the 10s
especially selfies in low-light
obviously it's gonna have to apply a lot
of noise reduction in order to get rid
of that noise otherwise you have a
really grainy image so a lot of this
does come down to personal preference a
lot of people that I showed photos to on
both phones lacked the images from the
10s just because they looked a little
bit more even and they had a good spread
of shadow and highlight detail so it
didn't look so dramatic but a lot of
people like to look from the 10 because
photos appeared to have a little bit
more detail just because they had some
more contrast and less of that HDR
effect but it's totally up to you which
one you like but the most important
thing to note is that this is not just
happening on faces this is pretty much
any subject especially if you're
shooting in low-light you will notice a
difference one way this could be tweaked
is if Apple introduces a software update
that lets you adjust the granularity of
maybe the HDR or the noise reduction or
of course you can just shoot in RAW
using a third-party app so you have full
control over your images but I'd love to
know which one you prefer and what you
think I have an article explaining this
