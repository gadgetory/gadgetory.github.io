a look at the sony alpha 6000 is the
latest addition to Sony's popular range
of interchangeable lens compact cameras
it replaces the older next six camera
sitting in the middle of the range for
those of you wanting to take your
photography just a little bit more
seriously it's physically fairly small
you definitely won't be able to get into
your genes but you won't struggle to get
it into a bag it's got a host of dials
and wheels on the outside giving DSLR
like manual control on the back as well
you'll see we've got a tilt table LCD
there's an OLED viewfinder and we've got
a hot shoe on top for you to put on a
flash if the built-in flash doesn't
quite do the job the heart of the camera
is a twenty four point three megapixel
Exmor R sensor backed up by Sony's
latest by ons X processor now Sony
reckons that gives more detailed shots
with lower image noise sony also claims
it has a lightning fast autofocus so
hopefully you won't miss any crucial
moments like most of Sony's range of
cameras it also has NFC pairing Wi-Fi
and access to Sony's PlayMemories apps
letting you do things like time-lapse
photography and add in various image
effects if you're after a portable
camera to help take your holiday snaps
to the next level the a6000 could be a
good option to consider when it goes on
sale in March
I'm Andrew Coyle for CNET and this is
the sony alpha 6000</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
