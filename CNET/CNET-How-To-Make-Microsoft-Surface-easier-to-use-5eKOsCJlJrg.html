gap between laptop and tablet but it
makes a few usability sacrifices along
the way I'm Donald Bell and on this
how-to video I'm going to show you some
easy ways to make the surface a little
easier to use one place where this ten
point six inch screen feels particularly
cramped is in the traditional desktop
view the text and icons are extremely
tiny here so I suggest bumping it up by
holding your finger on the screen for a
few seconds selecting personalize then
display here you can switch the overall
size of things from the default small
size up to medium or hit custom to scale
things up even further I personally like
how this thing looks at about a hundred
and fifty percent hit apply and let the
system sign you out log back in and you
should see a big improvement no pun
intended if you're not crazy about the
touchscreen keyboard you can fiddle
around with a few alternative options
down here in the corner but there's an
even cooler alternative keyboard that
you can pull up with this trick from the
Metro view swipe in from the right and
hit settings then tap change PC settings
here on the bottom select ease of access
from the menu here on the left and
you'll see an option for customizing
what will happen when you hold down the
windows button and the volume buttons at
the same time from that drop-down menu
select on-screen keyboard now whenever
you hold down that Windows button in the
volume button in that order you'll get
an overlay keyboard that can resize and
has a bunch of neat tricks like
predictive text function keys and a fade
button that allows you to glance at
what's behind the keyboard now to close
the keyboard just use the same windows
volume key combo finally one of the best
features of the surfaces that includes a
basic preview version of Microsoft
Office but you know it's better the
final version and it's free for you to
download if you know where to look from
the Metro view swipe in from the right
and tap search then type updates and
then select settings from under the
search box from the results on the left
the link for install optional updates it
says your system is up to date tap the
link on the left to check for updates
now it looks like I need a firmware
update but I'm going to take the extra
step here to click see all available
updates and look what we have here a box
to update Microsoft Office to the final
version I can't say they made that easy
to find but free is free so make sure
it's checked and then hit install so
there you go three tips that will
improve your surface tablet experience
head over to how to see Netcom for more
tips like these you can also find more
tips from me
