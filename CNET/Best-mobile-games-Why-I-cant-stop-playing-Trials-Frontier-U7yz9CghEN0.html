it's a 2d racing game that came out over
a year ago but it is so deep and so good
that I keep it on my phone and I've been
playing it all the time ever since this
is the village that acts as your home
base and each of these doors go to
different places that are all part of
the game right here you have the bike
shop where all your bikes are and each
of these can be upgraded using parts
that you find as you play the game
there's also games where you look for
these map pieces and once you have all
the map pieces then it unlocks the bike
and this room are all the characters
that you'll meet throughout the game
each of these characters have different
things that they want to do for instance
this cute girl right here is all about
the candy she wants candy so bad it's
actually pretty funny she's psychotic
about it pretty much the way it works is
you'll go into a level and you'll try to
find pieces of candy not so much to race
to get to the finish line but just to
find the piece of candy this guy is the
prospector he wants medals once you
collect those you'll get experience
you'll get money and you'll get a part
for upgrading your bikes up here you
have the amount of gas that you can have
in a sitting or what happens is is each
track uses from five to seven gas points
I guess I'll call them once you use them
all up then you'll have to wait you also
can use real money of course to buy more
gas this here with the guys spinning on
the top is the shop and like most
freemium games they have bundles that
you can buy that'll give you new
costumes and stuff like that or you can
buy gems and yes it goes from $4.99 for
200 gems all the way up to 9999 best
value I don't know if you think that's a
value then you're a different person
than I am anyway this game is not easy
there are a bunch of easy levels but
this game is not easy and you will come
to points where you'll feel like it is
impossible look just watch how this one
starts so I'm dead okay let's let's try
it again
all right so we're starting again got to
land it just right so I can get this
Hill Climb no okay and we're going to
get the hill climb
No and this is how hard these tracks
wait wait wait wait for it I got it okay
but that's only one checkpoint and
there's a million more things they're
going to be as hard yeah and I'm dead
again</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
