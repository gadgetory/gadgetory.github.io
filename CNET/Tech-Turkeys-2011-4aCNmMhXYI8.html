in the world of tech that leave us
scratching our heads like why Apple
redesign final cut for four-year-olds
why Quicken no longer works on the Mac
or why a Roku box has a genes tab but
those are trivial compared to this list
the top 5 tech turkeys of 2011 blunders
that someone just had to get fired over
number 5 the flip camera Cisco paid 590
million dollars to buy flip in 2009 they
got the brand the cameras the company
all of it and then in April 2011 they
killed it all they didn't scale it back
they didn't license the technology
didn't even sell it as a loss they just
shut it down
yes smartphones are bearing down hard on
flip cameras but flip was the dominant
brand in a still decent category
synonymous with Lowe's kind of cameras
it doesn't require any more R&amp;amp;D at this
point how much money did they leave on
the table with that one number for webOS
and HP personal computers we started
checking the dumpsters outside of HP for
empty booze bottles when they announced
in August they were suddenly killing off
the webOS mobile platform and devices
and selling or spinning off their PC
division don't those deserve to separate
press releases it was a bolt out of the
blue and made HP look like it never got
mobile and it gave a good case of the
willies to its PC clients and partners
and that's not a small business the
whole debacle cost the CEO his gig and
HP a lot of its cred as a Silicon Valley
visionary number three the Sony
Playstation network breach in a year of
unprecedented hacks and attacks the Sony
PSN breach was perhaps the ugliest in
early April PlayStation Network was
brought to its knees and the customer
records of some 100 million users were
pinched largely stored unencrypted all
in PSN and Sony Curiosity were down for
like three weeks
blackberry gets hell with their network
goes down for three days
oh and that also happened this year Sony
made amends by tossing you
there's some free games and stuff which
is kind of like the croupier buying you
breakfast when you just lost your car at
the baccarat table number two rim just
rim the BlackBerry maker didn't have any
one product or moment that its fate
turned on this year and maybe that was
the problem
just 12 long months of 2011 in general
was a year that the question what's up
with blackberry was on everyone's lips
app will retain the title for most
popular smartphone Android took over as
most popular platform Windows Phone as
most promising and RIM got kudos for
having a good keyboard not much to work
with there okay our number one tech
Turkey of 2011 Netflix when you hear
folks say your company's strategy is
gonna be studied in business schools for
years to come that's either real good or
real bad for Netflix check the latter
box in July the company raised the cost
of a DVD plus streaming plan from 10
bucks to 16 dollars overnight a 60% bump
the backlash was big subscriber
cancellations and nasty headlines sent
the once darling of home video in a
u-turn then they fixed it by announcing
Qwikster a new company to handle DVD
rentals separately from their streaming
because nothing takes a users mind off a
60% price hike like a 100 percent hike
in hassles well they reverse that
quickster idea a few days later but the
price hike stayed and the worst part of
the story is Netflix is still a great
service had a great price but no one
notices that anymore because it's now a
banged-up
brand all they had to do was handle it
right but I guess they didn't want to
give up this coveted number one slot to
rim for more top fives like this head
