in the world of tech that leave us
scratching our heads like why Apple
redesign final cut for four-year-olds
why quicken no longer works on the Mac
or why a Roku box has a jeans tab but
those are trivial compared to this list
the top five techfoot turkeys of 2011
blunders that someone just had to get
fired over number five the flip camera
Cisco paid 590 million dollars to buy
flip in 2009 they got the brand the
cameras a company all of it and then in
april 2011 they killed it all they
didn't scale it back they didn't license
the technology didn't even sell it as a
loss they just shut it down yes
smartphones are bearing down hard on
flip cameras but flip was the dominant
brand in a still decent category
synonymous with lows kind of cameras it
doesn't require any more R&amp;amp;D at this
point how much money do they leave on
the table with that one number for webos
and HP personal computers we started
checking the dumpsters outside of HP for
empty booze bottles when they announced
in august they were suddenly killing off
the webOS mobile platform and devices
and selling or spinning off their pc
division don't those deserve two
separate press releases it was a bolt
out of the blue and made HP look like it
never got mobile and it gave a good case
of the willies to its PC clients and
partners and that's not a small business
the whole debacle cost the CEO his gig
and HP a lot of its cred as a Silicon
Valley visionary number three the sony
playstation network breach in a year of
unprecedented hacks and attacks the sony
PSN breach was perhaps the ugliest in
early April PlayStation Network was
brought to its knees and the customer
records of some 100 million users were
pinched largely stored unencrypted all
in PSN and Sony curiosity were down for
like three weeks blackberry gets hell
with their network goes down for three
days when that also happened this year
Sony made amends by tossing users some
free games and stuff which is kind of
like the croupier buying you breakfast
when you just lost your car
the baccarat table number two rim just
rim the blackberry maker didn't have any
one product or moment that its fate
turned on this year and maybe that was
the problem just 12 long months of yeah
2011 in general was a year that the
question what's up with blackberry was
on everyone's lips app will retain the
title for most popular smartphone
Android took over as most popular
platform Windows Phone as most promising
and rim got kudos for having a good
keyboard not much to work with there
okay our number one tech turkey of 2011
Netflix when you hear folks say your
company's strategy is going to be
studied in business schools for years to
come that's I've you're real good or
real bad for Netflix check the latter
box in July the company raised the cost
of a DVD + streaming plan from 10 bucks
to sixteen dollars overnight a sixty
percent bump the backlash was big
subscriber cancellations and nasty
headlines sent the once darling of home
video in a u-turn then they fixed it by
announcing quickster a new company to
handle DVD rentals separately from their
streaming because nothing takes a user's
mind off a sixty percent price hike like
a 100-percent hike in hassles well they
reverse that quick stir idea a few days
later but the price hike stayed and the
worst part of the story is Netflix is
still a great service at a great price
but no one notices that anymore because
it's now a banged-up brand all they had
to do was handle it right but I guess
they didn't want to give up this coveted
number one slot to rim for more top
fives like this head over to top five
