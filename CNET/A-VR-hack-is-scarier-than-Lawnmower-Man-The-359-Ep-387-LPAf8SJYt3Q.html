Alfred Eng virtual-reality is supposed
to take you to whole new digital worlds
Oh hackers get involved and may become a
crazy bad trip Albert you wrote about
the potential dangers of this what
should we be worried about so yeah a
research team from the University of New
Haven in Connecticut they demonstrated
in this proof-of-concept attack that
they can basically go into like your VR
like software and then adjust where the
digital walls are so when you're playing
like a VR game you can like set up the
walls so that you can you know look
around but you won't bump into the wall
like in real life
right what they did in there you know
malware that they wrote was essentially
they could move the walls like
accordingly so like you wouldn't notice
where they're moving because you're
doing like so subtly right and then like
they can make a person like walk into
the walls in one example they didn't
really do this but they said it was like
entirely possible that they could lead a
person like to fall down the stairs
because when you're wearing the headset
all you're seeing is like what's in the
game right so that was one of the
examples of the malware that they had
you know written for their experiment
now just be clear like these tests
assume that hackers had already gone
through the computer that also does
encryption right yeah so it was
basically only looking at the VR system
security itself not your computers so
they they sent it through an email to
like compromised a computer right but a
suit I asked them you know what if they
send this on like Gmail or something
like that you know it's pretty it's a
pretty like robust like antivirus system
yeah Gmail plus like the anti virus on
your computer itself like wouldn't they
be able to detect this and they said
yeah but that's not the point of like
the experiment the experiment was more
so about finding out like what VR itself
could protect right so I mean the the
theoretical dangers are there it's
interesting to discuss but for a lot of
these systems that are tied into
expensive computer systems that
generally have strong antivirus
protections it's not exactly a practical
threat yeah all right so let's talk
about Apple the tech giant is reportedly
getting into the news business or
basically taking what left of its
texture acquisition and folding it into
its Apple News team there's obviously a
free Apple News Service now but they
want to create a premium
this a plan for some time this year what
do you think I mean it's I feel like
it's gonna come down to how much it cost
I don't I don't think I'd pay for that
considering there's so much news out
there that's free right now just a minor
texture which is sort of like a Sebata v
for magazines is ten dollars a month
obviously the service is still going on
but I could imagine something similar
Apple already has Apple music which is a
subscription service so it's I don't
know if it's that Star Trek yeah
especially if it's magazines like I I
read magazines for free through my
library app so I don't even really like
see a reason but maybe if it's a curated
selection of the best articles from
multiple magazines but we'll see
t-mobile is a hot war with the FCC the
nation's third largest carrier admitted
to injecting fake ringtones or dial
tones into calls in rural areas so
customers wouldn't realize that those
calls actually weren't going through
t-mobile settled with the FCC will pay
forty million dollars to the US Treasury
I mean I I'm just curious about why
t-mobile would do that in the first
place like why wouldn't they just
acknowledge for customers hey this phone
call is not going through like it's such
a weird like so SIBO effective from what
I understand a lot of it was to get out
of being blamed for that call not
connecting if the call doesn't connect
you're like a crappy t-mobile with the
call if you hear a ringtone you blame
the other person for not picking up the
phone it's kind of a shady practice but
the call isn't connecting though no no
that's a thing customers don't know that
if they hear a ringtone they assume
someone else is on the other line just
not picking up so what this is just kind
of like a cover-up on there and it was
like hey we actually do have service
here even though like they really didn't
basically yeah if your customer you're
you're less likely to blame t-mobile if
you hear ringtone than if you hear the
call disconnecting oh damn t-mobile and
service it's important that Verizon also
settled a few years back for doing
something similar this is not an unusual
practice before the end you know
obviously forty million dollars it's a
bit of a drop in the bucket for this
it's a slap on the wrist for t-mobile
which last quarter made about three
billion dollars a years yeah me too for
more on those stories check us out CNET
I'm Roger J I'm out for rain thanks for
the sing
it was a dramatic pause you kind of
slipped in there and I looked at the
clock was like whoa we're way over let
me make it more over by pausing a little
bit another second all right now's the
time for every to go ahead and submit
any questions and comments about today's
topics or even anything else that's at
least tech related and we can try to get
to them I'm gonna go ahead and call this
out right now Roger your headline is
total clickbait which one for this video
yes we didn't mention a lot more manic
no I mean okay so the consequence is
that we got syringe or in the chasings
what are the upper limit of consequences
of this hack just bumping into walls or
like what a potential heart attack
because the hacker made you walk off a
cliff I mean let's remember right now VR
is pretty tethered yeah yes although
there are wireless systems coming sure
what are some of the biggest threats I
think the point of the research was to
like take a look at you know because we
are still emerging like what are some
issues that they're going to need to
address like as this gets bigger and
deeper and into more homes and things
like that and like you said as they do
get like wireless and there's not like a
big wire holding you back from like
hitting the wall or anything like that
is it mostly just like pranks like
getting you to like no there's a bit I
mean what else can you do that's the
point that I talked to about like that I
talked about the most just because it's
the most interesting to me but I mean
there's other aspects of it like they
can like the same thing with like
standards of like other breaches like
they can like get you know how like you
have to set up a camera also as like
part of the scan or you have to scan
through they can get like footage from
your camera okay there as well right
that's scarier than than like misg I
know yeah yeah of course it was just
like you know trying to find something
that like separates like what's the
difference between like you know a virus
that like affects VR versus and fires
that affects your computer in general
because you know any any like a malware
could also get access to like your
camera on your computer
yeah yeah so it was just like how do I
separate it for like something specific
and that is I mean it wasn't it's
probably the most unique type of hack
yeah literally hack someone's sense of
direction sure it's it's an interesting
call so maybe not the scariest aspect
but I think it does as Alfred pointed
out it sort of kind of underscores the
broader
issue of whether or not VR might have a
security problem yeah like in the video
that that they put up and that's in our
story it's like this bow and arrow
shooting game for like the HTC vive yeah
it's like available on Steam VR you're
only supposed to stand in one spot for
that game like you only you look around
and then like you shoot an arrow and
like people coming at your castle or
something like that in the video that
they demonstrated even though the game
you're supposed to stand in one spot he
had moved like across the room while
playing how did he do that did he like
how do you how do you not know that
you're I don't know they I mean it's I
think it's because you're so like
immersed in the game that like you don't
you're like slowly in gender direction
yeah that's what the point was like if
you do like subtly enough but yeah I
don't I don't know like what like real
dangers there are besides like bumping
into already you know it's only become
super intelligent they they've brought
up examples where I'm like I don't I
don't think that's a likely scenario
where it's like you know if you if if
there was an assassin that wanted to
like kill somebody through the window if
he's not standing by the position you by
the way I don't like that that's really
that's if ik use case my story but I'm
like that's just very specific yeah yeah
and it's gonna happen like right so I
need to kill this guy personally they
said this video
yeah hooked into this VR game it's yeah
they've got a hack the VR I'm like he's
probably gonna walk by the window at
some point anyway I don't really think
like our system is the way to do it but
yeah I mean that's I think they're more
so taking a look at I think the
underlying issue for them was that they
could have done it so easily right um
they they bring up the fact that like
there were no like safeguards within
like the VR system once they broke into
the computer right if if somebody like
hacked my computer they wouldn't be able
to get my passwords from like a password
manager cuz it's still encrypted they're
like even though the computer itself is
compromised there's like several factors
of like sensitive data that like they
still wouldn't be able to get that was
their issue of this with like all like
the VR software that was like super
simple to get right into it it didn't
have its own yeah hunter is asking do
you think with emerging technologies and
equipment in places like hospitals or
banks they should seriously think about
multiple security flaws that could come
and now let's go ahead and apply this to
we were talking about virtual reality
let's take a very small pivot over to
augmented reality
yeah and how that's being implemented in
different healthcare technologies could
that be possibly at risk I mean the the
ideal example I always get with
augmented reality is in surgery
basically like you see a digital map
overlaid on top of the body it sort of
gives you instructions on where to make
the incision or you just get data right
you get like vital information on the
upper left corner as you as you're doing
the operation you can easily hack that
so the digital information is completely
different right like I don't know I mean
theoretically patients you know the
patient could be dead and like the wife
vital signs are still going or you know
give you the wrong information in terms
of where to make the incision these are
all theoretical risks I don't know if
it's all possible I don't know how
susceptible a our systems are to hacks
but that's kind of the nightmare
scenario that people would present when
I think of emerging technologies for you
know hospitals universities and banks
any kind of business really I mostly
think about the like many Internet of
Things devices that they're putting in
like hospitals and all these like places
now that are really susceptible to write
attacks and you know the I mean they can
get it like fresh and like brand-new and
if they don't patch it within like you
know six months or anything like that
I'm sure there's some vulnerability
that's like available for it and that's
the like issue is that like when you get
these like shiny new gadgets when you
get them at scale when you get like I
don't know let's say you're like a 15
floor like hospital with like 600 rooms
or something like let's talk about
connected bedpans yeah sure
and then so that's like what like six
hundred different bedpans what you're
gonna collect all of them and then like
update them all at the same time and all
this stuff that's like one aspect of it
that that like is really problematic and
that's like something that you interface
with like every day there's also other
issues with like even something small
wears like a smart thermostat like just
to like control like the temperature of
like your hospital if you're not
updating that regularly and that's like
one thing think about all the new tech
that like a hospital would be getting
like that
to me is like the bigger issue right
yeah strange ROI points out the
potential for a really cruel joke that
someone could play VR for the elderly
and those with dementia and other
similar issues what if they get hacked
and somebody tries to employ a horrible
jump-scares yeah that was actually one
of the examples that they pointed out
when I was speaking with them there
there was another scenario where you can
put ransomware into like the VR games
itself basically like instead of the
game that you want it to play it's like
just something like screen that they
show and they're like hey you've been
hacked send your money like here if you
like want to play your games on VR ever
Wolff Wow that is scary stuff when you
really get down to it even though we
kind of dismissed it in the beginning
however a lot of people in the chat are
more curious about what is a more
imminent threat and let's pivot over to
t-mobile Alex Mitchell is asking can you
explain a little more on the t-mobile
thing I have a t-mobile phone and I get
fake calls all the time the end after
just a few seconds I get that - that's
different though that's a completely
different thing and really this is a
problem if you live in a more rural area
where t-mobile's coverage has
traditionally been weak to non-existent
the idea again is these are these are
fake ring or dial tones that get
injected into the call so when you call
instead of it going dead or going quiet
you'll hear a ringtone you'll think oh
someone's gonna answer and the known
does and it was just just this just a
mask from t-mobile to make you think
like oh we're trying yeah it's more
again it was more about yeah the
creating perception and to be fair they
say that this was some sort of
inadvertent thing and they stopped doing
this
in January of last year it's just taken
a while for the settlement to be reached
Charlotte you know for them yeah I guess
the idea is if you hear the ringtone
you're not automatically assuming Oh two
mobiles coverage is terrible just the
other person is not picking up so it
definitely is about helping their
reputation so than passing the book kind
of yeah scapegoating and in terms of the
the to the question about sort of fake
calls I mean those are those are bad
calls like I would never I know you and
I work in fields where we kind of have
to take every call mm-hmm
but if you don't recognize a number you
should definitely not pick those two
calls up if you don't have to it's not
part of your job we need you
a lot of random callers coming in if
it's worthwhile they'll leave a
voicemail exactly and they never did
like these these random robot callers or
they're just basically testing to see if
the the line is someone worth picking up
I do make it a mission though at one day
I want to get all the way through and
pick up one of those robot calls and get
the human at the other side because
eventually they're done I've done that
yeah but I have a real artsy way of
threatening them and I'm not going to
reiterate my quote here because it's
definitely not safe for work but I
definitely made somebody cry one time I
would just I would just say that that
may not be worth your time because it
takes it is satisfying though to just
destroy someone really inconvenient
experiences they like to hang up the
moment they like notice that like you're
upset cuz they're not actually trying to
get like your info no that's why you got
to play along oh you want to speak to me
I love a free ship that's a lot of
effort yeah dude
so I love when they're gonna hang up
right when your spiel starts I want Ryan
to regret their life decisions that's
all I'm saying you know if they're doing
that pretty rough yeah yeah you're right
or just they don't care that's true from
Jay Brown how do they know that the call
did not connect and is this happening
with other phone companies so like I
said Verizon has settled a similar issue
back in 2015 so they they did do the
same thing it's hard to tell that's the
thing like I'm not entirely sure how the
FCC like managed to really uncover this
but you know one tip-off is if like it
just keeps ringing constantly then maybe
that's not a legit ringtone right if it
doesn't go to voicemail it just sort of
keeps ringing indefinitely maybe that's
just the system putting in you know a
fake ringtone in place or maybe no one
wants to talk to you storm king why not
admit that there was a problem and then
announce a solution that would make
t-mobile look proactive instead of
reactive isn't that the question would
you make a mature calculated part part
of the issue and the other part of the
settlement wasn't just about the thick
ringtones there's also the fact that
they had terrible terrible service in
rural areas and they were told to clean
things up to fix things and they just
did get around to it
yeah they just polished their
pretty much I didn't even polish their
turd though they just injected it with
little bits of like stale candy
I think this analogy is cut off the
rails I'm trying here I'm not a writer
let's turn over to Apple News Alex
Mitchell says this is the true test for
Apple could they sell dirt to a farmer
people don't pay for news anymore though
we've seen an actual statistical uptick
right near Times The Washington Post
Wall Street Journal CNN magazine
they've all successfully implemented
paywalls not seeing a magazine because
it's a physical magazine no people pay
for it people do pay for and subscribe
to it people do subscribe to news
quality news I think that's the issue
and these the idea here is my guess is
you're taking the best articles from
various magazines and you're basically
you're it's a free-for-all you pay you
know a lump sum or a flat rate every
month and you get access to all these
articles that you may not necessarily
have read because they were on the
newsstands and not necessarily so here
out of five for news here's a question
though Alfred oh yes how is Apple going
to actually curate this that's a good
question baby well you know what they do
that now I mean there is an Apple news
section for iPhone users if you just
swipe left or right left swipe left
there there's a curated Apple news
section people use it all the time in
terms of who actually curates I'm not
entirely sure I have staffing do it
though but ultimately in the in the age
of fake news how long until some
controversy somebody slips their crap
source through the the border and gets
filtered into there and then a my
difference is that they actually have
like human moderators from where I stand
there are there are folks you interact
with like as a publisher I think we
interact with people people at Apple
news that that will highlight some of
our stories we've had my Star Trek
discovery profile from last year was
like I was a marquee story on the Apple
news one day mmm it's because we worked
specifically with someone it's not a
program got it got it got it I would
worry just about something like an app
store kind of situation where it's for
sure I mean if it's algorithm based
yeah absolutely but I think the idea if
you're picking out and this is all
theoretical we're not sure the surface
is launch is gonna launch but if they're
picking the best of us you're looking
for quality you need to have human
curators I agree I agree 100% because it
keeps me employed hunter Mons on Apple
news at $10 a month i could see older
generation subscribing now I think that
I mean he's not wrong but I think
there's definitely more interest in it
because people do want to be able to
trust their sources again
yeah I've at my home we've subscribed to
texture for a while it's a shame that
they seem to be cleaning house there but
ultimately it's proven to be a good
service here's hoping the apple doesn't
screw again like I said no time to the
Washington Post's all seeing an uptick
in subscriptions there are people who
are willing to pay for a trusted source
of information but do you think that
they see this uptick in subscriptions
though because it's like we want to
support quality journalism and then
we're gonna you know directly contribute
to like the New York Times or The
Washington Post whereas this model would
be more so like we want to make money
yeah we're kind of giving it to like
Apple that's a great question I mean you
can make that argument for music as well
music has generally been you can get for
free yeah but like the difference with
like so
Spotify like I want to listen to
everything and I'm willing to pay for
that but if I want to support like a
specific artist there's different ways
for me to do it like I can go to a
concert I can write buy merchandise I
don't really think that there's like a
similar that's a thing Apple music has
been successful no no but my point with
like journalism though something there's
like a specific like outside way for me
to like specifically support like the
Washington Post or something oh I gotta
go to like a Washington Post concert
right right right and so for you like if
you wanted to show support for that's
yes if equality journalism you pay for
watching yeah yeah back that's the
counter-argument that's the thing we
don't really know it's but it's not just
the New York Times a washer there are
plenty of other quality publications out
there with their own I don't know fan
bases that may be willing to pay but
it's look this is all up in the air it's
a lobbyist Theoretical we're not sure if
the service is even launching yet
but it's sort of an interesting idea
that Apple would want to get into this
business yeah Josh Boyd is asking would
it be the same for everyone will an
algorithm try to tailor it just for me
it's not as we said very much algorithm
based but it's from my experience
texture was an opt-in scenario so you
picked and choose exactly what you
thought you wanted to read and I'm sure
there's some aspect of it yeah yeah
they'll try to suggest but it's probably
sheet unless you subscribe to seen that
they'll be like maybe you like
TechCrunch no no kidding it's not like
on Facebook where it's like I subscribe
to CBS news plug and Facebook goes maybe
oh like Joe's news and it's some guy in
the base I like Joe he's cool this
basement is very nice yeah let's take
one more James H aren't there any other
services for magazines besides texture
no there are I don't know them off to
your local library is a great source for
free magazines you know I'm saying like
online yeah I I recently started using
it I've been like so my girlfriend
girlfriend has a subscription to like
New York magazine and she like gets it
every week
oh there's a new magazine I just like
pull it up on the apps like cool keep
the whole issue yep oh wow and it's free
freeze nice yeah you kept mentioning how
it would try to tailor articles specific
articles is that something that has been
outright said cousin Mike I thought it
was all just issue to issue could just
they still publish them as magazine it
could be issued issue I only flow the
idea of article by article because Apple
News curates it that way they don't
acetic urate by publication it's like
that's an RSS feed kind of but it's it's
curated right yeah basically here's the
best of the best from various
publications sure I just wonder are they
gonna try to merge those two things
together could be I don't know maybe it
could be you have two options have you
have you used Apple News I mean yeah
I've liked yeah I've like skimmed it
every now and then but like I don't I'll
be honest I only do it when my I don't
use it regularly but I always hear like
really good things about it like a
friend had like quit Twitter for Apple
news oh wow like she said she gets all
their news from similar to Flipboard
right I don't know I don't use that
either ever no wow I mean in the early
days of the smart
I used Flipboard a lot more like I don't
use as much now but it's it's the same
deal it's like curated based it's
specific articles taken from various
publications oftentimes publications you
say you like mm-hmm but obviously it's
more online stuff hmm so there are some
options we're trying here footboards not
and flip or straight
oh is it yes that's great interested to
see if anybody else out there would be
potentially on board with signing up for
some subscription-based news type this
seems like the right time for them to be
trying to pull this off who do you think
they're gonna try to market this to but
could this be a great opportunity for
Apple to kind of expand outside of their
little cult could be although it's not a
little it's a pretty big one all right
fine I mean it's the same folks or
subscribing Apple music right yeah I
mean there are options before why won't
the subscribing to Spotify so okay yeah
by that by that logic you know brand
loyalty okay same words now I mean they
rely on that but the goal with any
business is to try to grow and this I
think is a better opportunity for them
then anything else they're doing right
now
potentially well that's thoughts sure
we'll go fine all right we are out of
time for the day unfortunately we are
not gonna have any more live shows for
the rest of this week sorry everybody
it's my fault I have to do some
traveling but we will be back next
Tuesday that is the 22nd we will still
have the audio podcasts assuming Ben
knows we'll find oh you can still catch
us in iTunes but yeah so if you like
things you saw hurt here chicken sounds
CNET like I said iTunes tune and
stitcher feedburner Google Play Music
and the Amazon echo will be there the
next few days and then we'll be back on
Tuesday with our video take care
everybody we'll see you next week</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
