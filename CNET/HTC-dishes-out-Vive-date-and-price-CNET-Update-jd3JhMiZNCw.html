eight I'm Jeff Bakalar filling in for
Bridget Carey this is your cnet update
2016 is officially the year of VR well
at least if you want to buy one HTC has
announced the release date and pricing
details of the vibe that's the company's
VR headset that also uses a front-facing
camera now the vibe is going to go for
eight hundred dollars and pre-orders are
going to start on februari 29th that
price is two hundred dollars more than
the oculus rift which is actually pushed
back its current pre-orders to around
july of course it's worth noting that if
you do want to use the oculus or the
vibe you're going to need a pretty hefty
computer to run them that's likely going
to cost you around a thousand dollars
there's plenty more VR news coming out
of Mobile World Congress so be sure to
check out all of our coverage at cnet
com Bill Gates says he's disappointed
and how reports have claimed he's siding
with the FBI and its ongoing controversy
with apple / unlocking one of the San
Bernardino terrorists iPhones gates told
Bloomberg quote that doesn't state my
view on this he goes on to say that with
the right safeguards in place there are
cases where the government should be
allowed to access private information on
the current topic of the FBI vs apple
gate says he'll let the courts decide
hot off the heels of the company's
announcements at Mobile World Congress
Samsung has opened up a flagship store
right here in new york city called
samsung 837 that number just being the
street address where it's located it's a
pretty cool setup showcasing most of the
company's new products like the galaxy
s7 and the s7 edge and there's also
other exhibits like a VR tunnel and in
our gallery our editors were there this
morning and report there's plenty to see
and do there except you can't actually
buy anything that's right this isn't a
store it's just a place to see and play
around with Samsung stuff and finally
believe it or not the next great leap in
mobile internet speeds 5g is already
being
did verizon invited our own roger cheng
to experience a demo of the technology
where he saw speeds up to 3.7 seven
gigabits per second yeah that's around
three hundred and seventy-seven times
faster than what we're used to right now
with 4G but don't think about ditching
your current 4g phone just yet because
5g likely won't be a reality until
around 2020 that's it for this tech news
update for everything else head on over

York on Jeff back alone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
