been able to bring them together and
have them enjoy the Olympic experience

have them enjoy the build-up and then
you know hopefully afterwards enjoy the
you know the bring down after the other
bigs and show them that it's not just in
two weeks and show them that it's
there's more to it than that and also at
the same time bring them to places that
they can't can't go we're doing closed
closed circuit things on skype where
we're for 20 or 30 minute period of
doing q and A's with with these
classrooms from the Olympic Village

kid there was no way that was possible
so for me to be able to bring that to
these kids and have that you know come
full circle to go from going to
classrooms before speaking to speaking
to kids and then not being able to have
the technology to run in myself and have
them you know have the platform right
off my right off my MacBook and to be
able to to give that experience to kids
