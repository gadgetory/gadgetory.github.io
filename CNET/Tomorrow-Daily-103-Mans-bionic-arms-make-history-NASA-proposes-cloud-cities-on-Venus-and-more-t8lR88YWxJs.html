history with two new Bionic arms NASA
proposes cloud cities and airships on
Venus that's the purpose re just keep
going okay and a Japanese company is
working on animating all those cool
statues that you see it like comic book
shops oh I love this episode already yes
it's tomorrow daily
greenies synthesis in the internet
welcome to tomorrow daily the best geek
talk show in the universe I'm your host
Ashley scale economies always my
right-hand man literally to my right
kill Thomas it's good um this this
actually I think you're right in that
this might be one of my favorite
episodes all year because it because of
the stories there's some pretty good
stories in here I can't wait so we have
we have stories that will will lift your
will warm your heart heartwarming we
have stories that are like so crazy and
awesome that they can't possibly be real
but they are and then we have stuff
that's just like whoa I really hope that
shows up in my house sometime soon right
and we'll get to them in about forty six
minutes no in about four seconds here's
the headlines okay thanks for taking
that away from me you know I don't make
anybody way fellas really burying the
lead here 46 minutes all right what do
you got two shows from now okay so this
is gonna be the story of a man named les
bow I'm gonna call him bow its ba ugh so
I think it's bow bow bow now i'm gonna
say bow um less lost both of his arms in
a freak electrical accident 40 years ago
okay so there he is and he is now
officially the very first amputee in the
world to wear and control two Bionic
arms at the same time using just his
thoughts using his thoughts yeah this is
this is literally what I probably one of
my favorite stories of the year a
hundred percent it came in at the last
minute in December definitely one of my
favorites so his arms his Bionic arms
are from John Hopkins Applied Physics
Laboratory and he had to actually have
surgery that literally reassigned his
nerves so he could use these arms oh wow
this has been a while in the making oh
yeah this is like it took he had to go
through a lot of different processes but
there he is using two Bionic arms at the
same time using his thoughts so uh after
he got that surgery done to reassign his
nerves to these arms like to use these
arms he had to then trained to use the
arms through a bunch of different
tutorials including one that was
actually a virtual reality version of
his arm of these having these arms and
so then there is a custom
did socket that fits onto his upper
torso which is what you're seeing in
between the two that's it's sort of like
a chess piece that allows him to kind of
where it almost like a jacket but they
put it on his torso so that it sets the
arms in place and those are his arms
like and this is the amazing do can you
pick stuff up like I mean has he done
this is ok so that is the most
appropriate question you could possibly
ask this is the crazy thing within 10
days he was able to move objects from
one place to another so this right here
is a process that I think they said took
took over eight different functions that
is normally taking one cup and putting
it on a different shelf a higher up
shelf is it comes very difficult task
for people with prosthetics and the fact
that he was able to learn to do that in
just 10 days is remarkable Wow and they
were really excited about how quickly
and easily he's been able to sort of
pick up the use of these arms and the
unless himself was quoted as saying
maybe for once I'll be able to put
change in the pop machine and get pop
out of it oh it's a good just like this
would show a man yeah like he's just
that's like a really exciting Bank rusty
the whole time nobody incredible super
major what kind of I mean maybe we don't
have that information but like what kind
of strength is in the arms I mean like
what are they capable of like the
dexterity like that how does it they're
very they're extremely capable I don't
have like super specific detail there's
if you go over to our show links there's
it's a huge article it has lots of
details you can check it out watching
the video just in and of itself is
extremely inspirational but they're
extremely dexterous he's able obviously
you saw him grabbing a ball and dropping
it into a bowl and that's all done
without the use of any remote controls
it's just him thinking about it that's
crazy it's pretty great just him
thinking about it it's amazing it's a
little really amazing it I saw the
picture today and it was like seeing a
guy with two Bionic arms in use what
blew my mind because it was just like
I'm looking at like the future this is
the future it was just such a it was
such a tremendous feeling so I can't
even imagine
what all the researchers and scientists
and unless himself feels like having
such a such an accomplishment happen and
now he they're saying the next step
would be for him to take these arms home
and you know do his day-to-day
activities with them so we'll see way to
go science and technology yeah pretty
good high five science and this one this
next story speaking of science yeah is
high five is what sounds like a wacky
like idea from somebody that's not a
NASA and it's actually coming from NASA
and that is that I bet it make sense
NASA thinks we should live in in the
clouds more specifically the clouds of
Venus get me my lando calrissian Kate
yeah this computer Cloud City feel is
getting better all the time so basically
you know let the plan was initially like
oh well we're gonna live we're gonna
live on Mars well yeah let's all go to
Mars well let's keep in mind that Mars
has 40 times the radiation of Earth
right well Venus Venus itself isn't any
better that it's got 92 different
atmospheres and pressures and
temperatures and it's around 500 degrees
Celsius so not exactly the best place in
the world to lay it seems really hot on
the surface i think that's that is the
level of heat that can melt lid yeah so
not another fun place to look at however
a couple of guys working at NASA's
system analysis and concepts Directorate
at Langley Research Center that's a
mouthful yes have have pointed out that
if we live just above the clouds of
Venus it's it has just the same amount
of radiation as it does have you lived
in Canada oh yeah it's like pretty
similar kind of not obviously it's not
the same but it's a little bit less
dangerous yes and there's Ani there's
only one atmosphere of pressure and a
slightly lower gravity than Earth how
high up is this so surface of Venus 500
kilometers 500 or 50 sorry Finn if you
use okay 50 50 kilometers okay it's not
bad at all so all these things are
making it sound less and less crazy yeah
um so yeah here's here's the phases so
this is this is okay ethically if it
happened actually you're the bases here
we go got a plan uh there are solar
powered airships okay so we'd have the
airships check them out okay so the
first phase robot explores the upper
atmosphere so weird
exploration send a robot in like
curiosity check it out it's like
everyone's gone number Q crewed mission
orbits for a month okay so we send
somebody sense turkey club from open it
out spying yeah like check things out
ahead stocking number three crewed
mission ghost the atmosphere for a month
okay checking it out like really getting
in the end of the soup number four
crewed mission stays in the atmosphere
for a year look at this look at this
airship inflating in the sky this is
like how they would do I think they said
instead of edl owl standing for landing
this would be EDI which eyes inflation
you can see the solar panels on it too
so it's amazing all solar-powered that's
came at number five permanent human
presence could you imagine living in an
air in a blimp in on Venus awesome I'm a
Venusian i live on Venus but like i
would say i would like to say that these
scientists have their heads in the
clouds get out hahaha just go it felt so
good I bet you've been waiting all day
to say that I'm sorry I just can't with
it I'm I'm almost offended but I'm also
impressed but anyway so yeah that's a
it's from NASA that is not intense it's
not from my Uncle Louie that lives in a
cabin up in the woods now it's great
actually for some time ya know this is
this is this is really cool so so I mean
I'm sure like nobody's really thought
about let me ask you would you I don't
know there's that the T the day now
would you rather I know your answer
would you rather live on Mars uh-huh or
would you rather live in the clouds and
Venus oh my gods on via that's the
hardest person a living in the class
because here's the thing i believe i
read that if at some point if astronauts
were ever to settle on Mars we would
have to be underground because of the
radiation on the surface that's terribly
Asian exposure so as far as a right and
then the other thing is that i read and
i think that was part of this story um
was that the trip to Venus actually much
shorter than the trip to because of the
or below they were saying something
along the lines of like a trip to Mars
would be like 50 500 plus days like it
this would be a pretty lengthy
you commitments but they were saying
that if you did a 30 day trip I think it
was like 110 days to get there and then
another and then depending on or 30 days
to get there and 110 to get back or
somebody is a very much much shorter
amount of time to get there and back
based on the orbiting schedule of Venus
and then they also said that they
measure days you can't really measure a
day on Venus because a year on Venus
actually shorter or is actually shorter
than a day because Venus rotates so
slowly you say wait what say that again
so a day on Venus is longer than a year
on Venus like isn't that weird he's
super weird so anyway stellar stubborn
facts oh I'd like to i'd also like to
point out that the the Jetsons lived in
the clouds and they live just and they
seemed like they were doing a robot
Butler's I'm sure they had the look
there's my house I'm buying that one on
the left that's that's me there you go
there's your Cloud City right there
cheaper than I don't know like la it
songs Aang it's probably cheaper than
living in Los Angeles downside you're
afraid of heights maybe not a fun time
you're gonna have a bad time maybe you
don't dive out all right um ok so that's
the second cool story what's the third
cool stone it just keeps getting better
um one of the things that I've kind of
always wished for is you know you go to
the comic book shop and you see these
like amazing maquettes where they're
these statues of like your favorite
characters and I have a bunch of them at
the house like North I am sister yeah I
did too ah we're all nerds here guys
word we're all nerds um but I always
wanted like I always wish like man I
wish they could like move like I wish
she could have them move like not come
to life like toy story cuz I'm not two
years old just about three years old but
like it just in my heart I'm three years
old um but yeah like I always thought it
would be cool to be able to you know
either move them or pose them well this
company species speed species I'm
assuming its species there in Japan and
it was founded by a guy who worked on
the robot dog I Bo you remember the
robot dog hi Bo yes yeah robot dog maybe
if you saw it you'd probably member it
so they're hoping to kind of do exactly
that's we have this amazing video so
here they are this is what's called a
motion figure system so imagine over the
top of this the skin of like your
favorite character ho ok so there are 25
centimeters tall whoa they have 20
joints of them connected by
yeah he's cute connected by wires and
then the wires feed into the box
underneath that has motors Bluetooth
Wi-Fi speakers and sensors so here's the
thing the species is hoping that the
software that they would include would
prompt people to do things like develop
their favorite characters and give them
poses to make like so Zelda like this I
see you have a Zelda when you these
different poses for Zelda or greet you
when you walk past it like you could sit
down or even like read your e-mails back
to you like if you sat at your desk if
it's a like here's all your emails blah
blah blah so they want to bring this
system to market but it's not going to
be cheap they're saying it's gonna cost
between 500 and thousand bucks per
figure marvel pay attention but but
seriously anybody who's a real high-end
collector I'm sure would love to have
their favorite character that you could
program like multiple poses into and
have it animated everybody if Marvel
took this up shut up and take our mind
everyone would do everyone would get one
of those yeah imagine if like spider-man
like you come home after a long day
throw your keys down hey spider-man hey
kale what are we doing tonight same
thing we're just gonna watch TV awesome
cool I'm your friendly neighborhood
spider-man and then he poses yeah the
thing is that you you're right like you
know like spider-man has all these
different poses and you can move the
pose like the feet and so I me it's like
so it's perfectly it's enough
articulation to make it look cool but
not so much that it gets really bogged
down and like this like super technical
like oh it's got you know a hundred and
fifty points of articulation no its
twenty which is enough for a figure I
just think it's awesome why why would
you say it's so expensive what does I
mean that we already have like toys that
do kind of move a little bit true well
we have action figures that have just
plastic points of articulation a full
wire system that you'd be able to build
characters on top of and then on top of
that you've got underneath it all these
sensors Bluetooth Wi-Fi connectivity
like it's all that as well so it's the
box underneath the actual doll or the
figure is filled with technology so
they're hoping that they would be able
to develop a software that would allow
people to like create their own you know
carrot but not create their own
characters that create their own um you
know like scripts for like hey
kill thank you tell us right right he
said I wanted to say hey kale blah blah
blah yeah i'll give it two years i say
two years and then we're gonna do it
like i got really excited when I which
is art that's actually a hash well
that's our hashtag of the day like a
hashtag TT stay here and we want to know
what character would you want an
animated statue of and what tasks or
poses would it do I feel like I'd want
Sailor Moon like just the hair moving
around oh that's really good I remain
I'd want bill paxton I want it I want to
bill pay i do want bill paxton i come in
on like no after a long day kill how was
your day I was crappy mine was fine i'm
bill paxton i'm a good yeah no I likes
it like it's just so weird something not
particularly extraordinary so bizarre
they'll be fun and then he talks about
like being in twister Jenny only text
it's not like me it's like all the
movies he's been and he's like a young
one time when I was on the set of
twister yeah in Helen Hunt had lunch
together and me and cheese sandwiches
bill had a terrible day well when life
gives you lemons twister get in a dude
wisdom follow a tornado no I like the
idea of it being almost a companion that
seems like where our minds are going I
like articulation is fun for like we're
a different with the Bluetooth wanted to
screech at the Bluetooth and the Wi-Fi
like imagine if you could get your
messages through it like if somebody
text you or something like that and then
they can get the voice right you have
spider-man read you the why do I keep
going to spider-man thank you you're
spider-man he's no friend yeah we're
built axon read it alright worgen I'm
breaking up with you all night I got a
text from my girlfriend on that bill
paxton note on that sad sad bill paxton
oh we're gonna take a quick break we'll
be right back with into it and your user
feedback on our photog refer the day so
click away tomorrow daily
welcome back from the show I know it it
only felt like 30 seconds it really it
was a lifetime it's like interstellar
hey guys did you joke spoiler some
people haven't seen it well not just you
know we got close sort of the
singularity and you could have said
inception where it's the lower level of
inception yeah we're seven years ago way
Christopher Nolan until they're all like
they're all connected I think they all
happen in the same universe oh do they
I'm just gonna be very scary scary
universe weird bizarre universe um okay
so uh it's Thursday which means it means
we're done wait no not yet we got to
tell everybody what we're into its into
it um I want to go first just because I
don't want anybody to even pay attention
to what you're gonna say because once
every this they're just everyone's gonna
shut this show off immediately and just
run off to the to the website of steam
because the steam holiday sale started
today and that's what I'm into I know
bye I even kill his off I mean but
here's the thing uh really awesome
people like yours truly mm-hmm have
already gone online to the steam sale
and bought games I think last year I
bought 12 or 15 to 15 games like a
ridiculous amount of games for less than
one hundred dollars so it's always
really good deals like you see anything
right now are you are you super yeah
meadow get me Metal Gear uh ground
zeroes is on sale ya know big metal gear
fan rocks not answer it stated see it a
caveman I are there okay no wait here we
go sid meier's civilization beyond Earth
okay why that I always use the steam
holiday sale to buy like indie games
like I love buying a pile of indie games
that I've been thinking about our I've
read about over the you know course of
the year I wasn't like buying a whole
bunch of any games and then I just spend
all your kind of catching up and playing
them so it's I mean this team holiday so
is what it's all about guys right yes
that's what I'm saying and fun fact
thirty-one percent of the game
that we buy on steam we don't play no
that's actually that's a hundred percent
accurate in terms of my account like
there's still stuff I've never ever
opened that's an actual statistic by the
way yeah actual it was like a steam so
go give steam your money and then and
then don't use thirty percent of it ya
know is really hurting you guys you
gotta get it helps my probably euro
truck alright but it changes every day
the sales change every day they're even
having a thing now where it's like user
voted three games our user voted to go
into the steam holiday sale so like
they're gonna have starting tomorrow I
think it's the first one no they're
gonna have like these sort of people's
choice sale which is kind of nice okay
what are you into I'm into a little
thing called the black mirror so bright
mare is this show that show in the UK
it's basically the twilight zone but
addressing like issues nowadays Twilight
Zone was all about like addressing
social issues like challenging you know
like social concepts and like how would
you deal with the situation type thing
this takes that to the next level of
course it's gonna have to sensationalize
it even more to match what's on TV and
it also addresses sensationalism too so
let me let me put you this way the name
of the show is called Black Mirror
gotcha that that means it the meaning of
black mirror is your devices your cell
phone your computer screen your
television they're all black when
they're turned off but they're going
they're on their reflection of who we
are today catch so this is a twisting of
that taking all of those things and
showing what can and and might go wrong
with all of these all the creepy and
weird things that could possibly go
wrong so for instance my for my favorite
one is called the history of you in
which your memories are saved to like a
small hard drive that you wear and you
can re-watch them and you can show them
to other people so people become
obsessed with their memories and it
becomes like it's it's great you've got
to watch it that's I you can you just
watch watch the history of you and then
you know maybe I'll watch at this week
and also a holiday episode just came out
yesterday it had stars Jon Hamm and they
just premiered the
trailer for season 3 yesterday it's
coming out in May okay Thank You UK for
doing something that we should have done
a long time ago which is created I don't
like do that appropriation thing like
where they pick up a UK series and bring
it to the US like you know I need a
broad church it's the exact same show
please don't do that gracepoint and
broadchurch infuriate me because
broadchurch is literally it's a great
show it's an idiot weiners starring
David Tennant wait starring David
Tennant and then they were like let's
bring it to the United States and rename
it and have it start David 10 it's like
why oh that was still stars the same guy
it's so bizarre I only worked once and
it was the office and that doesn't even
technically count cuz it was a different
show yeah just watch black hair black
mirror okay good love the people from
the UK cuz they're making good stuff
alright I like this is I'm a huge
Twilight Zone fan huge Twilight Zone fan
this is modern a twilight it is modern a
twilight zone it's not like you're just
saying well it's kind of like the trial
is only like no Twilight somebody has
nails exactly and somebody asked me it
would rather certainly like this show
and I said absolutely well he would love
this if Rod Serling if you think Rod
Serling's would give it and ok then I
will watch it we've had that we have a
rod serling graphic that comes up
whenever I say that no we don't let's
talk about user feedback alright so
yesterday we asked you guys to tell us
whether or not you thought Netflix
should have an offline mode using the
hashtag TV now it's fighting time it is
um our very first our very first tweet
came from I'll abdul-rahman i think is
the right pronunciation I hope I got
that right he says let me have the
service first and then I'll complain
about Arabia Australia is getting it
like next month I think well played well
played we realize we often do not
consider the fact that things like
Netflix are not available in other
locations sorry alright Ricky wrote to
us and said I have two gigabytes of data
on verizon so offline Netflix would be
great now that's nice it's my good point
yeah glen road to us similarly and said
offline netflix wouldn't be necessary if
LTE plans were unloaded high speed
internet is saturated in my life yeah
yeah i agree but a lot of people are
watching these on the
Oh like I don't really watch Netflix
yeah you know I don't know unless I'm
waiting in a line for something like or
even then i'd like to absorb the outside
world a little bit yeah i'm from a
computer all the time that's true
anthony wrote i think netflix should let
users watch offline original content
that's only on next there you go see
that's the there's the correct answer
cuz then what people are gonna watch the
netflix originals yeah that's really
good on that is a very business-savvy
answer somebody at netflix needs to give
anthony a job yeah that's all life
congratulations Anna you just been hired
at Netflix yes according to us I don't
um and of course that brings us to our
very final piece of user feedback our
photog refer the day our phone talker
with the day they might frighten you a
little bit it sucks from Adele a and he
says no hey Ashley no don't touch your
microphone no don't leave I took this
picture using my iphone 5 back in
September when me and a friend of mine
we're talking about how small cameras
how small cameras have evolved in the
past years I saw this little spider on a
sidewalk and gave the phone a chance to
demonstrate my point although I've never
been good at taking photos my iphone did
not disappoint me and took this great
shot i hope you liked it loved the show
keep up the good work and ashley i hope
you get better soon misty last week
Adele from Dublin Ireland get get get up
no get up no I'm not is it off no it's
not up anymore it's all hot look there
you're you're you're literally your face
oh god you screamed right into the mic
and you just made people drive off the
road right now please don't drive off
the road please don't leasing spider out
the screen Oh God also I forget it's
really ugly looking to it's like a deal
it's it's a it's a spider and it's an
ugly spider riders are so good it's
funny expect because they have a lot of
lot more powers than I do know they can
they can they can make a web they can
jump way higher than I can you could
sneak and hide under stuff like they're
like literally a hundred they can run
faster than me a lot of the time well
that's cuz we're out of shape there's a
lot more of them than us too that's true
if the spiders ever decided to rise
humanity you ever see that movie from
the 1960s with the giant spiders that
were crushed in the building or Iraq
that's based on a true stalker yes just
like the blair witch project based on it
ice cream oh no don't start coughing
okay well thank thank you for that photo
you're my favorite user know it you're
absolutely Kayla's new favorite
officially because i am decree it so it
you're my new favorite that's rare now I
was a really nice picture I thought it
was great I like spiders so spiders are
helpful don't kill spiders guys unless
there are those really big ones that
live behind clocks like the one I got
you for Christmas and on that note if
