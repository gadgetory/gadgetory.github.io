das and joining me is Josh Lowensohn
senior writer for cnet Josh thanks for
being with us my pleasure we're gonna do
one of our favorite things today talk
about rumors forget that fact stuff
that's boring boring let's go through
the apple rumors because there are a lot
of them and we are nearing sort of that
time of the year when we're expecting
new phones and this is when the rumor
mill gets really hot fever pitch it is
so let's start with this low-cost
version of the iphone that we think is
going to come out yeah there's a lot of
good indications there's been leaked
cases there's been all sorts of mentions
of it one of them in a china labor
report which is kind of crazy night they
came out with this report basically from
one Apple suppliers saying they found
all these issues but the thing everybody
took away from it is that they said oh
they're making this cheaper iPhone too
it's like oh my god okay so that's what
they came out with but yeah they're
working on something that's that's a
little bit cheaper that they can sell
alongside the normal price iPhone and
this is specifically for countries like
China and India work a lot of the market
buys phones at full costs so something
like a six or seven hundred dollar
iPhone over there doesn't make a lot of
sense yeah I've heard my cousin's
complained who live in India about how
more how much more expensive it is to
buy an iPhone over there so this one
might cost somewhere in the range of do
we know I've heard three hundred dollars
$300 is a pretty good number right now
they're selling older models of the
iPhone like the four for about four
hundred dollars so this would come in
considerably less expensive and there's
another rumor that this low-cost version
won't have Siri yeah and I don't quite
buy this one and there's a good reason
for that they pretty much pushed out
Syrian to all their devices it's really
become a core part of iOS they're kind
of pushing some stuff into the future
for cars next year and to not have that
features really going to limit who would
want to buy this and for something so
simple it gives them a lot of data it
tells them a lot about the customers and
it ties into all these other services so
the fact that they would somehow remove
that at this point is very sketchy ok
the next rumor I wanted to talk to you
about Apple gives something potentially
this low-cost iPhone but they might take
something away the 4s Mike go bye-bye
yeah it's been kind of a thing that they
keep the last two models around so when
they came out with a five they had the
four in the
rest right it's kind of weird to keep
something like the forests around it
still uses the older 30 pin connector
and they moved everything else to
lightning I think if you're someone
looking to buy a new phone it's kind of
weird to think about that when you're
buying accessories like something for
your car maybe a music stand that still
uses the connectors instead of Bluetooth
and all sorts of cases I mean
everything's kind of pushing that
direction so it makes sense to get rid
of that of course that's the version
that I have then the high end of the
spectrum the 5s that we expect to come
out yeah the rumors have been very slim
on this one and I think that's because
it's kind of an exciting the big ones of
course are the usual things that come
along with the s model which is kind of
fastest interim so yeah a faster process
or a better camera maybe some improve
software features I mean it's really
kind of but not a radical change no and
I don't think that's what the ass has
ever been about it's just kind of been
about tightening things up and improving
things where they can and the potential
date September 10 yeah so this is
reported earlier by All Things D has
been you know very good source about
that stuff September tense a good time
they did the iphone 4s in October and
then last year is a similar data of
September 11 so it's a good time for
them to release something it comes out
right in time for the holidays and it
has plenty of time to ramp up and colors
this is a something that I find it hard
to believe that they're going to
introduce a champagne gold 5s but you
say it's gonna happen yeah and it's been
kind of unclear whether it's the 5s or
the 5c which is the cheaper model okay
hopefully if she doesn't see anything
for cheap that would not be a very
signature Apple no but I think there's
been a lot of push especially if you
look what Motorola is doing with the
Moto X where you can pick basically any
color you want for any part of the phone
there's a lot more pressure for them do
something besides white and black yeah
so iPads now let's talk about iPads what
rumors do we have there let's start with
the mini iPad first sure the big rumor
for the mini iPad which is a new screen
mm-hmm the retina screen of course that
ship with an older resolution one and
you can still kind of see the pixels so
there's been a lot of expectation the
analysts haven't really been sure if
that screens even ready yet it's kind of
high-tech
very cutting-edge stuff to get displayed
that small with that many pixels so
apparently they're ready with that and
that's something bloomberg reported
earlier this week there's also a report
of a larger slimmer iPad a full-size one
I think one of the reasons it wasn't
sessle in the last couple models is
because it needs a really big battery
yeah and a lot of the display
technologies better the processor
technology has gotten better things
don't take as much powers they usually
do so that's one of the reasons for the
thinness okay all right so the rumors
are going to keep coming we'll still
keep talking about them and then when
the date eventually happens we will
confirm or deny them absolutely Josh
