conference i'm here with osman Rashid is
the CEO of know which today introduced a
new tablet computer aimed at students
why you guys it's a fairly interesting
approach you guys have taken two large
screens and created something that's you
know bigger than two iPads put together
why is it so large why why would you
build something that big should II the
number one reason why we have chosen the
size of the screen so that it can fit
with the textbooks that students have
today so on a 10 on a 12 inch screen for
example only forty-seven percent of
textbooks weight whereas we needed a
14.1 inch screens two of them in order
for ninety-five percent of the books to
fit the number one problem etextbooks
have failed on laptops for the past ten
years is mainly because
laptop sighs it's not conducive to the
learning experience you have to ban top
and down left and right or zoom in to
look at the text and we wanted to
replicate what they have today in the
analog hole and bring it into the
digital format and this is built on
Linux but it's not the same kind of
Linux you would see on a netbook or
something else you guys have customized
it what did you guys do absolutely if
you've customized it mainly to create a
touch OS or a touch system on top of
Linux the whole idea was not to create
or recreate a mouse interface because a
finger is much bigger than a mouse and
we wanted to ensure that when a student
touches it they have no stress on the on
the touch part of the of the product and
we wanted to create a complete new
experience when it came to the book very
natural how to use the books today and
you guys have some of the big education
publishers lined up it's going to be
piloted in a few schools this fall and
then when can the average person order
one and get one yes we have pearson
education we have cengage learning
mcgraw-hill and widely as the top for
higher education publishers who are now
going to be participating in our beta
program and the idea behind the launch
of the product is that it will start
taking pre-orders in october november
timeframe and allow for shipping in time
for holidays now it's the size of two
iPads am I going to have to pay the cost
of two iPads to get one it's actually
more than decided to iPad our goal is to
keep the price well below a thousand
dollars and we hope to create a price
that people students will be able to
