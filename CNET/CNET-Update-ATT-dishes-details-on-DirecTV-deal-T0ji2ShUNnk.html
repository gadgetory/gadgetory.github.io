twitch tech companies are going shopping
I'm Bridget Carey and this is your CNN
updates as we watch more video
programming on the Internet the world of
telecom and television are emerging into
the same business so it doesn't come as
much of a surprise to hear that 18p
wants to buy satellite TV provider
DirecTV for the price of forty eight
point five billion dollars that means
AT&amp;amp;T is spending about three billion
more dollars than Comcast is spending to
buy Time Warner Cable it would take a
year for this deal to go through if it's
approved by regulators ATT does have its
own television service called u-verse
but that's limited to a few areas and
when you can't get u-verse ATT will sell
you a bundle that includes DirecTV so
these companies already have been
working together
installing u-verse fiber lines in more
areas is expensive for 18t but expanding
DIRECTV well that's much easier pretty
much anyone in the u.s. can get it by
popping a satellite dish on their home
xviii he is also changing up its prepaid
wireless business ATT recently purchased
the cricut brand of prepaid phone
service and to support cricut ATT is
killing the name of its other prepaid
service called ayo and now everything is
going to be under the name cricut google
has a few acquisitions of its own epic
quest visual which created the
translation app Word Lens if you point
your phone's camera at a sign that's in
another language word lens will show you
the translation in English or vice versa
it's one of the more useful apps for
Google glass but that's not all YouTube
which is owned by Google could be trying
to buy the game or video site twitch for
1 billion dollars that's according to a
report from variety but sources tell the
Wall Street Journal that the two
companies are still in early talks so
nothing's official yet twitch is a
popular website for video game fans to
stream their gameplay for others to
watch live in other video game news
a new system update the Xbox one it
offers a few fixes and new features like
better volume controls and to all the
gamers that watch update I need to set
the record straight on a mistake I made
in the last episode the new Halo game is
simply called halo 5 Guardians but I
said it was halo guardians of the galaxy
which was probably a result of me
subconsciously thinking about the new
trailer and poster for the Marvel movie
called guardians of the galaxy but
combining the space heroes with halo
would be a cool mashup
that's your tech news update you can

studios in New York I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
