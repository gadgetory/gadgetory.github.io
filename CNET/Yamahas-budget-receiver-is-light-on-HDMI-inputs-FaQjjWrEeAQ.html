and we're going to take a look at the
Yamaha rxv 473 this is a 5.1 AV receiver
with built-in airplay and it's currently
selling for three hundred and fifty
dollars now the design is pretty much
like any other AV receiver this is a big
full-size unit so you're gonna need
sizable shelf space to hold it the
included remote is about as confusing as
it gets with tons of tiny buttons and
confusing labels so you'll definitely
want to consider a universal remote if
you go with this receiver you can also
control it with Yamaha smartphone app
which is available for iOS and Android
and it has a much more straightforward
interface in the physical remote some AV
receivers have upgraded to fancy
graphical displays but the rxv for 73's
display looks pretty ancient it's kind
of bizarre to see this kind of blocky
text on a high-def TV especially since
the entire screen refreshes every time
you press a button now you're honestly
not going to see these setup menus that
much but you will get the same kind of
experience when you're using the
built-in airplay functionality around
back is the connectivity and there are
only four HDMI inputs which is pretty
skimpy when most receivers at this price
point include five or even six there's
an Ethernet port which you'll need to
connect for airplay smart phone control
and internet radio but there aren't any
additional streaming music services
built-in like Pandora or Spotify for
legacy devices there are also for
digital audio inputs including two
optical and two coaxial ports sound
quality only Yamaha is good although
it's not quite at the level of some of
our other favorite receivers we had
resident audiophile Steve Guttenberg
listen to the Yamaha and while he
generally liked the sound he liked
Yamaha step-up model and our reference
then on AVR 1912 a little more but this
is a much less expensive receiver so
that's not completely unexpected but
altogether the rxv 473 just doesn't
offer enough value when there are
competing receivers that offer more
connectivity and more features for the
same price
the Yamaha rxv 473 isn't a bad receiver
but you can find a better deal elsewhere
