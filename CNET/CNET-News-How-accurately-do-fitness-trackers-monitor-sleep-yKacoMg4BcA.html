steps and calories burned many provide
sleep stats but can you trust that data
we asked an expert at the Stanford
center for sleep sciences reason why
these devices are good is because it
puts greater emphasis on sleep most
adults in the US are actually somewhat
sleep-deprived but are they accurate the
devices offer relatively little data as
compared to the gold standard for
measuring sleep polysomnography
polysomnography is a collection of
different physiologic measures that we
use to define and characterize sleep we
start with EEG which are little
electrical wires that measure your brain
waves and it doesn't stop there
prepping a patient for polysomnography
takes close to an hour it also includes
measures like a snore mic that we in
your neck inside your nose and over your
nose in your mouth to kind of record
your breathing belts around your chest
and your abdomen that will also record
your breathing patients stay overnight
for these sophisticated sleep studies
which require a slew of equipment for
muscle monitors to EKG machines fitness
trackers on the other hand use
accelerometers they're not actually
measuring sleep they're measuring in an
indirect approximation of sleep through
movement in order to make these
estimations of deeper light sleep
they are probably using an algorithm
that takes into account the relative
amount of movement that a person is
having over the course of the night
fitness devices have another key flaw
they can't precisely measure sleep
latency the time it takes to fall asleep
both of them are really not very good at
telling how long you're awake in the
middle of the night and your your total
sleep time relative to the amount of the
time of year in bed still there's value
in paying more attention to your sleep
habits a lack of sleep can affect mood
ability to concentrate man more fitness
trackers motivate us to get our steps in
but they could help us get our Z's in -
