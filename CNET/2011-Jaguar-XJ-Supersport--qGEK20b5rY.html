looks like an elegantly balanced sedan
with lots of wood veneer Connolly hides
and even little funny picnic tables but
while the new XJ has most of that you'll
be too busy asking mats and XJ to notice
let's drive the 2011 Super Sport and
check the tap the new XJ has the new
Jaguar face of course four doors still
but a sloping coupe like rear aspect
they call this eggplant II color caviar
and it blends rather sneakily into the
always black c-pillar garnish part of
designer Ian Callum's controversial new
take on the hindquarters and speaking of
hindquarters our XJ moves
it's very decisively because it's the
Super Sport the top of the stack for
performance but we'll get to that
here's where we begin our first round of
the game hit or miss first thing you see
when you get in this jag is virtual
instrumentation on the center stack
you've got the latest edition of Jaguars
effort to try and make things very
virtual reduce the number of buttons but
not have so much damn animation going
back and forth blessedly now you can
turn off needless animation that used to
kill all kinds of valuable seconds while
you are interacting with it but the
system is still slow then they've got
needless burying that makes me nuts
to get to the seat heaters there are no
simple buttons you've got to first
enable the seat heater mode wait then go
to the virtual buttons for the seat
heater wait for them to take effect and
you've got seat zones for bottom and
back and top and that's all real nice
but again slow is the key word here if I
have media on the screen and I go to
adjust the temperature it takes a second
for it to react and even worse it pulls
a pop-up menu up there and that takes a
while for that to go away because it
doesn't know when I'm done looking at it
it's an interference I just don't need
that said this is a really well-designed
overall system in terms of how it's
bringing a lot of technology to bear in
one place you've got just about
everything you want in terms of the
media system you've got radio in this
car being am/fm and HD radio Sat radio
is serious on a Jaguar my music brings
up all your different sources and there
are quite a few here you've got a single
slot CD right here
rip that to the hard drive 30 gigabytes
you've got your iPod hooked up
interestingly with dual USB jacks one
for iPod another one for USB thumb
drives or so they're labeled now here's
my droid hooked up as a music player
because it has a 2 DP stereo bluetooth
on this guy the navigation system is one
of the better looking out there they've
done a really good job of rendering
Rhodes the typeface is on the streets
things of that nature are looking really
good at this point I like this about the
knavish you get closer to an event
something you've got to turn or make
sure in the right lane it takes over the
leftmost virtual gauge the fuel and
temperature and your music settings and
all that relatively low-grade stuff and
put some momentary very James Bond
Goldfinger Aston Martin ish little
window in there that tells you your next
event and then when you do that it takes
that away you go back to your gauge it's
cool now
on the instrument panel hit-and-miss I
think it's really cool that it's virtual
it allows it to prioritize things that
matter at the moment but that's the hit
the miss is those gauges look like a
graphic novel and I'm being generous
they look cartoony to be honest and they
don't fit the quality of the caliber and
the price of this car
I don't think and that needs to be
stepped up a little in terms of elegance
lots of ways to keep you from backing
into things with this car so when you go
into reverse you've got a backup camera
which gives you trajectory and gives you
distance markings and on top of that
you've also got sensors front and rear
to make sure you don't drive into things
the shifter by the way is this little
pop-up deal Jags been using for a while
Park reverse neutral Drive and sport
mode is right there with an additional
push and turn detent I love this check
out the jet nozzles here for the climate
control system first of all you've got a
rotator here for open or closed very
elegant nicely integrated and then the
gimbals they sit on are fabulous silky
but nice and stiff they'll stay exactly
where you put them infinite movement and
they're not grinding some other
economics in this car that are
interesting Jaguar has a thing called
Jags sense let's see it's here in the
glove box this looks like a button but
you just lay some skin on it you get a
little bit of contact and down comes the
glove box okay same thing goes on up
here for these dome lights you don't
push anything you just make contact with
them and the lights come on great little
touch in case you didn't notice here and
in here
that's a saucy color a purple they're
lighting this thing with
this is kind of a biggest Jaguar but not
in the second row it's not good god I
yeah I can't ride in the back
Oh got a nice climate system back here
while you're driving around with your
legs in your chin now you can also get
up rear seat entertainment media system
back here where you get dual eight inch
screens buried in the headrest a really
cool media controller that would be
inside the armrest here without that we
have just whoo
lots of that great purple fuzz and
luckily more of these nice silky little
nozzles I like those now a big part what
makes an SS and SS is the motor jag has
two supercharged 5-liter v8 s this is
the hotter of the two this guy puts out
510 horsepower 461 foot-pounds of torque
that gets this 4,300 pound car up to 60
in 4.7 seconds they claim I don't doubt
it
mileage is is you know it's the mpg
you're ok with when you can afford a car
like this 15:21 that means like 16
average real world
here's another stat you should know
about the world's chunky Ascar key you
see this thing I've got big hands
that's a big damn car key and the weight
I actually put it on a scale it's over 4
ounces this whole apparatus that's a
quarter of a pound why
Sir William Lyons always described
Jaguars being possessed of space pace
and grace aside from that back row of
seats which is the space farm
great pace and great grace this is one
of the cars that hits it just right in
my estimation of having a sporty capable
driving posture with an absolutely
luxurious ride no one else can get it
quite like this not even the Audi 80
which comes the closest the s8 this car
is the perfect blend of capable and
comfortable that's hard to do but of
course $410,000 it shouldn't be too hard
to do the power comes on like scalding
hot oil there's an ample home for this
car although this 6-speed automatic and
the way to the power tips in can get you
into some glitchy situations
now hit the dynamic drive mode button
down here and move that all turns red up
there the whole shift profile gets
different and that's the sweet spot it's
funny it's a lot of stagecraft I think
well when you put this thing in dynamic
mode you end up getting a inch back by
the seat belt
it sucks you up this is much to say you
better hang on for your life
okay a 2011 XJ Supersport basis at 110
grand at 3,000 more for a long wheelbase
l and if you ever plan to give me a ride
you better the only others CNET style
option to consider on this loaded model
is the rear seat entertainment rig for
$2,200
but since it'll be obsolete technology
before your first oil change just go
with a couple iPads</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
