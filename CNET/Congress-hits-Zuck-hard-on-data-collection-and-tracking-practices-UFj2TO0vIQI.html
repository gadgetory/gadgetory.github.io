Mark Zuckerberg
chairman and CEO of Facebook
incorporated here to testify before the
full Energy and Commerce Committee my
top priority has always been our social
mission of connecting people building
community and bringing the world closer
together advertisers and developers will
never take priority over that for as
long as I'm running Facebook facebook
now has evolved to a place where you are
tracking everyone and you are collecting
personal information on people who do
not even have Facebook accounts isn't
that right congresswoman I believe yes
you know congresswoman I I'm not sure
that I don't think that that's what
we're tracking Facebook also gathers
that data about where we travel isn't
that correct
congresswoman everyone has control over
how that works I'm going to get to that
but yes you are would you just
acknowledge it yes Facebook is that's
the business you're in gathering data
and aggregating that data congresswoman
I disagree with that characterization
the primary way that Facebook works is
that people choose to share data and
they share that Facebook gathers data
did you buy data from data brokers
outside of the platform correct
congressman we just announced two weeks
ago that we were going to stop
interacting with data brokers and even
though that's an industry norm with your
data included in the data sold to the
malicious third parties your personal
data yes it was as CEO you didn't know
some key facts you didn't know about
major court cases regarding your privacy
policies against your company you didn't
know that the FTC doesn't have finding
authority and that Facebook could not
have received fines for the 2011 consent
order you didn't know what a shadow
profile was you didn't know how many
apps you need to audit you did not know
how many other firms have been sold data
by dr. Kogan other than cam bridge
analytical and enoy acknowledge 'yes
even though you were asked that question
yesterday
yes we were all paying attention
yesterday you don't even know all the
kinds of information Facebook is
collecting from its own users I know
you're still reviewing but do you know
now whether there are other fourth
parties that had access to the data from
someone other than dr. Kogan or is this
something we're gonna find out in a
press release down the road
congresswoman as I've said a number of
times we're now going to investigate
every single app that had access to a
large amount of people's information in
the past before we lock down the
platform I do imagine that we will find
some apps that that we're either doing
something suspicious or misuse people's
data if we find them then we will ban
them from the platform take action to
make sure that they delete the data and
make sure that everyone involved is
informed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
