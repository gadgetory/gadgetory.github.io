streaming devices for years and in 2017
the company's new lineup looks better
than ever there's only one entirely new
product but it's a doozy the Roku
streaming stick plus delivers the
highest quality streaming video content
4k HDR for a rock-bottom price of just
70 bucks that's less than half of the
new Apple TV 4k for example and the same
price as Google's chromecast Ultra for
that price you get an incredible amount
of functionality packed into this tiny
convenient stick one of the coolest
extras is its included cable which
functions as a Wi-Fi boosting antenna if
your stick is in a place with poor
reception Roku says the antenna will
help the signal which is especially
important with 4k video also new this
year is a revamp remote it has voice
search built in so you can easily find
TV shows like this but the biggest
improvement is the ability to control
your TV volume and power buttons are
available on the remote and roku says
programming the clicker for your TV is a
cinch of course the new stick enjoys all
the stuff found in previous 4k Roku s--
including the industry's best selection
of 4k HDR palatable apps the 4k
spotlight app gets an update the
categorise available shows the movies
and even breaks out HDR separately from
standard 4k still no Netflix however
beyond the new stick Roku is updated all
of its streaming players of this year
the $30 Roku Express gets a new
processor that was super zippy in my
hands on preview and it seems like a big
improvement over its pokey predecessor
the $40 Roku Express plus is exactly the
same but aimed at older TVs with an
included analog cable the $50 Roku
streaming stick was my favorite
streaming product last year and the new
version adds that improved remote with
TV control and voice search at the top
of the line is the hundred dollar Roku
ultra as the same 4k streaming as the
new stick plus but an improver mode with
a headphone jack for private listening
and a remote finder it's very similar to
the 2016 version except there's no
optical output on the back anymore and
once again no Dolby vision Roku sticking
the standard HDR 10 for its 2017
streamers from what I've seen so far
Roku's new devices look like some of the
best streaming values ever check out
seen it in the near future for full
reviews</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
