Bluetooth portable speaker looks very
similar to the flip three but it's
actually a slightly bigger speaker
weighing in at one point one four pounds
or 0.14 pounds more than its predecessor
and is covered in a more durable fabric
with a tighter weave it's part of that
external design change the flip for gets
some changes on the inside including new
drivers and presumably a bigger battery
that delivers 12 hours of battery life
instead of the flip Three's 10 hours the
speaker is also now fully waterproof
instead of just splash proof like the
flip three the flip four can be sewed up
vertically or laid down horizontally and
comes with a removable lanyard that
allows you to hang the speaker from a
shower head or a branch outside
available in six colors it costs a
hundred dollars so how much better is
the flip four and how does it stack up
against the wireless mini Bluetooth
speaker competition at its price point
short answer the first question is that
it's actually a significant upgrade over
the flip three not only does it play a
little louder but it sounds better with
improved bass response and slightly
better clarity I compare this speaker to
Ultimate Ears a wonder boom which also
costs a hundred dollars the Wonder boom
is shorter and squatter and delivers
more bass it comes off as a bigger
speaker than the flip for however with
some tracks the flip four sounded more
natural particularly in the mid-range
and I preferred it sound when listening
to certain songs overall the one room
does come out on top for sound quality
that's a close race effort size and
price the flip four is a very good
performer and as such extras as a
built-in microphone so it works as a
speakerphone it's easily the best flip
yet I'm David karmic for cnet.com thanks
for watching
