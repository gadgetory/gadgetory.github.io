tired from hearing from us yeah I hope
not because here's a 359 podcast I'm BVG
it's episode 282 and oh my god are we
talking about Apple again yes new
startup company is it alright anyway
we just got through the big iPhone
announcement like the big offense
September of a shirt off new Apple TV
new Apple watch but the iPhones there
were three of them were easily the
biggest thing that was announced that
the show especially the iPhone it's not
the access that takes the 10 they say
I'm gonna keep getting tripped up oh
yeah they skipped the 9 because the
iPhone 7 8 9 oh god other way we've got
I had the wolf act are in the house how
this because this is a big deal
without further ado we're gonna get to
the podcast sending your questions and
comments we'll get to as many as we can
at the end of the show and let's get
moving and here we go for the recording
the podcast see in the chat 3 minutes
and 15 seconds 4 3 2 welcome to the 359
I'm Ben Fox Ruben I'm Alfred Aang and
with us today is friend of the show I as
the wolf Akhtar oh whoa
alright so we have three new iPhones the
iPhone 8 the iPhone 8 plus and the big
one the iPhone X no way that's an iPhone
10 sorry my mistake but the iPhone 10 is
probably the big one that we should
really talk about it starts at nine
hundred and ninety nine dollars is god
this new frameless display with an OLED
screen there are a lot of I think the
biggest reveal of this was face ID out
of everything you know because it has no
bezel on it now they don't have the home
button anymore and therefore no touch ID
yep
so your fingerprints are useless now no
but they're using an infrared sensor
another sensor on the front to basically
it'll connect like pinpoint like 30,000
dots on your face yeah and they also
have neural learning on it where it can
learn as like you you grow with it so
like as you get wrinkles on your face or
as you like grow beard or like put on
like glasses it's a
to learn past that what they talked
about those that if you have a twin it's
not that smart you have to tell the
difference between you two which is
interesting because I have identical
twins and if I did actually have the
money to get this phone I guess I would
try it on them now you can get two for
each of you can still put a pin on them
you don't have to I would imagine you
could probably use just a regular pin
code if you wanted as well but when it
showed off that design we've seen this
rumored for a long time with a big notch
on top but that seems to be explained by
two-faced ID because of the array of
different technologies that are in the
top instead of just being like here's
your earpiece
here's your front-facing camera they
have a lot of stuff going on in there
it's not like the essential phone with a
little yeah I'm very excited about how
the front-facing camera finally has
portrait mode now because now you'll be
able to see all these really high
quality selfies very important all right
but but here's the big question that I'd
really like to answer here is the iPhone
10 a big enough deal I mean like has it
has enough changed or are they just
playing catch-up to Samsung
I think the eight and the eight plus
were playing catch-up the Samsung I
think the ten actually does a lot to put
it you know slightly ahead of Samsung's
especially with the infrared sensors on
the front the AR capabilities that
they're doing with it and emoji come on
dude turn yourself into a poop that is
true they have animated emojis where you
can use face ID now that's only on the
ten because that's how important it I
think I think you know they're kind of
this being the tenth anniversary of the
iPhone they're comparing to that where
the iPhone really wasn't that hot when
it came out either but it kind of set
the ground for a lot of things of what
they want to see in the future that's
kind of how they introduced it as you
know this is the future of like smart
phones I think that's kind of what
they're going for with this with you
know more of a focus on front-facing
capabilities as opposed to the camera in
the back being like the the more
important shots and yeah with the high
cost of this phone it's gonna cost
people and the delay cuz this is not
coming out until November 3rd right guys
the other phones are gonna be on
September 22nd so the iPhone 8 iPhone 8
has 8 + excuse me are September 22nd but
this this high cost $9.99 as you
mentioned 1100 $49 for the 256 gigabyte
model good basically that's my rent
there's gonna be a bunch of people ready
for
want this device but there's a learning
curve to like we're sitting no home
button there's that you can use the
power button for Siri you've got a swipe
up which is different than using iOS
right now when you swipe up you get
control center so there seem to be a
little bit different usages for the
iPhone Tan excuse me some say Ted but
yeah it's I mean there is gonna be a bit
of learning to it but at the same time
there's been a lot of griping for Apple
watchers for years now that there really
hasn't been that much that's actually
changed in regard to the iPhone so I
guess we can at least say that they've
put a lot more emphasis into literally
changing the design quite a lot and
adding a lot more functionality into
this thing take a look at the design by
the way there's a huge 5.8 inch screen
versus the 5 v I think that's on the on
the plus so they have a much smaller
body much larger screen and that's
that's gonna get a lot of people just to
look at it at least and that's got it
has that unique well bezel and that that
that knotch
so people will know when they see it so
that's probably gonna turn heads still
yeah I guess that's gonna do it for us
for today there's also the new Apple TV
the new Apple watch but I guess maybe
we'll get to that stuff on another show
if you want to read more about these
stories check us out on CNET I'm Ben Fox
ribbon I'm Alfred hang my is actor
thanks for listening
so a d-does p4 and the chair asks the
elephant in the room what's gonna happen
with the iPhone 9 7 8 9 still have left
you already made that joke too it's
still bad so I don't think that they
really have to respond to it quite yet
because they're probably gonna have the
8 s and the 8 s plus next year maybe I
don't know what the hell they're gonna
call the 10 though maybe a lot of the
two lines we're like that's it they're
at premium version like the X is is only
gonna be in like Roman numerals right
you know they could always go backward
they just drop the number and call it
iPhone iPhone Pro they could do
something like that where they've renate
like retro named things like remember
iPad iPad air yes all iPad right but
they don't look like they're putting a
lot of work into branding it other than
that giant X which is strange they want
to
10 all their promo materials on there
totally agree they should have just
called it iPhone X and then allowed it
to have its own naming structure next
one things forward
yeah names are dumb phone x1 sounds kind
of awesome I mean granted we still need
to like look at and buy the iPhone I
mean it sounds like the Megaman naming
convention they probably just should
have just went with that where there's
normal Megaman then there's the Mega Man
X series yeah I mean but then and Mega
Man 7 half of it was terrible and we
talked a lot about naming conventions
yesterday I for one would like to say
that the new iPhone 10 does pack in a
lot of stuff that you know it's to me it
was a much more exciting phone than
obviously last year's phone and the year
before so bully for them for actually
developing something that was was
something a little bit more impressive
to look at I don't know if you guys
agree fully sharing I was staring at the
comparison chart and inside and all the
phones it pretty much all the same tech
- that front array on the iPhone 10
there's dual OS on the back of the 10
there's not a lot differentiate I would
think it may be a better process I'll
have a 12 megapixel camera you're right
about that they have the same processors
in there the a 11 Bionic so it's kind of
this curiosity of is there enough about
it that differentiates it to go I'm
gonna get the 10 over the 8 right plus
what exactly do you get with the yeah I
feel like the a wireless charge if you I
see eight was massive like afterthought
the moment they announced like all the
features on the 10 because it was just
the 8 feels like it should have just
been the 7's great it was an
afterthought while they were announcing
yeah Phil Schiller on stage was
literally snoozing through that thing
just trying to go through the motions to
get to the iPhone and now it's been he's
like guys I'm just gonna phone it in
just wait for it wait for me
even that's like certain like hey I went
up yeah even that's like more expensive
now it's like it's 99 based and that's
why I also feel like the iPhone 8 is
still an afterthought because if you're
already gonna shell out that kind of
money for a phone you might as well
like pay a little extra for the ice 300
more dollars though I agree with you to
a certain extent but that's still 300
more bucks which isn't which isn't a
little bit of money but yeah if you are
gonna the other problem that we didn't
mentioned it in the podcast is is that
all signs indicate that the iPhone 10 is
going to be severely limited even after
it comes out in November 3rd so good
luck trying to actually find this device
when it becomes available it might not
be until early next year or well into
next year before people you you really
start to see these screaming into the
mains now I've been wondering this and I
don't know how many people like had the
same thoughts that I did during the
Apple watch announcement is that I feel
like that's like the perfect device or
somebody that wants to declutter from
all the crap on social media and being
like connected all the time on Twitter
and Facebook and Instagram and all where
you really just want a device to stay
like in touch with people but you don't
want something to stare at all day how
so you've got like a like a computer on
your arm no but if I had that and I only
yeah but it doesn't have like a like an
Instagram app that I can use to scroll
around on or like a camera that I can
use to like constantly take photos all
day for snapchat how much is that thing
yeah that's that was the only that help
me back I was like a part of me was
consist seriously considering getting
that as like just like a primary like
device where like I'm not on social
media anymore all the time because I'm
already on it at work all the time yeah
to get people caught up in case you
didn't watch the Apple event the the big
change with the Apple watch series 3 is
that you've got cellular cellular
connectivity which means that you don't
have to have your phone tethered to it
anymore yeah so you can make phone calls
from it now you can get text messages
emails all that like when you're not
surfboarding yes I surf a lot so yeah
like man I really wish I could making a
phone call right now yeah the other
thing with the Apple TV was they added
4k HDR TV worst name possible Apple TV
4k so it's an Apple TVs for cases what's
the plural just does bi it's just I
don't know they could have come up with
a better name for that but I'm not here
to talk about it they're back
gaming skills I will say they were the
biggest I think surprise announcements
if you bought anything in HD on the
Apple TV or in iTunes you get a free
update or upgrade to the to the 4k
versions I thought that's it that's a
nice little thing of Budo do this that'd
be like a huge thing you do you need new
hardware though for the Apple TV 4k
stuff
yes and the 4k the Apple TV 4k is the
first Apple TV to offer 4k so you won't
be able to just go ahead and look at
that I don't know if you can see it on
your computer or your iPad or whatever
you're gonna have a higher res version
of it I'm not sure about that
questions are we finally taking
questions oh I already forgot waiting
for you waiting for me I couldn't get
you guys to shut up so much so many ways
you can get us to shut up okay for
example for what all right we're gonna
shout out to Watson who's become one of
our more recent regular listeners Watson
he wants your opinion on something just
sold my 7 plus and wishing I hadn't as
the 8 plus is inviting Rob kraid and the
ex is too expensive should I opt for
Apple watch and se for the same price
that was my plan you know I told you you
should do that I see you lose the
waterproof things of the 7 plus loss but
the watch is waterproof though oh good
point yeah think about that you don't
know that's a big step down from it's a
huge step a big plus screen to an SC
screen yeah cuz I've seriously been
thinking about doing this and here's the
thing like if you take photos a lot then
you know the kind of defeats the purpose
of having both both the watch and and a
phone you might as well just have the
phone only if I mean that's the thing
like if you're not like plugged in all
the time you're not taking a lot of
photos you're not like checking your
Facebook feed constantly and you kind of
only want like a device on you to like
know when people are sending you emails
or notifications or anything like that
but also never being able to reply to
them because you can't text on it I I do
like Watson's idea though insofar as
it's kind of like going to a restaurant
and wandering to apps for dinner which
is super fun something like the the
smart walk of like the Apple
watch a flight LTE features to me just
feels like a smart pager where you get
notifications without a phone but you
can't respond to them except for making
phone calls which if you used a pager
you feel alive when people use pagers
then yeah you know what phone calls are
what do you think is what he should do
yeah well yeah I mean but look the at
least the eight plus did you have that
new design with the glass pack you do
get wireless charging what you would not
have had on the seven plus should you
get the SC plus the watch again like
what Alfred saying it depends if you
take a lot of photos because of the
seven plus had a great camera and the
eight plus has the same cam with a
different sensor but still 12 megapixels
but be a larger sensor so it's really
about photos so if you really love
photos get something with a good camera
but your watch isn't I can't even take
photos one day when they like but I've
seriously thought about doing that I'm
still considering it right now so all
right back into the chat it's pretty
polarizing go figure more than a few
people not pleased with the facial
recognition face ID I think it's kind of
an annoying feature I think it's
interesting it's I don't understand why
they like I know that they had to get
rid of the home button but I also know
the why because they wanted the full
screen thing but I don't understand why
they has get rid of touch ID with it
because Sam somebody's been able to
integrate a fingerprint sensor into the
screen yet yeah just put it on the back
right poorly yeah but it didn't work I'm
saying like Apple has like you know the
resources to do to put it on the back
with good design I mean that's been
their whole MO I have heard a lot of
gripes about facial recognition as far
as privacy concerns goes yeah so here's
the thing about biometrics is that
you're like the Constitution does not
protect you from law enforcement getting
your like biometrics from you so if
you're required to give up your
fingerprint for something they can force
you to do that they can't force you to
give your password because that's like
the Fifth Amendment you're not allowed
to incriminate yourself so you can't
create yourself with your face or print
or your face no but that's like just
that's just like that's a biometric
that's not like oh my gosh that's not
you giving up certain piece of knowledge
that they wouldn't
they have we just entered a black mirror
episode where my dream that discriminate
they decided that in a court in like
2014 that like they can force you to
give up your fingerprints but they can't
force you to give up your passwords
that's why a lot of privacy advocates
they just use your user password don't
use biometric now with this you know you
can still have a password on the phone
though but you know they're they're
pushing really heavily for this facial
recognition thing and there's a lot of
concern that you know now a cop can just
like if you want to unlock your phone
take your phone and hold up to your face
and then swipe up pretty much can you
have like up like an emergency face if
I'm making it fun frankly don't unlock
there an emergency
there must be an emergency faces up and
what if I had different shortcuts for
like what face is your major smile gonna
have the front-facing camera face you
call the wolf like the wolf okay here's
the other feature here's the other
things that people think that annoy
people there in the demo it didn't even
work
he tried showing off face ID and it like
bugged out on him and he was like okay
let's just put the pass or no he
switched the phones he went to the
second phone didn't work though right
that works not with the face idea though
he don't unlock the second one worked
with the lady I believe the first and
the password in first when you see the
path we go on the screen I started we
can rewatch that but we will watch it
but yeah I there are a lot of annoyances
that come with face ID I don't know if
you guys are planning on using it or
there was a company that showed off the
fingerprint sensor underneath the
display yeah remember Sam someone was
gonna do it huh apples when they wanted
it to but they couldn't get it to work
reliably yeah which made me think man
this year is not the best time we got
the cool you know the s8 we got the note
eight we've got
iPhone 10 and they all don't have this I
bet next year look we listen to you guys
at Apple and we've integrated it into
the screen we now have touch ID back
because it's probably gonna be fixed by
next year I don't know we said the same
thing last year about the headphone jack
saying oh we listen you guys know that
they would never go back okay adding
another option that you never use I
think that we did also justifies that
price staying at $9.99 next year like
that I'm planning 11 stop stealing my
face ID people what happens when
somebody
starts a 3d printing your skull and
using that well that was one of the
things that they showed off that was
crazy
yeah so they said they worked with like
Hollywood mask makers to kind of try to
figure out a way to just poof their own
camera cuz it's happened before it
happens for a Samsung every time they
come out with a new phone they have
their face unlock feature on it and then
within like two three weeks they show
like oh look we tricked it with this
photo that like we just put in front of
it because it was like sounds like it
would be a little bit harder to do with
this one yeah but at the same time did
they mention that a twin will trick it
yeah they mention a twin but here's the
thing that I would like to I have a
small quibble every single time a twin
is mentioned they always say it's an
evil twin have to be evil
cuz your if it was a good twin they
wouldn't be trying to unlock your phone
fine so they mentioned how they got like
mask makers to like replicate like
people's faces in the same way that you
know hackers could try to 3d print
something and then put it there and I
mean they're saying that it wasn't
tricked I'd like to see you know people
get their hands on and see what they can
do with it at this point because that's
what they did for the print stuff at
this point the bar has been set fairly
low by Samsung because their facial
recognition software yeah they even said
like this is a new feature but it's not
really maybe there's a difference
between what Samsung is doing what
they're doing with face ID though so
with Samsung's I was using the
front-facing camera they don't have like
infrared lens or 3d sensors or anything
like that that's what they're saying
makes there's Apple is saying makes face
ID different with the infrared sensor so
it could also detect in the dark and 3d
sensor so that you know or deaf sensor
sorry so that it knows that it's not
just a photo like it can tell the
contours of like 3d now with like 3d
printing like a face though like
somebody's skull they're saying that
there's like some kind of like liveness
they also that's where they're they're
like neural engine comes in like the
machine learning so like like I said
earlier how it learns to detect like
your face and grow a beard or anything
like that um a friend of mine brought up
an interesting point like what if what
happens if you get like like in a car
accident or something your face is
scarred cuz like the machine learning
that learns over time so like as I get
older and get wrinkles or something you
know then
it changes that like my face you would
retrain but yeah it is learning it but I
think if you get in a horrible car
accident worrying about how to unlock
your phone but without the pin that's
probably not that significant I guess if
you had your phone similar unlock it you
but I can't make an emergency call
although you think you can unlock with
the emergency calls no matter what right
yes or with the pen yeah you can always
make emergency calls all right let's get
to another question finally favorite
design our banks going to accept face ID
as payment so they did mention Apple pay
that you could use Apple pay with face
ID because obviously it's supposed to
work just as well if not by some
avocados start using it yes yeah I mean
like I have the Chase Bank app on my
iPhone right now and it uses touch ID so
if it wants to continue to utilize those
types of biometrics then I would assume
that it would integrate face ID fairly
quickly whether you can use that for
payments or venmo yeah maybe and to me
that continues to add to the benefit of
it yeah but there's some kind of SDK to
take you from touch ID to face ID for
the developers but there has to be
something mm-hmm I just can't help but
not make sure that's like a really
awkward situation where you're just
gonna sit there and there somebody's
gonna ask like hey can you send me that
on venmo and you may like okay are you
taking a selfie no I'm not it doesn't
have to be that way look like you were
able to put the phone next to the point
of sales thing and you didn't have to
like be hovering over it so it looked
like it's reaching out far for you so
I'm really curious if that's gonna work
how well that's gonna work I'm very
interested to see how this works in
person we have a bunch of people that
are actually at the event
you know when Roger gets back from SF
he'll be able to tell us a little bit
more about the demos that he got to see
at the event today I asked him to bring
a photo of himself to try and trick it
but he said that it's not very likely
that I hope you were to try to trick it
because first you have to set the
phone's password as that face
and all this stuff I think it might be a
while before we can find out if it can
be tricked or not cool all right let's
lay them through a few more question
before we wrap up for the day
Halim who else hates the giant lock at
the top of the screen on the iPhone
you mean the notch a little notch she
called the lock there's a underneath the
notch when you're looking at the phone
and it actually they animated it to
unlock when you unlock the phone with
the lock on the screen with the notch it
might be it's pretty ugly looking but I
think strike antics do you see it and
you're like oh it worked because then
you still have to swipe up you doesn't
just automatically unlock with your face
if people start to complain a lot about
that lock specifically if that's what
he's talking about then that's something
that can be fixed with software and you
don't really have to live with it what
else we got plenty hang on speed round
now you're not there ready we're gonna
crap here hey love we love our viewers
not crap it is a lot to filter through
everybody's putting in a lot of great
conversation today I still kind of
convinced like we could just here and go
back and then the the chat just kind of
takes care of it some would argue let's
go back to Watson do you think the new
Apple watch is still a gimmick a novelty
after the introduction of cellular I
actually thought that was kind of an
interesting yeah but finally useful how
clear something up for me though are you
going to have to add the Apple watch to
your cell plan as another device on a
family plan or does it piggyback yeah I
saw from a tee there you'll have to pay
$10 extra a month for the watch feature
okay honestly I expected a lot worse
than that but that's just a teensy I
don't know what it's like rather yeah
carriers I wonder if somebody would like
try to incentivize that going back to
spider to try to quell t-mobile had this
thing a wild oat they got rid of it now
because it was costing them so much full
disclosure t-mobile is sponsoring us
today oh just saying be careful all
right fine going back to Watson's
original question you think the Apple
watch is still a gimmick I mean like
they've got their onto series three at
this point obviously they've been
selling them
in the promo video they trying to show
okay this is what people actually use
this thing always been like what is this
for
why am I gonna need this why can always
pull a sheeting in the Major League
Baseball mostly yes that was also in the
video no I do think that it finally has
used now I mean I think when the Smart
Watch first came out everybody had this
whole vision of like the Power Rangers
where they could like talk on their
phones with each other and you know have
like connectivity with that but then one
big first smartphones all came out I was
just you know hey this can like detect
your heart rate and tell you how well
you sleep at night and it just became
okay that's cool but I don't want to
spend money on that but now with like
this communicate like communicator kind
of feature on it I think it's I don't
think it's a gimmick anymore I also
appreciated some of the efforts that
they put into some of the medical uses
granted they need to be especially
careful with that because obviously the
Apple watch is not a medical device but
with some of the diagnostic features
they at least presented the possibility
of it having some really impressive
futuristic uses not now not today
perhaps but maybe a couple years from
now and the fact that it's generally
untethered entirely with V of the cell
version of it that makes it more useful
cuz you not like well I have this other
thing too so then I might as well look
at the other thing then you can leave
your phone at home and run around do
whatever and still have that connection
that I think finally brings it somewhere
where it's supposed to be and they
weren't kidding about the idea that they
didn't make it much larger they added a
little thickness to it
but it doesn't look barely yeah so I
want to bring up a comment from puppy
proud people she got my attention this
has nothing to do the iPhone acts
actually has more to do with the iPhone
8 which is ironic because we thought we
were gonna see a lot more AR in the 10
but they definitely demoed more of it in
the 8 it probably have very similar
capabilities probably but it was
definitely a louder statement during
that part of the keynote anyways the AR
stuff is cool literally he the only
interesting part of the announcement
though I don't know if they go to that
extreme but I did kind of find that
feature interesting from showing the
constellations and getting the stats on
the sports player it's like that was
kind of that was cool that was pretty
darn cool right yeah I think Apple
obviously realizes that a
is a very big part of the future for a
lot of major tech players so they're
trying to stake their claim to it at
this point I don't expect the iPhone 8
or the iPhone 10 to really have a ton of
a our capabilities but they're at least
trying to like put their you know stake
in the ground and that game looks pretty
hey we're gonna start doing this my game
looks pretty dope the one that they
showed off but I feel like there's gonna
be a lot of like Nintendo Wii like
accidents like waiting to happen
you remember when the we came out and
like you were like broke their TVs and
like hit their dogs by accident whatever
they're like this is real life nothing
that can be thrown your phone and say no
but I'm saying like when they're like
trying to shoot stuff on a table and
they're walking around the table and
they're not noticing stuff there's gonna
be a lot of people like falling and like
hitting that's a Pokemon go effect
saying ard MD is gonna be sick Alfred
effete if that comes to the office I'll
join you for that oh yeah I'm right
there with you yeah I just like it for
the sports feature there's being able to
be like okay what's going on who's like
what it would just came into the into
the game you can actually have that
overlay that's supposed to be the future
which we have not had other than Google
glass which was a fun all right we're
getting low on time but I can't go a
show without bringing up our buddy
Michael Brown who's always for a really
fantastic input Michael Brown says I
think the iPhone X was a solid
announcement and then he goes on to have
a comment back back and forth with our
new friend Watson says I'd like to see
CNET test both side by side maybe the
team can do a comparison video and he's
referencing the new pixel to forthcoming
between the eight and the 10 pixel the
10 in the pixel yeah we have to do that
absolutely and then just to close things
out they are brown says what is
something you think will be the killer
app or feature or a for AR on the iPhone
X yo ard and Devon 10 they are D&amp;amp;D I
already said it I like a lot of the
stuff that they presented with Google
lens where it you use AR as an overlay
for literally anything that you need
extra information while you're walking
around town so it's kind of like a
pop-up video for life you want to get
additional information for a restaurant
get an idea when you know something is
closing what's available nearby all
sorts of stuff where it's just more
information that you would find on the
Internet immediately available right in
front of you I think that is something
that a lot of people are gonna use much
more often for a are definitely oh you
know what to be a great AR app you know
you know how like when you were a kid
and then you'd be like from like people
really far away you're like I'm crushing
your head like literally a killer app
I'm thinking as dumb as it was an an
emoji thing I bet you people are gonna
love that thing I figured you'd be more
excited about I crush your head but I
never understand what emojis first came
out like this makes no sense and then it
like exploded and this animated version
when you have your own voice and the
stupid that's awesome that already
happens on snapchat I'm telling you that
as dumb as that is Apple has this weird
tendency to go yeah we know everybody
else did this but when we do it you're
really gonna use it like the way people
were using iMessage with all their
stickers and all that extra crap you
know was on every other platform already
but people love freaking iMessage so I
think that's still gonna be the big
first things they've seen it already I
yeah I think you're definitely on to
something with that so this has been a
really good discussion today but I think
we are just about out of time and we're
gonna have to close it out cuz I know
Alfred you've got to me I got it
interview at 4:30 yeah and I as and I
have to go finish top five so I have
alright let's wrap it up thanks
everybody for all your questions really
appreciate it we're probably gonna
continue with more Apple stuff tomorrow
unless much stuff in the world happened
okay and there's nothing else happening
