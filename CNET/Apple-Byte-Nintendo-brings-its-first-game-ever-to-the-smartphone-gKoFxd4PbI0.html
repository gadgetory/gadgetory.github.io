Apple bite it's your weekly visit for
everything good and bad inside the world
of Apple let's get to it and it's a
first-ever from Nintendo this week after
they announced me tomo will be coming to
smartphones for the very first time
welcome to 2012 Nintendo now they
famously resisted making mobile games
for years focusing on its gaming
consoles but those days are over me tomo
is basically a social networking game
for meez seriously that's the best they
could do for their first smartphone
gamer app this is a total disappointment
it's your first game Nintendo and we're
throwing a bad apple at you now 9to5 mac
reports Apple stores will begin selling
the new Apple TV in stores starting this
friday i know iOS is actually different
from TV OS but if Nintendo is smart they
should be doubling down on this now
Monday's online pre-orders will start
shipping this week with priority
deliveries arriving friday and standard
deliveries coming after the weekend now
the US Senate passed the controversial
cybersecurity information sharing act
this week with the house passing a
similar bill known also as C is a it's
designed to allow companies to share
information on cybersecurity threats
with one another and the government now
companies like Apple Google Facebook
Amazon and Microsoft do not support the
bill as it's currently written and says
it hides new government surveillance
mechanisms in the guise of security
protections Apple has taken a strong
stance on privacy and has noted in the
past that the government does not have
access to its servers and it's even
impossible for Apple to unlock iPads and
iPhones under police request because
they do not store the encryption keys
for those idevices see privacy matters
Apple understands that and that's a good
Apple
see so many of you keep bugging me
insane hey Brian what about a good Apple
so that's all of them for this year and
since we're talking about good apples
the tech giant reported another record
quarter for the 3rd calendar quarter or
fourth fiscal quarter of 2015 with a
record revenue of 50 1.5 billion dollars
and a net quarterly profit of 11 point 1
billion dollars 48 million iPhones were
sold up from 39 point two million from
the year-ago quarter max were up 5.7
million compared to 5.5 million but
iPads continue to decline at nine point
nine million units sold compared to 12.3
million a year ago so what's the
lifeline of Apple it's still the iphone
and they report thirty percent of iphone
buyers in q4 this year switched from an
Android phone it's the highest rate ever
since they started measuring switchers
now only one-third of their customer
base has actually upgraded to a 6 6 plus
6s or 6s plus so there's still a large
group that Apple is salivating over now
the Big E is facing a
five-million-dollar class-action suit
over the fact that their Wi-Fi assist
feature is using too much data and
resulting in significant data overages
for some customers the argument is that
Apple failed to educate us properly
about the feature that gives permission
for your cell phone to use cellular data
if Wi-Fi connectivity is poor now we'll
see how this all plays out but the
biggest mistake Apple did here was turn
it on by default with the iOS update
instead of giving it to people as an
option to activate themselves and you
know what that deserves a bad apple and
where do you even find it well here in
the settings inside cellular and all the
way down down at the bottom of your app
see that's real easy to find so if you
want to turn it off right now that's
where you need to go all right many of
you know I'm a warriors fan remember the
world champion Golden State Warriors
well just in case you forgot
my
yeah now you remember well apples on
board too with a couple of commercials
featuring the reigning MVP Steph Curry
launching a no-look three in slow motion
wait for it splash or a live photo step
just taking a steph court shot and
absolutely splashing it see that
Stepford 'less now arguably the best to
Apple commercials in the history of
Apple just barely being edged out by the
iconic 1984 commercial you know known as
one of the greatest TV commercials ever
made its really close call and before we
go it's time to announce our winner for
the awesome belkin charge dock for the
Apple watch an iphone I asked you all
for your favorite new emoji and why and
I got some fun responses like this one
mark owen who got creative with Netflix
and chill Zachary Mardon email said
obviously the best emoji is this because
who wouldn't want to barf money but the
winner goes to dawn burn gasser on
Twitter who said in case oh you wondered
the taco emoji is my favorite it's all I
can talk about yeah she went there
people she absolutely did it I love it
so congrats done and we'll be in touch
all right that's going to do for this
week's show you can send me your
comments and questions to the app Evita
cnet com or tweet me at brian Tong
thanks so much for watching we'll catch
y'all next time for another bite of the
Apple
