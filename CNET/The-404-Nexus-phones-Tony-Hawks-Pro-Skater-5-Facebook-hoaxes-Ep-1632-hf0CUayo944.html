mr. Russ brush too why hello there is
this spooky voice cuz it's October boo
you're such a dumb as the ghost how are
you bud I'm lovely this seems like a
good weekend to listen to podcast so if
you're in the Northeast because we're
gonna get a crap ton of rain this
weekend so i hope you download it right

right you need to listen spod cast by
candlelight it's gonna be a really old
timey sort of situation yeah we're
recording this on wednesday a little bit
ahead of schedule and uh i believe today
is like podcast day what do you mean
wednesday this two days ago was poz day
and wow do we celebrate I don't know
like what's supposed to happen on
podcast day there yet money I don't know
like two is there a union that we're not
paying dues to that we should be
collecting some sort of check I feel
like if any day were to give us some
sort of reward it would be today I don't
know I'm just trying to inquire a little
bit more I don't know podcast day you
seem a little unorganized I feel like
every day is a stupid-ass thoughtless
like hey its second mailman's
replacement day it's ridiculous enough
already with the days when is the date
doesn't need to be a puppy dog day and
each city has its own series of days
like you could Oh October thirtieth is
Jeff Bakalar day but only in this little
tiny New Jersey City that no one cares
about well first of all they care about
the city the second of all no you don't
need every day to be something I don't
need a day to be bagel day right first
off that's every Friday well also every
day because I love bagels pinnacle days
every day and puppy days every day cuz
puppies are the best oh yeah alright so
let's get that crap out of the way I
want to talk real quick about last
week's episode with the very elusive the
very interesting mild-mannered
monotone at times Derek water in this
just sort of who he is is is sort of
like that's his tone avoid like very
even keel and yeah I got tons different
kinds of feedback so let me start from a
personal point of view I loved him very
nice I thought he was so freaking nice I
was really disappointed I was not here i
was in san francisco i missed it it was
a bummer and then apparently he went to
do like Howard Stern the next day so
clearly we set him up well like what he
needed to be was Stern was pissed that
he came on this show first I think storm
was like man I can't believe 44 scoop me
again I think so um uncle I'm just happy
to be on the same freaking see ya oh
yeah other seemed like junk impressed um
so yeah uh he's a very interesting dude
because and when I say interesting I
mean you know you kinda it takes a
second to like figure out what kind of
guy he is and we you know we we joked
around a little bit beforehand and
that's usually when I sort of decide
what angle this interview is gonna go in
sure you know whenever a celebrity comes
in was like work you know I know what
this person's like in the public eye and
on TV what's this guy or girl like in
real life will they be cool if I tickle
them right would it be cool if i made
like I don't know some kind of off-color
joke or like mash notes right don't he
was really receptive to all that stuff
it was a really good dude I could tell
he had not been awake for very long sure
I well yeah what time did you would do
the interviews was ten a.m. yeah that
i've he seems like a night kind of
person as am i sure it was the first
thing i did yeah on uh on wednesday
that's for sure yeah but i love talking
to him uh he's super down-to-earth just
a normal guy who had a great idea who
has some really funny friends and got
this show off the ground if for whatever
reason you don't know about it and maybe
you skipped last week go back and listen
I'm also putting together some stuff for
a video because we did sit down on a set
and do the whole interview yeah so I'm
thinking about I'm gonna I'm cutting it
up right now and I'm going to make that
a little shorter than then the 40 minute
podcast that came
that yeah so because I think you don't
have any questions for me you're just
gonna listen to the I'm Jewish I was
traveling i missed the whole thing and i
feel like if i ask you questions about
what happened that seems like i'm super
lazy about it no it's fine um yeah like
I said I got all kinds of different
reactions from people which I thought
which is usually par for the course yeah
sure but it was like pretty much split
down the middle I do love this show this
is really tremendous it's one of my
favorite shows on Comedy Central and
just to show you and watch no matter
what like you don't have to catch up
there's no like you know references the
older episodes you just wrap in and it's
a bunch of famous people acting
reenacting drunk clarity and i had will
ferrell yeah recently I'm very few shows
have real live puking on them I guess
reality shows probably have a fair
amount of that but sometimes they blur
it but they there's a lot of puking and
drunk history which I guess is to be
expected well they were you know he was
saying like that's not what they aim to
do sure but no one know like.you never
you never know what you never know um i
would probably be like to apple martinis
down and and that'd be it for me i
thought i did talk to him a little bit
about that appletinis that's it just two
just two just idea that's all I need at
least you're having the appletini we
should live in your life yeah damn it um
I assume I was like yeah you know what's
the deal like a lot of people kind of
stole your idea like do you mean the
wedding yeah like that I mean whatever
they go back and listen to that yeah he
Ike was not happy I don't know I said it
and he was like oh what do you mean I'm
like out you know right I'm like what do
you think it's gave me an interesting
answer okay um but uh you know I was
like yeah a lot of people kind of do
this I mean I want to do it like I want
to tell I want to explain like the
history of apple shirt wasted totally
you know yeah like I so I want to do
right but I want to do it on CBS this
morning I want to go there at eight
o'clock yeah blind drunk take a peyote
button beforehand right maybe drop some
acid to just to balance me out
and you know just talk to Charlie Rose
about lat what Steve Jobs is and like
how he's kind of a dick in real life
what is the life was a dick in hell yes
anyway let's talk about some of the
stuff that's happened this week week and
it's been a busy week so far wait for
technology if you if you like technology
you're half in the right place yeah
because we're going to talk about Google
and their Nexus phones that were
announced earlier this week I feel like
this is good timing because we just I
think a couple episodes ago talked about
how you were like I wanna get an iphone
yeah I feel left out I just wanna I
message with Stacey all the time and
just like JK lol emojis for her non-stop
do you still feel that way no because I
already bought this new one ok that is
that yeah I how long did you wait I just
I instant I was refreshing the store oh
my gosh so here's the deal right like I
my big thing is the camera short and
I've become frustrated with my g three
how old is that how many years about
almost two years old ok um I don't know
I man you know I just got a little too
frustrated with Apple um and when you
look at like the 6s plus yeah I mean
them that phone super ugly I mean it's
huge it's huge and it's very uh doesn't
look dramatically different from the six
it no it does it's you're talking about
a for us 47 screen to a 55 no sorry i
meant the the 6s versus the six all
right then you know plus design wise
it's the same as last year yeah the year
of year they'll like form factors change
but like I've is the first time I held a
6s plus yeah and I'm holding this thing
I'm just like it's a norm good god is
this ugly I don't find it ugly it's kind
of nice to get rid of those bevel those
bezel well they is especially with the
success in that button you need a case
like I've never not had a case for those
phones a cuz they're hella expensive and
because like it's easier to hold and
yeah actually looks pretty good if you
have a decent case on it
all right um so I mean that sort of
sucks because you're throwing down
hundreds of dollars and then you have to
throw it at another 30 bucks for a case
sure but what are you gonna do so here's
a DSO you know after I'm switch I'm
leaving verizon soon anything i'm just
gonna know i'm gonna go to tmobile the
uncarrier yeah I'm gonna I'm gonna get
myself on Carrie I'm gonna just cuz of
money uh I yeah money is part of it
you're at the same time I'm just
frustrated with verizon not giving a
shit about me like I don't and I'm not
seeing t-mobile's gonna like you know
come over and make me dinner right but I
want some lever I want to feel the love
a little bit and I want some leverage
and I want a company that isn't like oh
here's using 895 up your boat charging
yeah what why am I paying this yeah so I
feel like I could never leave AT&amp;amp;T
that's a good sign because I have to
deal with oh I've grandfathered in
unlimited data right so I'm I feel like
like this is going to be like the new
rent control like you're gonna pass
grandfathered unlimited data down
through the generations i'm at the name
my children Ross consistently as is
their children's for the Yankee exactly
get the pass him down right um yeah so
I'm out of that I don't have any awesome
legacy stuff rights forever you're free
some free so I'm gonna leave and I'm
gonna have a tmobile pay my ETF sure
which i think is awesome and if I don't
like t-mobile I'm just gonna leave I'm
gonna go to Google Phi yeah which then
I've just got off the red anyway let's
get back to the phones themselves uh
huawei which is I believe a chinese
manufacturer yes is making the nexus for
the first time this thing's a freakin
powerhouse it's called the 6p it's got a
5.7 inch screen a Snapdragon amp dragon
810 processor apparently the cameras
pretty baller it's going to have a USBC
charging port which i did is the first
one is going to move it the new macbooks
the little macbooks the super small ones
use that us bc o ok i don't know about
phones and it's might never meet you
think you better than me yeah uh-oh so
yeah i don't i don't care that has
front-facing speak
years because ya think listening to
music on your phone is for assholes yes
um so yeah I a fingerprint reader all
right i'll take it's nice I unikey I'll
use it and see if it's important to me
for me it's all about the camera uh
obviously that's a huge deciding factor
like religious men get marshmallow first
version of the six point but what was
that so like the dot I've iphone 6s
obviously has a very good camera too so
what was the determining factor just
like you didn't want to switch away from
yeah I think at the end of the day
American I I I just didn't want to leave
yeah and it was just like harrowing idea
to me yeah it's daunting I just want to
do and I don't even think would be that
big of a deal yeah and cuz apple just
added that transfer over I would reuse
that why not would I don't know what
that does brings all your contacts over
and then sends them straight to Tim Cook
says it is in box yeah uh I don't care
because I everything I use is google
anyway so I would just hook up gmail you
can you get your gmail contacts and your
iphone without transferring junk sure
that's what I would do okay and i would
use google photos exclusively and I take
that to the bank baby i don't know i'm
i'm sadly in the pocket of apple in the
sense that i just like I you know my
work computer is an apple of my phone's
an apple and they all sort of talk to
each other it's nice because you're weak
I'm weak Emily just a weak person so
that's the 6p little pricey starts at
five hundred bucks that's with a
contract that's no contract free free
free free country I understand bring my
reverie well that's not that bad not bad
because think when you subsidize a phone
I'm gonna get you're paying that anyway
yeah and when you leave you're gonna
have to incur that cost at some point
sharam I'm excited to use it I'm excited
to see how it goes the battery let's not
forget this battery yeah it's got a 35
milla amp hour battery I wouldn't take
34 but I take 35 don't you shut your
mouth because all I know is when you
look at the numbers the shore the the MA
Asia's of these batteries the milliamp
yeah it's significantly bigger on the 6p
yeah I don't got a killer battery yeah I
would wait until a company or a website
an independent website did hardcore
testing does determine how hurry
I don't know what website now what
probably seen it probably say what 3000
is bigger than 2,000 that's sure and you
don't need a freakin website to tell you
that's that's fifty percent bakery oven
so here's the deal they've also come out
with a phone called the 5x yep and
that's going to be made by LG don't
forget Huawei's getting the first time
contract to make a nexus phone with the
with the higher end one the lower end
one I wouldn't want to say lower end but
it's called the 5x LG is making it
that's confusing well how does that
compute because it sounds like 5s which
is with an apple phone that already
exists this ok like why didn't they just
call it like the 5t or something they're
gonna run out of letters pretty quick
and they're gonna have to use emoji it's
gonna be like the five poopy smiley face
you think so I think definitely five
poopy smiley face yeah it's gonna be
really good all right I'm eager as long
as they don't use any of those Pope
emojis I'll be fine um so yeah get
excited about that if you aren't looking
for the highest end nevertheless it's a
pretty well-to-do phone and a very
capable specs yeah so you're not taking
a downgrade by going down the 5x route
from LG I kind of like the designer that
phone a lot yeah it's not gonna go it's
not going to get that metal body that
the 6p has but you're still going to be
well served with a pretty sleek sort of
form factor with that 5x there you have
it those are the two new phones they
announced they also did some stuff with
chromecast and they've got a tablet
coming down the road called the pixel
see you know I don't know I guess though
that's a fair if you if you still think
you need a tablet yeah I don't hate do
you really with these giant phones I
have no desire to use tablets anymore my
ipad is a six-hundred-dollar comic right
reader right totally a hundred percent
it's comics it is good for comics I
kinda want the comic industry to like
break away from that make their own
little thing oh really like a like a
kindle like a kindle that'd be cool very
cool yeah get get all those guys too
good thing they have so much free money
the like floating around pull your
resources man you're basically saying
Marvel get marble image DC yeah but
Imogen TC you know the image and easier
huge there that they're huge but but in
terms of like spare
I need to make hardware that's a huge
investor you get prorated Marvel's got
under you know foot the biggest part of
the bill anyway that's that um when we
come back I want to talk about we got
take a quick break when I come back
we're gonna talk about um a game yeah I
came out yes this week that is a hot hot
mess steamy hot mess it's a flaming
dumpster fire and you're gonna be upset
because i'm sure this game for this
franchise has a very special place in
most of your hearts more 404 right after
this hey Russ you got yourself a cloud
no is that a problem you should get one
oh but it seems like it's too
complicated for me I don't know if I
could handle my own cloud yeah you all
I'm not saying you yourself I'm saying
you should hire a company like soft
light okay they do clouds they know
clouds they're an IBM company and they
deliver clouds that are built for
innovation software is one of the only
cloud providers that provisions
dedicated servers and virtual servers
did you know that so I did know it's
otherwise known as a public cloud okay
I'm just breaking it all down here for
you it's making a lot more sense than in
layman's terms if you will soft layers
an IBM company in fact iBM uses software
as its cloud infrastructure foundation
for all IBM clouds stuff across the
board you our listener can get five
hundred dollars off cloud infrastructure
by visiting softlayer calm / podcast
that's five hundred dollars off servers
storage network and security on a cloud
built for innovation from softlayer do
not wait if this is something in that
interest you you're gonna want to jump
on it right away for that five hundred
dollar off deal go to softlayer calm /
podcast hey welcome back to the 404 show
how you dealing lovely it's probably
raining wherever you are well maybe I
mean you could be in like California and
it never rains there that's right it's
been about four years that they've
gotten rain they're probably pretty
jealous of Mars yes oh nice reference
Jeffrey look at you scientist over there
just call me Jeff the scientist um what
was that is that the thing like you just
can't do voices I just lay mean I can't
do voices too all right prove it no
we're not doing that I'm saying like you
don't want to open that I've got doors
but I've got a lot of good feedback
about your inability to do voice good
well I'm glad we're sticking to that
shit was to let that one summer for a
little bit the game we were teasing
before we hit the first break um it's
tony hawk's pro skater 55 the fecal how
long has it been since a good tony hawk
game came out is it i think the last
good game was tony hawk's project eight
okay which that had to be I want to I
want to guess that that came out in 2007
no it's gotta be later than that really
it's gotta be later than that it's 2006
oh how is that awesome or easy cuz they
did that awful motion control game was
that where's project date before or
after the like underground I think was
after those underground it had to be it
had to be and it just went totally it
was dead bye dad dead I cannot and will
get back to why Tony Hawk's Pro Skater
five sucks but I I can't believe that
what so it went Tony Hawk I think they
made two of those motion tony hawk's
ride those motion control games that
were awful so when Tony huh after two
tony hawk's pro skater 4 and 0 to you
had underground underground to american
wasteland project gate and then proving
ground I don't even know what proving
around it oh I remember this ok it was
probably it was probably ok as well it's
never a good sign when the wikipedia
page for your franchise has a section
called series decline mmm and it just
says 2008 to 2014 well guess what I
think we could probably extend that
maybe one more year wow so is the climb
ouch ouch they're not wrong I mean look
here's what it is I am not terribly
familiar with the production road
for Tony Hawk's Pro Skater five sure it
was very clear that the nostalgia the
desire to go back to your roots and to
just make a game where you had this
collects gate yeah you had the hidden
tape that was now a DVD fun and DVD
definitely very timely there I
understand that like why wasn't it just
like I'll collect the geotag write
something like not from 2002-10 or
something anyway it sounds like they had
very little time to develop develop the
game and despite the fact that like they
didn't have much time and there's not a
ton of stuff in there it's still char
they're still charging 60 bucks which is
just like a relic of a different era the
fact that this game is sixty dollars
yeah is a huge slap in the junk slap in
the face slapping wherever it hurts to
anyone who is even thinking about buying
this game let alone has a little piece
of nostalgic you know sentimental sent
sentimentalities that word yes that's
about outing it is word okay towards
this series because these games were
great yeah and this kind of
smash-and-grab job this kick this quick
cash grab job of what Tony Hawk's Pro
Skater five has turned into really
really upset it seems to me like they're
they basically accepted the fact that
okay this franchise is done we're
setting it off we're putting on a little
raft like at the end of my Joe Young
yeah it's gonna float off into the ocean
bye-bye but before that happens we're
gonna goof a lot of people by making one
more game sticking on store shelves and
anyone that loves Tony Hawk is gonna be
like Oh a tony hawk game I'll buy that
or I'll buy that for my nephew who like
skating or whatever and they're gonna
make a little cash but this is like
there's no way you come back from this
so this for as far as I'm concerned this
franchise is over it's done this is the
nail in the coffin right if they want to
resurrect it it's you can keep Tony Hawk
sure I think you need to because I can't
name another's case I'm not gonna point
the finger Tony Hawk no it's not his
fault he's been cashed checks for a
while now and the guy is like super nice
a nice guy I I'm sure he saw this i mean
i'm sure he played it before was out and
we can be like oh you guys maybe this
games broken a little bit i don't know i
don't know how much casey dude he's got
plenty of other brands to hawk uh no
it's just so it's just so sad it's
really sad okay so why's this game suck
why's this game hot garbage uh it's been
a lot of it is broken and I played it
for two hours last night and I already
saw like what so many people were saying
there's huge clipping issues meaning you
fall right through the map yeah um the
physics stuff is all out of whack
sometimes was there a big day one patch
they really so listen to this it was a
day one patch that was like a hundred
and sixty percent the size okay of the
original game yeah so that happened it
was like a four and a half gigabyte
patched or two gigabyte game yeah so I
don't know where that is apparently that
patch needed to happen because the game
just wouldn't work cool don't even
understand like there needs to be
certification right like you don't get
allowed to upload the game not to
mention there's got to be some people
that like just by the disc and don't
have a steady internet connection or
don't have a like have caps on their
internet and can't download another two
gigs or whatever I don't know so you
bring up the disc thing and I don't know
if this is a game that you can buy a
really disk I'm not a hundred percent
sure I'm gonna look it up real quick on
cuz i know it's 60 hours which is it is
definitively $60 pretty outrageous but i
can't remember the last time that there
was a digital-only game that was 16
hours oh maybe I maybe I Caroline pc
games I'm pretty sure you can buy in a
store maybe I'm I could have sworn this
was like only download but maybe I'm
wrong maybe I'm it looks like on
gamestop i'm at the gamestop for the
second time in my life um it looks like
you can buy it okay but uh yeah I look I
don't know I I don't know uh it's just
it's bad it's bad and it's right around
in it probably not it doesn't matter
even he can't say this guy's didn't even
feel like a sixty-dollar game either
because it feels so light yeah in terms
of content yeah and even if you can like
ignore for the for a minute that the
game is broken and their severe issues
with the gameplay it's not fun right
like even the times where it works it
doesn't and it doesn't have that same
feeling the gameplay feeling that it did
in one through four like the thing that
they're going for even that thing they
missed that mark on how is the
soundtrack sad Jax pretty good okay
that's like the soundtrack is right up
your alley that's the only thing the
game really has going for it ah there's
about 40 songs or so okay 32 songs so uh
look I would be upset if my even the
soundtrack glitches out even this
there's skips in the music for crying
out loud yeah so look a big avoid it
said so Dutson that's a no bye no bye
official no by stamp of disapproval from
the 44 so it feels like you've been
duped into being excited about a new
tony hawk game yeah i got scammed man
you got revolting skin you know who else
got scammed as a matter of fact what's
this I got a phone call this morning
about eight thirty in the morning for my
mother miss fresh dick hmm who called me
and said so I just got a call this is
her talking I just got a call um on my
phone and I didn't pick it up but then I
got a text message saying your phone has
been hacked please call one eight
hundred blah blah blah blah stop it
she's telling this to me and I'm like
okay that's a scam don't call them right
and she's like well I called them all
well I called them and I'm like oh no
and she's like well they said I was
infected and that I should go to this
website and I went to the website and
they were selling this 190 dollar virus
protection program and thank God she did
not buy the virus protection program but
she was like he sounded so convincing
like he sounded like a tech support guy
he's a con man and i really i mean i
think pretty much anyone could probably
convince I feel like people of a certain
generation our parents generation
are just not aware of because this is
not the first time this has happened
like she gets emails her thing is
infected I what she sees a banner ad
your computer is infected click to fix
and then you're toast you know week I'm
trying to get this out in the right
wording okay she's not a tech savvy
person text editors but I don't think
it's a generational thing per se I think
because 50 years ago sure they're worse
can write a lot of it i'm sure with like
banking yeah checks crap like that but
that guy comes to your door with a
suitcase selling vacuums but he's got a
gun oh sure the attorney mean the old
stick up this is a robbery scam yes uh
stick them up no so i think like back
before the internet back before this
digital revolution there were a lot of
analog scans I mean look at like you
know on now what was a catch me if you
can like write that kind of stuff where
was like really clever conning right
okay now I don't think let's use your
mother as the example I think your mom
would have liked been victim would
fallen victim to stuff like that back
then well now i have like Frank abaca
right pray I'm talking about like more
low-level stuff like the shit she just
did right it does seem like they're
using the the the camouflage of the
internet right to seem authority right
so like grandparents now are like you
know the internet sort of a mysterious
thing that has some sort of like
professionalism to it like you don't
know how it happens or who's behind it
right it just it's just magic but you
you know when something goes wrong you
either have to call someone that knows
what's going on or you like search
online and and you know we have that
that definition in our brains that says
oh this is crap like this bullshit
you've like a radar to determine like oh
these are scams and I just feel like it
requires like this second level of
nuance to understand that like if you
get an email saying like hey check out
this picture don't check out that
picture right
and it's so innocuous and sometimes it's
even from a person whose name you
recognize and you'd like i would know if
i get an email from you and it was like
a little bit weird and there was
attachment I probably wouldn't open it
and my mom and her generation probably
would like that we have this built-in
it's just cuz we were raised right it no
people of that generation have it as
well if they spend enough time right
what's really interesting that I found
out is obviously everyone knows the
Nigerian scam that's like the big
internet scam or when I give him all my
money he's a prince he's a freeze in a
bit of a dire straight here I need a
little money to set him up and then once
he comes to us your goat your so-called
golden so what's interesting about that
is people say okay obviously no one's
gonna fall for that it's the most
obvious scam everyone already knows
about it what it sounds like is that the
scammers actually intentionally make
those scams as obvious as possible
because that ensures that they get the
most positive hits out of the responses
so the people that are go enough to say
oh I might actually get some money out
of this are the people they want
contacting them they don't want people
contacting them saying hey that's
interesting but let me ask you or
information right you meet a keynote so
they're intentionally making these
things really blatantly obvious so they
can get the people that are most
gullible and most likely to give them
money which is kind of really
interesting easy a social engineering
thing it's a social engineering thing
and it's like man that's kind of smart
it is you got to give these scam right
credit and then the other thing you were
saying about the old generation of
scammers you have to consider in all
those instances that was a one to one
moment you were scamming let's say the
bank teller on the other side of the
table you weren't trying to scam 50,000
people with one email which is fishing
which is fishing so essentially like
their level of like time commitment is
so much lower and you know if they get a
point O one percent response rate on one
of those emails that's a success for
them yeah whereas if it was Frank
Abagnale trying to go from bank to bank
that would never be a viable scenario
right it's so true because you don't
realize man there as as crazy as it is
and as many hundreds of thousands of
people that would never even think to
click that link
there's one right yeah and that one gets
obliterated I mean you you there's no
coming back from that right I don't know
yeah it's just not I don't think it's
something you can I mean eventually if
you're using it enough you can try to
but it's happened a couple times and for
like innocuous ways to like change
passwords people asking to like change
for Apple passwords right and I just
don't know how to like I'm like that's a
scant I knew I the second she started
talking it was a scam and it's just like
it was like so much we were like yeah it
was over so that was a fun little
morning there's been a bunch though you
there's been a bunch of scam there's so
many and I kind of like them I like them
because i like the smart ones okay like
the ones where there's like bank stuff
and I mean these people are criminal and
I'm not endorsing it sure I'm just yeah
the one reader like the most limiting in
terms of personal damage I think I'm
fine relatively fine with oh I'm not
fine with any of them I you know like
you can call a lot of things scan jaron
on so if you've been on facebook this
week you've seen now this isn't a scam
it's just a hoax yeah those so uh if you
are one of this oh look everyone's like
oh you know you never know it could be
really I gotta put that I gotta put this
thing up okay if you're that kind of
person you there's other things in life
that you're overlooking as well let's be
clear of what you're talking about
though we're talking about a scam that
has been re popularized for whatever
reason this week on facebook it happens
every six months but yeah that's roughly
what it is somehow through these social
assholes which I'm gonna start calling a
thing okay it's just people on facebook
who don't know any better yeah just
click whatever button they're told to
yes and like whatever hell the thing and
yes it's bad the thing with Facebook is
everything with Facebook is bad yes
because Facebook and I'm gonna put the
the hoax on on hold for a sec okay and
I'm having these like the swing of
consciousness that I just don't know
that is the problem with Facebook is
that it it confuses too many people and
too many people see shared articles yes
that are from bullshit sources yes come
through their feed and they think it's
the
fucking New York Times yeah and they
click it and they're like shit that
cliparts roll up like a source I want to
read that looks like a professional
journalist did that and they click it
and they share it and they take it as
fact yeah and that is the freakin
problem it's even with face bright I
completely agree and they don't make the
source very obvious there's even bad
instances where the New Yorker has this
kind of lame parody column called I
think the Borowitz report or something
like that and I'll see posts from that
report on my Facebook feed and it says
it's from The New Yorker and the
headline will be something like Congress
does I don't know outlaws ice cream or
something like that but it's from The
New Yorker so I like I'm like what you
like on and I have to like do research
into whether this is legit or not
facebook is awful i completely agree
it's very dis deceptive about like when
you're clicking through stuff what
you're looking at you really like most
people don't do the legwork to like care
about sources and stuff like that so
because that is now our process yes
meaning we don't do any of the legwork
and we take everything almost as fat
right on its face something has to
happen now I know you're going to be
like oh well how can you like somehow
police that and like oh if they're
putting a story from you know Bob doe
calm the the integrity and the
reliability goes down to zero you need
to do something yeah you have to do
something right it's just because it's
shared 180 thousand times doesn't mean
it's coming from someone who knows what
the hell they're talking about did you
hear about the NPR april fools joke that
they did last year no NPR did a post
that just said it as the headline why
doesn't America read anymore and posted
it to their Facebook feed and the
facebook feed was filled with comments
being like screw you and bri read all
the time right but if you click through
it says congratulations april fools
jerks right you all comment on this
article about how you read all the time
and we are a headline and move on it's a
society i get sex in fury so this is why
this kind of stuff happened yeah it's
essentially what i'm getting at for
whatever reason these and and the worst
is when you see some
do this that you kind of respect you
need to say what it is first before we
know I'm building that 472 it's a hoax
where people are under the impression
that everything they post to Facebook
including their images and whenever
become Facebook's property long that's
the long and out of it and by somehow
posting five paragraphs on your feed you
somehow absolve yourself and become the
only sole proprietor of the content that
you post yeah as if that would be the
way Facebook is doing that privacy yes
yes that's the way they're doing it
they're just having a billion people put
that on their wall that's the way you
you solve this problem yeah it'd be like
going to a baseball game and you're in
the audience with a video camera and you
it and you're filming the game I know
you're getting and you announce this is
my personal video I'm only doing this
for me and then and the MLB would be
totally cool with your posting that no
it's fine like what is wrong and and
really if you post this on your Facebook
page all you're doing and you're doing
it very clearly is saying to all your
facebook friends unfriend me unfriend me
I'm an idiot congratulations you're
friends with an idiot if you'd like to
rectify that now it's a good time look
on front and I use this as an
opportunity to thin the herd totally one
hundred oh my god oh my god great I got
rid of 15 people yeah oh it's fantastic
it's and it's so at such catharsis it's
like later bar no longer in my life
moron we're no longer quizzes leaping
idiot yeah um yeah but the worst at like
I was getting too before we said exactly
what this thing is the worst is when
it's someone you really like yeah or
someone you really maybe respect right
and you just see him or her do it and
you're like oh shit yeah do i do i post
on there through my comment all right
what do i do there's no way to handle it
there's no right there's no good way to
handle it cuz it's all it's going to end
in is you would have to direct message
them but the problem
is the direct message couldn't be
anything other than hey Yura bleep an
idiot I want to okay a family member of
mine which I will keep nameless sure i
will not name him or her okay lazy stacy
pacolet no one time posted something and
he or she has done this like half a
dozen times writer he or she put a story
on facebook it wasn't it was just like
cut and pasted text got it where was
like if you're ever at an ATM and you
feel like you're someone like a shady
character is around yeah there's a way
like like if you're being held up at an
ATM yeah all you have to do is enter
your PIN in backwards what I know and
they Timbs you call the cops oh my god
that is really bad aside from the fact
of what do all the people with the code
100 1 and so on do right but just think
uh and and maybe there's a separation of
how people think they are perceived on
facebook maybe that's a part using their
joking maybe no no way no way now I see
someone like cut and paste this stuff
start adding funny things there right I
give no on the right to do anything
because I'm not a bright an idiot sure
so those are pretty that out there when
that when they occur yeah I I don't know
I think there's a whole weird
psychological thing that Facebook is
done to us that I just can't quite put
my well I think a big part of it is just
your you live in a place where
relatively people are of the same
similar mindset you know Kylie made it
close enough um but there's still some
people who are internet stupid we're
like they're totally yeah lucid and put
together Elijah sure the second they get
them hands on those game boards they
just they just they just crap them right
they just don't know what to do right so
I don't know what that is yeah and I'm
not saying we're better than well now
we're get really barely and clearly
nobody me but come on I mean if you if
you went to Yale like I have people who
are like straight
up scholar sure I don't get it yeah I
don't get it I don't know yeah but that
is a wedding so that got me thinking
like Oh what are other really good scams
you know stuff like that um so there's a
lot of like Judas games come in all
shapes and sizes or they not they get
through the mail yep a lot of snail mail
scans or a thing I get a lot of the ones
like I could I have a landline in my
apartment so we can buzz people in yeah
and I know six seven times a month you
get one of those like congratulations
you've waited on myself until you've won
a yacht right give away a 40 million
dollar yacht that's really gonna give me
right so I I just what I do is I just
pray that a human being picks up I just
have like a 10 minute thing with them
right just you like have all I do it all
the time and what do you like ask some
questions about the service because I
because I want them to think that
they've reeled in like a really big door
like homeboy yeah I gotta keep reeling
this bad don't you think they're also
judged based on how long they keep
people on the phone no cuz it's zero
that's like I mean I'm sure there's
people like me look even if that's true
I'm still throwing off the the ratio
case you have the actuarial tables are
getting I'm still brewing up there
that's probably true I I just use my
phone's ability to block specific
numbers and I whenever a spammer calls I
just add them to my spam ela right but
that's not gonna do anything I mean it
does say don't minimize the same number
they don't but it has minimized the
number of calls I gotta my cell phone
kind of nice uh cell phones I alms get
none yeah that's great um so I got me
look the thinking and I looked up so
there's like from New Jersey calm okay i
don't know why they came up quick maybe
it's a sure location thing on google uh
but there they they have like five
really big scans to watch out for of
2015 sure so they're they're number one
scam was ransomware ransom where yeah do
you know what that is it's basically
like let me guess is it an app that uses
those crazy cutout letters to write
notes to people and if you want to see
you d drive again
cuz it's pain in the ass to find all
those different kinds of letters if I
can get the m4 Mad Magazine dedication
where you get another app I don't know
its dedication magazine / max action /
Maxim uh so yeah like they're talking
about ransomware I've never really come
into contact with this but up but a lot
of people you know fall victim to
instances where they will either be
approached by someone impersonating a
figure of authority okay who says like
we you're on this list sure and you look
your computer IP address looked at child
porn right and if the only way you can
get around this is a one-time fee of
five thousand dollars sure enough people
pay Charon in particular patient
tasteless tasteless um a lot of mobile
payment scamming yeah um a lot of the
concerns well like so a lot of people
are overly concerned about mobile
payment scams but most of them are
unrealistic some people think like oh if
I leave my phone too close to a reader
it'll get charged some hands a few but
but it's not that it's it's more about
like getting tricked into paying for
something that you didn't necessarily
sign up for it um the list goes in
through like credit card chips oh yeah
that's a scam like the you can get
scammed with that because um you the
chip is exclusive to the card yeah a
number can be written down or whatever
the chip is exclusive to the card so
that's the thing to consider in october
i believe of this year they're switching
over the whole the way credit cards are
used in the entry or now you'll have to
like have a card with a chip and
apparently that ship is like you're only
the only way to really pay for school
great and that's it you'll like stick
that in a thing sure what do you think
of that I think it's great I as I
understand it in Europe credit card
fraud is very very rare right because
they have those things data system so
that's great i might car get stolen
probably twice a year and it's a big
pain in the ass so Austin was telling me
Austin Walker from John
bomb is telling me about a money order
scam that he fell victim to where he was
selling something on craigslist yeah and
the guy wanted to buy it was like hey
I'm gonna send you a money order and I
was like uh okay yeah the guy sends him
a money order and then says oh I sent
you the wrong one can you cash and give
me the money back and I'll send you the
difference and essentially what it is is
like the money orders for too much money
yeah and you send them back more than
what it was originally worth like oh
okay sure your you know subterfuge know
what a money order is yeah like who the
hell uses that like I'm sorry you found
something on craigslist and I'm gonna
use those antiquated way possible pay
for it come on so there's a lot of scams
out there watch your back and if
something feels furry furry fishy yeah
furry would really be raised eyebrows
girl just just you know search for it
cuz odds are too does someone that you
feel like knows a thing or two about
technology like literally one simple
question of hey this is kind of weird
what's up right and if it's if you're a
parent and you have kids that know
technology or vaguely know technology
they'll probably instantly tell you oh
that's a scam stop whatever you're doing
uh you know throw your computer out the
window yes man someone a couple years
ago I was away skiing and I got a call
during the day and it was from someone
claiming to be lifelock which is that
personal security shirt and lifelock
goes hey you something about your
informations been compromised I've been
like all right well I've never signed up
for life lock right and they they didn't
want anything from me right they just
kept saying and I i don't i don't know i
don't know what it was about it was this
non-stop back and forth and i was mad
sure because they called me they knew my
name well yeah that's just not difficult
um and then they wanted like my address
i didn't give that Brian and I was just
like men like just out with it I'm not
gonna I'm clearly not going to be
convinced to give you any vital personal
or financial information yeah so what
the hell are we doing it just I rub me

hey welcome back to the 404 show don't
worry we're not interested in your
social security number we don't want it
no we already have it we already have it
that's the contract you agreed to by
downloading the podcast yeah I want to
talk about Spotify yeah quickly you put
this year in my Spotify judging us it's
judging me for example uh we had shining
cook on a couple weeks ago and she
obviously played us a lot of music
mostly music I really enjoyed she had a
really good playlist I know I have to
justin bieber stuff i went like half
maybe some of the yeah so apparently i
might taste kind of bounced around a bit
I want kind of run the gamut but I've
been listening to the Spotify discover
pie OS which I think updates weekly and
it's essentially like you know just
here's a bunch of music you're probably
going to enjoy and I almost consistent i
would say ninety five percent of songs i
really really dig so it's clearly their
algorithm is pretty on point I think
you're just what it's good you just love
everything yeah easily your sonic sonic
Lee speaking you're easily entertained
aren't you Russ I might be I never
occurred to me and are you allowing your
musical taste well I was just really
humbled because I was listening all this
music I like and suddenly sting came on
but it was oh yeah I love the police i'm
a huge fan of the place i'm sure that's
why he was on there but it wasn't a
police on Jeff it wasn't it was that if
you walk in fields of volley it was post
police when you called you know such an
old man pop that I wanted to jump off
out of my window and just end it all
right there wow it was just laying did
that sting did that with that song and I
just don't like Spotify no one wants to
hear sting because that's what that's
telling me is like you have terrible
taste you have the most generic like
blah taste imaginable that you could
walk into a CVS and hear the same
playlist and not be surprised like it's
playing on the on the overhead speakers
oh man
now did it I was really upset I'm gonna
give them the benefit of the doubt
they're usually very very good like it's
not human controlled it's just a robot I
know and the robot thinks I'm like a 65
year old man wandering the aisles of CVS
maybe you shouldn't click like on uh Oh
No yeah someone else's songs it I mean
look the police are great yeah you could
understand like why it would be like oh
maybe he'll like maybe we'll just sneak
sting in their stings been asking for a
few more places I can't thumbs down it
though that's the problem I don't know I
just wanted to tell them like no not
acceptable we can't exit out or do
something think so and even if I did I'd
be worried that it would remove all the
other police stuff hmm interesting I'm
an old man uh speaking of old man I
don't know how we're gonna segue in
there is no wait a sec uh this is not an
old man topic whatsoever we're gonna
talk about product cons game of the week
on for four sho what is it this week
Russ yeah so as you all know i work at
product hunt you can visit product hunt
calm / games you know can i interject
for just the second shore keep getting
these emails from product on about like
oh awesome podcast you should listen to
and I'm like well shit ah well shit one
of their one of the big product hunt
guises on a pod yeah well I wanted to
mention we actually just launched a
podcast category yesterday yesterday so
I wanted to make sure that things launch
smoothly before I introduced our
podcasting thing but it's actually
pretty cool if you like podcasts you
always lie to your friend like that yes
if you like podcast it's episode
specific so it's not like people are
like recommending the shown just show in
general they would for example recommend
the episode where justin gets lost in
the woods which is class everyone knows
classic so if you have any favorite four
or four episodes and want to submit them
obviously please feel free that is
product on calm / podcasts I believe
podcasts or podcast I think it's podcast
with an S yes it is and just went there
and there's some good stuff on there I
definitely submit yourself I being you
know in charge of the game section
brought a game today and it is space
team did you ever play space team on
your mobile phone uh no based he was an
awesome mobile phone game that I really
would recommend for anyone essentially
it's a multiplayer game where four
people are holding their phones and on
your phone you're given very explicit
directions like turn the flu boob or
it's like they use a lot of gibberish
around you like that and on someone
else's phone is the flu group flew
before so you're constantly shouting
back and forth directions for other
people so how do they do that it's
networked is it now worked or is it just
like use this code and you're in I mean
they're networked they're good they're
connected to it so you don't but I don't
think you need to be on the same Wi-Fi I
think you could probably connect
directly via bluetooth okay and it's a
great multiplayer game you know your
it's like a lot of shouting and chaos
but it's great for non gamers it's
either very cheap or free and then they
just funded a card for a card game
version of it on Kickstarter raised
about 70 grand and the team was on
product time answering some questions on
our live chat but if you dig space team
or are curious about it download the
mobile game and then check out the card
game on product on it is really slick
that's great arm and stuff it's it's a
really cool idea how many people can you
play with on the mobile game I think it
caps out it's six I want to say it might
be four but i think it's six and the
card game i believe is four to six as
well and the card game is infinity
infinity it just keeps going so if you
like yeah multiplayer games kind of a
good game if you have a bunch of non
gamers around you're welcome to like
kill weekend see their rainy weekend to
see game that I wish yeah we didn't do
anything like that on this bachelor
party I was just that you just shot each
other yeah we're just shooting each
other with paintballs yeah paintballs I
don't know why I adopted a southern
accent when I started playing paintball
but I just did yeah it seems to fit oh
it's it's I don't know what are you
trying to say trying to say it's like
this trashy thing no I say it's an
outdoor activity that uh you know it's
like hunting and I kind of associate
it's not hunt like hunting it is look uh
you know
kind of your hunting men yeah for sport
it was weird i thought i would be really
i didn't play paintball in a while and I
thought it was going to be so good
because I play a lot of call of duty and
I'm pretty good at call of duty sure it
doesn't always translate well the
tactics translate thank you so these
right so the ideas of cover and you know
viewing angles stuff like that are very
important what doesn't translate is your
muscles which are probably very
atrophied and I and I was telling before
we started recording my quads are so
jacked right now yeah I can't I can't
even like understand well because it's
so much of the time and this is our I
hesitate even say this but you know the
tactics that you're using in paintball
is similar to like a lot of the training
regimen that they use in the military
because again you're hiding mine cover
but you can't just like sit indian-style
behind cover no that's not really so you
need to be like in a crouched kind of
aggressive position and potentially if
you're like pinned down by a bunch of
people firing in your direction for like
a good 10 15 minutes so try crouching
for about 15 minutes and then see how
your legs are doing after that it's not
a pretty scenario and I was sore for
about the last time i went was about
like a week a week and a half I could
like feel it like I couldn't move my
right quad is so much worse than my left
and then I played ice hockey the next
day and it's been days no wasn't because
I was like oh it's definitely crouched
too much in your knees are bent in the
sake but you're not like sure anyway I
had a blast I got rocked in the ring
finger you know bed and I'd never been
shot in the finger with paintball yeah
well that's a very specific thing that I
do another specific I bled yeah as you
can see right here yeah that's gram and
the craziest thing was like did it hit
your ring no that's the thing if I was
wearing my ring if I was wearing my ring
are my man good karma for hitting on all
the paintball girls took your ring oh I
i yes anyway it happened and when after
I got hit I in my head I thought oh my
fingers gone it's explode or you thought
your finger my brain just exploded and
then I'm like hey look at it and it's
bleeding sure and I'm like I wasn't like
a lot is bleeding more than I thought I
didn't care but I was like guys not that
yeah crazy yeah I was it felt like
someone replaced my finger with like an
m-80 I just lit it I got shot in the
forehead hi there was one point I was so
sore from Crouching that I just got
frustrated and charged a point of cover
just like go for it and one of the guys
just stood up behind cover aimed and
fired and hit me right in the forehead
and the mask covers your eyes obviously
you don't want to go blind but the
forehead for at least for me was very
uncovered and yeah I bled a fair bit out
of my head it was pretty awesome yeah
that's tragic the I'm the masks we had
were covered your forehead but you see
you know the rules were like if you get
shot but at the pain that the ball
doesn't break yeah just get out it
doesn't count right which is stupid no I
mean that's the only I think that makes
sense in the sense that like it's sort
of the only official way to determine oh
this person got hit it's supposed to be
by like you're supposed to say oh I'm
out or something grant there's a lot of
honor code yeah doesn't always work I
was so weak I was shooting a guy sure in
my group we had 19 people said plenty
people he pink did not break on oh
really and like I don't know what the
deal yeah he was they happen without God
right he wasn't fat but he wasn't skinny
and I think the ball I think it was just
like husky enough chore we're like him
enough Gibby it was like the ball just
balls were just like taking it and just
sitting on so the last time I went we
were it was for a bachelor party we're
about eight people and we were paired
with some randoms we didn't have enough
teams to like fight each other yeah and
there were two guys that were to the
nines decked in like hardcore military
gear like flak jacket just get goggles
they had your pieces for like an
occasion damn it but there were old guys
and they like we're not very good they
were like not moving so they got into
the scene of it but we're not really
good meanwhile this other dude was in no
joke flip flops and like a wife beater
t-shirt thing and like pajama bottoms I
swear to God I was the best and he was
outrageous he was so he was doing slide
dives to like take people out
is amazing and nothing can hit him so
you really do need to be that like
insane crazy person that like doesn't
care for your wellbeing yeah and your
your rocket because everyone else is
just like hiding behind cover waiting to
die I mean yeah it does i play for four
hours if there's one thing I learned
from this for our session just camp yeah
just Camp camping so damn things the way
to me all right uh we'll do one weird
animal facts that will back then yeah
what a hard animal facts hey Russ rustic
hey Jeff tell me about this rogue Cal
seems that in central New York Jeff made
the mistake of thinking this was
Manhattan I was like where midtown now
we mean central New York upstate there
is a fifteen fifteen hundred pound rogue
cow that has been eluding capture for
months now if you can't catch a cow like
no one's ever accused the cow of being
fast yes what the hell's going to make
it take a trot maybe like seven miles an
hour uh yeah maybe you could crawl and
catch up with okay but argument's sake
you personally catch the cow you're
standing next to the cow what do you do
to keep the cow and play my a butcher no
you're just Jeff so I don't so I don't
have the the knowledge but you might
have the knowledge you might know what
you need to do but you don't have any
tools what do i do what would you do I
get in the car and I heard it with a car
okay you heard it where like the nearest
open barn okay so that's seems
complicated a little bit oh I would
corner him ok but he's outdoors I'm a
corner him in a corner bowl feel more
like a fence it was that it seems that
they've been trying they say they have
these things called headlock feeders um
that trap a cow while i was eating while
he's eating right so they've been trying
to use that hasn't been working the cows
just sort of kind of devious the police
tell the utica observer-dispatch that
the 1500 cow 1,500 pound cow has been on
the loose for several months effort to
identify its owner have been
unsuccessful so this guy's up is an
odorless cow yeah he probably has an
owner but maybe the owner doesn't want
a part of him I do kind of wonder do the
spots have like the fingerprint thing
we're like every cow is unique oh no
rust spots on a cow are not QR codes ah
sad that's a bummer does the cow have
NFC technology within it i feel bad i
mean i'm not about to go say I won't eat
cows because I do in their delicious
yeah but I don't like a cow being
treated inhumanely and you know what if
this camper got free chur we can't eat
him let him go let him go he's like the
turkey on Thanksgiving at the White he's
pardoned he's pardoned well let him be I
I was in a cow rampaging kaveh scenario
I was staying up staying Stampede what
you said you said rampage well even know
it was just a cow that got out of a
fence we were upstate New York okay and
uh you know this might actually sound
familiar because I think you've I've
been there all right member with the
with the bell he had a bell around a
bell resident cuz we were staying at
that house with I was like Memorial Day
weekend we had a bunch of couples I was
fourth of July but you know I same diff
and um the cat we were staying next to a
farm there's a farm how about cal got
out of his pen the cow is legit out he
was in our lawn yeah of the house we
were staying and I wasn't scared wasn't
like I wasn't scared but what was I to
do yeah and they're massive creatures
right and the farmer was like oh yeah
they do that yeah so I guess there's
sort of an assumption that they normally
come back and this cow did not come back
so what's up so what's this cow know
right what does he know that's what you
truth is out there get to the bottom of
it alright everybody that's going to do
