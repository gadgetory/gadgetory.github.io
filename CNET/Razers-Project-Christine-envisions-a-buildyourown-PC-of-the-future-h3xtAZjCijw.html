looking at what could be the future of
desktop gaming pcs razor is showing off
project christine now what is this
razors never made a gaming PC before but
what we're seeing here is a concept for
a modular gaming PC it's being touted as
the world's most modular pc design and
what you have here is a rack tower and
the idea is even if you don't how to
build your own pc each of these parts
plugs and plays and you can get whatever
piece you want from a future store
potentially where you get a drive and
led maintenance readout display you get
speakers and get extra graphics maybe
you have other manufacturers buying into
this concept as well and not only that
its mineral oil cooled underneath here
will be a reservoir of mineral oil for
better cooling properties and there's a
a dual self-sealing valve system right
here that runs through the whole unit
and cools all of the different parts
crazy right well this does not have been
released 8 needless to say it doesn't
have a price is a concept that razor has
done this before project fiona was an
idea for a concept before they have the
razor edge gaming tablet last year and
so again this is a concept you can
imagine at some point to be building
towards a product you're looking at a
CES where pcs have been redefined steam
box and where else are we going to go
maybe this is building towards that type
of a future that will see soon it
certainly is one of the most
eye-catching and awesome designs and
we've seen on the show floor a lot of
people are curious about it and that's
how it works it is called project
christine for now i'm scott stein at CES
2014 with razors project christine</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
