that's based off of the Firefox browser
like this of course I'm Jessica doll
court for cnet this is the geeks phone
key on this is an interesting device we
first saw it at Mobile World Congress in
Spain last februari this is a developer
preview version so it's meant to go
specifically for developers they can use
it as an environment to test and create
applications for the very new firefox
operating system this is not intended
for people to actually pick up and buy
but it does give us a very interesting
window into phones like this that
consumers eventually will buy now the
Firefox OS phones will go to emerging
markets and they're going to be very
inexpensive the operating system is
meant to be extremely lightweight
components aren't expected to get very
high so you will find a whole range of
different features but these are never
meant to be very premium phones there
for a very specific purpose mostly
affordability one of the most notable
things about the key on is its blazing
orange color which I personally kind of
like this is a nod to Mozilla and
Firefox of course it's got a soft touch
finish that I find really comfortable
it's got sort of rounded edges on the
back makes it comfortable to hold the
screen does for Trude a little bit from
the sides which kind of dampens down the
comfort level just a little bit but it
does make it very easy to pop off the
back cover and get to the microSD card
slot and sim card slot underneath the
operating system itself is sort of like
a cross between Android iOS and Windows
Phone you've got very familiar elements
like a notification shade that pulls
down in front you've got a couple
different home screens there's
multitasking as well you navigate with a
touch-sensitive button at the very
bottom there is camera on the back of
this phone it's 3 megapixels also takes
video the camera app is extremely simple
that's mostly so that developers can use
it to just make sure that things work
this phone really isn't intended for
excellent camera quality navigating the
phone is pretty easy you can slide it
over to the left to get to a bunch of
grouped icons this is organized by
things like social game music movies
weather and TV so it's nice that there
are a lot of apps to get started
everything is pretty much based on HT
ml5 so these are web apps one problem I
had is that most of them are not yet
skin and optimized for mobile they will
be in the future because of course this
is a developer phone but it's nice to be
able to get an idea of what the apps
might look like this handset itself has
some very low in specs again to keep it
cheap but I do notice a lot of lag eNOS
so that's a problem if you've got a
phone that's based off of the web speeds
are also going to be pretty slow 2g and
3G there won't be any 4g support because
this isn't intended for markets that
really rely on 4G LTE at this point in
the game Firefox OS is in very early
development stages we're going to be
keeping an eye on that and on phones
like this key on that showcase the
operating system and what it can do it's
a very interesting alternative for
emerging market I'm desig adult court
this has been the geeks phone key on
developer preview for Firefox OS</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
