2013 this is LG's booth now at CES you
see a lot of televisions around but
behind me is a unique take on TV this is
a sort of a deconstructed rear projected
television this is a hundred inch laser
TV LG is calling it there's a small
projector right below the screen it's
it's about 22 inches from the screen the
unit comes with the screen and the
little projector unit you set it up at
this fixed distance turn it on in wallah
you have a hundred inch television right
there so this uses laser projection
technology one of the advantages
increased lifespan the bulb lasts about
3000 hours I've been told this TV has
all the normal specs for LG's flat panel
televisions including 1080p resolution
it's got the Smart Remote it's got the
voice control TV got little speakers
inside the projector down here the only
thing it doesn't have is 3d so if you
want 3d you might have to wait until
next year's version one of the downsides
traditionally with projection technology
is screen brightness this thing is
supposed to have 115 it's of light
output which is plenty for a moderately
lit room you can see below here there's
a little bit of a sound bar that's not
included with the box what is included
however is the screen itself is going to
be a very large box the screen is
included this means about 0.8 inches
thick so again very thin really slick
form factor and if projections form
factor of the two-piece and the screen
is kind of holding you back this thing
is a totally different alternative so
it's right in the front of the room
there's a really neat take on television
of course one downside for all that
technology is the price up until it's
going to be around ten thousand dollars
that hasn't been set yet this product's
going to be coming out around March in
the US that's
quick look at LG's hecto laser 100 inch
TV I'm David cat smart from Cena</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
