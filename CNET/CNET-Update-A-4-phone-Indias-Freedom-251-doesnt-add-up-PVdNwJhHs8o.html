to be true guess what it is I'm Bridget
Carey this is your CNET update a phone
should not be the same price as a cup of
coffee but one new smartphone maker in
India is getting lots of attention this
week for introducing an Android phone
that only costs about four dollars it's
the freedom 251 and it's called 251
because in India it costs 251 rupees
which comes to three dollars and 70
cents here but when you look closer at
the facts around this phone things start
to get super shady and it's clear
something is not right for starters the
company ringing bells says it's made in
India but is in fact made in China when
the phone was unveiled at a press event
reporters were given sample phones that
had the Chinese brand addcom covered in
white out you can see the paint
scratched off here in this video from
the business news paper mint in which
the reporter also said she had trouble
getting the review model to turn on and
photos from various news outlets all
show icons on the home screen that look
like they were ripped off from Apple's
iPhone app icons India's telecom
ministry is investigating this company
and how it could possibly sell a phone
for so cheap because when you just break
down the cost of the parts that are
being imported from China it costs about
$40 to make freedom 251 is marketed to
have a 4-inch display a 1.3 gigahertz
quad-core processor and 8 gigs of
storage running Android lollipop the BBC
and others report that the company does
not yet have a manufacturing center in
India and yet this made in India foam
promises to start shipping pre-orders by
the end of June the website crashed
Thursday from pre-orders and the company
told The Economic Times of India that it
had 30,000 orders already for the phone
before the site went down yeah we shall
have to see how this plays out in the
meantime there are some other unique
phones popping up that aren't so shady
but they don't come as cheap take the
next bit Robin this comes from a brand
new company and to stand out it took a
new approach to storage it comes with 32
gigs but to save room it will
automatically archive apps and photos
that you have not used and store them in
next bit servers online yes the cloud
you redownload them when you need them
the fingerprint sensor to unlock the
phone
is on the power button on the side and
in our time with it we found it to work
very well but it is not a perfect phone
it costs 400 dollars unlocked and
Caterpillar yes the construction brand
has a new ultra rugged phone called the
s60 and is the first with thermal
imaging sensor built into the camera it
comes out this year for $600 and it's
one of many phones that will be unveiled
at the big mobile show taking place in
Barcelona Mobile World Congress will be
bringing you tons of news in the mobile
world over the next few days so stay
tuned using it for continuing coverage
from our studios in New York I'm Bridget
