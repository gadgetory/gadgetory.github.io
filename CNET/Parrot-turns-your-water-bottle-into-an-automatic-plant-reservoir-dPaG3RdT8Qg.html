taking a look at the new garden products
from Barrett you might remember the
parrot flower power it's a garden sensor
that I reviewed a little while back now
they're taking that same flower power
and they're putting a water bottle on
top so not only can it sense your soil
moisture and your fertilizer and your
ambient light and your temperature but
with the water bottle it can actually
water your plant for you you're going to
tell the app what kind of plant you have
it's going to assess the needs of the
plant and then water it accordingly when
it looks like you can attach most water
bottles to this thing and it's got a
cool that you can go out into the garden
with a water bottle of your own and have
a self watering garden based plant we
also have the parrot pot which is a
smart planter that also waters itself
just like the pair h2o this thing
measures your water and your fertilizer
in your ambient light and your
temperature you plant into the parrot
pot fill it up with water and this will
take care of what the water bottle takes
care of over here both are still limited
to bluetooth but the possibilities of
self watering and self maintenance here
are pretty cool</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
