is tomorrow daily the best geek talk
show in the known universe i'm jeff
cannata and you are watching one of our
shorter episodes every Thursday we have
a longer episode where we deep dive into
the stories of the week and maybe a
friend of the show will stop by but
until then right now let's jump into the
headlines we love talking about
inventions that will change people's
lives on tomorrow daily but sometimes we
just have to talk about things that make
no sense this is one of those times this
is the prank Oh phone Russian artists
Dimitri more Azov is the mind behind
this little contraption which is a
hybrid phone / synth device meant to
confuse call recipients he hacked
together a phone a logic module and a
synthesizer to create this odd little
bit of tech for different modes allow a
person to choose a number to call or let
the prank o phone dial randomly and
decide whether or not to let the device
use an algorithm to create sound or
create it manually when a person on the
other end of the call picks up the prank
o phone plays a synthesizer song based
on the tones of the phone number it
dialed morozov's says the sound message
is unique for every number it reaches so
if you ever get a phone call that sounds
a little like this it's the francophone
is prank calling still a thing I guess
it's still a thing you know if you ever
get called by the prank of phone you
might be annoyed but you're also pretty
lucky it's a random number hey you
probably heard of graphene at this point
but check out this graphene that can
move Chinese researchers published a
report in science advances this week
about a graphene oxide based paper that
can change its shape when exposed to
infrared lasers applying heat causes the
graphene to contract while shutting the
light off allows it to expand again in
the video you can see one tiny scrap of
paper inching around like a worm and
another folding of its sides like
origami there's a lot of possibilities
in research like this in the future
as paper might be used for making
inexpensive sensors that can track
changes in humidity temperature and more
this graphene can also be used to create
artificial robot muscles so we're
getting closer to Terminator robot
muscles fine if you have some muscles so
we house the robot they have the robot
muscles you get the picture hey speaking
of China check out this robot that just
set a world record Walker number one
just set the Guinness world record for
furthest distance covered by a
four-legged robot on a single charge how
far did he get 83 miles 83.2 eight miles
to be exact or 130 four point oh three
kilometres the little robot walked
around an indoor track over fourteen
hundred times and his feet took 54 hours
and 34 minutes to complete the previous
robot record holder only walked 40 point
five miles in 2011 so this is over
double that it took about a year to
build the robot and researchers want to
put what they learn to use in areas like
energy efficiency reliability and
durability they feel like what they've
learned will help robotics at large and
we think it will considering how little
energy this robot actually used over the
entirety of its walking journey these
researchers think that this walking
robot can be deployed in places that are
too dangerous for humans so you know
like Walmart on Black Friday hey it's
Tuesday and it's one of the biggest new
release Tuesday's of the year let's get
two new releases
if you are a video gamer this week
there's almost too much to play all

playing it I got an early release copy

that's just a drop in the bucket for
this game it's going to be hundreds of
hours of content in this
post-apocalyptic world it's out on xbox
one playstation 4 and PC but if that's
not enough game for you how about rise
of the Tomb Raider the sequel to one of
my favorite reboots ever which was the
the tomb raider reboot that came out
just a couple of years ago this one is a
timed exclusive on xbox one and follows
lara croft's journey into the wilderness
and becoming more of that tomb raider
character that we know and love but if
big action and big role playing isn't
