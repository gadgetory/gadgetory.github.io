here at PlayStation experience in San
Francisco to show you the PlayStation VR
headset this is what job simulator is
all about I am in a crazy job in the
future that I really probably wouldn't
want to do in real life so there's some
kind of some kind of corporate drone job
cubicles all around me usually VR
experiences don't let you just reach out
grab objects and throw them around
that's something that's been pretty new
for this game and because we have these
PlayStation Move controllers in the
camera they're tracking it all we can do
that yes game within a game so meta
so that was job simulator 2015 now let's
try something a little bit different
instead of playing around with my
cubicle environment I'm in the cockpit
of a space spider audio is really
immersive too even though this is a set
of discrete headphones aren't built into
the headset could definitely tell that
there's some thrusters behind me that
are propelling this ship headsets really
comfortable too I mean I can do all
these motions without feeling like
there's a lot of weight on my forehead
or the back of my head or anything
and the whole that just shattered I
take my ships toast
these are just two of the many virtual
reality experiences announced this year
and for just one of the major VR
headsets we expected 2016 but there are
a lot of fun they really feel to me like
killer apps for the platform reasons you
might buy a VR headset to begin with I'm
looking forward to playing both of them
next year</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
