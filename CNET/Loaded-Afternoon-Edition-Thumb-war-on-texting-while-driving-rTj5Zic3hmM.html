Best Buy launched its streaming video
service called cinema live it lets you
stream movies over the internet with
connected blu-ray players HD TVs and
online at cinema now calm to start it
works with LG blu-ray players and home
theater systems but it should be
compatible with other manufacturers
later this year Apple updated the
macbook today it now has a faster Intel
processor with the 2.4 gigahertz intel
core 2 duo and a faster nvidia geforce
graphics cards it also claims a longer
battery life up from seven hours to 10
hours on a single charge the price is
the same 9 99 hotmail is going to get a
much-needed facelift there will be more
storage spam detection integrated chat
conversation threading and a better
mobile experience on your cell phone
there will also be a bing sidebar and
embedded video capability from YouTube
Hulu and more these changes won't go
into effect until later this summer if
you want to put them into your bad
texting and driving habit try the thumb
suck what are your thumb socks now and
join the fight against texting while
driving wear them while you drive and
give them out of school they make it
impossible to text while wearing them
this is part of a national no texting on
the road campaign the socks are free and
you can order them for groups as a sort
of feel good gesture you probably still
could text while you're wearing them but
you know this can't hurt unless it
weakens your grip on the wheel those are
all your headlines for now we will be
back in the morning with more so stay
tuned i'm natali del conte with cnettv
and you've just been loaded</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
