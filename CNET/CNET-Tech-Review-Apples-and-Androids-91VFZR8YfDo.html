for G is coming just maybe not to you
adobe photoshop gets an update the
latest imac upgrade is our editors
choice and how to find the returns
department at the iTunes Store it's all
coming up right now
hey everyone I'm Brian Tong and welcome
to the scene that tech review Mollywood
is off this week so that means I'm in
charge of picking the hottest videos of
the week and bringing you the good ones
the bad ones and offering some sage
bottom-line advice because I am to be
trusted let's kick things off with the
good stuff when we first saw the HTC evo
4g kent german was drooling all over it
at ctia in barcelona this week Bonnie
chopped finally got a chance to put it
through its paces how'd it hold up it's
in the good section for a reason take a
look hey everyone I'm Bonnie cha senior
editor at cnet com and i've got your
first look at the much-anticipated HTC
evo 4g for sprint as many of you know
this is the first 4g smartphone
available in the US and that comes with
a lot of pressure does it deliver all
and all the hype well let's take a look
as far as the design the evo is very
similar to the HTC hd2 it's actually a
bit bigger than the hd2 but HTC still
manages to keep it relatively thin so
it's still pretty manageable plus you
might be willing to overlook the large
size when you get a glimpse of the
massive display measures 4.3 inches
diagonally and has a sharp wvga
resolution so it's fantastic for viewing
webpages photos and reading text there's
even a handy kickstand on the back that
will let you prop the phone on a desk so
you can watch videos or slide shows
without having to hold the device in
your hand the evo is also relatively
easy to use and extremely customizable
thanks to HTC Sense senses HTC's custom
skin for the Android platform and it's
always been our favorite because it
makes the OS look less techy and
actually enhances a lot of the phone's
core applications for example in the
phone app a tabbed menu along the bottom
lets you easily filter through messages
based on status attachments group or
meeting invite and it also improves the
standard Android media player by
bringing a nicer Cover Flow like
interface underneath sense the evo is
running android 2.1 which is currently
the most recent version of android
available so you're getting some of the
latest features like google maps with
navigation voice to text entry and live
wallpapers
but if you're an Android fan you know
that android 2.2 also known as froyo is
coming soon I asked sprint about whether
they would provide an update to froyo
when available and they said they're not
announcing anything right now but what
we should focus on right now is the 4g
capabilities of the evo vivos the first
phone to take advantage of Sprint's
wimax network which claims to provide
wireless speeds of up to 10 times faster
than today's 3g average 3g download
speeds come in around 600 kilobits per
second to 1.4 megabits per second while
4g averages around 3 megabits per second
to 6 megabits per second sprint's 4g
isn't available in new york's yet so I
went down to Philadelphia where they do
have it to put these claims test and the
evo did deliver I averaged around 3.4 2
megabits per second for download speeds
and upload speeds of 0.9 3 megabits per
second so it was on the lower end of the
spectrum but I also did a 3g speed test
to compare with 4G and I was getting
0.77 megabits per second down and zero
point three point zero point three five
megabits per second up so definitely a
huge difference the evil also comes with
a number of features that can take
advantage of 4G it's actually going to
be the first to ship with a YouTube high
quality player and also ships with a
quick video chat and a front-facing 1.3
megapixel camera so you can make video
calls unfortunately our review unit
didn't come preloaded with the quick
chat app but we're hoping to check it
out later the evo can also be used as
mobile hotspot and can connect up to
eight devices just be aware that this is
going to cost you an additional thirty
dollars per month the civil silver
lining there is that there's no data cap
there's a lot more to this phone but the
video would go on forever if I try to
cover it all overall I'd say the evo 4g
is easily the best smartphone that
sprint has to offer and certainly one of
the best android phones on the market
it's packed with tons of features and
it's powerful and it does deliver on the
Ford II promise I'm just disappointed
that they're launching it with so few 4g
markets currently Sprint's wimax network
is live in 32 cities and the carrier
promises to bring that up that total up
to 44 cities by the end of the year
including New York San Francisco la
Cincinnati in Miami I can the additional
ten dollars for four G's a fair price
but it's unfair to me to make this ad on
mandatory and they know a lot of people
have been unhappy about this in the
grand scheme of things for in stata
plans are much less than its competitors
and there is no data cap with a premium
add-on but still if you live in a 3d
only market I can understand why you'd
be unhappy about paying for something
you're not actually getting hopefully
spring can really start lighting up
additional 4G markets quickly so people
can get their money's worth and let the
evo for do you really live up to its
full potential the HTC evo 4g will be
available starting june fourth for 1 99
99 with a two-year contract i'm bonnie
town this has been your first look at
the HTC evo 4g now I'm pretty attached
to my iphone but as soon as 4G is up and
running here in San Francisco I'll be
drooling as much as Ken now some of you
may know that I host a show here at cnet
called the apple byte where we break
down everything that goes on in the
world of Apple lately most of the bus
has been centered around the iPad and
the impending announcement of the new
iphone but behind the scenes Apple has
been upgrading the processors in many of
their laptops and desktops as well
here's rich brown with his review of the
big daddy of the imac family hi I'm rich
brown senior editor for cnet.com today
we're going to take a look at apple's
highest end 27-inch imac so we say
highest end and that's because the base
model for this unit starts at 1999
unlike the 1699 version this one comes
with a core i5 cpu actually has four
cores that's the only four core chip
available in Apple's imac line this
particular model though actually has a
core i7 CPU in it which is a little bit
faster than core i5 also costs a little
bit more so it's 200 bucks that makes
our review unit 2199 so what you get for
that price is the fastest own one
currently available as well as a tall
one with the largest screen even Sony's
highest and on one only has a 24 inch
monitor so Apple remodeled its imac line
back in the fall and there's a few
different design element
if you're familiar with the 1699 iMac
nothing has changed it's basically the
same in the exterior there's
edge-to-edge glass going across the
front of the system and up at the top
you get a webcam now the effect of the
screen with the glass and with the
glossy coating is that it's very bright
appears very crisp the image is great
for watching movies for images playing
games now that you can get steam on the
imac the keyboard mouse both wireless
are now included with the imac you can
see here it's sort of a trim down design
familiar chiclet keyboard you've got
batteries that go in here and a keyboard
power button over here for the mouse
this is apple's new magic mouse it's got
a pretty unique design to it we don't
really love the sort of sharp edge as
you get there and it's feels a little
too tapered in the front and though it
has some gesture-based touch sensitive
features built into it it's really not
the most intuitive experience so it's
certainly a serviceable mouse but we
can't say we love it sigh the imac here
you can see there's a slot loading DVD
Drive Apple still does not use blu-ray
and down here finally which is new to
this generation of vimax is an SD card
slot which makes it easy to swap data
between mobile devices on your computer
now the back of the system you can see
that it's pretty clean design there's
the same reports down here in the bottom
edge you get a couple audio outputs as
well as four USB firewire 800 Jack mini
DisplayPort jack which we'll get to in a
minute so as the ethernet input the
system of course comes with wireless and
bluetooth built-in so in terms of
networking you're pretty much covered so
what's also unique to this new
generation of imax is that the mini
displayport is bi-directional that means
you can not only send the signal out
from the imac you can send signals into
it for example you could take a macbook
pro connected to the imac to use this as
a secondary monitor that's obviously a
very useful feature and extends the life
of the imac once the computer parts are
obsolete but we're a little bit
frustrated by it because with other on
one's from windows-based vendors we've
seen HDMI ports built in that let you
connect say game console or cable box
unfortunately at least out of the box
you can only connect other macs to the
imax so it's a little bit frustrating
now you can't actually find on the
market hdmi to mini DisplayPort adapters
that will let you connect game consoles
or other devices they're expensive
though they cost about 150
same goes with the wall mounting
technically you can pop the standoff
connect a visa compatible wall mount to
the back of the imac and mount it up
wherever you want to but most
windows-based all-in-ones have that
functionality built in so you certainly
could take the imac in its giant screen
and transform it into sort of a Mac
based media center you definitely have
to want it you have to be willing to
spend a little bit more than what you
get out of the box and it's not really
the most convenient process so we hope
Apple is listening and eventually they
might take steps to make that a little
more streamlined despite those
limitations the imac is still one of the
best all in ones you can buy that's why
it's an editor's choice because it has a
giant screen and fafsa performers in its
category so i'm rich brown this is the
27-inch core i7 you know with that
27-inch screen and that super fast
processor that imac could be great for
one of my favorite hobbies drawing in my
abs in beach pictures and luckily for me
a brand-new version of photoshop just
came out to seth rosenblatt is here with
a tour of photoshop cs5
Photoshop has been in the English
lexicon as a term to edit images for a
long long time with the latest version
of Adobe's flagship program stretches
the canvas of manipulation much farther
than ever before hi I'm Seth Rosenblatt
frisina download com and in this first
look video we're taking a quick peek at
adobe's major update to photoshop the
look of the program has changed so
little from photoshop cs4 that users of
that version should be instantly
comfortable with this major update but
photoshop creative suite 5 also known as
photoshop version 12 gives photographers
artists designers and low cats
obsessives with too much money on their
hands a stunning array of new tools
among the new features in adobe's
flagship image editing software are
automatic lens correction high dynamic
range toning automated editing tools and
significant improvements to creating 3d
images let's look at the new automatic
lens correction option which will fix an
image that has been distorted by a
geometric distortion chromatic
aberration or vignetting go to filter
lens correction and examine the tabs as
you can see the panel is loaded with
options and the process to fix this
photo can be complex you're pretty much
required to read or watch a tutorial to
get it right if you need high-end image
manipulation though this and many of the
other new features our killer must haves
one of the new automated editing tools
that's been getting rightfully a lot of
attention is the content aware fill
option lets you remove an object from an
image with a simple mouse stroke and
replace it with pitch perfect
approximations to match the surrounding
light color and noise of the area it can
be used as part of the Spot Healing
Brush or with the selection tool while
the Spot Healing Brush isn't new to cs5
the content aware function is and it
makes Spot Healing much more accurate
than before an excellent improvement to
the Photoshop workflow in cs5 is the
introduction of the mini bridge mini
bridge creates a panel within Photoshop
for directly accessing all of bridges
features but without the hassle of
having to switch windows it's a long
overdue and logical improvement
users who need photoshop's 3d features
will be impressed by the ones available
in photoshop cs5 extended this is a
pricier version of the program and
includes all the features of the
standard Photoshop along with 3d editing
tools part of extended is adobe repo say
which allows users to convert 2d images
to 3d and then edit the extrusion
properties photoshop cs5 is nothing less
than a boundary-pushing leap forward for
the premiere image editor at one hundred
and ninety nine dollars for an upgrade
or 699 for a brand-new version and a
multitude of lower price than even free
alternatives with varying degrees of
less power you really should think twice
about whether you need this
multi-faceted complex but undeniably
excellent program with a first look at
photoshop cs5 i'm seth rosenblatt for
download com that content aware fill
option is ridiculous and i can't wait to
use it for cutting ex-girlfriend's out
of my vacation photos and there are a
lot of them not really now in addition
to the apple byte i also hosts a show
called tap that app where i sift through
tons of apps for the iphone and ipad but
did you know that there's a way to
return apps well neither did I until I
shot this how-to video there are times
where some of us get a little app happy
I know you've been there and we
purchased the wrong app from apple's app
store I recently purchased the Iron Man
2 game I know don't judge me but I
accidentally purchased the iphone
version instead of the one for the ipad
i'm brian Tong for cnet com and i'll
show you a little trick that a lot of
people don't know about how to return
apps that you've already purchased now
Before we jump into this I want to
emphasize that this is not intended to
be used to buy a nap then return it and
hurt the developers because these guys
are the people that are making our
gadgets more enjoyable so let's respect
that alright the first thing you have to
do is purchase some apps from the App
Store through your iphone ipod touch
ipad or computer or wherever now once
you've done that jump into itunes at in
the top right hand corner find your
username
select account and login let's go to
your purchase history and then you'll
see a list of dates and order numbers
select the date that you made the
purchase and you'll see an order
breakdown then click on report a problem
and an option will show up next to the
price of each app find the booboo that
you made in this case it's going to be
iron man 2 for me that was 699 and click
report a problem a prompt will appear
and you'll need to select the problem
that you had and add any comments I
explained my iron man 2 issue and also
told them how I purchase the ipad
version immediately afterwards submit it
and you'll receive a confirmation email
it only took about a day for an iTunes
rep to get back to me but I received an
email telling me the charges would be
reversed now that Dustin reservist
there's really no reason to return a
99-cent app and you do have up to 90
days to request a refund but hopefully
this feature helps you the same way it
helped me out I'm Brian Shawn for cnet
com with your how-to for refunding apps
respect your developers and use it
wisely
again I want to stress at the point of
this video is not to rip off the find
people who create these apps because
that would be bad but if you have a
legitimate problem with the purchase
like I did it's good to know there is a
way to fix it now on that note it's time
to take a break but don't go anywhere
we'll be right back with sock monkeys
not bad for your daily dose of tech news
check out see nuts loaded it's packed
full the latest tech news highlights
that matter to you find out the latest
gadgets or the coolest gizmos all that
more monday through thursday at cnet com
flash loaded welcome back guys i'm brian
Tong and this is the scene attack review
so far we've seen plenty of good stuff
but it's not all puppies and roses in
the tech world so let's move on to the
bad last week molly explained how Tom
aired has moved on to greener pastures
but we couldn't let him go without one
more look at some of the worst programs
to ever appear on download.com take a
look at this installment of the top five
worst downloads for spring 2010
welcome to Cena top 5 home for wayward
lists I'm Tom Merritt spring it's a time
of renewal for everyone that is except
Seth Rosenblatt he's our intrepid cnet
reviewer charged with digging in to
download.com vault every three months
and dragging the worst examples of
software into the light of day and they
all seem to love it so let's count down
the top 5 worst downloads at number 5
who is on my Wi-Fi I'm not asking that's
the name of the program also known as
what my Wi-Fi router already does now
granted this one is free so I guess for
those of you too lazy to pull up your
router in a browser window this could be
good coming in to number four you are
celeb yes you are you know what makes
you a celeb having money to burn on a
program to make fake magazine covers yep
high roller who can just waste 15 bucks
on a program that does what you can
easily do in Microsoft Paint up to
number 3 NB fashion astrology okay maybe
you don't have the same problem Seth
does with astrology or fashion no matter
what you have to admit this is a pretty
ugly program for something that's
supposed to use Sun signs to tell you
how to look chic sliding it a number two
internet explorer toolbars seth has
lumped a whole category together here
noting that microsoft itself has put out
a white paper confirming that toolbars
have got to go if you want browser
stability that is if not have adam
before we get to number one let's
cleanse the worst download palette with
a look at some good downloads these at
the top five most popular downloads on
cnet download.com right now how restful
for the eyes all right let's get to our
number one the worst download of the
spring according to the man who knows
CNET's seth rosenblatt at number one
it's man juice yes I just said man juice
it's a seduction and dating simulation
game with a textual RPG interface
features include approaching girls
training pick up skills
and traveling to different cities man
juice makes iPad sound positively
prosaic well that's it for this edition
of CNN top 5 don't forget to visit cnet
download.com for many many good
downloads there's more good than bad out
there but now you know what to avoid I'm
Tom Merritt see you next time
man juice huh yeah I'm not going to
touch that at all anyways look for a
brand new batch of top five countdown
starring our very own Brian Cooley in
the next few weeks and stick around for
more bc coming up later in the show
continuing on with the theme of bad back
in October Bonnie Chow reviewed the
garmin nuvi phone the first smartphone
from the gps device maker and let's just
say she was less than impressed in fact
that phone only received two out of a
possible five stars on cnet's rating
scale now the company is back with their
new garmin phone for t-mobile let's find
out if it's as bad as the first one hi
I'm Bonnie cha senior editor at cnet com
and today I've got your first look at
the garmin phone for t-mobile this is a
second smartphone from gps maker garmin
and even though i've only had the device
for a few hours so far can already tell
you that it's a huge improvement over
the garmin nuvi phone which was released
on AT&amp;amp;T back in october two thousand
nine for one thing the garminfone has a
sleeker design I don't know if you
remember the nuvi phone but it was a bit
of a brick and just looked really boring
but the garminfone is a bit sexier with
a nice shiny finish on the front and has
a slimmer profile so it's easier to
carry around as a phone and a handheld
navigator it also features a higher
resolution screen so everything looks
sharper and colors pop a bit more the
built-in accelerometer is also much more
responsive to switch the screen
orientation when you rotate the phone
but more than anything else I think what
really makes the biggest difference here
is that the garminfone is running
Android the original newbie phone was a
linux-based system and although it had
all the elements of a smartphone
features weren't integrated well and the
capabilities just seemed half-baked but
we know that Android is a proven OS and
also brings such things as all the
Google services a better browser android
marketplace support for amazon mp3 store
and more as you can see it's not running
the standard android skin garmin
customize the user interface to
prominently feature the navigation
capabilities on the home screen which i
think is fine I think the UI is pretty
easy to use and you can expand the tray
from the right side and scroll through
all your available apps and you can drag
and drop your most frequently use
programs to this bar here which
can easily access from the main screen
the one downside is that the garminfone
is only running android 1.6 but t-mobile
has set the device is capable of
over-the-air updates and is working on
providing an android 2.1 update of
course as a Garmin device you get a heap
of navigation features smartphone comes
with pre-loaded maps of North America
and nearly 6 million points of interest
can create routes for the car or in
pedestrian mode and offers voice guided
directions there's even an app called
Garmin voice studio where you can have a
family member or a friend record a set
of instructions and let that be the
voice you hear when getting directions
Garmin's connected services are also
available which lets you search for
nearby gas prices restaurants and movie
times real-time traffic and weather data
and this time it's included in the price
of the phone which is 1 99 99 with a
2-year contract you don't have to pay an
extra monthly subscription fee like the
nuvi phone required also included in the
price of the phone is a car mount the
garmin phone will be available from
t-mobile in june we're definitely
looking forward to taking it out for a
test drive to see how it does on the
road but so far we've been pretty happy
with what we've seen I'm Bonnington this
has been your first look at the
garminfone from t-mobile in this case it
looks like the second time's a charm and
I just hope it's compatible with Android
2.2 which was also announced this week
now the moment you've been waiting for
this week's bottom line usually Brian
Cooley likes to work alone but when he
took the 2011 kia sorento out for a spin
he brought a little friend along for the
ride poor little guy
you know the Kia Sorento it's the car
the sock monkey and his friends take to
Vegas
but i'm guessing the inanimate set
probably didn't check the tech very well
we'll take care of that now in the 2011
sorrento IX front wheel drive
now you can bet nobody either cloth or
human never rolled like that in the
previous sorento a dowdy dough ball of
the thing that nobody noticed but this
second-generation vehicle which is
hitting the u.s. now as a 2011 looks
alright part of that is thanks to a
design by Peter Schreyer best known for
doing the TT while he was over at Audi
look around this sorrento this is not
the kia sorento you'da seen before it's
not really what you think of in a kia
the interior materials the feel the soft
plastics the fake metal the leather
seats are significantly nicer than other
cars in this price class because
hyundai-kia knows they've got some image
catching up to do and they're working on
it pretty hard and I'd say rather
successfully now we've got the advanced
head unit this is an optional thing part
of a limited package but it gives you of
course navigation right off the bat and
I like this map the screens not that
large but the rendering the graphics the
style of the information on it is I
think very easy to digest with a quick
glance I understand how they're
representing traffic that makes sense i
know that red means traffic there are
some other systems that use read to mean
road that makes no sense to me but while
that nav system which is good looking
and operates well is an optional piece
the audio sources are all standard and
they're pretty darn good first of all
you've got am/fm radio but no HD radio
satellite you've got serious for that
choice now under CD aux we have access
to our USB or our aux jack right next to
it or with the kia cable it becomes an
ipod connection I don't have a kia cable
there didn't come with the car if
somebody lost it so here i am trying to
use my ipod white USB cable nope doesn't
work i tried to add an aux cable with it
nope that didn't make it work either
then i open the manual it says don't do
this because that may burn something up
in the car whoops pulled that right out
my point is this i'm not crazy about
systems that require you to have a
special automaker USB ipod aux cable to
use your ipod or your ipod touch that's
not a good thing to me because you're
going to lose that cable and got to buy
another one and they're more expensive
than the one you might get down at
RadioShack phone this is a nice one look
at this I've got my blackberry paired
and the a2dp stereo bluetooth streaming
again standard with this car and of
course if you got bluetooth streaming
you definitely have Bluetooth hands-free
for calling all that bundled in whether
you get the upgraded head unit or not
that's a nice array of entertainment
options now I've got a rear view camera
on that same screen as well but that's
not part of the net
negation package you got to get another
package to get that it's in the premium
package which includes roof rails and
leather seats what's the connection
don't do that guys roll in the rear view
camera with the upgraded head unit
package to make it part of upholstery
that doesn't connect except with my
wallet and I see right through it now
our Sorento ax is missing one option an
engine well I guess that's an engine
looks as though they forgot to put it in
though there's enough room in there for
another engine and I kind of wish we had
to because this is a gutless little
thing 2.4 liter inline 4 175 horsepower
hundred and sixty nine foot pounds of
torque it's not up to the job now the
good thing about putting in an
underachieving power plant is you can
often get some overachieving mpg and we
do pretty well on that count 21 29 on
this guy front-wheel drive 21-27 if you
go for all wheel drive I would trade a
few mpg just a few to have a little more
power there's a v6 version of this car
drive it before you decide to buy one of
these one gearbox choice in our Sorento
e ex a 6-speed automatic with the usual
shift ability it doesn't make a whole
lot of difference with this engine
driving the Sorento with the
four-cylinder is an exercise in thinking
ahead about when you're going to need
power because it doesn't have it when
you need it doesn't matter what you do
the gearbox i'm in drive i'm in the
sport Matic mode I've shifted it
aggressively and it just doesn't matter
it's a slow responding slippery out of
breath powertrain the right qualities
tight as a drum no rattles no squeaks no
float or flop it's a nice independent
suspension but it's almost too simply
taught it feels too much like your
writing on Springs as opposed to a more
sophisticated compliant underpinning so
bottom line is you're not going to get
that feeling of a budget lexus rx on
this vehicle the way you might think but
it's still a good value for the money
ok let's price this 2011 kia sorento ex
front wheel drive is twenty five six
base that includes destination and a
scene at this guy yep you start with the
limited package for two thousand dollars
that gets you the nav with traffic the
infinity audio upgrade though the
sources are the same as base and these
do they really still think those are
cool chrome wheels if you won't get the
rear view camera you got to go for the
premium package which also adds in
leather and the roof rails you're going
to be annoyed by that right down to the
last minute and for the world's smallest
third row seat at seven hundred bucks if
you learn only one thing from the show
let it be this week's bottom line keep
coolly away from your children's toys
but it is nice to see that he's getting
out there and meeting people or sock
monkeys okay that's our show for this
week thanks again to Molly for letting
me fill in while she's away she'll be
back next week with another round up of
cnet video but until then you can find
more of the goodies kids go for at Cena
