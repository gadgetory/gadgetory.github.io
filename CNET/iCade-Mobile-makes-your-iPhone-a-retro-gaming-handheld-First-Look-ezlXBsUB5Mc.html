if they were fantasized about taking
your iphone or your iPod Touch and
turning it effectively into a game gear
that's right this is a old-fashioned
sega game gear from maybe the 90s the
mid-90s well yeah you can do that with
thanks to the ion icade mobile a seventy
dollar accessory that works with iOS
devices like the iPhone and iPod touch
you can see the ones inserted right here
and much like an old game gear you've
got a d-pad and buttons even got
shoulder buttons on the back now I'm a
big handheld gamer I have all the
handheld game systems and I know one of
the big beefs about handheld touchscreen
devices like the iPhone is that there
are no buttons and there are ton of
great games hey wouldn't you like to be
able to play Street Fighter and use
buttons well not so fast the icade
mobile is an offshoot of the icade
arcade cabinet that came out last year
and if you use that you know that only a
certain number of games work with the
icade it basically fools the iphone into
thinking that it's a keyboard and pairs
with it that way you enter a certain
number of buttons to activate it and
then you're paired and set and as a
result there's no analog control pad
here which is frustrating and you can
already tell it a lot of games like
shooters wouldn't work on this there are
a number of fun retro games like Ataris
arcade greatest hits midway arcade and
some indie titles that are retro
inspired like super crate box that work
really well at the icade oh wait no they
don't they don't work with the icade
mobile yet not all of them in fact Atari
arcade greatest hits and super crate box
at this point don't and I'm sure a lot
of them will be updated to work with the
icade mobile but you have to basically
look on ions website and see which of
the games work and which don't which is
a hassle the ones that do work work
really nicely you can play joust on this
thing and hey the buttons respond really
well but the whole construction of this
is big and bulky to double-a batteries
going to the back you actually have to
unscrew a panel which is a little
frustrating and it adds a lot of weight
this thing is not pocket-sized unless
you've got king size cargo pant pockets
or enjoy carrying a holster
pack with you it's not as big as a game
gear but it's getting close it kind of
looks like an atari lynx and if you're
paying seventy dollars for this on top
of whatever games you're purchasing
that's a lot of dough it doesn't include
any games with the package you know what
else can be said about this it's not
that pretty and that's another downside
I think this looks like a kind of a
generic third-party gaming peripheral
and the buttons are a little rattling
loose feeling they work but they feel
kind of like a little knock off and this
whole rubber holster that keeps your
iPhone or iPod Touch in which can also
rotate keeps it in sturdily but it pokes
out a bit on the sides it doesn't it
feels like a little weird when it gloms
on here you can't access your volume
buttons or your your top buttons up here
it's just not that pretty and it does
come with a little rubber insert so you
can put an ipod touch in there but it
feels kind of like a hack and at seventy
dollars you would expect something a
little more elegant than a hack the ion
icade mobile would be awesome if it
worked with a whole bunch of games if
you could download games on the App
Store and you could play any game you
wanted with these controls well that
would be the fantasy that's not allowed
right now companies aren't finding it
very easy to create a universal
controller for the iPhone or iPod touch
this is I guess the next best thing
right now although be nice to see analog
pads and it really adds up to a neither
here nor there a product that would be
maybe a fun stocking stuffer for those
who like retro games but at seventy
dollars that's an expensive stocking
stuffer and we're not at the holidays
yet I'm Scott Steinman that's a look at
the ion icade mobile for the iphone and
ipod touch</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
