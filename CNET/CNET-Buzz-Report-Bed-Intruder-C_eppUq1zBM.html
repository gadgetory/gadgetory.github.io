buzz report the show about the tech news
that everyone is talking about this week
it's a blackberry ban the death of
google wave and the best clogging the
tubes ever but first it's the gadget of
the week the gadget of the week is the
blackberry torch it's BlackBerry's
answer to the touchscreen smartphone
craze and it's running the new
blackberry OS six which now offers
universal search a nicer music player
pinch-to-zoom on the browser and better
social networking integration if that
all sounds familiar it's because all the
competition has had that for a while now
as for the hardware you get a 624
megahertz processor not the one
gigahertz of say a droid x or an HTC evo
8 gigs of total measly storage no
front-facing camera a low resolution
screen and no extra goodies like HDMI
out and it's only available on ATT hey
don't knock it because the torch may
look pathetically behind the times
compared to iPhone or Android but if the
most cutting-edge phone you've been
using is the blackberry bold the torch
is killing it it's a low bar speaking of
blackberry news the United Arab Emirates
and Saudi Arabia announced they will ban
the blackberry because of national
security concerns in fact Saudi Arabia
said its blackberry ban will go into
effect pretty much now August sixth the
band includes foreign visitors who will
be able to make calls while in those
countries but they won't be able to use
any data services now the UAE and Saudi
Arabia say they don't like the fact that
blackberry data is stored offshore and
it's heavily encrypted so they can't
monitor the data the BlackBerry users
are sending back and forth which
actually when they put it that way that
is a pretty good ad for blackberry in
other news google is discontinuing
google wave in a blog post wednesday the
company said it will not produce wave as
a standalone product anymore and will
instead work on developing things that
all those stupid people who don't work
at Google can actually figure out how to
use big news from Apple Insider this
week which uncovered information that
suggests the next version of the ipad
will include a camera yeah they
uncovered this information in a big file
folder marked da
also from the Department of really the
FBI is asking Wikipedia to remove images
of its seal from its pages the g-men say
that the unauthorized use of the seal
violates federal law even though
Wikipedia is an encyclopedia plus the
FBI says people could use Wikipedia is
high-res image and then use the logo
inappropriately or even commit crimes
with it or they could just google FBI
seal and use one of the two hundred
fifty-four thousand image results that
turn up aren't there bigger crimes than
this happening in the country speaking
of crime let's take a look at what's
clogging the tubes this week because wow
antoine dodson of huntsville alabama
saved his sister from a would-be rapist
who had climbed in her bedroom window
then he gave this angry interview to
local television antoine dodson heard
his sister screams and ran to help well
obviously we have a rapist in making
part he's climbing in your windows he's
snatching your people up trying to rape
em so y'all need to hide your kids hide
your wife and hedgehogs because they
raping everybody out here so then the
angry interview was auto tuned into song
by the amazing Gregory Brothers
obviously
I hide your wife
oh boy and then not only did the
auto-tune go massively viral they're now
like 300 or so covers of the bed
intruder song
so so old he's climbing in your windows
and snatching your people up trying to
rape them phones if you hide your kids
hide you I hide your kids hide your wife
and hide your husband cuz they're rapin
everybody out here yeah the internet is
a weird place and then we got to
thinking here at buzz report how could

ourselves a window seat to hell and that
is the bus report for this week everyone
