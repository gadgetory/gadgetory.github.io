so I prefer to think of the ff01 concept
not so much as a concept car but more of
a car of concepts an extreme testbed for
the fundamental ideas were working on
for up-and-coming production vehicles we
put the users needs first and that
begins with the interior we started with
an all-white interior
appear an extremely clean aesthetic that
wouldn't be practical in a traditional
internal combustion racecar the seat
design was inspired by NASA research on
zero-gravity driving positions so the
driver is placed at a 45 degree angle
and it optimizes comfort and maximizes
circulation we've created a
drive-by-wire asymmetric instrument
panel built around the features the
driver utilizes the most this propeller
shaped instrument panel previews an
important piece of forthcoming FF design
DNA located in the spine of the headrest
is a halo safety safety system which
integrates a head and neck support
connection as well as an oxygen supply
and water supply through a port of our
prototype helmet that we also developed
in-house we're looking at connectivity
and customization in a whole new way
that goes far beyond automatic climbing
patrol or a seat that remembers your
driving position we're taking the
innovative intuitive movements of
digital devices and applying them to the
interior of the vehicle incorporating
swipes pinches and touches augmented
reality is projected on the road as your
digital copilot so this vehicle
reeducate sit self continuously about
your needs in real time a smartphone is
actually docked in this steering wheel
allowing the driver to access
information control secondary functions
view live images track their position
all without having to learn a new
control language now let's take a look
at the exterior as with a digital device
the racecar is covered in contrasting
matte and gloss finishes smooth and
three-dimensional surfaces and light and
dark values that connect the exterior to
the interior it's an extreme tablet on
wheels</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
