Bakalar for cnet.com hosted the
fluorophore show I'm here at the
predator 3d booth to celebrate the
film's 30th anniversary they're
releasing a 3d blu-ray and I'm here with
the predator himself hi
we he's agreed not to kill me to have
this interview and he actually told me I
could call him Roger so I'm pretty
excited about that as well so okay those
eyes are terrifying how are you doing
he's good he's good alright he speaks
English that's awesome
so what you can do at the booth here is
pre-order the blu-ray or you could
pre-order a special edition head we take
his head and they have a 500 then made
if you preorder it you're allowed to get
an action figure with your head that
looks like the predator has ripped your
head off of your body and your spines
just tingling it's actually quite
terrifying camera and I'm gonna take
eight images simultaneously then we're
gonna take those eight images and in
about a minute or so we're gonna process
them into a 3d model of your face and
throw that on the predator can I make a
face can you can make a little bit of a
dead face my face gets really twisted or
whatever else you'll end up being really
twisted on the head so we don't want
that my face is already jacked up enough
okay all right so I'm have you look
right in the center camera you ready
three two one
do you see all eight of them go yeah
nice all right so they're gonna pop up
here oh cool we'll see if we can oh
that's a pretty solid dead face okay so
I just got my photo taken with the eight
cameras over there and now I get to come
over here and basically design how my
head's gonna look on the action figure
so I can move it around in this 3d sort
of thing that's upsetting that I'm
completely bald there but what I'm gonna
do is change the hairstyle I guess so
okay now I got like kind of like a
Barney Rubble thing going on there like
that
maybe blue hair that's pretty fantastic
I don't know about you I'm looking
pretty good let's see what else what
other hairstyles oh there we go
I like that what do you think need a
little blonde more realistic perhaps so
check it out this is what the actual
action figure is gonna look like I'm not
gonna lie I kind of do look like that
little guy over there and this is really
upsetting now that I see my head cut off
there the company putting these together
there's 3d systems and about four to
five weeks I'm gonna have my very own so
you want to get in there it's pretty
it's pretty upsetting but awesome at the
same time so that's it from the predator
3d booth here in comic-con you're in
town make sure you come by you can
pre-order the blu-ray that's out in
December get yourself an action figure
while you're at it I'm Jeff Bakalar for
