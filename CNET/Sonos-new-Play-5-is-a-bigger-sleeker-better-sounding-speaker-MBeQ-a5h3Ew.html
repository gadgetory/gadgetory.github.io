steadily adding speakers to its
multi-room audio lineup but his flagship
tabletop speaker the play five hasn't
changed in six years until now that is
this is the new play five a bigger
sleeker and significantly better
sounding speaker it costs five hundred
dollars or a hundred dollars more than
the previous model but after hearing it
I'd say it's worth the extra dough it
comes in two colors white and black and
can be placed either horizontally or
vertically in three different
orientations total I personally liked
the look of its standing vertically and
while the speaker works well as a single
speaker with a wider soundstage and
better clarity than the previous play
five if you can spring for two of these
guys can create a stereo pair and get
some real stereo separation the speaker
also delivers significantly more bass
than the previous play five it's got six
drivers including three mid woofers and
three tweeters as you'd expect the new
speaker works with all of sonís
existing smart speakers and the company
has created a new true play tuning
system to help you get the best sound
out of your sono speaker's based on
their placement in a particular room you
calibrate your speaker or speakers using
a free app and the microphone on your
iPhone or iPad initially at least true
play is iOS only though Sonos does have
both iOS and Android apps to set up and
control your system on your mobile
device the speaker itself does have new
touch controls that enable you to play
pause adjust volume and change the track
and what's cool is that smart sensors in
the speaker make the touch controls
responsive to all orientations so the
volume up is always facing up we'll have
more about the sound in our text review
but that's a quick first look at sonís
is new and improved and slightly pricier
flagship speaker to play five I'm David
