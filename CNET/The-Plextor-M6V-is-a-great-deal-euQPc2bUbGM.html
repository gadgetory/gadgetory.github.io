the plextor might have something for you
hello I'm Domo and this is the plextor
am sick Vee SSD now V stand for velocity
but it can also stand for value because
this one is one of the most affordable
drive on the market now this 256
gigabyte capacity here has a suggested
retail price up just hundred dollars and
that means a street price is going to be
even lower than that the drive is also
available in 128 gigabyte and 512gb by
now this is a standard SSD to replace
any regular hard drive like this laptop
one or even this desktop one right here
and when you do your computer would
performs a lot faster a lot a lot faster
that is because in my testing the drive
here x-out in almost all categories in
fact its core sometime even close to
that of much more expensive higher-end
drives now the M stick deliver that
performance because it has the smarts
kitching feature called plex turbo
three-point oh that's automatically
detect and catches frequently accessed
data to improve performance over time
now on the downside the plextor here
does not include any backup or drive
cloning software it also come with a
short three year warranty or thing
consider though is still an excellent
drive now to find out more on why it is
an excellent drive check out my full
review at cnet com but if you don't like
reading just what this first look video
five or six times in a row and go ahead
and get it you will not be disappointed
and that's because i'm dumb know and i
recommend this mcig v SSD for flixster</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
