welcome to the Apple by for everything
good and bad inside the world of Apple
now if you want to get your first taste
of iOS 10 and I know there's a lot of
you the public beta is available now you
can get access by signing up for apples
beta software program online for free
but I will warn you to put it on a
secondary device because not all your
apps may work the same way you know
because it's a beta but not everyone
really cares about that they just want
the new stuff now apples also seated the
second developer beta for iOS 10 TV OS
watchos trace and my name is mako's
Sierra I did that for you iOS beta 2
gets a few new tweaks like handling your
widgets that you can access at any time
with a swipe from the notifications new
3d touch options in the control center
for the flashlight and timer and your
medical ID has the option for organ
donation so I could give my heart to you
it also looks like the voicemail
transcription feature is starting to
roll out the actual feature is still in
beta itself but you can tap on an
individual voicemail and voila the
transcription is there pretty sweet also
I could go on and on about watch os3 and
you know it's completely changed about
how I feel about the Apple watch because
I'm wearing it almost every day now
we've talked about what makes it
different but one of the new app
editions is called breathe this isn't a
throwaway app and it's actually useful
for simple deep breathing exercises that
can help you relax your body and quiet
your mind I've used it in its really a
nice feature to have plus you can even
set reminders to take in a deep breath
just breathe
hey what's up hi
so yeah that still wants to make me
throw up in my mouth you can adjust how
often the breathe out remind you but
even after all that I still love watch
os3 I'll write a report from digit times
claims Apple may switch to micro LED
displays for the Apple watch in the
second half of 2017 at the earliest
moving away from the current OLED
screens the timeline would suggest OLED
screens would still be around for the
Apple watch to and micro LED panels
would be ready for the Apple watch 3
micro LED displays are thinner and
lighter with an improved color gamut
increase brightness and higher
resolutions all good things they do not
require backlighting but are reportedly
more difficult and expensive to
mass-produce and in the latest iPhone
news and rumors the latest CAD renders
from nowhere else fr continue to show
the larger 5.5 inch phone with an
opening to support a dual lens camera
and a 4.7 inch model with a larger
camera cut out for a single lens and
again the design reinforce is a
lightning port with dual speakers at the
base with no headphone jack but if
you're still disgusted over apples
insistence to have an entry-level iphone
with 16 gigs a Wall Street Journal
report has squashed that claiming the
iphone 7 or whatever they call it will
finally come with 32 gigs of storage in
the base model you know I won't believe
it until I actually see it Plus Nintendo
has decided to wake up and will invest
in physical controllers for smartphones
and tablets at least five years later
than they should have I've written in
Tendo four years for being so stubborn
instead of just at the very least
releasing five dollar to ten dollar
versions of their classics on mobile
devices you know everyone would still
buy them they'll also release five new
mobile titles by March again at least
five years later than they should have
sorry no bad apples here this is just
straight embarrassing how late to the
party they are but they might have
completely redeemed themselves with the
release of Pokemon
Oh in New Zealand Australia and a roll
out to some US markets you basically use
your smartphone camera and gps to create
an augmented reality what I'd rather
call real life where you can capture
collect trade and battle pokemon now for
someone who regularly loses to a
seven-year-old and four-year-old nephews
at the card game this is my chance for
revenge Jake and Tyler you hear me Jake
tonga Tyler Tom you aren't going down
I'm gonna kick your butts huh all right
that's going to do it for this week's
show you can always email us at the
apple byte at cnet com or tweet me at
brian Tong I even got this nice sketch
from Gabriel to telly of an iphone
sketch he did in 1991 call back to last
week's show alright thanks so much for
watching we'll catch y'all next time
from the bite of the Apple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
