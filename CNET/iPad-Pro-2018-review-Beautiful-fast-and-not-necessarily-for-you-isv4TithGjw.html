this is a question that Apple has asked
us for years and it's still really hard
to answer because the iPad in the Mac
are still pretty different computing
types the iPad pro does double down on
its strengths it's a much faster
processor there's a nicer pencil then
you have to buy a new one and it works
via a USB see although it doesn't work
with all accessories so let's take a
look at what it can do and what it can't
the iPad pros design is really refined
now and looks really sharp compressing
the screen to body ratio and making for
an overall more compact tablet it's a
lot better looking than it used to be
the 12 point 9 inch version has shrunken
down to land in between last year's 10.5
and twelve point nine inch versions
while having the same screen sizes last
year the less expensive 11 inch model
which adds more screen into the 10.5
size is what I'd prefer but at least the
12 inch version isn't crazy big anymore
but these iPad pros are also more
expensive now they start at $7.99 or
$9.99 with 64 gigabytes of storage and
go all the way up from there if you go
for a whopping terabyte SSD and cellular
the 12 point 9 inch iPad pro cost one
thousand eight hundred ninety nine
dollars and that's not including
accessories you'd want $129 pencil a two
hundred dollar keyboard folio case and
you better consider Bluetooth or USB C
headphones or a USB C dongle or two
that's more than many Mac books cost in
a lot of ways the new iPad pros are
basically kind of like the iPad 10
because they work a lot like the iPhone
10 models they have the same
front-facing face id camera over here
there's a notch but on the iPad pro
there isn't it blends into the bezel and
is basically invisible it has the same
curved corners that are in the iPhone 10
displays it has the same swipe gestures
for the most part because there's no
more home button and it has a souped up
version of the 812 processor that's in
these phones and the most recent 10s and
10 are this is the a 12x
has better graphics and better
multitasking if you want a multitask you
can really only put two apps
side-by-side
say Safari and Twitter I wish you could
put more or even be able to position
them in little windows face ID works
just like the iPhone 10 and supports the
same functions iPad unlock Apple pay
iTunes purchases and automatically
entering passwords for accounts setup
needs to be done in portrait mode but
after that it works fine in portrait or
landscape in any direction but the iPad
may sometimes ask you where to look the
front-facing camera has the same depth
sensing technology as the iPhone 10 s so
it also takes portrait selfies
the iPad can also doom emoji and an
emoji just like the iPhone 10 because of
that true depth camera which I like
because I can now do this in every
single video of course you don't want to
be the weird person taking iPad photos
in public but if you do it takes some
really nice shots how do you navigate
this thing
well the gesture language is pretty much
the same as the iPhone 10 with a few
extra wrinkles for iPad users you swipe
down to get notifications and if you
want to get to the control center you
have to swipe from the top corner which
is a little bit annoying and if you want
to get to the home screen once you're
inside an app well then you just swipe
from the bottom all the way up and swipe
the app away but if you want to get to
the app dock you have to do like a half
swipe if you have to swipe up a little
bit to get to the apps you want to
select and if you want to get to the
apps that are already open you swipe a
little bit more swipe a little bit more
so you gets a little confusing to get to
the open apps getting that feel for how
much you have to swipe can get a little
bit strange sometimes the nicest thing
about the pencil is that it finally has
a place to go not only will it not roll
off the table because the site is flat
but it magnetically charges and sticks
to the side of the iPad you don't have
to worry about where else to put it
whether you're sticking it in your
pocket or trying to stick it into your
ear or put it in your mouth you're
putting it off anymore you can just
flick it to the side of the iPad they're
done the new pencil has capacitive
DoubleTap almost like air pods
it does only one thing per app though
and not many apps support it yet notes
lets you switch between your pen and
your eraser but the really annoying
thing about pencil is you'll need to buy
a new one old Apple pencils won't work
with it which is ridiculous and the new
pencil won't work with older iPads the
rest of pencils drawing sensitivity and
latency seems similar to the older one
but I mostly draw Triceratops so I
talked to a real artist instead I've
been in print for 40 years drawing on
paper and then the last four years
drawing on the iPad I do a lot of live
drawing
I call it digital journalism visual
visual journalism where I travel around
and draw what I see and so having it
portable obviously is great I don't call
myself a caricaturist because I was
never trained to do that I seem to be
able to do it a little bit more easily
on the iPad
the ability to erase a line
instantaneously so you you just keep
making the mark until you think it's
right I'm not used to the the feel of
this yet it has a little bit more pull
and then the previous iPad is was much
more loose and fluid it feels it pulls
more like a real pencil and I'll get
used to it but I I really got used to
the old pencil that was really loose and
fluid and I liked what it did to my work
because my work is really quick and
relaxed I think I'm done oh wow that's
that's really good it looks a lot better
than me the iPad pro now has USBC
replacing lightning which seems like a
big move it's not as wild as you might
expect it's coolest trick is that you
can reverse charge phones or just about
anything else
accessories are more hit and miss
third-party dongles can be used instead
of Apple's also while this iPad gained
USBC it dropped both lightning and a
headphone jack so for headphones you're
gonna need something Bluetooth USB C or
find an adapter well you think hopefully
and the iPad will finally connect to
external monitors and do cool things but
the new iPad pro has limitations in fact
in its default if you plug in with an
adapter say a USB C to HDMI to a monitor
it's just going to show you a mirrored
image just like it did before with
lightning to HDMI adapter z' and it's
pillar-box so it doesn't take advantage
of anything on the monitor and you can't
do a second screen now third-party apps
will take advantage of second displays
up to 5k resolution there aren't really
very many yet you can see for instance a
movie trailer like this one for Bernie
the dolphin will take advantage of the
whole display right there to enjoy
Bernie the dolphin in all its glory and
wasn't the dream of USBC to skip having
a dongle all together well
it doesn't always work like that in fact
I tried connecting USBC to this Dell USB
C monitor and unfortunately it didn't
work until more apps and accessory
solutions arrived to make the most of
this new iPad pro it's a pretty hard
tablet to judge is the iPad pro for you
well if you're an art professional who's
already liked the idea of what the iPad
brought to the table sure this is great
if you can afford it
but if you're somebody who's wanted this
to replace your Mac someone like me
who's like a real serious writer it's
not exactly my perfect device is it for
you I have no idea but check out that
question that's pretty amazing
you didn't deserve this pencil goodnight
sweet prince
just very something yes I buried $100</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
