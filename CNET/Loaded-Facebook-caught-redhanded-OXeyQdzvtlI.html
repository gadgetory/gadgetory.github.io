Conte back from maternity leave and
happy to be here with you again it's
time to get loaded Facebook is sharing
personally identifiable information of
users with advertising and Internet
tracking companies we kind of already
knew this a Wall Street Journal
investigation found that Facebook was
doing this in violation of its own rules
user names and the names of users
friends were found to be reported to at
least 25 ad and data firms Facebook told
CNET that they are working to
dramatically limit this Yahoo is
launching a universal login program
called why connect this is like Facebook
Connect where you sign into sites with
login requirements with your yahoo ID we
don't have a timeline for this feature
it's expected to launch soon YouTube
Leanback is now part of Google TV this
is the autoplay version of YouTube that
plays you videos consecutively that it
thinks that you will enjoy it does make
youtube watching on your TV a lot easier
because you don't want to constantly
have to navigate through videos on your
TV but then again how much YouTube do
you really want to sit back and watch on
your couch and the Sony version of
Google TV looks like it hit store
shelves early Sony said the TV would go
on sale on october 24th but best buy
scouts reported that they shipped early
so if you want to be an early early
adopter runnin out to bestbuy pronto and
the we no longer requires a disc to play
netflix movies last week the PlayStation
remove the disc requirement and this
week Nintendo caught up to get netflix
streaming on your wii download the
application in the Wii Shop Channel and
we are one step closer to being able to
use our own cable boxes late last week
the FCC move to open up the retail
market for companies that make cable
boxes and dvrs this means that you
wouldn't be locked into the cable box or
DVR that your cable company chooses thus
giving us a choice in an area where we
haven't really had much choice before
and finally Mike Tyson is returning to
his famous punch-out game but not on the
Nintendo console a new version of Mike
Tyson's punch-out is coming to the
iphone the boxing game was a classic on
the nintendo entertainment system but
Tyson was dropped from
versions of the game after his license
with Nintendo expired the iphone version
will come from a company called rock
software who very likely could be sued
by nintendo when this game comes out
next month those are your headlines for
today I will see you tomorrow with more
thank you for watching i'm natali del
conte with cnet.com and you've been
