I'm Bridget Carey and this is your cnet
update google will be showing app
activity in search results now so when
you go to Google on your desktop to
search for an app or a website you soon
we'll see what Google Plus users are
liking and sharing and reading and
listening to on that app or website for
example if you search for fandango you
can see the top movies from Google+
users this only works for websites and
apps that let you sign in using a google
plus account and it'll roll out in a few
weeks jawbone is a company known for
Bluetooth speakers but it's pushing more
into the growing market of wearable
Health tracking devices jawbone
reportedly spent more than a hundred
million dollars to acquire body media
which has been making health tracking
devices for several years now you may
have seen the devices promoted on the
show The Biggest Loser jawbone already
has its own activity monitoring bracelet
called the jawbone up it measures
movement and sleep but it had a rough
start after a recall in 2011 for now you
can still purchase body media devices
which track more workout detail than the
jawbone up verizon mobile customers will
be getting 500 megabytes of free online
storage to save and backup files from a
smartphone or tablet customers can also
pay for additional cloud storage it's
offered to android customers first and
then next for Apple devices and other
systems come later this year twitter is
now allowing any US company to advertise

searching for a term or a hashtag before

sponsor a tweet but now you'll see all
sorts of companies taking part maybe
even your local neighborhood coffee shop

on some very cool concepts for the next
generation of gaming it's called the
illumiroom it's a projector that sits on
your coffee table it's wirelessly
connected to the Xbox and being
images onto the wall to create different
illusions that expand the gameplay
beyond the borders of the television
screen it might show more of the scenery
around you or just the gunfire and
explosions outside the current view this
demonstration posted to YouTube also
showed how it works with the furniture
in the room to effect the lighting and
colors of objects depending on the
scenery of the game unfortunately

the new xbox coming this year but
engineers may show off more demos of
this in July that's your tech news
