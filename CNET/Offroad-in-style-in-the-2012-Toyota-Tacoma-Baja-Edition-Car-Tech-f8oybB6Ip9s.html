Camry in a Camry I seldom get in
situations like this where I have a
serious concern of taking the painting
off the roof let's drive the 2012 Toyota
Tacoma 4x4 double cab with the Baja
Package and check the tech if I can just
get at this Tacoma has two things
notable from the outside first of all
it's the big boy it's the double cab not
just the extended you got a full whole
second row in this guy secondly in case
you missed the graphics it's the Baja
Package it's a $5,000 package so let's
see what it includes first of all these
very cool wheels great color great alloy
design but most importantly they are
bead locks see a bead lock wheel is a
wheel that clamps the wheel to the tire
bead because off-road guys tend to D
inflate their tires quite a bit to get a
fatter contact patch over irregular
surfaces but that means the bead of the
tire can separate from the wheel during
high cornering stresses or other loads
and lose even more pressure and become
undriveable also because these are high
traction tires sometimes they will grip
the ground so much that you'll actually
spin the wheel inside the tire not cool
so you lock the bead to the wheel
additionally we've got Bilstein racing
shocks all around this vehicle you see
the shock here and then this braided
hose goes to an offshore reservoir for
additional fluid helps to keep the fluid
cool during the violent kind of impacts
these shocks may deal with underneath
here you can take a look you'll see a
catback system it's a better exhaust a
louder Sport of your exhaust with a
little less back pressure that's a TRD
piece and of course you've got the Baja
graphics whether that's a good thing or
not is up to you okay let you get your
tacoma without doing any SI netting of
it you're not going to have this head
unit this is optional this is part of
some package called a J we have a lot of
things in here including the engine
system but as you'll notice it's a
little different interface and different
offerings than we've seen on Lexus cars
for example you have Bing search here's
Pandora streaming now one thing i griped
about on this system a while ago is that
you only had voice command from this
button for bing and all the other apps
in Entune you had to
fiddled with the interface which often
locks you out when you're moving they've
just announced that they are going to be
upgrading the other end to naps to have
voice command now by today's standards
this is the iPhone of head units and I
don't mean that in the most
complimentary way what I mean it's kind
of small
it's a 6.1 inch screen they tell me it
doesn't even look that big does it it's
a little cramped but the graphics
rendering is quite good as Toyota tends
to do and I find it the response on
things is perfectly fine
now the electronics in this car go well
beyond navigation and median a few apps
and this guy you've got an
electronically controlled
four-wheel-drive system not every Tacoma
has that it's a different trim level but
we do have four-wheel drive first of all
it all funnels through either a
six-speed manual or a 5-speed automatic
we have the 5-speed auto now in addition
to the gear shift lever here which
doesn't have any shiftable nonsense it's
kind of old-school well you've got Drive
which is fifth four three two or low
then over here you have an electronic
control for all wheel drive high to high
for or if you want to go low for to
really get your grunt mode going you
just push and turn another electronic
button over here to lock the rear diff
you've got another one here for a hill
descent control in other words this is a
very easy to live with all-wheel drive
car electronic systems make things
happen instead of you having to move big
old levers which some all-wheel-drive
cars still have and you can screw it up
and get a really nasty grinding sound
under the hood four litre v6 in the
four-wheel drive configuration we've got
here the four liter v6 only comes in the
big cab versions not in the small cabin
believe that guys relegated to the 2.7
liter for that we're not going to
discuss here 236 horsepower 266
foot-pounds of torque a real grunting
motor I'm not going to talk about zero
to sixty who cares in a car like this
but the mpg is interesting 1621 in this
v6 with all-wheel drive if you got the
rear-wheel drive I believe it gets as
good as 1924 quite a difference now the
base transmission on this vehicle is a
six-speed manual however we have the
5-speed automatic which adds a little
under 900 bucks given the fact that the
powertrain is so electronically
controlled in this car I'm not offended
by it having an automatic but then again
I'm not an off-roader so maybe you are
and think I'm an idiot right now
okay first on the street all pavement
driving like you'll do 90% of the miles
in this vehicle it drives like it should
it's a whole lot less harsh than you'd
expect looking at it from the outside
the thing I can't live with every day is
what I think is a horrible sounding
exhaust note that TRD system to me just
sounds like it's got a blown canister it
doesn't sound good to me now let's go
off-road where I have no idea what I'm
doing or what I'm looking for but it
sure is fun we have a nice steep short
drive hill here
nice approaching because I've been on
this one before and some other vehicles
and lost the chin but this is where the
suspension on this vehicle continues to
maintain some grace even though I'm
hitting some pretty good ruts and whoa
big approaches there come on Danny here
we go
this one now I don't want to put the
shiny side down but feels like I'm about
to of course I'm not used to this kind
of driving in this kind of vehicle I was
mentioning earlier about how a lot of
off-roaders are going to deflate their
tires somewhat to get a more compliant
contact patch you can feel that even it
I think full pressure right now we're at
running standard pressure this is uh
this is a very a lot of the compliance
of the suspension is coming through the
tires these are not exceptionally big
diameter wheel that's not the idea on an
off-road vehicle and so we have a lot of
Skoosh in the actual casing and the
sidewall and that's really helping keep
things planted because what you don't
want in this kind of driving is to be
airborne for anymore milliseconds and
you have to be okay pricing arctic omus
is about high 28 s the way it sits here
now I think about 4000 of that though is
all-wheel-drive and related equipment so
that's a big yes or no on your part
5,000 is the Baja package you either
know if you want that or you don't you
don't need my advice
and finally the steel on this car for
1900 is that package EJ that gets you
the in tune system the LCD screen
navigation JBL audio HD radio a lot of
goodies come in that one for what is
basically a steal of a price get that
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
