galaxy s 9 plus are two of the best
Android phones you can buy they're
packed to the gills with all the
features you want in a high-end phone
there's a great 12 megapixel camera with
a cutting-edge trick beautiful curved
glass edges with even thinner bezels
two gorgeous new shades water resistance
wireless charging some entertaining
software and currently the fastest
processor on the planet but no phone is
perfect in the galaxy s 9 and s 9 Plus
have plenty of highs and lows you'll see
what I mean here's what's good starting
with the two phones all screen designs
on the s9 you've got five point eight
inches of display space to play with and
6.2 inches on the s9 plus the
fingerprint reader has moved beneath the
camera module on the back of the phone
it used to be way off on the side and
Samsung is letting us keep the headphone
jack a second speaker at the bottom edge
of the phone makes audio loud and rich a
definite improvement over the Galaxy s8
the s9s camera also deserves a shout-out
at least some aspects of the camera
anyway the 12 megapixel sensor takes
clear beautiful outdoor shots with a lot
of color in detail and live focus on the
s9 plus gives that phone the ability to
create artful portrait shots that you
can edit later on you can even undo the
close-up scene if you want to the jury's
still out on the s 9s low-light photos
these are the first phones to have a
dual aperture lens that physically and
automatically switches between settings
for daylight and low-light shots photos
are very bright and not too noisy but
the low-light setting tends to be a
little aggressive making some pictures
artificially bright and blurry a new
photo mode called selfie focus does a
nice job adding that portrait feature to
the front-facing camera but it also
wound up blurring out the edges of
people's hair Samsung also used the s9
phones to introduce two features that
mimic the iPhone 10 and they're both
really bad
they are emoji scans her face to make an
emoji of you that you can send as an
animated gif or turn into a video the
problem is there aren't enough
customization
options to represent actual human
diversity and the animations themselves
are disturbing take a look smiles don't
work
I'm grimacing I hate it like my mouth is
always like quivering like I'm about to
cry
then there's intelligence scan eight not
so intelligent unlocking feature that
combines face unlock and iris scanning
it's supposed to speed up how quickly
you can unlock your phone but it isn't
secure at all and you can't use it for
mobile payments if intelligent scan is
meant to copy apples face ID then this
new tool is a big fat fail despite some
rickety parts I still hardly recommend a
galaxy s 9 and s 9 plus these are both
terrific all-around errs that connect
you to your online world</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
