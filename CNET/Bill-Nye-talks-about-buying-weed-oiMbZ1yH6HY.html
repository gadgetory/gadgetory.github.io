saving the world once again so in season
2 of Bill Nye saves the world is the
world any better off since season 1 or
are we still a hot mess
you'd think that 13 1/2 hours of
television on a streaming service would
have changed the course of human history
but not it hasn't been completely
effective yet no but it's cool and we're
back on the TV with big-budget
production a big travel budget well in
your first episode you explore the
science of marijuana and I hear that you
purchased cannabis this is for
scientists I got a I guess it's called a
license to buy marijuana in California
didn't go to a doctor's office didn't
present any evidence that I was a good
or bad person just got it on on the
internet then went to a store and bought
it and the woman there recommended at a
variety and I gave it to the props
department I don't know I don't know I
don't like just tell you guys I'm not
crazy about the smell
watching this are we gonna see Bill Nye
get high no in fact you'll see me play
Ultimate Frisbee with teammates who are
high that was our agreement so going
into this episode if you have an opinion
about marijuana and did anything change
when you were done with the episode how
about this it refined my attitude here's
the main thing you guys here's the
takeaway as we say not modern parlance
is nobody's really sure how it works
marijuana
nobody's exactly sure what it does and
so there's a very strong argument that
keeping it as a Schedule one drug is not
based on any science the schedule one
means that it's presumed to be addicting
and it's presumed to have no medical
value but people use marijuana and
marijuana extracts for all sorts of
medical applications so you got to think
there's something to it but the upshot
of the show is no but
sure how it works so we got to study
marijuana more and find out really what
the active ingredients are alright so
let's talk about some other episodes yes
you have an episode on time travel we
always we all wonder about it could you
go back in time and could you go forward
in time it's important I think for
everybody to understand a little bit of
the physics of the nature of time as far
as we can tell it only goes one way for
us there was a big bang and the
expansion of the universe that happened
we see the stars moving apart why is
that why does time only go one way why
do we have the mythic second law of
thermodynamics where you cannot build a
perpetual motion machine and it is
sobering to think that really ultimately
deep down all the time travel television
shows movies stories science fiction
stories about time travel or ultimately
about death that and taxes seems to be
the hand were dealt and so the show
Israel I'm really proud of it
well you also in your show talk about
cybersecurity what mysteries are there
still around cybersecurity that you
think people need answers on because I
feel like we've all been hacked we've
all had our security breached in some
way by now but then how does everybody
get hacked if we're also aware of it why
are there all these troubles how did the
last presidential election get
influenced if it did if we are all so
hip to hacking in other words we the
scale of it is what I don't think people
appreciate and most of us are not aware
of the significance of the catastrophe
that may result if we ignore this threat
you touch it on a lot of topics that
sometimes can feel like doom and gloom
is there hope like when you're done
watching bill and I save the world are
we left with with hope that things can
be better you've got to be optimistic
people or you won't get anything done
you've got to think you can save the
world or you won't know the whole thing
is optimistic let's do something about
this but the first thing you want to do
in problem-solving is identify the
homed in on what it is you want to fix
change improve
I like that message thank you though
Thank You Bridget carry on everyone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
