and this is your cnet update foursquare
is getting more competitive with Yelp
the check-in network just launched a
reading system for local businesses
users of the iOS app can rate a place on
a 10 point score which is a lot like
what Yelp does but Foursquare says the
rating system also calculates in users
tips popularity loyalty and the number
of check-ins although foursquare is
shredding on yelps territory yelp has
been creeping in on Foursquare space to
highlight the connections of your
friends activity such as their check-ins
photos and tips yup also rolled out a
change to its app Apple and Android
users can now just pull up restaurant
menus and see photos and reviews of each
item amazon prime is now offering a
payment option of eight dollars a month
the same price as Netflix and Hulu
previously you had to sign up for amazon
prime subscription in a year lump sum of
eighty dollars and then option is still
available it's about twenty percent
cheaper than going month to month but
having that monthly option is just
another way Amazon's trying to take on
the other streaming video services prime

customers borrow thousands of Kindle
e-books and it includes free two-day
shipping on millions of items in other
news Instagram users are gain web
profiles before there was no real home

app to look up someone's feed but now

working on a surface tablet just for the
Xbox the verge has unnamed sources

product for really pushing SmartGlass

interact with games and navigate media
on your Windows tablet speaking of games

a refreshing improvement and a must buy
