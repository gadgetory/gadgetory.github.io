at Facebook is this a good thing or two
just get you into trouble and we can
talk about things like home and if you
want yeah I mean whatever whatever you
want to cover um yeah I mean it gets us
into tons of trouble right so I'm of the
belief that values are only useful when
they're controversial right so you know
there are companies that right out these
value statements that I think are kind
of meaningless because their table
stakes stuff I mean people are it's like
be honest it's like of course you're
gonna be honest I mean that's not a
choice sir idea then that's not a value
you have to be honest right I'd like go
home if you're not honest but if um move
fast is good because it's something that
people can actually disagree with right
and yeah there are companies that don't
move fast and that succeed right i mean
i think um you know in our what i really
mean by move fast is that i want to
empower people at the company to try
things out and I don't demand that every
iteration of what we release is perfect
what I want to optimize for is learning
the most and having the best product
three five seven years from now right
which you can do by iterating quickly
getting feedback learning and going from
there and I mean there are companies
that have very different approaches than
that I mean I think apple wood would
never launched something that didn't
meet their perfection bar and it's
served them incredibly well right so I
think you know move fastest is a very
nice kind of it you can meaningfully
disagree with it and I think it leads to
interesting outcomes NSA user data you
have 1.1 million users a billion you
have more data than any entity in the
world and it's all of our data and we
care a lot about it and we don't want
people necessarily getting it then using
it to do bad things we we know what
facebook has done in the over the last
several months to try to help increase
transparency and we see we've seen the
lawsuit we've seen those efforts and I
don't need you to repeat them although
I'm happy to talk about that if you want
what I want to know is what Mark
Zuckerberg thinks about these issues
in our right to privacy versus the
government yeah so I mean we take our
role really seriously I think it's my
job and an hour job to protect everyone
who uses Facebook and all the
information that they share with us it's
it's our government's job to protect all
of us and also to protect our freedoms
and protect the economy right and
companies and and I think that they did
a bad job of balancing those things here
right you know so frankly i think that
the government blew it right i think
that they blew it on communicating what
they were basically the balance of what
they were going for I here with this so
um you know we at the morning after this
started breaking they're like a bunch of
people asked them what they thought it
would look and the government's come it
was oh don't worry basically we're not
spying on any Americans right and it's
like Oh wonderful yeah it's like that's
really helpful to companies who are
trying to serve people around the world
and they're really going to inspire
confidence in American Internet
companies it's like thanks for going out
there and being really clear about what
you're doing so I think that that was
really bad right and we've been pushing
just to get more transparency on this
and and I actually think we've made a
big difference right even we haven't the
big question you that you'd get from all
the coverage is you know what's the
volume of the total number of requests
that are going on is it is it closer to
a thousand requests that the the
government is making of us or is it
closer to a hundred million right and I
mean from the coverage and from what the
government has said you would not know
the difference right but um we worked
really hard with the government behind
the scenes to get it to the point where
we could release the aggregate number of
requests and it's it was around 9,000 in
the last in the last half a year and you
know is does that number tell us
everything that we want no and you know
that's why when when the conversations
kind of got to the point where we
weren't going to make further progress
we just had to sue them so we could
reveal you know is it 1000 or 2000 or
3000 or 4000 or 8000 of the nine
thousand requests but the reality is
because of the the transparency that
that we
for you know now people can know and I
think they deserve to know that the
number of requests that the government
is making is closer to 1,000 red it's
it's 9,000 or less in the last six
months and definitely not you know 10
million or a hundred million or not a
draft with regard to crabbing data yeah
new truck so you know I mean we're not
at the end of this I am I wish that the
government would be kind of more
proactive about communicating we we
aren't site that we had to sue in order
to get this but we feel like people
deserve to know this and we just take
this really seriously</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
