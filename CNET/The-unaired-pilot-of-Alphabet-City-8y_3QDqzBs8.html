currently on vacation but we would like
to give you a little gift
this is the unaired pilot for this show
yes you'll see the return of the old set
and my wonderful slash terrible sense of
humor on display enjoy
hey everybody and welcome to alphabet
city this is the show that covers
alphabet from A to Z we might get stuck
at G though since alphabet owns Google
first stop Google Garden few things
never change right it's design and was
on prime pricing and gmail well guess
what they all changed Google introduced
a new version of Gmail so everybody
freaked out the compose button is now a
capsule shape and the whole left side
menu can be collapsed by clicking the 3
bar icon hovering over it brings back
the familiar inbox and labels if you
have those the search bar on top is now
huge on the right side you've got a new
sidebar section you can have your
calendar Google keep or Google Tasks in
a sidebar you can also add other apps to
the sidebar section by clicking the plus
button for some reason you cannot have
all of your sidebars on the right side
of the screen at the same time go figure
the new Gmail can resemble Microsoft
Outlook there are two split pane options
so you can preview your messages you
also have new ways to interact with your
email messages you can snooze an email
so it'll come back at a later time if
you choose to actually reply to an email
Google will give you some smart replies
so you won't even have to type anything
so in short it's kind of like Google
inbox
if you want to try out the new Gmail
design it's really difficult are you
ready okay so click the Settings icon
and then click try the new Gmail huh all
right next up the First National Bank of
alphabets
alphabet announced its quarterly
earnings and it made a few bucks the
company pulled in 30 1.15 billion
dollars in revenue with Google's
advertising business accounting for over
26 billion dollars of that 30 1.15
billion alphabet beat expectations so
that usually makes investors happy
alphabet also wound up letting the world
know how nest is doing quick history
lesson when alphabet announced numbers
it reported how Google is doing and also
how other bets are doing every other
alphabet company that is not Google is
grouped under the other bet section nest
used to be a separate company operating
under alphabet since 2015 so it's hard
to tell how it was doing since it was
lumped into that other bet section in
February of this year nest got merged
into Google's hardware division so
alphabet recast some numbers and
financials history lesson over
don't fall asleep yet we're almost done
it's estimated that last year nest made
726 million dollars in revenue but if
the losses were six hundred and
twenty-one million dollars that's not
too great a performance last stop
Android avenues we tracked down someone
who had hands-on time with a new LG g7
thank you they were uncomfortable
speaking about the phone on camera so
we're gonna do a recreation can you tell
me why I'm talking to a bear because
your source was uncomfortable with
speaking on camera about the LG G 7
thank you instead I will be speaking for
that person what can you tell us about
the LG g 7 think q sure I had some
hands-on time with the LG G 7 thank you
it has some neat AI tricks the camera
can detect what it is seeing and adjust
the camera settings to match the subject
expect to see two cameras on the back
one on the front
like other 2018 flagship phones it will
be powered by a Snapdragon 845 processor
same as the Samsung Galaxy S 9 LG will
also be using an LCD display instead of
o LED now that's pretty interesting
is there
think about the g-seven think you that's
gonna make it stand out against the
competition unfortunately no it's very
met thank you for your time
not a problem do you validate parking a
quick programming note before we go we
will be at Google i/o and have tons of
coverage from Mountain View that data
