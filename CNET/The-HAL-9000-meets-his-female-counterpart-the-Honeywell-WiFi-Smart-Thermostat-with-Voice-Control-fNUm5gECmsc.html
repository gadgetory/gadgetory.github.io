Christina appliances and this is a
review of the Honeywell Wi-Fi smart
thermostat with voice control this
thermostat may look familiar to some of
you and that's because it is basically
identical to the Honeywell Wi-Fi smart
thermostat without voice control it has
the same features the same basic
dimensions but the one obvious
difference is that this one is offered
in a black finish while the older
version is offered in a metallic silver
finish actually prefer this one better i
think it's a bit more sophisticated the
voice control feature is extremely cool
it's a first for the residential
thermostat market but it's going to cost
you the older version without voice
control is 249 dollars similar to the
Nest Learning Thermostat while this one
is three hundred and forty-nine dollars
to activate it you just say hello
thermostat I'm feeling hot changing 712
71 degrees and that's it it's definitely
cool but do you need it maybe not if the
technology was super advanced and could
do a lot of the same things that the app
could do I would recommend spending the
extra hundred bucks Honeywell is playing
to make updates to voice control along
the way but for now i would say stick
with the $249 model or go for the nest
if you like that design better so while
it does all of the great things that the
less expensive model does the voice
control is just a little basic to me
thanks for watching I'm Megan Willerton
for CNN appliances and this has been a
review of the Honeywell Wi-Fi smart
thermostat with voice control</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
