available now loaded with Nvidia stop
performing GTX 10-8 a graphics card but
none are quite like the Razer Blade Pro
I mean look at this thing
it's less than an inch thick but shrugs
off demanding games like a full-size
desktop of course it requires the
constant blowing of its little fans
pushing air through small vents as soon
as you start a game but that's the price
you pay for being so slim
well that and $3,700
you get more than the GPU for the money
however including a 17 inch 4k
touchscreen with a hundred percent Adobe
RGB colour space coverage and it's a
g-sync display which helped keep tearing
in check while playing games you're also
paying for this keyboard with according
to Razer the world's first ultra low
profile mechanical switches they give a
satisfying click with every press but
they are on the small side and do
require a little extra force than a
typical laptop keyboard but it's
otherwise a great typing experience
adding to that is Razer synapse software
so you can adjust everything from the
keyboards lighting to setting up macros
and profiles to fine tuning the trackpad
it's great too by the way but if you've
used any other laptop ever your muscle
memory will need to adjust to the
placement to the right of the keyboard
where you would normally reach for our
mouse assuming you're a righty anyhow
Razer said putting it on the right left
room for the largest possible battery
inside which was able to stream video
for just under 4 hours but you're
considering this for the high
performance and the really nice design
not so much battery life but really this
thing is amazing
even if you have to give your right arm
to afford it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
