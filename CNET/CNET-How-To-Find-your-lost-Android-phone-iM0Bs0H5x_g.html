the lowdown on how to find a lost or
stolen android phone first let's talk
about a couple apps that you can install
now as a precaution just in case you
ever misplace your phone or it falls in
the wrong hands at a minimum download
contact owner this free app allows you
to place contact information on the lock
screen so that if a decent person finds
your phone you'll be able to get ahold
of you without unlocking it once it's
installed just choose your contact info
from this option here then lock your
device and you'll see that your info
shows up on the lock screen that's a
good start but what if you lose your
phone and no one finds it or if what if
someone steals it and you want to know
where the perp with your phone is
located lots of apps let you locate your
phone and do other useful things
remotely like send an alarm a text
message and even wipe your device after
some research and testing the best deal
on such an app is where's my droid it's
free does almost all these things and is
super easy to set up once you've
installed the app you don't have to wait
until you've lost your phone to try it
out but you will need to borrow someone
else's phone to find yours first text
wmd GPS to your number you'll receive a
series of four texts the first will tell
you to hang on while it finds your phone
when where's my droid locates your
device you'll get text messages with the
phone's latitude and longitude a Google
map link and the nearest address to the
device now you can use that info to
figure out where you left that darn
phone and if you think you're close to
your phone but it's on silent you can
make it ring just text wmd ring and your
phone will sound
you can change these commands by
adjusting the settings in the app and if
you want features like remote wipe you
can purchase the pro version for 4 bucks
from within the app now if you're
watching this video because you lost
your phone before using any of these
precautionary measures there is still
hope for you check out plan B it's from
the makers of the popular lookout
security app once you've lost your phone
you can remotely install plan B from the
Android Market website and within a few
minutes
your phone's location will be sent to
the email address associated with your
phone if you have any questions shoot me
