by senior managing editor kent german
and kent this new apple iphone is
expected to come out in less than two
weeks the rumor mill is working overtime
let's talk about some of the new tidbits
out there sure one screen size i guess
some photos of surfaced and we now know
a more accurate idea of how big it's
going to be right well we're pretty sure
it's going to be four inches as I some
pictures emerged on a French site today
which showed a just apart so you didn't
see the whole thing but you did see a
hole for a screen size of four inches
which is a pretty big jump up from the
current size of 3.5 inches 3.5 to 4
inches now all right and tell us about
the NFC Near Field Communication that's
no longer a part of the flow we've heard
that rumor for months and we actually
heard it going into the iphone 4s 2 and
that didn't happen and now we're hearing
that NFC might not happen of course
that's what that's the feature that lets
you do wireless purchases let's transfer
things back and forth but anna texas
today that because the phone will have a
metal back and there won't be enough
room inside they will not have an NFC
chip is that a big disappointment would
you say to many consumers or more just
to analysts well I think a little bit of
both I mean we've heard it for so long
that I think people get excited about it
for it but it's bigger deal LT wasn't in
there or something like that gotcha now
as far as the release date we are still
thinking the announcement could come on
September 12 right yes and what about
location well pretty unsure Moscone
Center so Apple usually uses Moscone
Center in San Francisco that's
completely booked for that whole week so
and we know it's not by apple with other
companies like Intel it could hold it at
the yerba buena gardens theater where
they've actually introduced the iPads
for the past couple years we still don't
know that though so the location that
becomes the bigger choice because they
everything's booked in San Francisco
they have to go to their campus which is
pretty small exactly that means like
less media and they probably fewer
products ah interesting if it can't pack
as many people in now as far as the date
that the phone actually hits the stores
I hear that verizon's let a little
something leaked that could indicate the
date yeah supposedly verizon is
prohibited as employees from taking a
vacation around September 21st so
there's a few days around it and I mean
we don't know if that's the store or who
put employees that applies to but if you
can't go on vacation which we have seen
in previous iphone releases probably big
deal that they expect a lot a lot a lot
of lines right and that is nine days
after the announce date which does kind
of fall in line with apples
are typically there a week to a week and
a half later which and that would be
makes perfect sense of that were the
case well thank you for the rumor update
