Year I'm Bridget Carey on Sina comm and
it's time to get loaded the Consumer
Electronics Show is next week but Apple
rumors are dominating the tech buzz at
least for the moment
Apple will reportedly hold a press
conference in New York sometime this
month and early speculations say it has
something to do with electronic books
and publishing sorry kids we're not
going to hear anything about an iPad 3
or Apple TV just yet
and speaking of e-books you might be
able to do some reading on the new
Nintendo Wii U game console which is
expected to come out later this year the
Wii U has a touchscreen tablet like
controller and not only will the
controller have standalone games
available on an app store but reports
this morning say there will also be an
e-book store so if you're stuck in a
game you can pull up the how-to players
guide right from the controller this was
a huge holiday for smartphones
according to flurry a mobile application
analytics firm a record 6.8 million iOS
and Android devices were activated on
Christmas Day and more than 242 million
apps were downloaded if you take a step
back to look at the whole last week of
December 1.2 billion apps were
downloaded it was also a big holiday for
Mario Nintendo sold 4 million in Tendo
3ds systems and 4.5 million Wii consoles
overall for the year Nintendo sold more
than twelve million gaming systems in
the United States and it's hit that
number for five years in a row according
to the company and it isn't just devices
that can have a good holiday season the
social network Google+ saw its usage in
the United States rise 55 percent from
November to December according to the
firm Experian Hitwise that means Google+
had 49 million visits but Google's
keeping mum on the official numbers one
analyst and self-proclaimed Google
statistician the founder of ancestry.com
believes Google has 62 million users of
course it's a ways away from Facebook's
count of 800 million users with election
day nine months away you can follow the
campaign trail on Google's new election
hub at google.com slash elections you
can see which candidate is trending and
searches or go on the ground to get
elections
stories pinned across a map and see
what's going on in a particular location
of course if you go on now all the news
is around Iowa today is the Iowa caucus
the first major electoral event in
nominating the President of the United
States but if you rather go by Facebook
stats than Iowa polls to determine the
Republican presidential candidate well
then Mitt Romney's in the lead with more
than 1.2 million fans according to the
social media statisticians at social
backers he's followed by Ron pop who has
more than 600,000 Facebook fans paul
also has the greatest percentage of
interactions with bands between likes
and currents but if you just look at fan
growth in the past month rick santorum
has the lead those are your headlines
for today I'm Bridget Carey proceed calm
and you just been loaded</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
