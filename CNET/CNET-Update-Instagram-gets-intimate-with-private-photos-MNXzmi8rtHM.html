Club I'm Bridget Carey and this is your
cnet update your instagrams can now be a
little more intimate the photo sharing
app has been updated to let users send
photos privately with direct messages to
one person or between several people you
can access private messages in a new in
box icon that appears when you scroll up
and users can reply to private messages
with a text or with more photos so you
can keep a private message going as a
threat of photos between friends if you
want to send a private photo to someone
that is not your friend it goes into a
pending request area Instagram is trying
to make sending private messages easier
than the follow me back dance we play on
Twitter but to address the potential
abusers harassing strangers with
unwanted photos you won't be able to see
anything in the pending requests unless
you click to accept their images so do
so at your own risk twitter also just
started allowing photos to be shared
privately in a direct message on its App
sending photos privately in apps is a
big trend right now that both Instagram
and Twitter are trying to take advantage
of because apps like kick and whatsapp
are popular with a younger crowd that
rather use a messaging app for sharing
instead of just texting or emailing
there's one less hassle to deal with in
your gmail now all images embedded in an
email will automatically be displayed
without you having to click that link to
allow the image to be seen that link was
always put there for your protection but
Google found a way to make it secure if
you rather not have photos appear
automatically you can change it in
settings the gaming company valve is on
a mission to take pc games to your
living room TV with its new console the
steam machine and it announced that the
first 300 prototype steam machine
systems are now being sent to beta
testers the company says it'll have more
news on the future of steam machines
