vacation and yes I actually take a break
once in a while but I always bring
something for you the Apple biters like
last week's music video and yeah we're
going to talk about that later but first
this story's of the week now Apple pay
finally rolled out I've only been able
to use it at an Apple store so far and
it worked like a charm
at an Apple store but something this big
wasn't going to have the smoothest
launch now a number of Bank of America
customers said they were double charged
using Apple pay it affected about 1,000
transactions and yes it's going to be
fixed but then there's another issue
retail Merchants who initially supported
Apple pay like CVS Pharmacy and Rite Aid
have decided to pull out and disabled
all NFC payments completely preventing
Apple pay and even Google Wallet
customers from pain by phone now why
would they do this
well that's where it gets fun and messy
you see CVS and Rite Aid belong to a
group of retailers that also include
Walmart BestBuy and gap in a coalition
called
the emergent consumer exchange or mcx
for short
now these retailers are backing their
own mobile payment platform called
currency get it currency like currency
which is money all right so they shut
down NFC for any mobile payment
competitors to currency because that's
obviously smart and good for the
consumer and it got many people angry
with more than 2000 comments across
several reddit threads to boycott the
stores now the program is just in its
pilot phase but the story isn't over
after mcx was recently hacked with the
data breach involving the theft of
customers emails again this is a pilot
program in its pilot phase what a great
start now Apple pay is already over 1
million active users since it's been
activated
and yes the mobile payments battle still
has a long long ways to go but can we do
an over-under for win right in and CBS
will allow NFC payments for competitors
again I'm gonna say three months oh and
before I forget write it in CBS and
currency welcome to the show
because I'm giving you all bad apples
all right the rumor news have been
actually quite this weekend I'm thankful
for that
so let's just throw it out there when
you guys think we'll actually hear the
first iPhone 6's rumors yeah
probably next week all right well in
eyewash news as part of an interview
with WS JD live Tim Cook dropped very
little new information for apples plans
overall but he did mention that Apple
watch users will likely need to charge
the device daily because they will use
it so much
see if Apple was smart they would have
told us the same thing about our iPhones
now Cook was tight-lipped about
specifics for the watch but he did say
that he believes it will last about a
day and if you're itching to play with
the Apple watch interface on your phone
well you can kind of sort of thanks to a
new jailbreak tweak called a watch
spring that brings those circular icons
that can be zoomed in or out it looks
fun for 30 seconds and then it just
really makes it impossible to find
really anything on your phone so
jailbreakers you can all have at it and
third-party stands for the Apple watch
are already being made before it even
comes out so check this out
this one from DODOcase which
incorporates the MagSafe charger and
actually looks pretty sweet it sells for
around 60 to 80 bucks right now or if
that's not your flavor you can lay it
flat with a composure dock from rest or
check this one out
my favorite looking one the $29 he dock
from Howard electronics yes
the Apple watch thirst is real my
friends all right now let's talk about
last week it might have come out of
nowhere but you should know by now when
there's a new iphone that comes out
we're working on a music video now a lot
of you loved it and I mean loved it and
some of you had no idea what the heck
was going on so here's what some of you
had to say pulley from YouTube Bryan
Aguilera writes this is way better than
90% of the music out today
Natasha Ismail says better than Justin
Bieber and that caught 65 thumbs up now
Claude Pierre disagrees this music video
should get a bad apple no Claude now
Segundo da says anyone have a neuralyzer
like this needs to get out of my memory
Oh MRSA Dec WTF linton ramen WTF barn
Ruiz WTF and Josh Swayze sums it up the
best for me
Cena does things other tech reviewers
just won't do and I completely agree
with that one now the YouTube comments I
gotta say alone made my day and we're
just having some fun guys don't take
things so seriously and let's be real
here if you were born after 1995 I know
there's a lot of you it's probably why
you don't get this at all but just
imagine for a second the 90s it was a
time when everyone actually sang all of
their own songs except for Milli Vanilli
alright guys and gals that's gonna do it
for this week's show you can email me at
the Apple bite at cnet.com or tweet me
at Bryan Tong and I'll respond to you
after my five layer jello recipe sets
thanks so much for watching we'll catch
you all next time for another bite of
the Apple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
