way around today isn't it yep alright
guys well this is Steven Shanklin
dimorra senior writer here with CNET
news I'm glad you could all join us here
for this hangout about Google i/o this
is Google's big developer conference
once every year at Moscone Center in San
Francisco and some other reporters and
editors here at Cena and I are gonna be
talking about it answering your question
and so with me here are Eric Franklin
he's our senior editor for tablets and
West and Seth wasn't but he's our buddy
reporter so he's all things all things
Google and I read about browsers and web
technology among other things so I think
we're just gonna start right in here
with some questions if you guys want to
ask more just drop them into the into
Google+ and we'll try to get to them but
we're gonna start I think here with a
question from our Yousef is a-- what's
going to be different in the next update
of android eric you want to field that
one oh sure yeah I can totally answer
that what can you guys hear me
I don't know coming up on the screen
okay yes I guess I wouldn't come up in
the screen I mean what's gonna be
different I think you know there's I
don't know what's gonna be different
obviously we won't know until tomorrow
but I think there are a lot of rumors
going around like one of the rumors one
of the big rumors it's gave me a lot of
traction is that Google is gonna add
support for native game support to
Android I think we might see stuff like
leaderboards and friends lists and you
know an easy way to kind of play with
your friends and you know achievements
and stuff like that and compete with
your friends I think there's a good
chance you might see that you might see
that but I you know I you know that's
only one little thing and to be honest
personally I don't find that that
attractive because you know on I don't
use Game Center on iOS I don't know
anyone that I know one person just
lonesome that uses it and you know how
many more friends and just low instance
so I'm not sure how useful that's gonna
be but I think a lot people might be
excited about that I think you also see
like you know performance tweaks and
stuff like that better support for
I res displays things like that and
probably a lot of cosmetic tweaks and
stuff to you you know you'll definitely
see well you won't definitely see but
you'll most likely see improvements and
stuff like Google now you know embedded
Google services and stuff like that but
we're definitely going to be seeing a
huge push on gaming just by looking at
the schedule there are I think six or
seven different sessions that are
designed to help developers get more
into the gaming world you're absolutely
right about the leaderboards and stuff
like that
and Google now Google keeps telling us
has been a huge success for them in
terms of design in terms of grabbing and
keeping user attention they just
released Google now for Google search on
Chrome I mean on a sorry on iOS so we
know that if they're making a big push
for iOS that it's going to not be too
long before Google now comes to desktops
I'll throw I'll throw one more thing
into the mix and I don't know if we'll
see something along this but I suspect
Google will address it to some point
which is the big OS fragmentation
problem where people buy an Android
phone and they only get the operating
system they bought it with there aren't
any updates that come so if you buy a
Google Nexus phone you get a lot of
updates but if you buy something from
some of the other manufacturers
sometimes it's hard to get the OS
updates Google has been very
dissatisfied with that I think a lot of
customers been dissatisfied with that
Google has tried to address it at Google
i/os past the last two years and they
haven't done really much to move the
needle there so we might see some new
some new directions out of Google there
to try to fix that fix that problem yes
what are you guys sure yeah no it's a
it's a huge one for them well I think
people are still using to point to how
do you how do you address that problem
that seems like well things like I
wouldn't want to be in that room to you
know try to figure that out no it's a
mess because Google wants to be really
open with Android but on the other hand
to fix this problem it kind of has to
frog March the handset manufacturers
into the future and that's gonna cost
somebody money somewhere
living on maybe this is a question I
think for for Seth we have a question
from Victor Mendoza what oh yes what can
we expect to see from Google for iOS we
saw Chrome and Drive last year can we
expect new apps or new features yeah new
things and Google apps in the App Store
I don't know that we're going to be
getting any new apps I know that you
know Maps Google Maps came out and
there's rumors that a big update to maps
announced that i/o will be indoor maps
so Google has apparently figured out how
to map not just the exterior world but
the interior world as well that's all
very exciting
Google now was just ported over to the
Google Search app for iOS and I believe
we're gonna continue to see more of that
we're going to see Google develop
services on Android and the ones that
are most successful and have the
broadest appeal will be then ported over
to iPhones and iPads and a huge thing
for them has been you know Chrome for
iOS I don't think we can sort of
understate the importance of that
because recently they just figured out a
couple ways to circumvent iOS is a
default app setting which prevents apps
even though that you said as your
default app from commanding a link
control so you click on a link in your
Gmail app and it will still open in
Safari even if you've set Chrome as your
default browser they figured out a way
around that and at least for now Apple
has remained silent
they don't seem if they care there
they're keeping that card particularly
close to their chest does that only work
when you're opening a link that you can
open the link in chrome and Chrome for
iOS or can you also open using other
apps like Google Maps for iOS exactly
it's exactly that Gmail now Gmail for
iOS now has these options so you can
allow so you can force links in Gmail to
open in other Google app services so
maps will go to maps any standard HTTP
link will go to Chrome and there's one
other that I'm forgetting Tube YouTube
yes YouTube YouTube links
even when they're a standard URLs we'll
go directly to the YouTube app so do you
think do you think it's safe to bet then
that Google is going to reproduce as
many of its services as possible on iOS
so that we won't we won't you know have
something where Android gets the premium
features and iOS is kind of an also-ran
mm-hmm absolutely I think they're gonna
try and get as much over there as they
can here's my my wishlist item for
Google and iOS which is a version of
ingress the real world augmented reality
game for iOS I'm kind of skeptical that
it's gonna happen because I think
they're still Google is still developing
that pretty rapidly and it's you know so
right now you can get it only by
invitation on your on your on Android
phones but I wouldn't be surprised if we
see an iOS version of that someday I
might add by the way that Google i/o
attendees get to join ingress which is a
closed in closed beta I mean you can
sign up and you'll get an invitation on
the just sign up over the web but I
think they're trying to kind of kick
ingress into higher gear yeah that's
that that's ingress and the gaming thing
as well I mean that it's they're they're
trying to pull out behind the scenes
they're trying to pull all their
services together oh it's so instead of
thinking of these things as disparate
units they want everyone to think of it
as the Google ecosystem and more than
any other company more even than
Microsoft I would say this is Google's
making a huge push for an ecosystem
approach to using Google sorry Erika
didn't mean I know that's why I'm just
gonna say that I was able to download
ingress for the first time last week on
a tablet we have here I don't own an
Android phone or Android tablet but I
was able to download one here Sharon
Vaknin actually introduced me to that I
had no idea it was a thing but I didn't
need I didn't need it I didn't need an
invitation so maybe it's maybe it's
available to to anyone at this point I'm
not sure now you gotta get an invitation
yeah it's because you were it's because
you're an i/o attendee is that what it
is yeah oh sorry that's good that's good
so that's if you have a question here
from Latian Jenson what do you think
they're going to be doing with the
Chrome
browser will they be integrating Google
now I'll leave the Google now question I
think for South cuz he's written about
that but I think you know this this show
Google i/o the first one in 2008 was all
about the browser and about programming
websites and web apps and using Google
API is to make your website better
embedding Google services so there's a
real heavy web focus at Google i/o and
even though Android is huge in Google
Glasses you know Bagan gets a lot of
hype the browser is still really
important for Google they're still
fundamentally really a web company in a
lot of ways so we're gonna definitely
are going to see some you know chrome
news and chrome developments I think one
of the areas the two two areas I'm eager
to hear some news one is with support
for software that works when you don't
have a network connection this is soft
line work it's been working for years on
this it's getting better slowly but
there's still a lot of work to do
there's something called chrome packaged
apps that's something some web standards
work that sort of in early days right
now that kind of makes it easier to pull
outta a web app and make it look like
you know sort of a standalone native app
like you might be used to on Windows or
Mac we might see some news there and
also I'm hoping to see some news with
Google Docs Google Apps those are the
you know online productivity tools and
the guy who runs chrome also happens to
run apps that sundar Pichai at Google
know he also has recently taken over for
Android he's got a much bigger ambit now
but I think we might I'm hoping we'll
see some improvements to Google Apps
because I think that's kind of
languished as a product in some ways and
now we have Microsoft banging the drum
for office 365 which is its online
office suite so Steph what do you think
about Google now well like I said Google
now is is something that they feel is
something of a sleeper hit it was
introduced last year at i/o for a jelly
bean and they you know the fact that
they ported it to iOS I think is a
really strong indicator of how serious
they're taking Google now it's one of
these interesting
products that takes Google search which
is something that everybody's familiar
with and Google's knowledge graph there
they're phenomenally large database that
can tell the difference between the
Kings sports team and the king of
Thailand and and and do that in a
predictive search way it's it's not
something that's easily summarized but
the fact that they're powering Google
now off of that and the fact that cards
which is Google now as interface is part
of Google glass I think also speaks to
how important Google now is for the
company we saw a few weeks ago a an
official Google add-on for Chrome but in
Russian only that was that that brought
Google now to Chrome I wouldn't be
surprised if we saw fairly soon maybe
even tomorrow an announcement of Google
now as a replacement for iGoogle it's
soon to be discontinued home page
because that does a lot of what Google
now also does yeah so basically I think
I think you're right I've been watching
the gradual arrival of the Google now
notifications in Chrome the technology
the plumbing that lets that happen
they've been working on that for months
now and you know essentially what you
have to think about Google doing is they
have two operating systems they have
Android and then they have chrome and
Chrome OS and a lot of the
infrastructure that they have for
Android with alerts and push
notifications notifications in general
they're moving that from Android to
Chrome so that you're as you said
earlier you're in the Google ecosystem
you don't care what device you're using
you're using up you know maybe a laptop
you're using a PC you're using a
Chromebook you're using an Android
tablet you're using an Android phone
you're using iOS you don't care what
device is in front of you you get your
notifications you get your email you get
your hangout invitation so they're
working on you know Google is is a
services company much more than it is a
gadget or OS company so they're they're
focusing at the services level yeah hey
Eric I don't mean to steal your thunder
Shanklin but Eric could you talk there's
a bunch of questions about hardware
what we can expect Jacob here up here
ahead of the first one and there's
another one about they're basically
asking the things that that you know
that I think everyone's curious about
are we looking at a nexus for update are
we looking at the Google X phone are
they going to be doing an Android
console to go along with all this gaming
right you know first of all we don't
know what they're gonna have tomorrow we
won't find out till tomorrow but I mean
having said that I mean there are a lot
of rumors out there about hardware
they're you know Nexus 4 Nexus 5 Nexus 7
Nexus eight Nexus 11 tablet and phone
rumors out there there's much to live in
a movie I think it should be I think it
will be I think it's coming out the
summer starring Vince Vaughn and Owen
Wilson actually no anyway you know I'm
not sure I mean I would love to see some
new hardware I would love to see it cuz
I'm a hardware guy and I review that
stuff so I'd love to see an update to
the Nexus 7 I love see a new Nexus 11
even the Nexus 5 I don't do phones but
I'd love to see Nexus 5 you know this
rumoured specs for that you know
Snapdragon 800 Snapdragon 600 for the
Nexus 7 you know Tegra 4 for the Nexus 7
that sounds exciting to me I want to see
that kind of stuff but you know as far
as a Motorola phone I'm not sure I think
you guys could be able to talk you know
you guys we were speaking work more to
that kind of stuff um you know as far as
a gaming console mmm not anytime soon
you know we um you know there's there's
an Android gaming console coming out
this year called the Ouya that seemed
that did a first take on a couple months
ago and you know it's it'll be weird for
Google to come out with its own gaming
console having that kind of thing that
kind of thing already out there that
kind of thing already you know kind of
gaining traction popularity and stuff so
you know I know it sounds kind of like a
cop-out but we don't know what we're
gonna see but you know we'd be excited
to see anything new and cool seems like
the rumors have been stronger just for a
new Nexus 7 tablet so basically same
size better screen better processor you
know that seems I think probably the
most solid at this stage
I don't think we're necessarily going to
see new phones it's I don't think that
Google is gonna be anxious to let me put
it this way I don't think Google was
gonna be anxious to announce a new phone
on stage that it's not going to be
selling very soon so you know we'll have
to play that by ear but the days are
kind of gone I think where you would
announce a brand new flagship phone and
then not and then just leave customers
hanging for months and months and months
so that's a good point that also when I
add one more things like you know these
things might be in development but
doesn't mean we're gonna see them
tomorrow you know companies that we you
know get into the habit having these
little like events for one one you know
one device so we might see something
like that in future Google did something
like that last year when they introduced
the Nexus 4 and the Nexus 10 so mm-hmm
discuss here tomorrow doesn't he's not
coming how about the SmartWatch Justin
lawston asks is Google considering the
creation of a SmartWatch I'm sure Google
is considering the creation of
everything right I mean I'm sure their
meetings about everything every little
harbour you can think of you know coming
out of Google as far as a SmartWatch I
haven't heard any rumors about that it's
something it's a thing that was rumored
just today is it really yes
it's intriguing technology a SmartWatch
- you know tech I mean I don't have one
I've never even used one but just
reading about it and thinking about like
you know having it sync up and you know
in those cool ways like that I would be
excited about it but you know I don't
know if we're gonna see you know what
the problem of the SmartWatch is what is
do you see any watches here there's no
arches Mizzy manly manly forearms well
you know okay but you wait but Shanklin
you're known as a weirdo I'm okay that's
true that's true nobody nobody wears
watches anymore we all have phones for
that well this is a fair point because I
do think right now Google's sort of
next-generation interface shifting new
paradigm work is going into Google glass
because that's really you know if if you
want an ancillary device that kind of
supplements what you already get with a
mobile phone I think that their idea is
you want something that you don't have
to you
your hands to operate and a watch could
be nice for you know you're keeping
track of your workouts or something like
that that seemed to be sort of the focus
for most of the wearable computing out
there but I think Google thinks I think
it would rather be you know shifting the
agenda and you know getting us to think
about the shiny new future and I think
Google glass is much more compelling way
for them to do that you know they've got
the skeptics to convince but a watch you
know it's fine it's fundamentally it's
really small it's got a tiny little
screen you probably you know if it has
any amount of computing ability you're
gonna have to talk to it to get it to do
anything you can't type on it so I think
you know as long as you have those can
those constraints for something new I
think Google's more into Google glass
but yeah I'm as said yeah of course
they're trying it they try everything
you know it's funny you mentioned glass
because I think when granted we have no
evidence of this whatsoever but it'd be
very strange after last year's extreme
sports a remarkable demo and debut of
glass for them not to bring it up I
think we're gonna see two things from
glass this year we're gonna see some I
guess you could call them hardware
partners we're gonna see some fancy
high-end eye glass makers announced with
Google glass integration and it's not
going to look anything like the demo
pair that that we have no to that we've
come to love and mock and the other
thing is is that I think we're gonna see
a real big emphasis on glass app
development I did a story a few weeks
ago on the kinds of people that are
developing for glass and the kinds of
investors that are looking at getting
into it and the investors are just
sitting on a ton of cash and they are
very very eager to throw it at
developers they want somebody who's
going to make a killer app for glass
something that is good that's going to
convince people to give it a shot even
with all the weirdo privacy violations
and etiquette problems that it brings
yeah so hey I'm not no Johnnie red come
asks glass has been getting a lot of bad
press over privacy what I don't
understand is why aren't like why people
are talking more about the great things
that this can devise is able to do and I
don't know anything
I think they are talking about the great
things it can do but you know the press
we like controversy and conflict and
disagreements and differences of opinion
and so we always gravitate toward the
fights so the other thing the other
thing to address Johnny's question is
that people don't what one of the
problems is is that the privacy problem
is very obvious somebody looks at you
and is recording you and posting you to
the Internet that's a very simple story
to tell nobody really knows what glass
can do yet because nothing's really been
developed for it it has a lot of a lot
of potential it could be used by
surgeons it could be used by first
responders it could be used when you're
on vacation and you want real-time
translation in your ear but none of them
that's actually been built at least not
to our knowledge and III think that that
the the that disconnect will will we'll
see we'll see a change as apps get
developed for it but for now we can see
the privacy problem we can't see the end
use case in a actual real world
situation so now we have let's say we
have a question from us a fuller Nick
Jew what about the unified messaging app
this is I think the project that's been
codenamed Babel and I mean I personally
I use a lot of Google services I use
hangouts and use Google Voice I use
Google Chat gmail chat and it's a mess
you know I have to go in through
different windows and different dialog
boxes I mean what do you think about
that is there room for improvement for
Google unified messaging so yes
absolutely
is it going to come I don't know I I
mean again look at Google's big top-line
projects at the moment glass Google now
and as for our software and services are
concerned Google+ you know again easily
mockable but something that that behind
the scenes has pulled together a lot of
threads and we're now seeing them sort
of braid it into one rope if you'll let
me run with that metaphor so
we're seeing a a connected chain of
things happening with Google will they
be doing something with Google Plus
almost almost without a doubt like how
could they not what is it you know you
know I Unified Messaging would be
graining Unified I think I mean I think
Google has been focusing a lot of
attention on on communications you know
that all the big ecosystem guys have
realized communication is a big deal for
people you know it's trying to put
people first you hear out of out of
everybody and you know all the big
ecosystem players Microsoft Apple Google
and you know that's a fair point we all
use our devices to communicate and so I
do think that Google needs to clean up
their yeah we got a few more questions
coming in mmm you know we kind of talked
about this earlier maybe we can go over
it again Larry Larry as Barry jr. asks
with blackberries new device being
capable of utilizing Android apps the
problem of Android hardware segmentation
only seems to get larger what can should
the interesting industry do to
streamline Android Harwick segmentation
and mitigate poor or inconsistent
Android experiences I mean it's like I I
don't know I mean I mean one thing is
like what incentivize that you know
better incentivize you know service
devices that already use the latest
version of Android right so you know
everyone on the Nexus 7 wouldn't have a
problem with that but that's not really
a realistic solution I don't know how to
do it you know reminds me of sorry you
know reminds me of is Windows XP Android
2.2 is Windows XP it's just good and
it's just good enough to be on enough
systems on enough devices to be a
colossal pain in the butt 2.3
Gingerbread you mean well any any well
just Jordan yeah any - I know here's the
way I see it I I wouldn't be surprised
if in the future we see kind of a
two-tier and Android handset marketplace
where we have the big boys
Samsung maybe LG Motorola you know those
guys stay on the car
release track so new Android update
comes out from Google and these phones
get it sooner maybe a month or two or
three later after they finished breaking
it for their own custom user interface
oops did I say breaking it sorry
anyhow so you know you have the you have
the big boys who have you know a lot of
brand promise those guys stay on the on
the release train and then you have this
huge number of lower-cost phones and
those come with the OS that it came with
and that's it and there's not really as
much of a brand promise when you get it
there's necessarily maybe as much of an
expectation that you're going to be able
to play all the latest and greatest
games that are coming out it probably
doesn't come with top shelf hardware
anyway because these are the budget
phones so I you know I wouldn't be
surprised if we see a situation where
you get you know you have developers
concentrating making sure their apps
work on all the on all the you know the
high-end devices the ones that stay on
the release train and then people will
just pretty much ignore the other ones
and you have kind of this you know this
ghetto of low-end devices so that's my
personal forecast is that some market
forces are gonna I wouldn't say fix it
but there's kind of giving this
consumers are going to come to an
understanding they can either be on the
train and pay for it or not
mmm harsh hard work SEMA Shanklin how
you gonna fix that but yeah it's it's
true so it's a huge problem
yeah and it's interesting because they
you know with with iOS there's something
analogous where you were you still have
a lot of people on older versions of iOS
but for some reason the Android
fragmentation really grabbed people's
imagination and it's become a much
bigger deal on Android than on on iOS
maybe because there's such a huge
variety of hardware yeah and and if
people don't upgrade to the OS as often
here's a question from Tom Rodman this
is kind of a point product thoughts
about Google keep that's the note-taking
app what do you guys think about that
you tried it at all Seth accidentally I
thought I was using my own note-taker
now and now I'm using Google keep it's
fine it hasn't
it hasn't struck me as any kind of major
game changer except in the fact that it
allows them to rebrand something that's
sort of difficult to expand I mean what
was the old one called Google note or
something like that and I can't remember
the idea of a competing with Evernote I
think is is very clever on Google's part
but they also didn't have anywhere else
to go with it
Evernote sort of owns that that uber
note-taking space where you can
integrate photos and recipes and
business cards and honestly if anybody
can solve a business card the business
card problem I will be very happy yeah
you know but beyond that keep as a
sounds good it depends on development
for it so it's new we could easily see
some improvements announced for tomorrow
but I worry I worry that it runs the
same risk as a lot of Google services
which is they have an 18th month 18
month shelf life and then they die well
that's less what Tom Robin ASCII says
something about feels like about this
feels like it's not ready for primetime
but they must have a big vision or they
wouldn't have bothered right well this
is Google so sometimes they they you
know even in this supposedly more
disciplined era of Larry Page as CEO
they're still throwing a lot of
spaghetti against the wall so I think
this I'm not sure I'd say this is a
piece of spaghetti but I do think you
know way Google operates is they put
something underwhelming out fairly often
you know when Google now launched a year
ago it was okay you can see potential in
it yeah potential for sure but but it
was kind of mad and you know but they
steadily add more features to it they
build it up they wire more services into
it it becomes more interesting richer
and they see what people are doing with
it so you know this is very much the
Google way is launched early and iterate
often so I wouldn't write it off yet but
I'm having a hard time getting really
that excited about Google keep
personally you know yeah let's see what
we have here nice name only Tom Rodman
that's a good name but on your ancestors
for giving you that Rodman name that's
good
ah I see how from David
I wasn't making fun of that's a good
name no no I have an affinity for that
name so David Miller writes how
important is play games to be play store
and Google+ what will be Google's
biggest announcement of i/o
yeah that's a good question
yeah the second the second one is is
this hard to answer because my crystal
ball broke I don't know 20 years ago it
has actually you know it disappoints me
about the Nexus Q is that for what it
does it's actually quite effective it
just doesn't do much yeah yours doesn't
work mine works yeah but it just doesn't
do much um as far as how important is
Play games to the Play Store on Google+
it's about to become much more important
gamification of Education game playing
on mobile devices is just booming as a
as stuff people want to do with their
mobile devices just last week BlueStacks
which had which has built but which sort
of cut its teeth on this app player that
allows you to run Android apps on your
Windows and Mac devices announced that
they were moving into the gaming console
device which and their their game
console called game pop allows you to
use your Android or your iOS phone as
the controller and the service is a
subscription base you pay seven bucks a
month and you get it starting 500
android games on the console and that
will go up over time the point being is
that there's a lot of games a lot of
gamification going on in android games
everyone hoping will be big personally
my phone has really crappy battery life
and i can't play games on it because
it'll die and i'd rather have it for
mission-critical stuff I'd also rather
read a book but so here's here's a
question from Josh Cain this is a
perpetual favorite why do you think
Google+ is still not gaining many users
even though it offers more or at least
as many features as Facebook so this is
the the favorite ghost town question
yeah I would I mean you know Shengo
maybe this is for you because you have a
hugely active life on Google on Google+
compared to other people I think and
you've got like what 10,000 followers
there or something 400,000 but for huge
number those people are passive so
they're so they're they're yeah but but
how's the quality of your engagement
with the people there I think it's
pretty good you know it's up there with
you know Twitter I certainly get you
know a lot of engagement with with both
of them so I don't know I think the I
think the apps are pretty good for
mobile apps are pretty good for both iOS
and Android the Google+ apps they're
very engaging they're fun to you know
watch the little pictures and words
slide by they feel pretty fluid and fun
so I think I like the software I like
the interaction I think the main thing
that Google+ the social network has
going against it is that everybody's
friends are on Facebook so guess what
how many people want to run to social
networks three social networks whatever
so you know Google gets a lot they get
to coast because so many people are part
of Google services you know my my
brother-in-law was trying to rate an A
game on his Android phone the other day
and he found oh I have to sign up for
Google+ if I want to rate this thing you
know and he was actually really actively
annoyed by because he has too much you
know a lot of us have too much more
technology in our lives than we want so
you know that's you know I was talkin I
do think there a lot of people but it's
not just about features it's about who
you know and where they are and where
they engage and that's the biggest
problem Google+ has but I was talking
you know with Google last year last year
last week and they're telling me that I
oh sorry sorry was Google last week and
they were telling me that Google+ has
had the fastest climb of organic new
subscribers not subscribers bolted and
from Gmail or other Google services but
organic new subscribers that the fastest
climb to
whatever metric they've a they they told
me 400 million or something like that I
have to check my notes then any other
service like what took Facebook and
Twitter six or seven years to reach
Google+ has reached with organic new
subscribers in 18 months yeah I do think
I do think those those growth statistics
are a little funny though sometimes
because what you have a new service you
know the first person who figures it out
the Pioneers that say it always takes
them a long time to reach whatever
number and then the copycats can do it
faster because a lot of the marketing
work is done the consumers understand
what the service does so I you know that
I take that with a grain of salt but
yeah but to address our point to address
canes or Josh canes original question
that it's not gaining many users I think
Google would argue that it's actually
quite the opposite that it's it's
skyrocketing in its growth whether
that's true or not well they're they're
they're seeing the kind of engagement I
don't know I would say that I would
caution people though that the way that
you use Google+ is not the way that you
use Facebook and I don't think the two
services are trying to be identical so I
kind of cringe a little when people say
well you know how is Google+ competing
with Facebook or vice versa because they
they occupy a similar space but it's not
like they're fighting over the same
pillar to stand on there's definite
different use cases there we see I was
just looking at this one this is a
spitballing question what would you
think constitutes the killer app for
glass remote control remotely control
your arm your Ironman armor you can do
that I think they what's probably sell a
lot of those thank you well I'm not
gonna agree with that
what's the battery power on that armor
though yeah well apparently apparently
first you have to get FiOS into
Tennessee you guys see that you guys see
the city of Chattanooga objecting to
that as PR as PR it was I thought it was
really well done because yeah you know
they weren't really really yeah waiting
that hard it was
just an opportunity to coast off the
Iron Man publicity machine by tracking
it Chattanooga chatting anyway moving on
we don't need to know about those cities
Spencer pond uh how do you think Google
Wallet will be upgraded there was
something in the planner talking about
that and Google Google glass inspired
indoor Google Maps so first question is
how do you think Google Wallet will be
upgraded and then what about indoor
Google Maps have you guys heard anything
about Google Wallet updates yes there
was a rumor for a while all that they
were going to be making a Google Wallet
card like a physical credit card style
card that you could keep and and use in
case your phone didn't have the proper
NFC hardware that apparently has been
killed so they're not going to be doing
that physical card or at least they're
not going to be announcing it tomorrow
again though this could all be
subterfuge and rumor juggling's
who really knows I don't know that if I
had a Google card unless it was free you
know like like the Clipper cards from
uni around here used to be I don't know
that anyone would actually go out and
get it so and the other question was
indoor Google Maps inspired Google Maps
though I have heard we only spoke about
that at the top of the Hangout that that
that indoor mapping is coming and it's
really only because there's nowhere else
left to go for Google Maps that they've
already been to Mars they've gotten to
the moon they've gone to the ocean floor
what's left I don't know so wait I just
have to throw this in here we have one
from Toronto go Beach it can someone say
Croatia
so we're dutifully saying Croatia there
I'm relational yeah we have Croatian
people in the Hangout that's great but
unfortunately is no specific question so
that's as far as we go that but I think
we're gonna wrap this up wrap up this
hangout we've got one more question this
is another thorny issue
for the for the fanboys this is from Tim
feasel how should Google get iOS
developers to develop their to develop
their apps for Android so how how can we
get the iOS guys to move over to Android
obviously they're you know their
bajillion Android apps but it's still
often the developers write for iOS first
and often iOS only what do you guys
think about the fleshing out the
ecosystem this is the man talked about
going there I mean man isn't it just a
question of how do you get google app
developers to make more money than iOS
developers right yeah I I feel like I
mean that that's the general consensus
at least is that you can make more money
because people actually buy apps people
are willing to pay for in-app purchases
and stuff like that if you're on iOS
versus if you're on Google Play I don't
know how tricky that is and the ad
conversion rates are better as well fine
well yeah yeah so I mean if if Google
can somehow make it so that app
developers for Google Play can make just
as much money or more money than they
can develop us I think you'll see more
and also these the segmented hardware is
a promised is a problem - I mean iOS
definitely you see upgrades over you
know it's basically the same family of
hardware though that give you know from
ipad 2 to I pad for or iPhone you know
iPhone 3GS - iPhone 5 it's really the
same family like especially if you're
talking about games you know you know if
you do jump me from a regular display -
Retina displays just double the
resolution it's not that it's not that
complex but if you're going on Google on
a Google platform if you're trying to
develop a game on a Google platform yeah
always different hardware things to
consider and I think that just makes it
a little bit more complex and just not
as easy more headachy to develop for yep
I think that's it alright guys well
thanks so much for joining us on the
Hangout here we're gonna wrap it up and
we'll be covering Google i/o with live
blog tomorrow starting it I think 8:30
