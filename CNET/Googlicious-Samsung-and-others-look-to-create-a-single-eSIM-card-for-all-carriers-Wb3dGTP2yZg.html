all your Google Alysha since everything
Google that we can pack inside of a show
now it's not the biggest news week this
week but we start off with an update on
Google's self-driving cars after its
first accident that involved injuries
now it was nothing serious other than
some minor whiplash but a post by the
director of the project Chris Urmson
talks about how the cars are being hit
surprisingly often but not because of
errors by their own cars but because of
human error by other drivers
now since 2009 Google's self-driving
cars have been involved in 14 accidents
with a 25 car fleet that has driven over
1.9 million miles there's never really
been a real number based on accidents
per miles driven because over half of
all car crashes are never even reported
so they're really hoping their
driverless car project can also give
them some more accurate information
all right Google continues to make move
to do really anything and everything a
recode report says the big G is hiring
the technical team that built home joy a
service that matches people with
professional home cleaners now a report
from earlier this year said Google was
looking to launch a tool for people to
compare local home repair services for
plumbers electricians roofers and other
handyman jobs so the brainpower behind
home joy will most likely be building
this out now we don't know if it will be
a standalone service or integrated into
search but one thing is certain coming
soon
you'll be seeing a lot more of this
thanks Google all right according to
Bloomberg the boobs is on track to
launch their paid YouTube service by the
end of this year
content always drives these things and
their top partners that account for 90%
of its views are on board but the major
TV networks are still holding out like
Fox NBC and CBS according to YouTube's
Terms YouTube stars can't make their
videos public and monetize them unless
they agree to be part of this service so
for them it's a no brainer when the
challenge is getting original content
that's worth paying for Netflix has done
it and it's now up to YouTube to figure
that out
alright some pretty sweet developments
on the smartphone front Samsung Apple
and other phone manufacturers are in
talks with cell carriers to create a SIM
card similar to the one that Apple's
iPad that
let's a user sign up for a service plan
of their choice on a single model of
hardware now this would make life easier
for everyone
instead of manufacturing different phone
models that support each different cell
carrier the idea would be an embedded
Universal SIM card that's built into the
phone and not user accessible you would
be able to sign up for any service but
also switch them at any time as well the
goal is to start rolling this out
sometime in 2016
Samsung is also announced in super-slim
Galaxy Tab s2 measuring in at five point
six millimeters that's half a millimeter
thinner than the current iPad air the
tab s2 will come in either nine point
seven inch or 8 inch screen sizes with a
twenty 84 by 1536 resolution Super
AMOLED display that's newly optimized as
they say for better contrast and natural
colors it will also get Samsung's
improved fingerprint scanner an eight
megapixel rear camera three gigs of RAM
expandable memory storage and LTE and
Wi-Fi models now there's no release date
or pricing that's been revealed just yet
and if you're an experienced reown err
that lives in Sweden and owns a Windows
PC and also must be willing to
completely wipe your phone of its
personal setting data and content if
this sounds like you you are in luck so
that narrows it down to like five people
sony is looking for people to test their
new android concept software between mid
july and september but will not reveal
any specifics or even a hint at what it
will look like now no other device will
work and customers from other countries
will not be able to join either but I
think a word of advice would be to get
as close to stock Android as possible
alright that's gonna do it for this
week's show you can always email us at
Google issues at cnet.com or tweet me at
brian Tong thanks for watching we'll see
you all next time for some more of that
delicious
