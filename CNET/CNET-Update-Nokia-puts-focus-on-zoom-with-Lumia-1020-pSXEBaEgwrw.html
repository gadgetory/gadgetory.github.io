I'm Bridget Carey and this is your C net
update nokia revealed a new Windows
Phone the Lumia 1020 and it has quite
the unique camera this has a 41
megapixel sensor and it has advanced
image processing software so the camera
itself uses six lens Carl Zeiss optics
which can take on wide angles and with
41 megapixels it takes in lots of
information so you can crop a photo
really close and still keep the quality
even after you take the photo you can
zoom in to see small details or zoom out
to see what was around your original
photo but it'll save to a five megapixel
photo when you want to post it online it
also captures 1080p HD video at a rate
of 30 frames a second and it has rich
audio recording nokia also packed in
tech to help with image stabilization
and to improve low-light performance
users can even change exposure settings
manually to do long exposure effects and
if you're not that savvy with cameras
there is a tutorial loaded into the
phone the camera is what this phone is
all about but there are some other perks
the touch screen can be used with
fingernails or gloves
it's that sensitive and it has scratch
and shatter resistant Gorilla Glass
wireless charging is not built-in but
you can get it if you buy a separate
shell and there's also an $80 camera
grip case you can buy that acts as a
tripod mount and an extra battery the
Lumia 1020 will be sold at 18 T on July
26th and it comes in yellow white and
black but be prepared it is not cheap
it'll cost three hundred dollars and
that's with a new two-year contract
Nokia is betting that customers will
want to invest a little more to get this
kind of camera since nowadays most folks
just use their phones as their main
camera and with Nokia's news came the
announcement that several apps are
coming to Windows Phone including
Flipboard vine and path Hipstamatic will
have a special app for the Lumia 1020 to
take advantage of the camera in addition
some other apps are also being updated
for Lumias high quality camera including
Yelp and Foursquare and that's not the
only Windows news Microsoft is busy
making updates to several products and
during a conference the company hinted
that
we'll be getting support for large
meetings and support for enterprise
voice as well as integration with
outlook.com and office 365
Windows Phone is working to create a
common app platform with Windows and the
surface tablet will have new accessories
and accessory colors and expect to also
hear something soon about office getting
its own Windows Store apps looks like a
busy year for Microsoft
that's your tech news update you can
