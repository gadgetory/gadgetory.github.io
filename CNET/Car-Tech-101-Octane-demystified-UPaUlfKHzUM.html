drabs over the course of a year so the
price difference between premium and
regular may seem small on a per visit
basis yes the percentage difference
between the two grades has declined due
to the more rapidly increasing cost of a
gallon of any kind of gas but the real
cost spread of premium over regular has
increased over the last six years in the
u.s. put another way it used to cost you
a little under 150 extra bucks a year to
run premium assuming fifteen thousand
miles a year and 20 mpg for your car but
around 2004 began to take off and now
it's a choice that costs more like two
hundred and forty dollars a year real
money let's find that if it's worth it
now premium gas has this image largely
due to marketing as being some happen to
be a more explosive kind of fuel that
blows off all this additional power in
fact it's kind of the opposite Premium
gas is high octane gasoline is is first
a blend of many components that have
many different properties and as such
octane is one of those properties high
octane allows you to compress the fuel
more higher pressure higher heat without
spontaneous combustion
if you use regular or low octane gas in
an engine that wants higher the mixture
may combust it spontaneously in the
cylinder before the spark sets it off
that's called pre detonation or not
that's the sound of your engine slowly
coming apart it's hurting your engine
there's a little mini explosion it goes
on in this four cycle engine one of the
cycles is compression when that goes out
of whack there's an explosion that's not
good it's a physical pressure way of
traveling in the combustion chamber and
you're actually hearing the result of
that pressure we're knocking against
metal parts in the combustion chamber
these explosions they can hurt the
internal in the engine they can hurt the
catalytic converter of the engine the
science that goes on when this 4 cycle
engine does this combustion process it's
pretty high-tech and one of those
elements is out of whack it means it's
not happening right now high compression
engines were all the rage back in the
muscle car and Pony car era and they're
big and racing of course but lately car
makers have been getting into high
compression for everyday cars because
they get more power out of little tiny
engines that need less air and fuel to
fill the cylinder each cycle in other
words they create good power and use
less gas
now why does premium gas or high octane
gas cost more is a very contentious area
refiners will tell you they get less of
it out of a barrel of crude than they do
regular secondly they add different
additives to it that will be used to
increase the octane and those are more
expensive than just crude itself the
main additive back in the day used to be
tetraethyl lead which increases the
octane beautifully except it's led we
don't do that anymore but that's what
gave rise to the old nickname for
premium they used to call it
methyl with a removal of lead you
removed an octane source and so other
sources of octane or required that's it
is modern cars as you probably know have
sensors and computers and variable
components all over them as a result
they can sense not from running low
octane gas and adjust the engine
slightly to compensate for it knock it
out but there's a limit to that
adaptability depending on your car's
design that's why you want to just check
your car's manual it'll often tell you
what octane level is okay and another
one that's recommended also maybe one to
avoid on the minimum side sometimes
regulars find other cars say mid grade
at least Premium at best
others say premium only okay when you go
to the gas pump you can look at the
actual number button that you're going
to select and look at the fine print and
it will talk about a minimum octane
number and under that it will typically
say this sort of bit of math R + M / -
that's research octane + motor octane /
- or the average of the two so it there
are single cinder engines that are used
to calculate the octane of a given
gasoline so the research number test is
conduct at lower engine speeds and so it
tends to be higher and then the motor
octane is conducted higher engine speeds
and tends to be lower you take the
average of the two and you come up with
what we call the anti-knock index and
that's likely the number you'll see in a
modern car manual
US automakers have recently groused that
octane in the u.s. is so low they can't
make the kind of engines they offer in
other markets smaller ones will even
more power and greater efficiency just
one point of clarification is that in
places like Europe and South America
where the opt-in numbers that people
call for are in the high 90s 97 9 years
that's only the research number right
here in the US we do the research plus
the motor and divide it by to put it in
a nutshell
you're safe using the lowest grade of
gas that your car manual doesn't forbid
that's your baseline typically
especially in higher performance cars
though there are tangible benefits to
using the ultimate grade the premium
especially if you want the full
performance you paid for</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
