colleagues here on stage to be
announcing planetary resources the
vision of planetary resources is to make
the resources of space available to
humanity both in space and here on earth
whether it's propellant from water on
asteroids or strategic metals and
minerals that are important to promoting
and creating a world of abundance here
on earth I had the pleasure of having
written a book called abundance the
future is better than you think and the
book was a response of saying you know
it's time to stop all this negative
thinking we are living into a world
where individuals and small teams have
the ability to incredible things
scarcity which has been the model the
past is contextual and technology is an
abundance liberating force and whether
its abundance on metals and minerals and
energy and real estate these are the
things in near infinite quantities in
space we have a population of almost
9,000 near-earth asteroids which
represents by the way my friends 1% 1%
of the near-earth asteroids that are
larger than 50 meters so there are
almost 500,000 between 500,000 and a
million asteroids that we expect to find
out there over time that are greater
than 50 meters and that are close to us
in terms of the near-earth capability
that's an extraordinary amount we only
know one percent of them right now and
so our first phase beyond the
development of our technology is to
prospect we're going to do it by
launching a Space Telescope a series of
space telescopes which our arcade 100
series which you're going to see and
then we're eventually going to launch
swarms of spacecraft using our arcade
300 series to these targets as we
characterize them as we learn about them
and eventually into the third phase
which is the extraction phase we're
going to decide based upon the
characteristics that we find out in the
prospecting phase exactly where we're
going to go and what we're going to do
