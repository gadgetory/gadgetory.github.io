cnet's we're here at Mobile World
Congress in Barcelona to check out to
new asa phones first up let's take a
look at this guy this is the a-sun
liquid e1 this is the slightly fancier
of the two smartphones so here you can
see it's got a 4.5 inch display and that
has a 960 x 540 pixel resolution it's
got a dual core 1 gigahertz processor
that doesn't sound too glorious when I
say it like that but this phone actually
feels pretty snappy it seems quite
responsive so I'm not too concerned to
be honest if you flip it around on the
back you can see it's got a 5 megapixel
camera it's got an LED flash as well
there is a front-facing camera that has
a much lower resolution of not point 3
megapixels so you might find your video
calls look just a little bit pixelated
it's got dual speakers and an FM radio
and it's running Android version 4.1 now
that is not the most recent version of
Android but it's pretty close so you'll
get access to the app store of course
and all of these home screens that you
can fill with widgets and other exciting
apps I have to say I'm quite impressed
by the e ones design I like the red
accents here on the speaker and lock
button and if you flip it around you see
you get this pattern shaped grill across
the back and you also get these speakers
and the camera it's quite a nice effect
overall if that's a little bit rich for
your blood then you might want to check
out the Acer Liquid z2 which is a
smaller cousin to the phone we just
looked at so this one has a 3.5 inch
display which is a lot smaller that's
got a resolution of 480 x 320 pixels
that's not a huge pixel count to be
honest so you might find web pages and
things looking just a little bit
blurrier than you'd like it's got a 1
gigahertz processor on the inside of it
but because of that low resolution and
the fact that you're probably going to
be running quite undemanding apps you
should find its kind of fast enough for
what you need to do if I spin it around
you can see it's got a 3 megapixel
camera and it's got this quite nice
looking speaker down here as well
running android version 4.1 jelly bean
just like the last phone that we looked
at in terms of design this phone is the
perfect antidote if you're sick of palm
ruining smartphones like the Samsung
Galaxy Note 2 it's extremely small and
it feels very light as well spin it
around and I like this curved effect on
the back overall I would say this is a
compact quite attractive little phone
the only thing that really lets it down
is this low resolution screen both
phones are going to be coming out in
Russia and the UK in mid-march other
European countries will follow shortly
after that unfortunately there's no word
at the moment of the US release date the
z2 is going to cost about a hundred
euros while the e1 is going to cost a
slightly pricier 200 euros or thereabout
on the west road casino terror mobile
Congress and here are two new acer
smartphones</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
