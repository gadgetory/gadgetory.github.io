I'm Cena it's cara de su boy joined by
senior writer seth rosenblatt Seth
covers google and google has been in the
headlines a lot this week let's start
with the gmail update as a gmail user
I'm really interested in these new tabs
that are coming out yes so your Gmail
will soon have tabs across the top which
will automatically filter your primary
email it'll filter your social
networking emails it will filter your
deals updates and it's really quite an
interesting look for Gmail it's a new
thing to help people filter the email
better because in the past you've had to
create filters right this is all
automatic what's nice about the new
gmail is that you can turn it off and
the old interface is still there well
these tabs be available on both the
browser version and the mobile version
mm-hmm so the apps will be getting an
update for android and iOS and the web
browser will also update and this will
be rolling out in the next few weeks
okay also google made an announcement
about their new music service becoming
available for iOS absolutely tell us
more again we don't know too much they
haven't said much at this point but
Google's all access will be available
for iOS sometime in the next few weeks
possibly as late as june or july they
haven't said this is a new music
streaming service that was announced
earlier in May and how has it been
received so far for Android users so far
it seems like Android users like it when
you sign up for it and it's separate
from the standard Google Music which
allows you to get all of your music when
you want streaming over the cloud this
is more like Spotify for google although
it's all run out of the same app if you
sign up now you get a 30-day free trial
and if you sign it before june thirtieth
it's 799 per month thereafter it's 999
per month alright so we'll keep an eye
out for that way and finally google has
also announced that they're sort of
getting into the nutrition or calorie
counting business yes there's nothing
that they don't touch apparently how is
this going to work so basically Google
now which is their knowledge graph made
real it's this an enormous database of
almost 600 million things pieces
information and data and all the end
to tell the difference between the Kings
team and the king of Thailand stuff like
that will be available nutrition
information will now be available in
Google now so you can look up say how
many calories are in an apple and it
will pull up a card that says how many
calories are in an apple and how is that
going to work do you use your voice or
do you type it I can do both you could
do both okay and the point of this yeah
I guess Google wants people to live
longer so that you can continue to buy
their services get people locked in
longer but this is a free service this
is free this is part of Google now and
google search and we expect it to roll
out here again in the near future
Google's been very noncommittal recently
on its announcements all right
fascinating stuff a lot to look forward
to thank you so much for your writer
