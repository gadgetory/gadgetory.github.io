today and show you something that you
can change your life again the
Thunderbolt SSD porbo drive from el gato
now this is just a normal portable drive
with a very nice housing made of
aluminum and it doesn't attract finger
prick which is great on a bottom here
unified two rubber feet long rubber feet
right here to put on any surface now
take a look at this sigh here it's the
only one Thunderbolt port and that means
something very special this is the first
dry that doesn't require a separate
power adapter diagonal well I've been
using this bad boy for years first first
place all right mr. know-it-all let me
tell you something that is true in the
windows world you have used be both
power drive for many many years but see
this is the first a poli purple vast
power product is magic just for a record
though the dry doesn't come with the
cable the cable we have to buy it from
apple by yourself for another fifty
dollars but hey fifty dollars okay and
this is a cable of the Thunderbolt cable
and I've been wondering why Apple make
this cable so long it's really long it's
sick prank sick foot long and it's a
pretty long it's actually longer than me
and with the nao here I understand why
now first of all this is the portable
drive it means you use it when you are
traveling and when you're traveling is
hard to find a gym sometime and this can
come in handy as a jumping rope for a
quick workout voila now stop worrying
why I look so good now secondly seeing
this cable is really long and it's
almost impossible to put this driver
here next to a laptop without cable
running over the place but you actually
can do this and this way you can live up
your laptop and walk around that is a
true meaning of mobile it just makes so
much
sense and now the question is how much
you have to pay for the magic this drive
right here is 240 gig and it costs
around seven hundred dollars there's
another version that I had on 20 gig and
costs four hundred fifty dollars now
that is a lot of money for not so much
storage space but hey magic is magic
well in my testing the dry is also one
of the fastest bus power portable drive
I've ever seen it also varies to you is
it plug and play there is no setup or
software to play around with the dragon
also work with other Thunderball devices
in a daisy chain setup but it has to be
at the end of the chain seen it has only
one port and that's it once again my
name is dong go and this has been the
first look at the very first bus power
thunderbolt port bow dr foam and gal toe
and now go take a shower
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
