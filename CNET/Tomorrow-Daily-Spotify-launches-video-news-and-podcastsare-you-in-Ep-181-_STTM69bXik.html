with a bionic face Intel's awesome
amazing gigantic science fair announces
its winners and gigantic changes to one
of music's biggest apps it's tomorrow
daily
creating citizens of the internet
welcome to tomorrow daily the best geek
talk show in the known universe I am
Ashley us together Jody meas always
punching the sky kill anonymous uh I
like the you like to keep me on my toes
the intro they're always the other day
all the time yeah all day every day
let's kill I cut your tire I cut the
brakes on your car so that will be a fun
ride some fun little w-well card right
card whoo what card car ride it's gonna
be just like just like burnout will be
great okay guys we have to talk about
some pretty cool headlines so let's hit
it usually app updates are stupid boring
it's like minor improvements or whatever
but every now and again that makes a
huge improvement that almost doubles
what it could actually do before okay so
the app update I want to talk about is
Spotify now this is a streaming music
music service kind of a free but also
you pay if you want to listen to it on
mobile okay and such like that but but
it it plays any song you can think of
you could just search it and grace
playlist it's just like the best thing
in the world you Taylor Swift hates it
but who cares yeah you won't find any
Taylor Swift music well Spotify has
decided that wants to step up it has
added podcasts okay she's recent
important for people who like to listen
and it has added video so not only can
you stream your favorite songs you can
also stream your favorite podcast you
don't have to open up a completely
different app and also you can you can
watch videos about news there's a
there's offerings from Nerdist Comedy
Central NBC vice so big people are
releasing like daily content on there so
you don't have to go elsewhere for it I
like yeah usually I have to open up
different apps to Laurel that's so so so
whether it be soundcloud maybe for some
or the odd day at the podcast podcast
app i use a pocket casts for my pejabat
you do not do any more well that's
unless you don't have some big modify
something yeah Logan notice that they
don't have this american life so I mean
like thurs okay except chasing okay
that's not oh that's not even it they
also added a playlist for moods times a
day and tastes kind of like their songs
that app I like songs there's also a
runner feature for if you're like me and
you like to run it'll match the bpms to
how fast you're running so it's cool
yeah that's weird I'm very interested to
see how that works i'm gonna have to go
for a run a little bit later okay i
already check this out by the way it's
really cool it's very straight line it's
not it doesn't like out of the gate like
hit the floor is it easy to navigate
yeah it's very easy okay that is great
you just pull the side menu anyway so
yeah the video the it actually launched
today Oh in u.s. Sweden Germany and UK
on iOS okay so stuck in android I just
went over to iOS so I'm kind of happy
about that but it launched this morning
you know it's an interesting an
interesting fact is that with how
successful that Spotify is worldwide
because it's a worldwide app yeah just
you know us not just us two I think it's
the largest streaming any largest music
streaming up in the world right and I
think Pandora might be number one here
but in the world spa defies likes numero
uno everybody had it before us but it's
still not profitable it's not a
profitable that company seems crazy
nervous yeah but they're hey you know
what they're making forward movements
again I think the big game plan I think
the big announcement here is is that
Spotify is trying to become your one of
your like home place apps it wants to
fit into your life it doesn't just want
to be the thing you plug in to your
auxiliary cord listen to music but it's
what you wake up in the morning and you
watch anyway go for your run you hit the
button you you on your drive marry me
that connect listen to your podcast to
learn about what's news and celebrities
they want to fit in every single facet
of your life and that's incredible that
is a very bold thing for a company it's
not making profit but the biggest thing
I think is the video because they're
trying to replace anything from YouTube
to any sort of news app that you may be
using they're trying to replace all of
that modify is trying to basically be
your mobile home page like it's instead
of a homepage it's like the app that is
constantly like your touchstone to the
world outside that's really smart I'm
down it's
ten dollars a month if you're interested
in trying out Spotify if you want it you
can use any computer for free but if you
want to like he's on mobile and you know
like access music all the time it's ten
dollars to ten dollars a month you get
all this video all this music monthly I
think it's worth it I think it's pretty
cool I don't have to try it I use our do
already I'm in well I'm in your in it
I've I'm in back it that is if that
brings us to our hashtag of the day you
Kayla's in but if you want to use the
Tash tag TD Spotify and tell us if
you're in and if yes or no and if not
why like why would you not be in and
also if yes why are you in okay so i
pretty much explained everything I have
to say about this so I'm in I I want to
try it because i use okay so right now i
use our do i use like three different
apps and i think you make a good point
that this kind of consolidates things i
use our do Songza and pocket casts those
are like my three kind of maine music
apps that I use one in the car and all
this stuff so I would have to say like I
definitely will try it but I really do I
am kind of an old lady in that I'm set
in my ways and I like that kind of I
like having things separate sometimes
like I like being able to just say okay
I'm in the mood for podcasts open up my
podcast app like because it may be
sometimes and I hope some of you relate
to this otherwise I'm gonna feel like a
real weirdo i'm sure i'm a weirdo but
sometimes I get overwhelmed with choices
that I have and so maybe this like
sometimes if you open it up there's so
much choice that I'm just like clothes
and I'm just like I don't want to deal
with that and then you just open up your
podcast app okay here you go then again
you're wearing a welcome to night Vale
shirt I may not have that podcast on
there what if they don't uh huh me
terrible I have to listen to Cecil there
listen tell me the news about Nigel so
tell us TD TD Spotify tell us if you're
gonna use it or not in it and and why
other way yeah and what would it take
for you to actually make that crossover
like what is the most enticing thing to
you about it what's the console making
mom in kavos a month i'm already paying
anyway i want to tell you about the
Intel Science Fair this is so rad I love
a good science fair obviously I never
won any or entered any when I was
getting probably got the whole night I
think I'd probably entered a science
fair but I did very poor i want a
science fair did you yeah
it was on a best way to preserve bread
oh it's to wrap it in plastic and then
foil I'm gonna remember that for my
house somebody do that ok so this
software Intel throws their
International Science and Engineering
Fair and it took place last week look at
this this is bear my not messing around
and these are finalists these are all
people who won regionals in other
locations all around the world this is a
global science fair there were just
hundreds of entries this is unbelievable
there were 20 different categories that
you could compete in and these are some
of the things that these kids kids by
the way these are kids these are not
adults yeah that's cool but it's not
bread it's not listen there's a robot
that picks up robot glove the pics of a
ball but it's not preserving grand
challenge let's all be row this lady
built a robot they party like there were
so many really cool entries but the
winner of the the isef the intel isef
was Raymond Wang he's 17 and he's from
Canada he took home the grand prize for
his engineering project and what this
engineering project is is it's a new air
inlet system for airplane cabins and
here he is he's just won the this new
system improves air quality and reduces
transmission of disease while traveling
an air so traditional systems are
compared to traditional systems this
system that Raymond Wang built improves
fresh air availability and cabins by
more than one hundred and ninety percent
which is serious business and also
reduces concentrations of inhalable
pathogens by 55 times compared to
traditional design those kids set don't
like this smart little guy and you can
see the other two people next to him are
using the other second their second
place yeah losers losers no but they're
they're also they also want anyone
second place oh this is I love this so
much this is amazing so I got what they
would they put in yes so the other of
the two of us selfie stick he loses oh
no come on maybe somebody invented that
with like sticks or something like at
the like they just created one out of
like it's still basically anyway what
did this I gotta put second and third
place inexpensive easy to use HIV
testing device from the girl
you saw next to rimming and then a
containment device that would
theoretically allow an undersea oil well
to quickly and safely recover after a
blow out my god yeah these kids are
making like amazing amazing thing again
amazing but not bread not bread but all
these kids are under the age of 18 so
this is pretty impressive and also just
makes me feel super optimistic about the
future beating in very good hands if
they're if they're in the hands of
people like this then I feel okay about
it i'm not i'm not super freaked out as
much as i was before but it's pretty
cool that intel does this i like they do
the grand prize winner that a raymond
wang took him seventy five thousand
dollars it's a big prize and not a
scholarship just actual money they
actually they also do scholarships they
look de prizes there are tons of prizes
in this science fair and like their
scholarships and cash prizes and all
sorts of different awards that you can
win like at the science fair so pretty
pretty awesome that intel does this so
great work intel and great work raymond
wang and all the other people who
entered and we're able to attend Raymond
congratulations it's not bread it's not
bread actually my bread is moldy thanks
to you they're gonna engrave that right
on the bottom of your award it's just
gonna say like Raymond weighing first
place like he'll do here's the award and
then I'll very bottom it's gonna take
these kids are so slow it's not bread
yeah I know they really are um can I
tell you about some other smart people
it's gonna it's about a turtle a
real-life turtle you got me I like
turtles I've heard that you like turtles
okay so um we're gonna keep going on the
happy news train and we're gonna talk
about this turtle who got a bionic face
I got it got a fresh fresh new face
secondly 3d printed uh aku tak a cooked
three is a loggerhead turtle named after
this rescue agency that discovered him
and sadly he was found last summer and
he had been injured by boat propeller
and you can see this is his 3d printed
prosthetic cool help give him a newbie
keas to look at the bottom of his beak
to see you see ortus um and so he yeah
he was injured by boat propeller and
over sixty percent of his job the top of
the bottom was missing oh and it was
fractured it was he was in pretty bad
shape and so the diff defamer sea turtle
research rescue and rehabilitation
center in Turkey
came to this little guy's rescue and
reached out to this medical 3d printing
company called B Tech and what they did
was they did a scan of his face they did
a full scan of his face they made a 3d
modeling software they reconstructed his
jaw using software and then made a
seamless prosthetic foreign amusing 3d
printing and then attached it was like
titanium and this is just like this is
some turtle and they were like hey lando
turtle we gotta get this together we
need to put we need to put this turtle
back together I love this story so much
isn't that crazy they're just like this
turtle come on guys I know I know like
we got to help this for ya he's not
gonna thank us no but let's put a beak
back up and apparently now he's a
supervillain now he's a supervillain
turtle and he will be the envy of all
other sea turtles when he goes back into
the ocean which apparently they will put
him back in the ocean when he is fully
healed up so he'll be able to go back
out in the ocean and they think that
he'll be able to to live a full and
fruitful turtle life back in the sea Wow
I know the best weird is what's weird is
that somebody's gonna like whatever
accidentally find that turtle catch that
turtle whatever and they're gonna be
like wait what is going on they're
evolving cave this man Gary yeah there's
an underworld like they're turning in a
robot that's incredible i love when when
science just does it cuz it's good for
them does it good for the sake of doing
good so that's a cut three very cool
very cool turtle thing it's still not
bread it is not keeping your bread from
getting moldy but that turtle is that
turtle doesn't care about your bread so
he just wants a jog in and now he has
one so there you go that is it for our
headlines we'll be right back with my
Brad Bird interview for oh this is good
and we're don't leave we're gonna talk
about the future wind and a little bit
of the past and then we of course have
our user feedback and our phone target
for the day so don't click away it's
tomorrow daily
welcome back to the show we have
returned we mentioned yesterday one of
the new releases this week is
tomorrowland which is the new Brad Bird
movie mm-hmm ah Disney is tomorrow and
it looks really cool i saw it i like I
liked it out of 10 how many stars out of
10 okay for me i would say i give it 8
out of 10 yeah but i think that if you
are not me you might give it like a 7
like you might take a star well we're
asking you i'm giving it a freak i'm
giving a couple free passes on some
issues with the movie because i liked it
so much so i would say a top 10 I'm
sorry about 10 will say Ashley's reviews
hit it mad max 10 out of 10 tomorrow
line no.2 Logan you seen Mad Max yet Oh
fair enough all right so all right but
this is this is pretty hyped up as far
as this is a brand new IP four dis brand
new this is really cool but nowhere but
not an unoriginal idea kale is a really
big fan of Disney and the history of
Disney and so am i and so um Walt Disney
had this idea to build the do you want
to tell them what epcot stands for so
before he passed he bought a Walt Disney
bought this space in Florida where
Disney World is now where he was gonna
but like he was gonna build his own City
yeah call the experimental prototype
city of tomorrow that abbreviates to
Epcot he wasn't trying to make epcot
center no but anyway who's gonna make
this like dislike this amazing community
yeah this week opians waiting you like
pie in the sky but he died it didn't get
to make it but that dream stayed alive
in Tomorrowland right and so brad bird
who is the kind of the genesis of the
iron giant to the director of The
Incredibles now the Incredibles 2 is
gonna be working on that directed
Tomorrowland and sort of had this very
same sort of optimistic look to the
future and wanted to make a film about
it and I got to talk to him a little bit
about tomorrow land and the future and
also epcot so take a look hi everybody I
am here with Brad burr the director of
Tomorrowland and we are very excited to
interview you about this wonderful movie
that I got to see last night great thank
you you are a huge fan of the future I
am hey you you have the iron giant the
incredibles and now Tomorrowland I mean
you
of looking forward I'm wondering what
you think the most hopeful invention
innovation or discovery that humanity
could make in the next 50 years could be
I think the way people are being able to
reconstruct people after horrible
accidents is kind of amazing and i know
some older people who are really have
trouble getting around and then they get
a hip replaced and they're like they
could run a marathon and that stuff just
really impresses me so on that note is
there anything that you're afraid of
that's an idea i've tried to explore in
my own goofy way and in other films is
that every time there's an advancement
there's a dark side to the advancement
and you know i think that that's always
the question when you come up with
something is the human mind is very
imaginative and anytime there's a
positive use for something there's
somebody who goes flood if you use it
for some horrible thing and there there
always is that two sides to the coin but
that doesn't mean that we shouldn't keep
exploring and keep trying I think that
we're wrestling with our own limitations
in terms of our hearts and that is kind
of a story that's always going to
continue so let's talk really quickly
about Walt Disney he had a vision for a
community a futuristic community in
Epcot yes do you think that Epcot could
work today is that is that a community
that could work today I think absolutely
um I think it's heartbreaking that he
didn't get to realize that because that
was the thing that he was most
hypnotized by when he died there are
stories that you know in his hospital
bed when he's laying there dying he's
actually explained to people using the
tiles on the ceiling where everything
would go and this in the city and the
idea was to collaborate to take all the
imaginative people that worked at Disney
and collaborate with companies to try
these these outlandish idea
is and that really inspired our film and
I think it could happen but I think
there has to be a will to do it and i
think that the unfortunate thing is a
guy like disney is the kind of guy you
need to lead that challenge and you know
that person male female who knows group
of people that person is necessary or
those people are necessary to drive it
because it wouldn't happen otherwise but
i absolutely think it's within reach i
think we have to start talking about
using all our energy and steering it
away from fighting each other and all
this pointless stuff it's like that's
one thing I loved about the space
program was it was it was using our
brains to go out and go beyond our
planet and go out there and find out
what else is out there you know I
thought that was a wonderful thing and I
i look forward to us going back i love
that we sent probes they're great but i
would also love to see more manned
missions well for what it's worth I
think Walt Disney would have loved
Tomorrowland oh thank you very much well
thank you so much for talking to me and
and giving giving us your time and good
luck with the release of the movie thank
you very much so we have what a jerk
that guy was such a jerky guys know he
was amazing he's so nice and and I got
to tell him about my favorite one of my
favorite paintings which used to be a
mural at horizons and not in disney
world which is called the prologue in
the promise you've seen it I've shown it
to you love it um Robert T McCall's very
famous kind of like sci-fi muralist so
yeah really interesting interview and I
had a lot of fun talking to him I didn't
get a whole lot of time I wish I I could
have picked his brain all day about
Epcot in the future and I just he's so
interesting but you and I have very it
like we can't obviously like the show
can only go so long you guys but um do
you think it would work today like if
Elon Musk tomorrow was like hey I'm
going to build this crazy futuristic
community it's going to run off of power
walls and it's going to have Hyperloop
capsules that you shoot yourself to
other parts of the community like would
you want to live there how would that
work do you think people do it
want to live there and I think there
would be people that would jump at that
chance there because you know like even
people would move to a place because of
google fiber that's true but but it's so
it's just a controversial idea to be
trying to create a perfect society and
only be able to allow in certain people
right so it would be really controversy
of applicant was jumping just like they
would look criteria let me I've got
nothing to add to society they be like
I'd be like hey you know I can host good
they'd be like get out we can host the
daily community to show that would be
great we have a talk show on the commune
muscadet that's what we call it yeah
musky muskan it Musketeers yeah let's
get it moving Musketeers muscadine lon
Musketeers okay so um I think you can
also go check it out tomorrow dailies
out what this weekend for ya this
weekend this Friday to start tomorrow
daily about it tomorrow daily is not
this weekend it's the only time it is
not it was over the weekend but yeah
it's Tomorrowland you know two are these
Tomorrowland dash movie com is the
website you check things out real quick
uh Logan out of 10 stars what do you
give Tomorrowland 727 eight other people
i think would give it a seven so um I
enjoyed it I think if you have a
childlike imagination you will enjoy it
too so go see it um but thank you brad
bird and everybody at walt disney
pictures for letting us do that you guys
are awesome and now it is time to talk
about you the lovely you viewer you yes
I'm talking about you it's time for user
feedback I said not you just okay uh we
asked everybody to use the hashtag TD
paint to talk about what paintings
they'd walk around in guys came up some
really good answers some really
beautiful paintings um that you'll all
have to look up I don't know if producer
Logan has images of these uh bring me
Frank wrote bring me inside the
paintings of sci-fi master painter Frank
Frazetta um frazetta oculus and V vibe I

ear at the end of the toe Baron go van
Gogh that's a good one too soon too soon
too soon uh hey soos wrote in and said
I'd love to navigate Las Meninas by

baroque VR I think that would be super
cool and then we got a couple emails
Chris wrote and said hey gang her owner
miss Bosh would make for excellent VR
would like to explore the hay wain or
the Garden of Earthly Delights probably
not with a smell equipped VRI that
though Chris and then Greg wrote in and
said hello my wife Renee wants to be in
the painting by georges seurat un
dommage up read I can't read this this
is too much French I don't know it um
media ile de la grande shot in english
it's a sunday afternoon on the island of
la grande jatte she wants to see all the
dots up close I see I like that that's
emotional i think i would like to go
into the huh coos I painting under the
wave off kanagawa it might be cool to
really go under the wave thanks for the
great show I that painting just right
off top of my head I can see it in my
mind why didn't you say yesterday that
you wanted to go into that painting you
just said that was from Disney I see
because you put me on the spot like
again we never I don't know why I don't
think about these things because we do
the show notes like hours before we film
the show and I just never think about it
until the second of and I was just with
van Gogh it's like very kind of artistic
and whimsical but yeah if I can change
my answer I would say the prologue in
the promise but a Robert T McCall did
anybody say their own painting no nobody
wrote their own painting our very last
email came from pin our good friend pin
oh god here we go buckle up no it's a
short email he says I'd like to use a VR
headset to walk through Salvador Dali's
the persistence of memory so with a
melting clocks yeah to watch the clock
smell and the scene comes apart as it
transitions to the disintegration of the
persistence of memory all with richard
strauss's also sprach zarathustra as the
soundtrack so he even has a soundtrack

variance I want like I'm being very
specific this is what I need that's
