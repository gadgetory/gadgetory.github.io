talking single serve coffee specifically
the eye coffee opus Brewer from
Remington this is a $140 follow-up to
the eye coffee steamed brew drip coffee
maker that Remington put out last year
that coffee maker claimed to use steam
to make a less bitter pot of coffee this
coffee maker makes similar claims it
says it makes less bitter single serve
coffee and it does that using spin brew
technology now what that means is that
the needle that pierces the lid of your
k-cup it's actually going to spin around
and spray water in all directions
agitate the grounds and it claims that
that makes a less bitter cup of coffee
now another of eye coffees claims is
that it'll work with any single serving
K style cups okay cups or the knockoff
off-brand cups that's a distinct
difference from Keurig 2.0 vers which
uses scanner to only brew approved K
Cups still there are plenty of single
serve coffee makers out there that will
brew both K Cups and store brand stuff
so that's not a distinct advantage for
this machine in particular that puts the
onus on the performance on that claim of
less bitter coffee so let's take a look
at how it works using this coffee maker
is really simple you just plug it in hit
the power button and then you'll turn
this dial to select how much water you
want in your cup of coffee that's a
really nice feature dial is sort of the
right tool for the job on your selecting
water amount however the dial wasn't
accurate it gave us more water than we
dial so we'd have to adjust down and an
8 ounce cup we have to set it down
around six point five ounces you'll push
a button in the front of the machine to
open it up you'll pop your cup in put it
down and then you'll just tap a dial a
brew button to get the coffee maker
going the brew process will take less
than a minute depending on exactly how
much water you're using and once you're
done you've got your single serve cup of
coffee and a first sip it tastes a
little watery to me it tastes a little
underdeveloped we tested this out with a
refractometer very nice tool that helps
to see exactly what's going on in a cup
of coffee and it is indeed a little bit
on the weak side even for a single serve
coffee which is gonna be weak to begin
with also it's not any less bitter than
other coffee makers that we like
including the editors choice winning
Bunn my cafe MCU so doesn't really
produce a cup of coffee that's better
than other brewers it's not a whole lot
worse it's right in the ballpark but
just not a distinctly better cup because
of that I think this is a tough crew to
recommend outright it's not the best in
this class it's not the worst either
though and the price one hundred and
forty dollars isn't terrible so
basically if you just need a simple
single serve brewer and you like the
look of this thing go ahead and get it a
hundred and forty is not terrible but
you can probably do better if you shop
around
I like the bun my cafe MCU along with
the cuisinart SS 700 those are both
classy machines that do a good job for
about the same price thanks for watching
be sure to check out the full review at
cnet.com along with the rest of my tech
reviews for CNET appliances I'm right
