three compact one of the best mini
phones around and Sony is keen to defend
that title with the launch of the z5
compact this is a phone that shares many
of the key specs of its flagship Zed 5
brother but squashes it into a much more
pocketable size with a four point six
inch display it remains the same size as
I said three compact before it and it
shares the same 720p resolution I find
it in extremely comfortable size and one
that's easy to type on and no trouble at
all to slip into a pocket
it really is worlds away from the
six-inch phablets around and I couldn't
be happier about that most smaller
versions are flagship phones come with
watered-down specs so that isn't the
case with the z5 compact this phone has
a meaty Qualcomm 810 processor as the
same one found inside the full-sized
flagship it's really powerful making
navigation Swift and gaming is easily
handled the camera has been upped to 23
megapixels and again it's the same one
you'll find on the premium z5 it's still
waterproof although sony no longer
recommends you take it swimming instead
it's designed to keep it safe and drinks
for spilled on it or from taking calls
in the rain that'll be something of the
bonus if like me you live in the
perpetually damp Britain if you want the
phone with a giant screen to show off
photos and for gaming this isn't bad
advice for you however if you're after
something that's got the performance or
the flagship but in a size that's a lot
more easy to hold
then this phone is definitely the one to
check out I'm Andrew Hoyle 50 net and
this is a Sony Xperia z5 compact</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
