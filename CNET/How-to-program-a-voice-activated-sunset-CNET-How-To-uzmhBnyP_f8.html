happens to me all the time and seemingly
on the nights when I need the rest the
most then I became seen that's resident
lightbulb guy and I started testing
smart lights out of my home and I
discovered that setting the lights to
gradually fade out as I was drifting off
will help ease me into a better night's
rest now there are plenty of smart
lights that you can schedule to fade out
at a specific time but most of us don't
go to bed at the same time every night
the better way is to program a simple
voice command that you can say while
crawling into bed to trigger that slow
fade here's how to do it first let's
make sure that you've got the right
gadgets for voice control
you're gonna need either an Alexa or a
Google assistant enabled device an
Amazon echo dot or Google home mini on
your nightstand should do the trick
you'll also need some help from the free
online automation service IFFT which
stands for if this then that if we give
our assistant the right command then the
lights should slowly fade out got it
good next up is the bulbs we're gonna
need one that has an IFFT channel that
lets us customize the duration of our
lighting changes really slow them down
for that that narrows our options down
quite a bit we're gonna go with the life
Xcel Edie now it's time to start
connecting everything on it to do that
we're gonna download the IFFT app to our
Android or iOS device and then create a
free account once you've done that go to
its list of supported services and
search for life expand for the voice
assistant that you'll be using activate
each channel using your respective login
info for each service and you'll be good
to go
all that's left now is to make the IFFT
applet that's going to make all of this
work to do so you're going to tap the
little plus icon in the if tap and then
follow the instructions to put the
pieces of your automation recipe into
place remember if you give a specific
voice command then we want the lights to
fade out so the voice command is the
first part you'll actually get some
extra customization options if you go
with Google but for our purposes let's
go with Alexa show you how it's done
we're gonna select say a specific phrase
is the trigger with Alexa that phrase
will come after the words Alexa trigger
so let's use the phrase asleep fade that
makes our full command Alexa
rigorously fade now for the lights let's
select the life exchange the important
thing here is that unlike a lot of other
lighting channels on if life exceed
duration for your lighting changes so
we're gonna set that to 45 minutes and
now when you say Alexa trigger asleep
fade she'll tell if to tell our light
bulb to fade out for 45 minutes and
that's it try it for yourself
and you'll be enjoying a smarter night's
sleep in no time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
