a first look at the HP officejet pro x
576 DW printer so the pro in the name is
a good tip that this printer is meant
for small businesses and home offices
looking for a workhorse printer it's
also 799 bucks but with plenty of extra
features you won't find with other
printer manufacturers it's really well
worth the cost for those that really
need a high output device it's the
top-of-the-line model in the x series of
office jet printers from HP it's a big
guy as you can see it measures 20.3
inches tall and 20 point 3 inches wide
but it's actually easy to pick up and
move around thanks to the small grooves
on the side here where your hands go and
the bulk of the size is because of the
two paper trays that feed media into the
printer there's one on the bottom that
can hold up to 500 sheets of paper and
there's another 50 sheet multi-purpose
tray on the side where you can put photo
paper or cardstock whatever you want and
finally there's another 50 sheet auto
document feeder on top that one's used
for putting stacks of documents to be
scanned hands-free so you don't have to
sit around and monitor the job so the
really innovative part of the X 576 DW
is found behind this panel here it gives
you a quick look at the duplexer and a
little bit of the new printhead the
printhead is part of the printer that
usually moves back and forth to place
ink on various parts of the paper but
this one by HP sits in one place and let
the paper do the work moving back and
forth across all the little ink nozzles
now the benefit of this new ink system
means big improvements in print quality
and especially speed HB brags that this
can print about 70 pages of text per
minute and while our test results don't
exactly fit that claim it certainly just
as fast as competing laser printers that
are known for their speed the X 576 DW
uses for different types of inks that
install behind this door on the front
there's one for cyan one for magenta
another for yellow and of course black
using HP zinc costs in their online
store we estimate that a page of black
texts costs about two and a half cents
while a page of color will set you back
three point two cents per page that's
about average compared to a laser but it
is a lot less than most inkjets you can
also save a little bit of
in the long term by investing in HP's
high capacity ink tanks up front so
there's a lot of options in high connect
this printer to your computer to you can
hook it up through a hard wired USB port
in the back here or you can connect it
to an Ethernet network for an array of
computers but the best way to do it is
definitely through the Wi-Fi network the
Wi-Fi server inside is going to sniff
out any open networks and of course
prompt you for your password before it
connects after that's done though you'll
be able to use all of HP's exclusive
cloud printing features when I say cloud
printing I mean that you can print from
this thing from a mobile phone from an
internet browser or a web-connected
device that can access email this 4.3
inch screen up top is also one of the
unique features and something we've
grown to love about HP there's an app
store built into the display that's
similar to a smartphone screen and it
lets you download various apps that make
it really easy to print out games for
kids sports scores the news of the day
etc you can also plug your own USB
storage Drive into this port here and
forego the computer entirely so you can
read even more details about this device
including speed test results and
comparison test products but that's
going to do it for me I'm Justin you you
just took a first look at the HP
Officejet Pro X 576 DW thanks for
watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
