Bridget Carey and this is your cnet
update seen it has learned that Twitter
is building its own music app Twitter
bought the music discovery service
called we are hunted and Twitter's using
that technology to build an app called
Twitter music it would suggest artists
and songs to listen to based on who you
follow on Twitter this means Twitter is
taking steps to become a media company
it's no secret that music artists are
popular on twitter but now Twitter wants
to be a home for discovering music and
if you remember Facebook's redesign now
has its own music news feed so they say
facebook wants to be like Twitter and
Twitter wants to be like facebook but
everyone wants to be more of a music
service like myspace well it's all
coming full circle so maybe that report
on samsung galaxy s4 having eye tracking
technology was not correct Bloomberg has
a report saying that the eye tracking
technology probably won't be in the s4
at launch but maybe it'll be in a
software update in the future but if
there's no eye tracking technology then
what else will Samsung show off to wow
us watch the phone unveiling live at
seen it on thursday at 4pm Pacific 7
p.m. eastern no matter what Samsung
shows off expect a flood of ads to
follow that's because a recent report
shows Samsung spends more than Apple in
marketing you've seen the memorable ads
about how the iphone is for uncool
parents but samsung also pores and money
to things like a random tap dancing
performance in Times Square all that
marketing muscle spells trouble for
brands like HTC it has a pretty good
phone with the HTC One but it's going to
need to do more to get noticed against
Samsung the HTC One was thought to
launch sometime next week but HTC says
it's facing shipment delays people might
not see this in stores until April maybe
it has something to do with the fact
that the super cool all aluminum body
takes more than three hours to put
together yeah each one the goo
now app may soon be coming to apple
devices a video about google now for iOS
was posted on youtube and was quickly
taken down but the folks I'd and gadget
were sly and reposted it Google now is a
feature of android 4.1 jelly bean it
taps into your calendar email news and
location and after learning about your
habits it'll send you notifications that
are relevant to your life like if
there's heavy traffic on the route you
take to work isn't it nice of Google to
offer this app to iPhone users you would
think Google would want to keep this
feature is something exclusive to
Android phones after all you don't see
Apple making c reacts for any other
phone nitro tech news update you can
find more details at cnet com / update
from our studios in New York I'm Bridget
