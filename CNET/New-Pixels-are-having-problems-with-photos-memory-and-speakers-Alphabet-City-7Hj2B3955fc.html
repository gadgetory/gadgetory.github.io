show that covers everything related to
alphabet Inc alphabet owns lots of
companies like verily jigsaw and Google
I'm your guide ayahs Akhtar and you are
the wonderful audience today we're
talking about Google's five billion
dollar problem
wham-o hitting a milestone your comments
and more but first the new pixels are
ticking people off let's go to pixel
part so the pixel three and Excel are
out right now they're built by Google
and they feature pure Android that
should be a dream come true right
yeah sorry no reports of problems with
the new pixels have been popping up
first up some pixel owners are saying
that the three and Excel sometimes
forget to save photos there's a reddit
thread as well as a post on Google's
pixel form about it the bug also affects
both versions of the pixel 2 as well
here's how the scenario plays out
according to the posts you take a
picture then you see it show up in the
preview icon if you switch to another
app the photo goes away if you go to the
camera the reddit poster says you can
watch the preview actually disappear in
front of your eyes and go back to the
previous picture that did save
apparently this was an issue on the
Nexus 5x as well other reports on Reddit
and Twitter say that the newest pixels
may have memory issues one tweet says
apps require frequent reloading there's
a video showing off how the pixel how to
reload apps and compared it to a 1 plus
6 phone which did not have that problem
another mentioned that you could kill a
spotify stream by taking a few pictures
with the camera app there are also
reports online complaining about the
speakers on the pixel 3xl 1 the
speaker's do not pump out audio at the
same volume level on the Google pixel
subreddit a user says that the top
speaker lacks highs and bottom is crazy
loud bass seemed about even with both
Google posted response in the thread set
hi all this is by design we specifically
designed speakers that allow for louder
sound 40 percent louder than last year
and better low-frequency response we use
new amplifier technology with advanced
speaker protection algorithms to push
these speakers harder and really get
every lab
better performance out of them over on
Twitter and reddit there are some
complaints that regardless of Google's
design there are still speaker issues
particularly something like a buzzing
sound one person on reddit said their
buzzy speaker problem randomly 100%
disappeared let's talk about top shot
it's Google's snazzy feature to make
sure you don't take a mistimed photo but
it turns out there might be a catch the
main picture is shot at twelve point two
megapixels but according to nine-to-five
Google the other pictures are taken at a
much lower three megapixels so you might
get a nice picture but it might be in a
lower resolution than you were expecting
one more pixel thing the two devices
were torn down by I fix it I fix it
found that the pixel three XL uses a
Samsung OLED display meanwhile the
regular three uses an OLED panel by LG
this is the opposite of last year's
models so far I haven't seen any reports
about screen issues about either pixel
three model if you've noticed anything
good bad or weird about your pixel three
screens let us know in the comments on
to up town updates so Google got a five
billion dollar fine by the European
Union July due to Android antitrust
practices google has decided to make
some changes it will offer several
licenses for phone and tablet makers in
Europe there will be a paid license for
those that want to include Google Play
Maps Gmail and YouTube another license
includes search and Chrome Google also
said that going forward Android partners
wishing to distribute google apps may
also build non-compatible
or Fort smartphones and tablets for the
European Economic Area the company added
Android will remain free and open-source
it's time to talk about way mo the
company's self-driving cars have crossed
their 10 millionth driverless mile on
public roads the company says it's been
learning a lot thanks to its early rider
program way mo is currently allowing
people to use their self-driving
vehicles for day-to-day tasks here's an
example when it comes to grocery stores
early ride is preferred if way mo cars
would pick up passengers at a shopping
cart return area instead of at the front
of the main entrance it's little details
like this that can make way more cars
more polite way most vehicles are
currently being tested in
twenty-five cities with San Francisco
likely to be next
the CEO of Wayne mo says that the
company knows it needs to solve for
inclement weather since those other
markets tend to have nice weather way mo
has spent time in Michigan and Tahoe to
try to learn more alphabets jigsaw
released a new product called outline
the company says it lets any
organization easily create and operate
their own VPN outline would allow a
company to make its own server
communications between devices on the
VPN would be encrypted making it
difficult for others to snoop on what
you're doing jigsaw was formerly known
as Google ideas but is now under the
alphabet banner on its company site
jigsaw says it's built to tackle some of
the toughest global security challenges
facing the world today time for comment
Cove this is the part of the show where
we shine a spotlight on the most amazing
audience in the world u io nu 92 says I
wish that the new palm was just its own
phone not having be paired to another
device and without an additional monthly
charge I want small phones to make a
comeback Natalie says kinda excited for
the foldable Samsung Samsung has the
best displays def care said curious if
you could use wine to run Windows apps
on the pixel slate that's a good
question
lifehacker has a post showing you how
you can run Windows app on Chromebooks
using crossover
greatness says wait hold up what's new
about the Google chromecast just the way
it's designed well let's check according
to that fantastic tech site cnet.com
here's what's different the finish is
matte a set of glossy with more rounded
edges Google says the hardware speed is
15 percent faster which can improve
smoothness on 1080p / 60 frames per
second video streaming otherwise it's
basically the same Thanks to everyone
