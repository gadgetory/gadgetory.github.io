market today cost over 500 bucks
the 499 dot neato bot vac d85 is a
pretty solid cost-effective option for
you if you've had the chance to look at
our previous review of nito's bought vac
85 that's nito's original bot fact line
this is kind of a lateral upgrade from
that model the original bought back
costs $4.99 this one costs $4.99 but
Neto says that this model boasts an
upgraded brush design and more powerful
suction unfortunately that wasn't the
case with this particular model and we
put it through its paces we tested it on
mid pile carpet low pile carpet and a
hardwood flooring surface using rice
sand and pet hair it did alright with
the rice test scoring at third place out
of the five models for comparison the
dat 5 actually did come in first place
with pet hair but the difference between
1st 2nd and 3rd place were pretty
negligible while none of the robot
vacuums tend to do particularly well
picking up sand this model did
especially poorly coming in last place
out of all of the models used for
comparison so when you consider that
this model was being compared to really
high performing models it actually held
up pretty well especially with the pet
hair test but I'm a little confused as
to why Mito introduced this model when
it's so similar to the Bott back
85 they are the same price at 499
dollars and this one actually performed
a little bit worse so if you're in the
market for a new robot vacuum and you
like neato I would still stick with the
original bought back 85 for more on the
bought back dat 5 a robot vacuum check
