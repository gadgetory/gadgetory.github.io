Stein and this is your in front of me is
the Acer c7
and at $1.99 this may be one of the
cheapest options you find at a store but
before Warren this is not any normal
laptop this is a Chromebook in case
you're not already familiar it's
Google's funny funky side experiment I
would call it in the realm of laptop
like devices that browse the web but do
it through a very focused channel it
really isn't a full-fledged device like
a laptop although it can do a lot of
things that it can like email web
documents even offline document editing
built into a device that again looks a
lot like a netbook that's because it
pretty much is except with a different
operating system inside now what you get
here is a 320 gigabyte hard drive which
is a lot higher than what you'd find on
typical Chromebooks Samsung Chromebooks
that were released earlier this year
used SSD up to 16 gigabytes so 320 is a
lot more storage space but you can't
dive into it the way that you can with a
normal laptop what are you really
storing on it well it'll be more like
downloaded movies side loaded movies
videos pictures that type of stuff music
files and accessing them you can
definitely play them and you can play
them when it's offline but it's going to
feel a little more like a very simple
directory of files than anything that
feels like a normal windows-based
operating system now there are downsides
to this device number one the battery
life which is maybe as low as two and a
half hours and maybe upwards of three
depending on how you tweak your settings
that's really a lot lower than any
tablet that's out there stay tuned for
the full battery test that we do at CNET
but that's that's a downside that's a
big downside especially if you're flying
in a plane and you want to be able to
use this thing when you're traveling on
the other hand having a little thing
like this that you can just web browser
on and Chrome OS is very good at web
browsing and doing anything that you
would normally do inside a browser in
terms of flash based stuff or any sort
of you know detailed online work well
that's all doable here and the trackpad
works well enough the keyboard works
well enough it's not really anything
shocking or surprising there's an Intel
Celeron processor
here two gigs of RAM but again that's
relative because the operating system is
tuned to me much faster responding and
quicker startup than your average laptop
and you do have a Ethernet ports here
you've got HDMI you've got USB that full
component no Bluetooth but you do have
Wi-Fi obviously for getting online and
you're getting off lines a little bit of
a tricky affair you can do offline
Google Doc editing and you can use
certain apps offline but the Chrome Web
Store which runs its apps are really web
based apps that don't run exactly the
way you'd expect in my experience
compared to something you'd find on iOS
or Android all told you're kind of
getting what you pay for here is a $1.99
device that could be great in a home
that just wants to surf the web and
doesn't like the idea of a tablet but
don't expect anything like a
bargain-basement laptop here this is a
very different beast with a battery life
that bears noting I'm Scott Stein and
that's a look at the Acer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
