Esqueda and you're talking at some of
the biggest stories across movies TV and
games and telling you whether buy or
sell your fan investments let's kick
things off this week with movies
specifically the spawn reboot and the
fact that it has a big fat juicy news
star spawn creator todd mcfarlane
revealed none other than oscar-winning
actor Jamie Foxx would be playing the
marine turned demonic creature in an
upcoming reboot of the franchise that is
super exciting news but there are three
things this movie won't be number one it
will not be an origin story number two
it will not be a big-budget tentpole
Blum House Pictures is financing and
that's an indie studio and number three
you may not even see Jamie Foxx in his
full spawn regalia as MacFarlane told
sci-fi wire and kind of think of it as
more of a horror movie and you probably
won't even get a full hero shot just
pretty interesting and honestly really
ballsy so I'm gonna say Todd McFarlane
I'm into it and I have some casting
ideas for you now we have to talk about
clown obviously you couldn't bring back
John Leguizamo and nobody would fight
you but my dream casting for clown none
other than Patton Oswalt that's right I
just blew your mind I do
come on Patton just do it as for Sam and
twitch MacFarlane says Sam actually will
not be in this spawn reboot he might be
in future installments but for twitch i
think Leonardo Nam who plays Felix on
Westworld is a choice pic and I just
have a really good feeling about it so
that's that's the spawn movie guys I'm
really jacked I think he can do it and
as for whether you buy or sell I think
you obviously have to buy into spawn you
got to watch the movie from the 90s you
got to read some comics and then watch a
fan film called spawn the recall which
is really really good it's on YouTube
it's free so ok from moving
announcements to game announcements
there's a new Fallout and more poke the
bug coming ups so excited Bethesda made
fallout fans everywhere wait about
Dejan their twitch livestream before
dropping the trailer for fallout 76 now
there weren't a lot of details in this
trailer just got people really hype but
there could be some clues john denver's
country road take me home played during
the trailer suggesting perhaps a West
Virginia locale for the game and on top
of that enhance computer 27th of October
that means the game could drop on 27 OCT
2013 for the lunch but nobody really
knows what type of game it's going to be
there are rumors that say they could
move from a single-player RPG to
something more like an online or
multiplayer format and we're only gonna
find out the answers at Bethesda's
official III event which happens in less
than two weeks so let's go from the post
apocalyptic wasteland
to the fancy happy world of Pokemon
Nintendo has officially announced let's
go Pikachu and let's go Eevee they'll
hit the switch on November 16th and both
games will have co-op drop in
multiplayer and take us all back to the
original 151 Pokemon that started it all
on top of those two games Nintendo also
announced Pokemon Quest which is a free
switch game that's available right now
and says there will be a full core
Pokemon game coming in late 2019 so
honestly if you want to be the very best
there's a lot of pokey goodness
happening this week congratulations
Pokemon fans now whether or not you
should buy or sell your investments in
either of these titles honestly I don't
really know I don't have enough
information but Pokemon Quest is free so
I say check that out if you don't know
if you're a Pokemon fan yet and there
are a million ways to play and fall out
so if you're interested in that go do
those things alright moving from games
to TV alright the Rick tater ship guys
Andrew Lincoln's leaving The Walking
Dead
well maybe Collider reported the one and
only Andrew Lincoln who plays Rick
Grimes will be exiting the walking dead
by the end of next season Lincoln is
reportedly only signed on for six
episodes in season nine whether he's
going to meet a grisly end at the
of a zombie get shot by a member of the
group or walk away and live a quiet life
with Michonne I don't know who can say
what I can say is AMC has got to be
desperate to keep Norman Reedus on board
and they are because they're supposedly
offering him a lucrative 20 million
dollars to stay on board so Norman if
you're listening I get it dude
20 million dollars is a ton of money you
can buy a lot of cigarettes with that
and motorcycles but at the end of the
day you know this but maybe the fans
don't the ratings for your show aren't
that good so the season finale rating
for season 5 was when the show peaked at
fifteen point seven eight million
viewers now season eight only seven
point nine two and compared to last
season that's a thirty seven percent
drop so you know what I'm gonna say I'm
sorry
fight me Walking Dead fans this is a
cell you got to just get out of Walking
Dead just run away as far as you can
this show is a shuffling bloated shadow
of what it used to me and if AMC was
smart they would just take it out back
and put it out of its misery just look
at the flowers Walking Dead just look at
the flowers guys The Walking Dead is a
thing that makes me very angry and you
know who else is angry mark Cheryl's but
he's mad about Star Wars take a look
it's alright you know it's not bad it's
no gather you vocalize it let me get
started for this stuff the last Jedi
see if you don't like last year though
that's not like Star Wars it's not at
York Star Wars you know what nah it's
the best one see I said that I see that
definitely the best Star Wars movie you
want all that all crap you want all that
all stupid stuff what it saw like or
Star Wars it's all Star Wars at all
college doesn't all that and it's
awesome this note you can use one that's
not nostalgia but in your vein you don't
want anything good so awesome movie
pretty good souls a movie but it all
feels like an old Star Wars movie and
you're like oh keep it up oh my Venus
thousand fools get Normie
I don't think that crap it's not where
we bet this is cancer keep filming
streets occur area that means please
leave it
can't handle I just traveled along and
the guy was Hansel but he was just in a
handsaw impersonation and then Lando
came and if this is londo's great but
iceland O'Shea the Game of Thrones woman
she was an old serious rubbish no one
good one was with the house because he's
good nothing there was a really rubbish
scene at Michael's a lot of his sins and
fight sores are rubbish movie and fight
all the Star Wars movies that I knew
I've been rubbish except the last Jedi
little last year days the one have
become Caesar's rubbish I'm all laughing
embarking on slime my other top say done
well that doesn't make any sense the
last day those good saw a shape and the
story that set that's that finished
elfin
there's always money in the banana stand
you guys that's why we came to the
blends II Blues voter event here in
Burbank California to ask potential
voters about the issues are you going to
be voting for Lindsay blues this
November absolutely I feel that Lindsay
is such a strong female candidates who
deserves our votes so you're with her I
am with her we've heard some rumors that
the blue family had laundered money
through a banana stand they owned a
Newport Beach does that concern you as a
potential voter well there's always
money in the banana stand so they might
as well take advantage of that Lindsay's
daughter maybe he worked as a studio
executive right here in Hollywood before
she was 18 do you think that means
Lindsay booth supports child labor
Lindsay has a daughter there's been a
little confusion about Buster Bluth her
brother losing his hand to a Lucille
some people argue that is fake news and
that it was a false flag and that is a
conspiracy what do you think the facts
are that is not fake news I witnessed it
live firsthand do you saw it yes I am
well aware that I had that a sealed bit
his hand right off and they had to
replace it with a freak mechanic Adam
and he now he's a monster now he's a
complete monster ruining the city but we
can spin it around what can we do let's
go a little deeper into Lindsay's
personal life and talk about her husband
who is a never-nude now that might be a
recipe for international blackmail do
you have any concerns about that as a
Lindsay Bluth voter no I just think it
brings more diversity to the family and
it's probably it's a good look actually
politically but not physically no
definitely about the rest of the Bluth
family they're very colorful characters
Lucille has gone on record saying some
highly inflammatory things some people
have called racist problematic for sure
problematic for sure Jo Bluth is a
me-too movement waiting to happen
mo most definitely definitely that and
also George senior has been accused of
light treason oh I believe it's going to
go a little bit beyond like treason
at the end of the day where the cards
will fall where they may but we only
have the we can only vote on the
information that we have now if Buster
ever ran for office not at the beginning
of that alone is a date just a dangerous
statement you say what platform would he
run on I see Buster is kind of like
starting like a hug campaign for people
with anxiety I feel like we need that
right now we do need that we do need
that he'd just go around and hug people
but him with a hook I mean that could be
kind of you just like it's all dicey
literally yeah oh no no he'd be a
masseuse cuz he likes to massage that
would be his platform with a hook
it looks like there is a lot of support
for Lindsay Bluth here at this event if
you are an undecided voter I highly
recommend that you watch the fifth
season of Arrested Development it's
available on Netflix right now
a massive thank you to Netflix and all
of the fans of Arrested Development that
we talked to at the event you guys made
it so much fun thank you so much that is
it for us this week next week we're
going to take a moment to honor all of
the shows that we lost during last
television season but until that end
youtubers like comment subscribe
ring the bell because it validates me as
a human being and I love you so much if
you do it hit me up on Twitter I met
Ashley asked Emma use the hashtag dream
economy coming yell at me about the
walking dead it's a cell guys it's a
frickin cell but until next time be good
never nudes
