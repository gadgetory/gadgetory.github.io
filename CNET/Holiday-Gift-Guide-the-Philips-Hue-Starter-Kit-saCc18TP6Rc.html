topic for a holiday gift guide for the
appliances category and for this
category we've chosen the Philips hue
connected bulbs starting pack this is a
set of three led lightbulbs and they
come with a controller that you connect
to your home wireless network so once
it's all set up you can use your smart
phone or connect a mobile device to
control these lights and all kinds of
interesting and fun ways so behind me
you'll see these four lights each of
them has a hue bulb in it and they light
up pretty much like you'd expect from a
traditional light bulb it looks great
there's a whole range of color
temperatures you can set if you wanted
to go from a warmer light to a bluer
light it all looks pretty comfortable
and familiar but dig into the app and
you'll see you can make the lights be a
little more festive now we got colors
you can set a whole different range of
programming options for these lights you
can set individual bulbs or groups of
bulbs to go off on either a timer with
an alarm or the geolocation feature that
ties into your smartphone's gps and it
will tell the lights to shut off if you
leave the house or turn on when you come
back home for more advanced users hue
ties into the IFFT standard which is
IFTTT or if this then that which is a
service that ties into all kinds of
different online services like Facebook
and Twitter and through IFFT you can
tell your lights to blink every time
you're tagged in a Facebook post or
maybe turn green when your particular
stock is up all kinds of different
options are available through IFFT and
it's really fun to play with if you have
the time so the reason the hue bulbs are
our top pick for this category is
because even though there are about a
year old there's still one of the most
fun smart home devices that we've seen
it's easy to install easy to set up and
everyone pretty much gets it whether you
want to use the hue as a standard light
bulb or maybe a more fun sort of party
novelty there's a whole lot of appeal
here and the price at 199 isn't really
that bad it's something we'd all like to
receive as a gift and for that reason
it's our top pick for this category so
I'm rich brown this is the philips hue
connected bulbs starting pack</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
