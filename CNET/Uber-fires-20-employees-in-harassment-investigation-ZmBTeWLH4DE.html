taking harassment seriously over 50 over
staffers were penalized amid an
investigation into the company's
corporate culture 20 employees were
fired an additional 31 were put into
counseling or training and another 7
were issued written warnings over 12,000
people work for the ride-hailing company
and these firings follow multiple
reports of different types of harassment
this past February one former engineer
wrote a blog stating she was sexually
harassed during her time at uber and
that HR did nothing when she reported
the unwanted behavior after that post
went viral multiple stories began
popping up on the internet about toxic
workplace culture at uber prompting the
company to start an internal
investigation into the claims uber hired
law firm Perkins koey to consult on its
own investigation and these firings are
the result of those recommendations
uber has also hired former US Attorney
General Eric Holder and his law firm to
conduct an independent investigation
into the claims and the company's work
culture but those findings have not yet
been made public
Uber's PR team tweeted about its actions
offering some insight into the claims
and a spokesperson for Perkins Co he
said it quote never comments on ongoing
client matters unquote of the claims
investigated this time around 57 are
still under investigation
so it's possible we'll see even more
employees dismissed in the future for
