SLR it's really tempting to pull it
straight out of the box and start
shooting but before you do here are a
couple of tips on how to best set up
your SLR for beginning users I'm Lexie
severe DS for seen it
first up attach a camera strap it sounds
really boring and really simple but a
lot of people don't actually know how to
do it here's how
make sure your strap is flat like this
then thread the end through the camera
loop from underneath pull the end
through the sleeve and thread it through
the buckle make sure everything is
pulled tight and then repeat on the
other side once you have your strap on
you're going to want to fully charge
your battery and insert it into your SLR
next it's time to turn things on and
start adjusting all the settings you'll
definitely want to set up your time and
date zone correctly because when you
start to import your images and catalog
them it's gonna be a lot easier to
organize them by date once you have this
set correctly in the camera next up you
need to make sure that all your shooting
settings are exactly the way you like
them I like to make sure that the image
quality setting that I'm shooting on is
either raw and JPEG or just a high
quality JPEGs or the raw file itself to
find this option you'll need to go into
your camera menus and search until you
find an image quality setting finally
it's a really good habit to get into to
start using your LCD screen to your
advantage for example when you're in
playback mode use the magnifying glass
button on the back of your SLR zoom into
your image this is where you can check
finer aspects like your detail and your
focus of images plus there is a really
useful button on the back of your camera
it's usually labeled as info or display
by pressing this when you're in playback
mode you can get access to a whole bunch
of useful information like your
histogram your metering modes and
checking your exposure as well so these
have been a couple of quick simple tips
on how to set up your SLR for beginners
