buzz report let's get right to the
gadget of the week the gadget of the
week is the new Dell XPS M 2010 it's
sort of a hybrid laptop kind of thing
it's really a multimedia monster you can
see this nice big 20 inch screen here
it's got multimedia controls along here
the keyboard comes off this is bluetooth
now it is pretty big weighs about 20
pounds cost about $3500 but I think this
is gonna go nicely with my desktop
computer
it's a UNIVAC and now for the news and
that thing is heavy
anyway Swedish police have raided 10
locations around Sweden and shut down a
music trading website that is suspected
of violating copyright of course no
one's actually been charged with
copyright violation which in Sweden is
only punishable by a small fine hey so
as long as you guys are just raiding
places could you hit the IKEA Factory
they never give me enough behind Allah
for my new Marar there are rumors this
week that Microsoft might be looking
into buying a Bay Microsoft buying eBay
that makes about as much sense as eBay
buying like Skype oh right yeah that's
totally gonna happen
frustrated Silicon Valley geeks are
starting up real life fight clubs where
they beat each other senseless with
sticks fists frying pans and tennis
rackets it's real in fact I totally went
to one of those one time this one guy
completely recompiled this guy's kernel
I mean he turned his face into a web to
mash up and afterwards the guy was
totally dropping packets it was bad man
like fatal exception bad and speaking of
bad several customers were briefly
trapped inside a glass elevator at the
top of the glass cube that sits on top
of Apple's new store in New York City
later Steve Jobs came and air dropped
jeans and black turtlenecks inside to
keep them warm British and American
researchers have unveiled their plans to
build a real-live cloaking device they
say it could be available very soon in
fact we've got a pre-release beta here
at CNET right now
