might clean up half the plastic in the
ocean in the next 10 years robots that
can adjust after they get injured and
keep on walking and Disney may have made
one of the coolest toys ever tmrw daily
greetings citizens in the internet
welcome to tomorrow daily the best geek
talk show in the known universe I'm
Ashley scavenge enemies always knock her
super walkin kill anonymous hello Ashley
that was I I can only do I know I felt
like that was a little bit of a little
bit of walk in there I before we get
started obviously a big important thing
to us is that fallout 4 has been
announced no release date there's
trailer out there it's about two and a
half minutes amazing a time taking place
in boston as revealed through the
trailer but not spoken out loud we
didn't make a story because I mean it's
just the trail amazingly excited but we
don't have that much it for me we have a
little bit of it in the break video when
we go to break we'll show a little oh
yeah so if you don't want to go away I
want some Salem witches can I because if
it's in Massachusetts I want some like
post-apocalyptic witches in it nothing's
off limits nothing's off the table their
spaceships and stuff in space weapons
nothing's off limits but I'll tell you
what is on limits our headlines
I really I really like where I like
you're really crushing it lately I'm
like crushing it all right tell me about
this the best way ever things because I
feel like I know about it the more I
read about this the more I got excited
I'd like to introduce you plain nation
this is was revealed by Disney what's
super cool about this is it's amping up
play time when you pretend when your
kids pretend they're like oh I'm iron
man or oh I'm I'm a Jedi now this
accentuates that so not only do they
they don't have to pretend that much
basically what what it is is it is there
like attachments and toys and such okay
for the Iron Man 1 which I read an
article about and it tracks your child's
movements oh they're little their hand
movements their fingers their thumb and
it has this little I our base and they
run around the room and its senses where
they are what movements they're making
on their hands this is amazing it's
incredible technology for playtime
there's uh they that they've released a
few statues they have iron man they're
also promising they'll be a Jedi one I
just want a villain pop off of truck
yeah pulling him off there's a there's a
Marvel Avengers system includes a
repulsor from Iron Man you strap on
Jarvis there's Jarvis oh who helps you
out with your instructions this all
seems really really cool like a really
fantastic I don't Muslim this if I was a
kid the I read an article and the guy
that was using it said that he kept
freaking out the more that he kind of
experienced moving it okay it looked
like I'm a box like 22 toy based but the
more he move and I differently got into
it more different features yeah so the
starter pack comes with repulsor to
power activators which you saw hello man
too smart figures captain america and
the iron skull oh we get a villain to
okay cool yeah so basically you go on
these missions there's 25 missions right
outside of the box it works with your
room and and you guess you can like hide
behind a bet like there was a kid that
was all because it can sense where you
are yeah um okay so yeah and also
there's two player multiplayer at lunch
I mean all I'm saying is as far as a toy
is concerned this event
impressive considering that kids want to
be their favorite character they don't
want to just necessarily have an action
figure and at least it's getting them up
and moving around or to working with a
our technologies well there are
technologies yeah so there you go
they're also working on a play mation
set for frozen I'll Star Wars lady for
the babies and boys who love frozen yeah
little girls and boys Allah frozen oh
they just said the lady boys ladies and
boys yeah ladies and boys let it go all
right ok so the Marvel set comes out in
October mom yeah I'd love to get my
hands on this just because I want to
like try it out yeah I totally wanted
it's very very cool but unfortunately
that brings us or hashtag of the day oh
that's so important sorry um it is TDP
later she played time and and our
question is what kind of juice box are
you gonna have before playtime yeah no
that's not our question our question is
what game would you want what what game
would you want translated into toys like
this so simulated playtime accentuated
by a toy what game would you want metal
gear solid because because then you can
have like Ocelot talking to you instead
of Jarvis and then you do missions where
you have to like hide from your parents
and stuff and then if they see you as I
would like cuz it can see where you are
from your pagan hide around the house
and stuff like and then you like joke
out your parents and take them down no I
said I'm just kidding no you don't do
them but I think that would be really
fun like if you have sort of this
mission that sort of like scans your
room and it's like okay like now you
gotta sneak through the house feel like
a couple of sensors around your house
and go to like sneak around and stuff
make sure that nobody sees you I guards
don't see you and then like you make it
through your house that being seen yeah
seems like I god like that's your globe
for a little bit okay cool cool stealth
I'll go I'll go horror but I think I do
like you know the shining or something
like something real crazy stuff of
nightmares shining or maybe that that PT
game where's family project yells at you
through the Hat through the wrist set to
do it take over know what is 126 times
yeah yeah wasn't showing long so there
you go yeah TD playtime playtime what
would you like to see this game tackle
yeah that's all
that sounds really what incredible
technology to out of the kid like
where's the stuff when I was a kid we
have like the duck hunt gun which was
very cool by the light gun was alright
and we had the burger time we had our OB
we had the robot Oh what we had those
are things we haven't wasn't cool I
wasn't as good as this yeah plus a lot
like and you just put it to the screen I
know you just follow that I was
terrified so shooters all right I got to
tell you about these robots that can fix
themselves because really this seems
like an awful idea to teach a robot like
I'm not super thrilled about this but a
team of robotics researchers released
this really interesting publication in
nature about robots and teaching them to
adapt if they become wounded or injured
now here's how they do it and this is
going to creep you out just this phrase
alone they give the robot a childhood
okay so they and by that we mean that so
when you're a baby you learn how your
body works right so like you get on your
tiptoes you're on your heels you learn
how your feet works you learn how you
walk you learn how to adjust your walk
if something's wrong with your foot like
all that stuff okay okay so what they do
is they do something similar they upload
a quote-unquote childhood to these
robots with a gamut of different gates
and and adjustments that can be made and
so um what it's it's like experienced in
walking in various kinds of ways okay
and then there's an algorithm that lets
the robot search through that database
when it recognizes hey like I'm not
walking the same way that I normally do
it can't tell which leg has been
disabled it can just tell hey I'm I'm
not walking the way that I am supposed
to be and then it can go through the
algorithm and through the process of
elimination figure out how to continue
to move with a modified gate that is
very similar to their original gate so
see that he's got a disabled leg there
in the middle on the right whoa and he's
walking pretty standard and so see he's
learning as he goes like these are
different gates that he can test and
they're saying that within seven to ten
tries it can get like the closest
approximation to like okay well through
the process of elimination I figured out
exactly like what the closest
getting closer right now what the
closest adjustment is to my original
gate like what's the what's the
adjustment I can make that will get me
walking very similar to early to what I
was doing before others how many times
seven to ten tries which is pretty
pretty great so it and the other crazy
thing about this is it there the the
team says it doesn't really matter what
kind of robot is using this algorithm
like it there's not a specific robot
that is required for the use of this
algorithm and they were saying that they
think that with some more testing it can
pretty much work on any robot as long as
it has sort of a an approximation of
experiences a childhood that's similar
to another robot so for example if you
have a six-legged robot 16 legged robot
and you upload the experience that
experience or that childhood to another
six like a robot that's different it
could probably figure out how to how to
continue and adjust after being injured
or disabled that's crazy this is a great
super super impressive that they tackled
this yeah yeah and and it's great
because the thing is is in a lot of
situations obviously you know you have a
robot out let's say in the field doing
something dangerous if its leg becomes
disabled you want it to be able to
continue doing its job and so that I
mean obviously is the point of this but
next they would like to try using this
algorithm on really complicated robots
and more complex robots like Boston
robotics Atlas robot which is that
terrifying it like human oh he's like
they're really kind of this a bipedal
robot it's gonna be at the DARPA
Robotics Challenge this weekend a lot of
the entrance are using Atlas as a base
model for their robots so they want to
try to use this algorithm on Atlas at
some point which to me just seems like
an awful idea because you're teaching a
robot how to once you've disabled it
when it's running after you it's it'll
be able to heal itself in there anytime
they had like a what t600 and terminator
whenever they knock off their legs and
it would still like just kept going
that's what ever it mines me up so we
got wrong away well if you're so
inclined you can check out their
publication it's in nature which is a
science vocation that was really really
impressive science though I'm gonna
childhood still
great turn yeah yes it's a giving a
robot of childhood freaks me out um so
now I have to tell you about this idea
that this 20-year old kid has he was
just a teenager not a year ago and might
change the world might change the world
in the way that we clean up our oceans
so there's a lot of plastic hanging
around in our ocean yeah and that's not
good that's bad and this guy's name is
Boyan slot and he is 20 years old and he
has an idea and he thinks the ocean
should be able to clean itself he has a
great idea for this he has this idea to
place these giant barriers in ocean like
current spots around the globe there are
these huge huge huge v-shaped looking
things that naturally capture objects
that are floating on the surface only on
the surface though so it's not like a
net because a net would be dangerous
because then animals and life marine
life could get stuck in it so what these
giant barriers do is they're these huge
v-shaped barriers that have these sort
of floating booms just slightly
underneath the service to kind of keep
it locked in place you can see that's
kind of how it would work this is
another sort of conceptual image of it
and that would be a platform like a
person could walk on and stuff and so
the great thing about this is there's
nothing underneath it so it the current
just moves freely underneath meaning all
kinds of marine life can just keep going
as they please and it's just skimming
the surface basically skimming the
surface and the plastic it's plastic it
floats right to the top the buoyancy of
the plastic would bring it to the top
and help collect these huge amounts
there are 60 excuse me there's 6500 feet
wide these barriers so they're huge
their gigantic you place them in the
ocean and then as the current goes
through just it's basically it's like a
skimmer just grabs plastic and then you
clean it up so really impressive and and
so garbage or naturally drifting to the
barriers collection becomes a lot easier
there to launch one of these things next
year between Japan and South Korea they
want to see what kind of a difference it
can make they want to launch more of
these all around the globe but they
think that it's possible that if
this idea works that we could decrease
the amount of plastics in the oceans by
half in 10 years which is a lot cool and
so right now they're actually this this
foundation that I think I want to say as
far as I was as like as I understand it
this 20-year old kid founded this
foundation is currently scanning put the
pacific ocean waters for plastics like
to see where and how much there is to be
collected so it's i mean this is like
really philanthropic impressive stuff
that this kids putting together and he's
20 he had a the video that we used is
from one of this sort of in unofficial
TED talk so it wasn't an officially
sanctioned TED talk but it was
considered a TED talk and he just went
up there and talked for like 15 minutes
about about his project in this
foundation and all this stuff so really
I mean crazy stuff but I mean listen
this that's what makes the world so
great there's people like that out there
just want to want to leave it a better
place than when they showed up which is
pretty cool that's that's great yeah I
didn't I mean he pretty much thought out
everything without messing around with
sea life the the platform that you saw
that look kind of like a manta ray he
was saying that would in theory be a
solar-powered and also good water
powered and then that way that you could
take them to different places on the on
the planet and you would just do your
collections and how you move to the next
pretty cool right on so keep up the good
work show thats it for our headlines we
are going to take a quick break we have
a very short clip from fault for from
the trailer today and we will be right
back with a mod squad that is very uh
snick snick the snick snick sick very
wolverine e very wolverine eat and then
we have user feedback and of course our
chromatography the day so you'll click
away it's tomorrow daily off all four
welcome back to the shell we returned
role fallout 4 again rolling it no I'm
just kidding um we are gonna check out
it's Wednesday which means it is we like
to check out things that people have
cobbled together on the internet and
this one's pretty cool so it's time four
Mod Squad so the cobbled visit to Kabul
things cover like MacGyver's cobbles
solutions okay all right all right uh so
this is from eyewear and it's a
Wolverine claw oh god wow oh god ionic
claw it's pretty awesome sure so Maya
where is a sensor that go can figure out
like it's aight oh my gosh is so cool so
you have these electrodes you set it all
up you get your my aware yeah that you
can literally it's 4-inch claws they
extend when you flex your muscle and
that's it and there's a lock to so you
can set a muscle lock that's like no I'd
like to leave them out at a certain time
even better this technology is fully
open source am eyewear has released all
of the step-by-step instructions for you
to help you build your own really cool
Wolverine glove so I expect all of you
dressing up is Wolverine at comic-con to
have these available and ready to go at
the show otherwise I'll be disappointed
in you that's really cool technology I
always find it weird however that
usually these creators have a really
good you know they've really good
technology and the first thing they do
is create some sort of a nerd stuff Iron
Man Thing or some sort of Wolverine
thing like no seriously good help people
out but check this out snick they're
gonna help people out though that's a
mate no no that you made a really good
point there and I all segue into this
it's actually on Kickstarter mmm oh so
you can buy like I think it's for 35
bucks you get am i aware you get the the
little sensor you get the electrode you
like six electrodes to build your own oh
wow that's fantastic yeah nice for every
five backers that back over the $25 mark
they give am eyewear sensor to limitless
solutions limitless solutions Lim
remember the Iron Man a prosthetic for
the little boy yeah it was awesome
that's them that's not
nonprofit so for every five people who
back over 25 bucks they're going to give
am eyewear sensor to limitless solutions
to help build and 3d print really cool
prosthetics that are low cost for kids
in need well that went crazy awesome
that went from really good at goes from
like and then I will another guy making
Wolverine claws now and then you're like
doing odd mr. that was you have good
technology but he's gonna help they're
doing great stuff so I really cool
usually I wouldn't pick like a bigger
company that is doing a Kickstarter and
step four Mod Squad is usually it's kind
of smaller kind of individual people
building stuff but I just thought this
was really great and it's in there you
know limitless solutions is a nonprofit
that we've talked about the show with
Robert Downey jr. giving the Iron Man
glove to that kid or the prosthetic to
that kid he was so excited that's the
very same company so um so yeah if you
want to back this you would be helping a
very good cause and and I just thought
it was really awesome Plus also you know
will ring clothes that are muscle
activated still don't think people
should have all very nice I saw you're
probably I know that it shouldn't have
any superpowers at all at least are made
about and not made of adamantium they're
made of plastic yeah it's probably
probably for the best uh do you want to
talk about user feedback I'd over to
youtube oh god so no then well we have
to nah I'm just kidding some of you some
of you I'm just kidding are you guys are
really I ever usually the ones right
I've been there like pretty nice are you
sure look see I don't come I don't go
over there that often so I just get
really low saying that some of them are
like the best people in the world it's
true it's true okay so we asked you guys
use TD pothole tell us what what other
kinds of like services would you want to
use that type of technology for us the
pothole is tweeting to the local
government to get stuff fixed jam wrote
in and said I would make the line
between a bicycle track and a pathway
pressure-sensitive so you wouldn't run
into by cyclists that's fantastic that's
really smart I like that was basically I
love the idea of you know those when
you're driving to Vegas they have those
the road is like really like rigid its
textured off of the freeway so that way
if you sir
drifting off you get tired it like it
makes your car like make a loud
vibrating noise it's like we're and then
you're like oh gosh like I'm not on you
describe that really weird yeah but but
they're little they're little bumps on
the side so that if you it exists and
it's your car make a noise to wake you
up and falling asleep on the road or to
remind you that you are in fact driving
a very heavy vehicle a pin tweeted us
and said a YouTube for aggressive bad
driving sorted by license plate with
most number of videos so basically if
you're a bad driver it auto uploads
videos of you back Drive oh yeah it's
like your license plate number so that
people can look you up and how bad
you're a driver you are and then over on
youtube alexandra go alexander Blum's
wrote in and said they already have
talking trash cans in latvia so here's
the others the talking trash oh great so
I somebody already took my idea I feel
bad but I mean I'm glad that they exist
that's pretty cool that wasn't good
enough and I did it exists fair know
maybe I've got my finger out of my
garbage that's me garbage yeah trending
garbage aficionado that's me um and then
lawlzorz WTF great name by the way said
pretty sure those sensors are gonna get
stolen which I mean I could see where
that would be kind of tempting to see
these little disks that have the hashtag
on those be like kind of a fun keepsake
to take but I mean they are they all
have kind of locator stuff in them
because they have it on google map so
you can tell exactly where they are so i
think maybe stealing what would be not a
great idea yeah but you know it's just
there's a idiot son I think you're right
that you did a yes I'm sure somebody it
has either managed to or dried to steal
those sensors we all said somebody right
in from Panama City that I don't have
but he was saying that it does like
these things actually are working so you
see the saying yeah these things are
working and then the roads are actually
getting fixed so and then said greetings
from Panama City so hey ayee but yeah
that's our that's our user feedback for
today not a whole lot but quality over
quantity you guys I always say okay so
it's time do our very last piece to use
your feedback which is always our phone
tog refer of the day
George sent us an email and did not tell
us what phone he took this picture with
so we're gonna have to guess okay here's
the picture hi guys I mean in a SLR DSLR
hi guys i just want to share my photo
for photography took this photo on my
recent vacation in mexico grand velas
hotel puerto vallarta mexico i love your
show and the whole scene that team not a
day without checking the website look at
that nice picture I want to go to there
that doesn't even look real okay I'm
gonna assume that George is the richest
person in the world so I'm gonna say an
unreleased phone and that's why he can't
mention it oh ok I like it it's a super
hyper phone and iphone 10 and it comes
with a telephoto lens that you have to
screw on and it also has a lighting kit
that's built into it I like it also it
makes popcorn so yeah very cool phone
George yeah real wide your life is going
so great that you get to have a fancy
phone from the future you jerk uh yeah
that's that's an unbelievable that's a
great great picture I actually yeah what
do you think galaxy s6 or note 4 i'm
gonna guess one of those two maybe a
note for right on yeah note for it it's
gotta be it's got to be one of those top
ones these are the iphone mmm it could
be an iphone 6 plus okay um it looks
really good I but I I don't know I'm
yeah it's it's a tough one I don't know
could be an iphone 6 it's definitely a
flagship I mean obviously if it's not a
fighter a shot right but it looks really
good so I i would say i really do want
to say though cuz the color is so like
full and rich like i would like to say a
note first it i'd like to say a note or
maybe an LG LG g3 or four um yeah anyway
you're really getting into that I am I
just said George is rich and set up a
photography a photographer to take a
picture for him then they're get through
that picture way and then someone
painted it and then you throw that away
yeah I like all of that I think that's a
much more likely story thanks George
thank you John if you'd like to send us
your phone tog refer of the day I don't
usually say this part so I don't know
what to say next you can email us
tomorrow at cnet com you can also
send over story ideas you can send
recipes someone said they're going to
send me a tiramisu recipe recipe I don't
believe it for a second I won't believe
it until I bake it that's what I'm
telling you um and and of course you can
always find us on social media itunes
rate and review us subscribe you know
