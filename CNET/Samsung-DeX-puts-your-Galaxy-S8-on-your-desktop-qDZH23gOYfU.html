awesome Dex is hey Suzanne absolutely
let's do this
accessing Samsung Dex is super simple
it's literally plug-and-play well from
my busy work life more like plugging
work and check this out when Samsung Dex
launches I can use face recognition to
unlock my phone to get into my desktop
experience all I do here is click look
at my phone and I'm in he's got multiple
windows open side-by-side and all his
essential smartphone apps like messages
calendar and email we're also working
with Microsoft and other partners to
optimize many more apps for something
Dex John why don't we finish up that
presentation we were working on and show
everyone how simple yet powerful this
tool is you got it I'm just gonna pull
up the presentation here and let's at it
a couple slides so this this slide looks
a little busy so let's move some content
over to the other slide I can do that by
seamlessly selecting the content with my
mouse I can use a convenient keyboard
shortcut like control X to cut it go to
the other slide control V to paste it I
can also use a keyboard and mouse to
move it to the exact position that I
want on the slide that looks about good
I can also resize his image here so it
fits better on the slide let's say right
there looks good I can also use a full
external keyboard to edit the title and
now I can simply go ctrl s save the
presentation now that the presentation
is done let me send that back to you
Suzanne all I do is go to email go to
your message hit reply I'll navigate to
my files where my presentation is what's
really cool as you can see I can drag
the presentation and drop it into the
email message as
- man stand it off and we're done
we've also customized the interface to
run Android OS and a desktop experience
and because of Samsonov our defense
grade security solution that built
that's built right into the Galaxy S a
your sensitive data is protected when
you use something death</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
