and today we're taking a first look at
the meizu mx4 core if this phone looks
oddly familiar don't worry that's
because that's the point not only is the
meizu mx4 core identical to its
predecessor the meizu MX it could also
be a twin or certainly a close relative
of the iphone 3s this phone runs Android
for dough ice cream sandwich but you
probably wouldn't guess that at first
glance that's because the meizu uses its
own interface which is suspiciously
similar to iOS you get three
horizontally scrolling home screens
Apple like icons and no Android app tray
powered by a 1.4 gigahertz quad-core a 9
cpu the meizu mx4 core also has lots of
speed and power other nice features
include an 8 megapixel camera on back
with LED flash and 32 gigabytes of
on-board storage keep in mind though
that the unlocked GSM meizu mx4 core is
only officially sold in Hong Kong and
Mainland China if you travel to Asia
often and have the equivalent of 530
u.s. dollars on hand then this high-tech
android iphone clone could be yours on
front is a 4 inch screen that has the
same pixel count as the iPhones 3.5 inch
retina display but it lacks the same
pixel density above the screen is a VGA
front-facing camera and below is a
physical home button and too slick
capacitive buttons meizu calls them
light keys and the buttons really a
cluster of leds change configuration
depending on what's happening on the
screen for instance within applications
the left key becomes a triangle of three
dots essentially a back button the right
key is usually arranged in three dots in
a line indicating its menu function but
when you flip the mx4 core between
landscape and portrait modes the keys
smartly adjust their orientation the
keys also double as notification lights
the left side holds a thin volume rocker
while the Mazouz top edge has a power
key and headphone jack on the bottom is
the phones microUSB port
I'm Brian Bennett and this has been a
first look at the meizu mx4 core be sure
