what's coming out I'm really here
looking at this place I'll understand
better what I should invest in my home
automation system this is the coolest
thing I've seen at the show so far but
this is a different level we saw a lot
of smart robots
I'm really excited really interested in
seeing what's going on with the IOT that
virtual reality the augmented reality
this chair though is probably should
have led with that seeing all the cars
and seeing all the technology over there
I really appreciated it it's all that
stuff that I never even thought that
could be a possibility
this changes Oh silliest thing I thought
I think was a good connected babypoo
thing all the line for the registration
that's crazy
the VR back there there's something
naughty back there there's always
something wacky and weird here if I
could sum it up in one word it is Google
overwhelming innovation interesting
unexpected like if we my mind amazing
there's a CES but it's also Vegas you
know there's some crazy stuff that
happens in Vegas I just walked in and
the power went out and that was
first time I've ever seen something like
that happen here I was able to stay in
there for about 15 minutes and wander
around the dark halls take a few
pictures it was just surreal</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
