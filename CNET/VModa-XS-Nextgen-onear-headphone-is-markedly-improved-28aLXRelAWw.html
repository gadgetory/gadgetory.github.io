that's both comfortable to wear and
sounds quite good it comes in the black
you see here as well as a white model
and the face plates on the ear cups are
removable and can be customized hi I'm
David Carr Noi and v-moda has spent a
lot of time trying to perfect the
successor to his popular crossfade and
maytee headphone at first glance the two
models look a lot alike but there are a
few key differences for starters the XS
has a hinged headband that allows you to
fold it up like the company's larger
over the year M 100 thanks to the news
design these headphones fit into a
significantly smaller carrying case is
nicely designed it comes with a
carabiner so you can clip it on to your
backpack if you want the other big
change is to the headband itself it's
it's more closely against your head
particularly in the temple region most
on ear and over the era headphones have
a gap there but Vee Mota's co-founder
Val Colton has made it a mission and
perhaps even an obsession to close that
gap the end result is a more comfortable
headphone and one that v-moda thinks
will also appeal to women due to the
more form-fitting design well the XS may
look like a clone of the old ma T the
v-moda sound has evolved the excesses
sound is more neutral and natural and
takes the edge off harsh sounding
recordings at the same time resolution
of fine detail is still quite good in
short the XS maintains just enough of V
Mona's weightier bass sound signature to
keep the company's fans satisfied but
the XS will appeal to more audio files
than the older model it doesn't offer
quite the refinement of the more
expensive bear dynamic t51p but it's
still an excellent headphone that's
early built and well designed especially
for an on-ear model I'm David Carr noise
and that's the v-moda XS thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
