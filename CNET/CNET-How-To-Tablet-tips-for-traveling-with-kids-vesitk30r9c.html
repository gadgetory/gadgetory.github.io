with a kid or two can be especially
difficult by now we all know that
plugging kids into a tablet can buy you
some time
and some judgmental looks from strangers
but that tablet's no good if out of
power and short on content I'm Donna
Bell here are some of my best tips for
making the most out of a tablet while
traveling with kids first buy your kids
some headphones trust me you don't want
to be listening to Thomas the train for
hours at a time through iPad speakers
and neither does anyone around you small
kids will often find earbuds
uncomfortable so pick up some affordable
kid sized headphones for a grade school
age kid a closed back pair of Panasonic
are PHT x7s will keep sound from
bleeding out and they're comfortable to
wear for a long haul if two kids are
listening to the same iPad a five dollar
headphone splitter is pure gold if
you're worried that your kid is
listening at an unsafe volume use the
iPads parental restrictions to lock the
maximum volume to a level you're
comfortable with also realize that the
tablet is only good if the battery isn't
dead so bring your charger bring an in
car charger maybe even invest in a
portable charging pack and understand
how to conserve the power you have put
the tablet in airplane mode keep the
brightness down and know that games will
typically drain battery power two or
three times faster than listening to
music or watching video so avoid games
if you can especially graphically
intense games like driving games or
first-person shooters instead of games
video is your best friend but forget
about Netflix or any streaming video if
you're on the move it's too unreliable
and you're just asking for a meltdown
when the video doesn't load instead
download videos ahead of time it can get
expensive but there are ways to save
money for TV shows buying an entire
season will save you a few bucks over
buying shows individually even better
look for the option to download an SD
the standard def version can be
substantially cheaper and it's nearly
impossible to tell the difference on an
iPad also keep in mind that some kids
shows are short so a whole $15 season
can often take less time than one
five-dollar movie so to stretch your
dollar look for deals on kids movies you
can download multiple rentals in a
the last up to 30 days on the iPad but
once he started on watching one you have
only 24 hours to finish it in addition
to rentals it's worth paying full price
for a few tried-and-true gems that can
stand up to repeated viewings and
finally download some of this content to
your phone as well it never hurts to
have a back-up plan so there you go
that's my best advice for when you're
trying to prepare your tablet for a long
trip with a kid or two more tablet tips
