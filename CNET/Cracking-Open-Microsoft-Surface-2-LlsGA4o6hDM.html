look like its predecessor the surface RT
but it has a completely redesigned
interior and as I'll show you today it's
unfortunately a real pain to disassemble
and repair I'm bill Detweiler and this
is cracking open the surface to is ever
so slightly thinner and lighter than the
original surface RT but from the outside
you'd be hard-pressed to tell the
difference now that doesn't mean however
that they're identical far from it
the surface too has a new two position
kickstand a micro SD card slot it's been
moved down a little bit and the case
screws are no longer visible on the
outside now these subtle external
differences pale when compared to the
massive internal hardware and design
changes for starters the surface 2 now
has two microphones stereo speakers USB
3 port better cameras a new 1920 by 1080
screen and a faster 1.7 gigahertz Tegra
4 processor unfortunately when making
all these hardware upgrades Microsoft
also completely reworked the tablets
internal design and in doing so made the
surface too much more difficult to crack
open and repair than its predecessor
opening last year's surface RT began by
removing the tablets back cover not so
with the surface 2 like the Apple iPad
cracking open this tablet requires
heating the edges of the front panel to
loosen the adhesive underneath now at
the same time you'll need to gently pry
the panel loose with thin tools
unlike the iPad however some of the
surfaces internal components and
external trim pieces are made from
plastic which can warp if overheated
now once the front panel is finally
loose you can lift it up from the body
and lay it face down now you'll need to
detach the board that connects the panel
to the motherboard before you can
completely remove it with the front
panel removed we get our first look
inside the surface 2
at the completely new internal design
the internal hardware is mounted to the
surface twos buddy with the front panel
and display being a single removable
unit now the surface
Arty's hardware on the other hand was
actually mounted to the front panel and
display assembly which also served as
the tablets body to dissect the insides
of the new surface I first removed the
plastic bezel that runs along the outer
edge next to come out where the new
stereo speakers followed by the volume
button and the upgraded front and rear
facing cameras after detaching several
cables from the motherboard and removing
a series of screws
I can finally lift out the board
removing the motherboards metal shields
reveals the new Tegra 4 sock and most of
the tablets other chips now turning our
attention back to the surfaces body the
last component to come out is the power
connector and micro SD card reader
assembly as the battery is firmly glued
to the body I'm going to leave it in
place rather than risk damaging it
during removal likewise I'm going to
leave the vibration motor kickstand
hinges docking connector and the
clicking keyboard magnets alone they're
clearly visible without being removed
now it's been a frustrating process but
our teardown is finally complete the
surface 2 is definitely an improvement
over last year's model when it comes to
hardware specifications and performance
kudos to Microsoft for that but it has
also officially become the most
difficult to crack open tablet I've ever
worked on the front panel adhesive is
incredibly hard to work around there are
more than 60 screws inside the case of
all different sizes and most of the
motherboard connectors are extremely
fragile and easily broken now I can only
hope that Microsoft makes some major
design changes for next year's model now

nope I'm bill Detweiler thanks for
