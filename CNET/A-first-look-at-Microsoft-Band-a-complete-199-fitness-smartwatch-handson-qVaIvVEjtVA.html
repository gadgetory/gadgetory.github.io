band and smartwatch and has microsoft
just nailed it i'm scott stein and right
here on my hand is the Microsoft band
this thing came out of nowhere like a
bat in the night but here it is and it's
a hundred ninety nine dollars now what
does this do that other fitness bands do
when your Microsoft and fitness band
you're not necessarily going to go I got
to have that but damn it if this thing
didn't really cover all the bases this
has a heart rate monitor that tracks
your heart rate 24 hours a day it also
tracks your steps of course it has
built-in GPS so if you're a hardcore
runner you could use this without your
phone go for a run or a walk and it'll
track where you've been it has workouts
that you can download with partners like
gold's gym and men's fitness and you can
download them right to this it tells you
to do push-ups or to take a break and it
coaches you along the way it tracks
sleep but it also does it with your
heart rate so you get a deeper analysis
of what your resting heart rate is and
also maybe a little more on the quality
of sleep that you got oh did I mention
also the UV sensor no fitness band is a
UV sensor this will tell you how much
Sun you're getting and then you get into
the smart side of things this gets
notifications it gets mail phone calls
it gets Twitter Facebook weather stocks
it also connects with your calendar and
if your Microsoft user it also has a
built-in microphone so you could talk to
it to Cortana and use it to set
reminders and interact with it as an
extra little carrot on a stick so it's
got all that plus apparently a 48 hour
battery life stay tuned for seen at
testing five hours if you're going to be
using it on gps for running that is a
complete package you could use it as a
full SmartWatch you could use it as a
fitness band you could use it as a deep
workout band how well does this all work
while we're going to have to see and
microsoft claims a certain element of
machine learning so the stuff is stored
in the cloud and that they're going to
give you insights along the way to coach
you sort of like what jawbone does with
its job on up 24 which makes us love
that platform so much and they're
claiming to work with other partners to
integrate other services into it
is the perfect band well too soon to
tell but I don't think there's anything
on the market that's this ambitious and
199 dollars it's only fifty dollars more
than some of those fitness bands that
we've been seeing just in the past few
months that only have basic fitness
tracking capabilities and this works on
all three platforms to I'm Scott Stein
with the Microsoft band the most
ambitious Fitness band and smart device
on the market seems like it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
