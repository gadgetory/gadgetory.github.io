down and ins the iPod staging a comeback
that's all coming up in this edition of
apple core apple's latest iOS 12 point
two beta holds clues of what we can
expect in the next round of product
announcements twitter user at stratton
smith discovered the code in the latest
beta that mentions four versions of an
ipad now this is rumored to be that
long-awaited ipad mini sequel so why
four well it could refer to an LTE and
Wi-Fi version along with different
storage tiers there's also a rumor of a
new low-cost 10 inch iPad that one would
replace last year's nine point seven
inch iPad and if this is true it could
arrive in March or April if it's in line
with other years now it's definitely not
the first time we've seen these software
clues in some of its beta code and it
also aligns with what we heard from a
report from my smart price that mentions
seven new iPad models registered under
the Eurasian Economic Commission where
Apple has to register all its new
products before launch so what are we
expecting while rumors right now point
at cheaper components than last year's
pros which is to be expected because
these are really meant to be budget
iPads or budget for Apple with no face
ID so touch ID instead of face ID and
slower processors the code also
mentioned a new iPod touch as point out
here in MacRumors
so this would be a seventh generation
iPod Touch and the first time this
product has seen a refresh since 2015 no
details yet on what this new iPod touch
will look like but we'll keep you posted
we've talked a lot about Apple's new
video streaming service that's supposed
to hit very very soon but now it seems
like they may have another service in
the works according to our report in
Cheddar apple may also be developing a
subscription-based gaming service now
the report says they're still in early
talks and that it's not a done deal yet
so don't expect it anytime soon but this
would make sense considering Apple's
strategy in 2019 of beefing up its
service industry to counteract the
effect of those decreasing iPhone sales
which brings us to our next topic timko
could warn investors that this was not
gonna be a good quarter for iPhone sales
but we finally got official confirmation
this week when Apple announced its first
fiscal quarter earnings report
the main takeaway iPhone sales are down
by fifteen percent from last year and
overall revenue for the company is down
about four percent which doesn't seem
like a lot until you realize that four
percent still accounts for several
billion dollars so what went wrong
well according to Tim Cook there have
been several factors at play
obviously the slowing economy and the
trade war with China is one of them but
less subsidies with cellphone carriers
is another one and those 11 million
batteries they replaced in 2018
he even admitted that he was warned
about the effects of lowering the cost
of the battery replacements and sure
enough it allowed users to keep their
old phones longer and just not update to
the newest iPhones what's interesting is
that the rest of Apple's lineup is doing
really really well
revenue for Apple services rose by 19%
as Apple music reached 50 million paid
subscribers while their home and
accessories Mac and wearables also rose
by 33 and 9 percent respectively
even iPad sales were up this quarter
which goes to show you how important the
iPhone is to the company even these
successes were not enough to counteract
the iPhone effect on Apple which is why
the company is really looking to invest
in that service sector as we mentioned
before or find that novel feature that's
gonna make users excited about buying a
new pricey iPhone again you know what's
not gonna help apples FaceTime glitch
for a brief moment in time
FaceTime could be used to eavesdrop on
other people allowing the caller to hear
or see what the other person was up to
without having to accept the call the
flaw was apparently first discovered
over a week ago by a 14 year old in
Arizona while setting up a group
FaceTime call to play fortnight with his
friends the teen and his mom Michelle
Thompson were then able to recreate the
flaw as shown in their video they try
to warn Apple of the flaw with Twitter
and Facebook and emails but Apple didn't
get the memo and they never responded
because apparently they needed a
developer's account to report the bug in
the first place but in the meantime word
got out on social media and by Monday it
was viral and the damage had been done
Apple has since had to pull the group
FaceTime feature while it's working on
the patch the flaw in exchange for
finding the flaw the teens mom told
reporters he would like Apple to give
him a new MacBook iPhone 10 and a set of
ear pods and that the company should
reward that kind of discovery even when
it comes from someone other than a
developer alright it's time to hear from
you guys should a believe this kid what
he's asking for tweet me your thoughts
or answer on the comment section below
and come back next week for more apple
core and what i'm hoping will be better
