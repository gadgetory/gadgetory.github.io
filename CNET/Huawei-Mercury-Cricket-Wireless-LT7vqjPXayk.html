CNN and today I'm taking a first look at
the Huawei mercury this is a new phone
for cricket so I'm pretty much just
gonna give you some highlights of the
phone it does run Android 2.3
Gingerbread and that is with Huawei's
skin on top so there's some nice things
like this unlock screen there's a
certain styling down here at the bottom
and here for the quick access pull down
menu so again 4 inch screen on here 8
megapixel camera and there's a
front-facing camera as well so those are
some pretty good specs for this kind of
phone usually cricket phones aren't that
advanced and this one definitely is so I
personally think this is one of the best
phones on the market it boasts a very
very impressive battery life but
honestly my test so far I haven't found
it to be any better than any other
battery life there is 3G support on this
phone and so if you're in a strong
cricket Network area it will probably be
just fine although the speeds that I
experienced here in San Francisco which
is in crickets roaming Network were not
exceptionally fast they were fine though
as for the look and feel of the phone
itself originally it was the Huawei
honor and the review unit we got here
was white which looked a little bit
classy this is black shiny plastic very
good for picking up smudges very glossy
so it looks okay but it doesn't have the
premium look and feel however I do think
that this is one of the best phones that
you can possibly get for cricket it is
Android it does have those two cameras
and the back camera so far does seem
pretty advanced in my photo tests the
phone's going to cost you $180 after $50
mail-in rebate and if you can't get your
hands on a $20 instant online rebate so
this is the huawei Mercury for cricket
