announced an trucker it's not from Tesla
in fact you may not have ever even heard
of this company but they've been around
for almost 100 years
Cummins a company known more for its
diesel commercial truck engines and
light duty pickup trucks unveiled an
urban semi truck that's fully electric
it's called a os-- it weighs 18,000
pounds but it can carry around 44,000
pounds of payload it also uses a 140
kilowatt hour battery and only takes an
hour to charge at the right charging
stations that only comes out to about a
hundred miles of range though so for now
it's a local delivery solution
Cummins says it won't build the trucks
itself only that it plans to supply the
battery and driveline system to
manufacturers looking to add electric
commercial haulers to their fleets
production could begin as early as 2019
the announcement even beat Tesla to the
punch which also plans to make its own
electric semi unveiling sometime in
September but reports say Tesla's
competing truck has two to three times
the range of Cummins AOS the company
says it also plans to offer a hybrid
extended range model in the future that
uses a diesel engine like a generator
think the Chevy Volt but really really
big for more information on electric
