this is our dryer buying guide video so
this model is the Samsung DV 457 and
it's a smart dryer it's top of the line
that's got this 8 inch touch screen you
can control it from your smartphone its
grid aware so it can detect when the
best most energy-efficient times to run
are it's a very nice dryer but we'll
back up here I'll start at the beginning
if you're looking to buy a dryer you
might want something simple you might
want something fancy but either way
you're going to need to choose between
electric or gas gas dryers will cost you
about $100 more but they're also
typically a little cheaper to operate
over the long run now this depends on
the energy usage rates in your area if
gas is really expensive where you live
and you should probably stick with an
electric dryer but if your electric
bills are always giving you a headache
and you want to take a dent out of them
a gas dryer can be a very sound
investment now keep in mind that if you
want to get a gas dryer you're going to
need to have a dedicated gas line in
your laundry room and not all rooms will
have this if you don't you'll have to
have one professionally installed and
that can cost upwards of 500 or 600
dollars so you'll have to budget that if
if you're getting an electric dryer
you're going to need to be sure to have
a 240 volt electric outlet a 240 volt
outlet is not the standard socket you'll
see in your living room it's this big
bad boy here with a circular plug your
next consideration is going to want to
be the size of your dryers drum the
capacity how much can it hold now this
one here has about 7.3 cubic feet of
space in there and that is quite a bit
if you had a large family this would be
a great dryer for you but if it's just
you and a roommate or are you and a
partner you might not need this much
space so how do you know how much space
you need we'll figure out what your
washers capacity is a good rule of thumb
is that your dryers capacity should be
about twice as big as your washers
capacity maybe a little less so if your
washer has three cubic feet you might
want to aim for about 6 cubic feet maybe
5.5 would be fine now if you can hit
that perfect 1 to 2 ratio a full load
from your washer should come out nice
and dry after a full cycle in your dryer
keep in mind though if you're getting a
matching set of washer and dryer they go
together
then you don't really need to worry
about this once you lock down the basics
of your dryer purchase you'll want to
take a look at the features available
and the models that you like some
features that I like to look for include
motion sensors in the drum and these are
great for detecting how dry the clothes
are during the cycle and they can even
shut off the dryer automatically when
it's done that way you don't over dry
you don't waste energy you don't shrink
your clothes they're a really nice
feature you can also look for dryers
that have steam settings like this one
the steam settings can allow you to do
all sorts of new things with your dryer
you can clean throw pillows and curtains
and toys other things you couldn't
typically clean elsewhere and you can
use steam to get rid of wrinkles in your
clothing which is fantastic if you're
willing to pay top dollar you can get a
smart dryer like this one and get some
smart functionality built into your
machine like I said this one you can
control from your phone it's smart grid
aware it's got a lot of cool things that
other dryers just can't do however a lot
of money and you're going to want to
make sure that these features are
compatible for you in some areas smart
grid technology isn't available here in
Louisville we can't use that feature and
also with this dryer not all phones are
supported it supports iOS devices and
Samsung Galaxy devices but it doesn't
support other Android devices like the
nexus so if you had one of those you'd
be out in the cold and that's not what
you want after spending well over $1,000

your next dryer check out the rest of my
buying guide or take a look at our
reviews to figure out which models we
like the best for seeing that I'm right
