it's a great team effort even
choreographer could be able to visualize
the space they have to put the acrobatic
performance or even a costume designer
could see and be helped to create more
complex custom speaking about designers
you know sometimes there are different
places on the planet so I would like to
invite today
Michela please one of our show director
and Michelle is in Europe right now so
it's going to be wearing the new
Microsoft headset hi Michelle I'm
Michelle mojo - mom I am sorry guys I
couldn't be with you today but it's kind
of cool to be virtual I live in it so
Cal there's two references I'd like to
share with you today okay so the first
of all it's the hand I think I was wrong
with marbles - gold let's go with
something warmer like this wood finish
okay interesting yeah nice and you know
about the background the turbine
yesterday I was working in Paris and I
stopped by the train station like
Algenol and it is industrial like this
Wow okay oh my god guys we'll have to
continue that in Montreal next week
because now I have to go because c'est
la vie bye bye Michelle hey Michelle
that's awesome
there is nothing like to be together
around the concept to take concrete
decisions now let's imagine were more
advanced in our design and we are ready
at the end of it to present to the to
this the result to the team yes
load for stage
Wow Wow that's great it's beautiful
so up until now we have spoke to a lot
of absurd design but let's not forget
what drives us at seducer lay it's the
human performance so let's welcome the
artist champion add contortionist that
works very well
hmm add who see
so for us now to be able to see that so
early in the process is amazing and
totally new usually we have to wait
until we finalize our casting and
artists come to Montreal but now by
looking at it we could even make changes
of some performance or different cutting
hall
so as you can see with our lens this is
a tool which can make our work and save
time and money and definitely be a good
addition to our toolbox yes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
