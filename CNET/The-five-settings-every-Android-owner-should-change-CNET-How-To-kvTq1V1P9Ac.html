five settings you should consider
changing the first thing you need to do
is crank down the brightness it's simple
logic the brighter your screen the
faster it will consume your battery
that's why you should consider lowering
the brightness and I'm not talking about
a little bit here consider dropping it
to 50% or even less
you should also disable auto brightness
because it could raise the level higher
than you really need next up if you own
a Samsung phone or a nexus 6p like I do
you should be using a black or mostly
black wallpaper these phones have an
AMOLED display and without getting too
technical because the black pixels don't
need to be illuminated simply changing
the wallpaper to black can actually
improve battery life quite a bit now the
first thing you usually do when you buy
a new phone is to hit up the Google Play
Store and download all of your favorite
apps but before you do that I recommend
disabling new app shortcuts each time
you download app a shortcut will be
placed on your home screen and if you're
downloading a lot at one time you will
end up with a very cluttered screen to
disable the shortcuts open the Google
Play Store click on settings and uncheck
the box next to add icon to homescreen
next up don't forget to schedule do not
disturb mode this lets you set your
phone to automatically mute sounds
during a set time period for example
like when you're heading to bed each
night hit the Settings followed by
sounds and click on do not disturb tap
automatic rules followed by add rule
then give it a name and set the time and
days you want do not disturb mode to
begin and end you can also customize the
feature to allow certain calls and text
to always ring even if the features
enable and lastly make sure to enable
find my phone this will help you locate
your phone in the event its lost or
stolen you can even remotely wipe it and
lock it head to Settings tap on Google
scroll down to security and make sure
the two settings under Android device
manager are turned on you can then check
the location of your phone and wipe it
or lock it by going to google.com slash
Android flash device manager for more
