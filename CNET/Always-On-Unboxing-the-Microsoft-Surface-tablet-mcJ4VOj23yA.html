new surface tablets and two different
types of keyboards because I want to try
out both options I'm only gonna unbox
one of the tablets because I'm sending
the other one off to Jeff cannot afford
torture okay let's start with the tablet
we have the windows RT model because the
surface tablets that run Windows 8 Pro
won't be available until January pretty
subtle pretty subtle packaging are
pretty slick modern packaging going on
here nice presentation nice matte black
power brick find it big and here's the
tablet itself now this tablet weighs a
pound and a half which is sort of
similar to the iPad but I got to say
when I had two of those plus the
keyboards in the bag it was heavy now I
feel like I kind of have to give
Microsoft a little bit of a throw them a
bone here because I've been complaining
a lot maybe you know about the Apple
lightning connector Microsoft is also
using a proprietary power cable here
mainly because microUSB is not powerful
enough to charge a full sized tablet so
I feel like I should point that out in
the interest of fairness let's get to
the actual tablet
it's rectangular but the corners are
very squared off unlike an iPad it feels
a lot lighter once you get it out of the
bag with the other tablet it's a little
like plasticy not gonna lie a plastic
you I think this might be power haha
well it's powering up let's do some
specs the surface tablet starts at $499
this model runs Windows RT more on that
in a minute the displays are somewhat
odd 10 point 6 inches it has a 1366 by
768 resolution screen with a 16 by 9 HD
display it's 9.3 millimeters thick and
it weighs about a pound and a half
roughly the same as an iPad it has a
nice metal kickstand built into the back
it's a pretty speedy tablet it has a
quad core NVIDIA Tegra 3 processor with
2 gigs of RAM there's a USB 2.0 slot HD
video out and a micro SD card slot for
expanding the memory it comes in 32 gigs
and 64 gigs there's a camera on the
front and a camera on the back but all
that Microsoft is apparently saying
about these cameras is that there's 720p
resolution cameras of some it's a
mystery now that I've opened up the
tablet let's open up our two keyboard
options now you can buy a surface tablet
bundled with this kind of surface touch
cover it's got kind of a flat keyboard
that's more touch sensitive but just
slightly raised if you buy that as a
bundle then it adds a hundred dollars to
the cost but you can only get it in
black if you want a colored model you
have to pay a hundred and twenty dollars
by buying it separately unless you buy
it at the pop-up store and you just we
talked them into giving it to you for
the same price as the bundle because
that doesn't make any damn sense
on top of that there's the type cover
option now this is also a cover for the
surface but it actually is much more
like a keyboard which you'll see when I
eventually stopped talking and open it
up that cost an additional hundred and
thirty dollars and only comes in black
you're keeping upright yeah well this
makes sense now this is actually a
pretty nice little keyboard I'm kind of
bummed that it doesn't come in any
colors but I can see why you would want
this because the big knock
tablets is that as soon as you have to
get a little work done the touchscreen
kind of lets you down it's pretty slick
let's open the other one and then we'll
try them both on for size so you can see
the keys are not raised at all here
pretty much just flat I think the main
difference is that it allows you to use
it more like a laptop because once you
have the kickstand up you've got this
laying flat like an actual keyboard you
can kind of type away it doesn't
honestly make that much sense other than
the fact that it's like a pretty color
let's see how they work does a case ok
dang nice can't close it pretty nice
little cover kind of like the Apple one
I like my pink and then when I open it
up it turns it on just like the Apple
thing then I can kick stand Baba and I
have my whole little baby laptop set up
one other thing they made a point of
telling me was that when I flip the
cover around this way it stops working
so I can't accidentally sort of type
things while I'm holding it which is
nice
alright let's compare it to our little
think pad guy here that's pretty nice
actually how it snaps right on and then
we have our little desk top station set
up I guess that's why this only comes in
black because this is the business
option but I think that's kind of boring
I'm gonna try these both out and see how
they go but unfortunately I do have to
send Jeff kanata the pink one for the
torture testing a quick word about
Windows RT so there are going to be two
versions of the surface tablet that run
two different versions of Windows
Windows RT is not a botched retweet it
is the version that is more like the
Metro interface that you've been hearing
so much about that's these tiles it will
only run apps from the Microsoft app
store so this is totally the mobile
version of the operating system it
doesn't interoperate with regular old
Windows 8
you can't just install any old Microsoft
software on here with the exception of
office and Internet Explorer 10 there
will also be a version available in
January that runs in Windows 8 Pro and
that'll be presumably much more like a
little tiny computer although to my mind
it just confuses things even more at a
time when honestly you just want to say
like kind of like the iPad but Windows I
think it's a perfectly nice tablet I'm
looking forward to using it I'm looking
forward to seeing if Steven Sinofsky was
right about how tough it is but I can't
lie despite the line at the pop-up store
today I think Microsoft has a tough road
ahead</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
