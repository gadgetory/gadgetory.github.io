against your in-car tech will take you
for a little ride in the tesla model x
virtually speaking and we're also going
to show you who's the most dependable
car out there whose tech isn't breaking
its car tech live hello everybody this
is episode 2 51 for this where is it
15th 16th of 6 16 x 2 days after
valentines day how could forget that
what a perfect way to remember dates you
know in in May will be saying the same
thing 74 days after valentines day I'd
go with seven days after cinco de mayo
oh that's right we can keep leapfrogging
ahead behind anyways Brian Cooley Wayne
Cunningham antuan goodwin stevo's at the
controls today filling in for Mitch
Chang who's going on our our big story
actually just came out a little while
ago this morning on Thursday through
catching us live or shortly after we do
the show here it's a new recommendation
not binding but sounds real serious from
the Department of Transportation run by
old tech hater rail Ray LaHood and they
have proposed new distraction guidelines
these are voluntary and their guidelines
they're neither laws nor firm
regulations but they sure kind of read
like them and they're going after
distraction in cars at the OEM level
we're not talking about you fumbling
with your smartphone it's a whole
different crews say this is the d.o.t
and the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration telling car makers you
need to build the tech in cars
differently you're making us nervous so
here are the three basic thrust we're
gonna put up a link in the show notes to
this PDF which is a little wordy but if
you look at the executive summary about
page 9 is where it gets interesting
three guidelines number one when it
comes to non driving-related tech in the
car things that are not essential
driving the vehicle they want to make
sure that car makers are going to dial
back on displaying images or videos and
aren't necessary dial back on displaying
automatically scrolling text I'll be
curious to get our take on that in a
minute be careful of requiring manual
text entry of more than six button or
key presses per task or require reading
more than 30 characters per task number
24 other non driving-related secondary
things they want to work on the time
that you spend on them and they say that
they should have a rule of thumb saying
that you don't glance away from the road
for any tech task that's not essential
to driving for more than two seconds or
a cumulative time for a total of twelve
seconds of two seconds or less looks to
get a task done and there's also
something here about one and a half
second glances it all gets very dicey
and finally the level three here they
say the last one is that they want all
device functions designed to be
performed by the driver through I our
hey I and hand coordination what they
call visual manual so that that requires
only one hand to operate I can't think
of much tect requires two we'll talk
about that steering wheel oh there's
that I hope that qualifies is essential
to driving and also they say that each
active display should be located as
close as practicable to the drivers
forward line of sight so those are the
basic recommendations what do we think
well navigation seems like it's a one of
those tech devices it's essential to
driving well it's an interesting
question is it essential driving or is
there a nice add-on I think it's pretty
essential driving because well mean for
one cat's already out of the bag yeah
people aren't going back to paper maps
and 42 ray lahood wants them to well I
mean 42 it's like even if even if you
did I mean a paper map is even more of a
driving distraction than the navigation
app because before map doesn't do it
does it doesn't follow itself people
forgot how fun people used to fumble
with paper maps propped up on the
steering wheel back in the day needs to
go driving down the road like that and
the papers in the way you can't see
through it it's or just like those like
laminated sleeves that you would like
put on your dash oh yeah for the
seriously organized driver it'll be
required to have a passenger in with you
I read a map that's to regulation so I
in turn here turn no single driving and
you can't look at them no girls are
worse than navigation systems actually
baby there ladies talking about other
stuff and they're like looking out the
window and they're like oh crap that's
return right there I mean it's very rare
that I find phone in the passenger seat
who will give me a turn like okay in
about a mile or and a half you're gonna
want to make sure you get over to the
right calmly yeah proper distance as
opposed to the oh crap yeah so when
someone does it I'm
surprised I look over like wow wow you
don't give a good direction you gotta
drive well it seems like there's some
wiggle room in these directions I'm sure
from then the nits aside they're
probably they don't see the wiggle room
but I think automakers could find it you
know they mention images you should not
have any distracted images or video now
I hope they don't mean a map isn't
images that's distracting right is that
an image is that video it is moving how
about the google Tech we've seen an Audi
and BMW that kind of looks like video
that Google Earth overlay oh yeah and
then those in hybrid cars they have the
powerful animation yeah that could be
considered the statute video but you
know maybe that's essential for the cars
operation because you need to know where
the power is coming from you need to
know if your battery's dead no it's like
it's like ages in the signal light
there's that a what is it the it's
called the blue something game on the
hyundai cars yeah where you like start
it up and you try to like max out your
your fuel economy over 10 minute period
you can see that being hit pretty hard
by this but really show anything except
some numbers and a representation of a
car with wheel spinning but is that
video you know is that we notice is what
I want to ask you about Antoine as they
said in here we don't like the idea of
any automatically scrolling text that
covers a lot of hidden units well mean
that covers most RDS radio system that
are already out there right yeah let
alone satellite an ipod in fact we're
getting away from those because the
displays are getting bigger in cars and
they don't need to scroll the town is
interesting yeah although so many of
them still do it always makes me nuts
when they've got a big LCD and they
don't take advantage of it they give you
about an eight character window within
it for RDS or maybe for HD radio types
like why didn't you bump that out you've
got a show like album artwork and other
stuff on that screen that that's way
more important than getting what song is
that vertical I want to see if it was
songs in the key of life or greatest
hits well but it's this long time off it
was on both man I need to know yeah so
because I mean people people visually
recognize albums right it's true no they
don't yeah I do that was sarcasm well I
haven't seen an album cover in years
what one thing they mention of a certain
age one thing they mention in your do is
displays as close as practicable to the
driver Linus yes now practical that has
a lot of wiggle room because
yeah you can't put a you know 17 inch
display like right in front of the
driver in place of the instrument
cluster you know you have to put that in
the console so this seems to urge maybe
more head-up display yeah hey I don't
join my mind's eye based on and the
first time I heard this list is when you
were just enumerated it so I'm putting
together in my head with this this
interface that they want is going to
look like and I'm seeing gigantic head
up display with a bunch of widget that
you can like touch because you can't my
hand yeah with one hand because you
can't go more than a couple levels deep
but you still need this information yep
and a lot of do two seconds per
interaction for a total of twelve
seconds so job gigantic head up display
15 or 16 widgets kind of floating around
minority report in front of you yeah and
it ends up being more distracting
nothing distracting about that and it
would be if it were just just not there
also said in here along with the closest
practical to the forward line of sight
include a specific recommendation for
the maximum downward viewing angle to
the geometric center of each display in
other words get things up like head up
and as opposed a lot of those displays
that are not just over out of line of
sight but they're also down below the
dashboard horizon I mean we're so used
to that now but is that really really
good design can't all displays come up
higher well you know we used to complain
about the Porsche they used to have
their yeah come in the kitchen manager
screen down buddy on me yeah way down
low and they started they raised that up
and that that was definitely a good move
on their part yeah a lot of the problem
I've seen too with cars is the
navigation system is optional and so for
the car maker to make it something they
can put in or pull out they have to put
it lower on the dashboard because
there's just room there well what a lot
of them started doing just leaving the
screen in there yeah all right you got
nav where you don't get nav the screens
there now it's just a gigantic climate
control system yeah and I think that's
what they should do though I think
that's what makes sense to go in that
direction screens are the screens are
probably cheap enough that it doesn't
add too much to the bottom line of the
vehicle there's actually was a story we
actually took it out of today's run down
because we got this do t storage is
going to take some time but there was a
guy from Harmon the head of harman
international which has all kinds of car
tech brands as well as JBL and others
under them saying in five years
there will not be a car of any price
point in the u.s. that doesn't have an
LCD screen it may not be a big one but
it'll least be of some decent size he
wasn't talking about inch sizes in
particular but there's an indication
that yeah maybe everyone gets an LCD so
that way they can at least get some
consistency ok we're going to push the
screen up it's got to be across all our
cars we can't have to dash caps for
every model one with LCD up high one
without that gets a little messy from
car makers but I kind of think the nits
of people are just thinking like oh we
can't have all cities in cars that's
distracting it's it's an image on a
screen and we can't have that you can I
get that flavor from this don't you yeah
and I also think I mean they mentioned a
little bit about the you know cell
phones and stuff like that disabling all
these functions and you know if they
make it so you pair your phone and when
you're moving it disables the bluetooth
well that's just stupid because people
just going to pick up their damn phones
and mega halls you know carrying the
damn thing totally that's what happens
when you do lock outs and you know we we
see cars that go both ways some of them
will have heavy lockout you go up to
about two miles an hour if it's like a
Toyota's bad on this they lock stuff out
they get most time oh yeah failings
employers right I had a hard time with
the camry hybrid last night i was trying
to input in a dress but i could not
catch a red light saber right not what
it's long enough right it looks like you
get scraps and the voice comes not quick
enough either so you can't really are I
hate the problem was the voice command
wouldn't let me put in an intersection
it would let me put in a dress which was
great what you didn't know let me put it
in an intersection i need to get 2015
mission i don't know what street
addresses down there i can get a wine up
so that was that's a good example of how
we're sitting there trying to punch
something in the lockout won't let us
what do you do you pick up your damn
phone and you punch it into the google
nav on your android device and guess
what or you even talk to the android
device but that's more distracting i
think then using something that is built
into the car i mean maybe not you know
are we driving people back to maybe the
the mobile device people need to step in
is juggling your phone with really good
voice rec better than anything I and
hand built into a car and I'm putting it
that way cuz I don't think any car maker
makes really good voice technology not
compared to the self the smartphone guys
they just blow the car industry away the
proud thing is though that all that
smart phone voice right happens in the
cloud yeah we can't use Siri without an
internet connection you can't use google
or vlingo yeah without an internet
connection it's not
I mean the the processing power for
voice recognition it usually happens up
there somewhere in space yeah wherever
the Internet is huh well this is all
non-binding it's they say it's voluntary
regulation so if you parse that
voluntary is obvious regulation is
usually the same language they use when
they tell car makers often not
voluntarily that you know taillights
must be a certain height bumpers have to
be a certain height you may not have
anything sticking out of the door handle
on the outside that could catch a
pedestrian and drag them down the street
those are regulations that they have to
follow these are regulations they don't
but it's only one step from them saying
okay we've tried these out and we're
going to flip them over to ray required
at some point that's the language they
use regulation is these organizations
form of law I wonder how long mr. LaHood
is going to be in a lot present USA
alive I saw you try and skip that word
in trying to be polite all of a sudden
Wayne books is true is ticket for DC if
he retires in a couple of years these
might not have much impact yeah he seems
to be the big driver behind this
although um you know this is coming from
what's the relationship between mitza
and DOD I'm unclear on that I think this
is a department of do team okay okay so
that's why this is all under under under
ray or at least all being led by him
anyway give us your comments we're gonna
have a link in the show notes you can
read the executive summary of the PDF is
the thing to look at will call that out
in the show notes take a look it's page
nine we'll put that in the notes as well
and just look at what they say that
should be required of car makers or at
least seriously urged of car makers and
how that would change your car something
you may have just paid good money for
and maybe the car makers wouldn't do
that anymore or worse what if they were
told they had to unwind it next time you
came in on a service call they had to
disable it with a software update they
can do that in fact there been questions
asked on whether that would be the path
or is everything old grandfather did in
which case you might have a very
valuable car all of a sudden if somebody
wants the old I Drive that lets you do
the more then maybe a 2014 I Drive could
do so interesting topic and will be of
course talking a lot about this you can
also send us your voicemails on this as
well by the way 866 what the hell's a
number 86 6401 cnet 866 40
we have so many phone numbers on here
866 401 2638 call right now if you're
listening on your get us get your phone
out let us know what you think about
these regulations that might be required
okay tesla model x Wayne and I went down
to LA last week and was it last week
what day was that yeah that was that
Thursday Thursday Timeflies that's right
Antoine Antoine was here holding down
the fort so we were down seeing the
Model X which is their SUV basically or
crossover is what it looks like and gull
wing doors that's the first thing you
see you go hey it's got gullwing doors
aren't going doors as our Father sorry
there's hook and wing doors and here's
why they call them that if you're
looking at our video version here you
see that they kind of fold in the middle
so as they come up they also fold across
horizontally halfway or so up the door
so they can become more compact this way
they don't require so much room to lift
and you can park in a normal space and
not be trapped that's basically the idea
um I think it's gonna happen I don't
know I you know I think Tesla definitely
wants it to happen and in the you know
but this is essentially a concept car
baby it's pretty finished they didn't
call the concept car but yeah cameras
for side view mirrors yeah that was way
out there they say they want to do it
but you know they might not be able to
and then they are the crazy doors
although they talked a lot about the
functionality that they did really focus
on the functionality of that and said
this is the most accessible car the cart
that's easiest to get into you the only
as third row SUV that you can actually
climb into the third row easily while
you've got a baby seat in the second row
exactly pointed that out as hello
parents you want this car because I
guess when you're not having kids I
don't know if I guess when you got a kid
in the second row and that seats all
strapped in with belts you can't fold
that seat forward you got to unloosen
the child seat yeah clamor back there
what a pain it's a nice looking thing if
you haven't seen it it's kind of what
Acura and Audi looking is that a fair
that sure yeah or a fat jaguar ok
there's Elon Musk sitting in the back of
it in the photo we're looking at right
now and that shows how you can actually
get into the third row it's a bit of a
shitty look like it's that easy to get
out of that easy no it's not that easy
it's like okay you can do it you're
gonna hear your your back pop and crack
a couple times you do it though but as
opposed to climbing
some of those third grow things in the
SUV's that are out there it's it's
definitely a lot yeah you can do it
unlike a regular 2-door just gonna I
wasn't there so yeah doesn't look that
interesting to you well know in photos
it just looks dumb it looks like Dorothy
they're too many moving parts like a
door is pretty simple you've got a hinge
at one end of it or it's on a slider
they're not a lot of moving parts but
now you've got two hinges and things
have got to come down to the right order
and they've got to latch the bottom and
of course somebody's gonna ask what
happens when you roll over can't get
that door oh yeah how does that work
how's rollo that'll tell us that your
status 85th LLS has like explosive bolts
that's cool but I mean you know you roll
over in this one everyone's got to crawl
out of the front doors and they do have
conventional front doors by the way the
goal wings are just the second row /
second and a half Rho and then the front
doors or traditional hinged doors hinge
at the front a traditional hatch in the
back and by the way since there's no
engine front or rear you have these two
big deep cargo bays front and rear it's
kind of like a giant version of what a
Boxster has with a cargo bay in both
ends but they're really big and they're
crowing about how that makes for a
really great crumple zone in the front
mr. luggage up there to get crumpled in
the crack right let's better get in a
block in my lap I guess uh sorry oh one
cool thing about this and you know one
thing we are not really mentioning here
it's an electric car yeah they didn't
they didn't talk about that as much as
you might think because they're kind of
trying to move ahead saying okay it's
also just a car right a usable everyday
car but it is the same platform as the
model s so a lot of specs that we would
expect from that but one thing that's
really cool i think about this is they
mention it can be available with
all-wheel drive so that means one
electric motor in the front and one in
the rear i was thinking about this a bit
and it's kind of cool they talked about
how they can adjust the torque across
you know the axles yeah better traction
and all that but unlike a car with a
engine doing all-wheel drive and
adjusting the torque back and forth it
isn't shifting the torque it's just
saying do we want a hundred percent
torque at the front and one hundred
percent torque at the rear or we can do
it or do we want fifty percent of the
front and a hundred percent it rear and
I'm sure per wheel yeah you could know
that it doesn't actually torque across
the week oh it doesn't know no
interesting okay
can't do that it's just a single motor
at each wheel they didn't know kind of a
yeah there's no guy would want to add a
gearbox to split the torque wheel to
wheel that it'd be simpler differential
you wouldn't be able to turn well they
mentioned well yeah but they mentioned
what they're using for things like
traction obviously traction control and
improving handling is in wheel breaking
mm-hmm okay um but the but I think it's
fascinating with scar can have two
hundred percent torque right hundred
percent on both ends yeah he kind of is
too in a present or everything it'sit's
you can basically turn this thing into
to complete power trains both working
one hundred percent of the time so could
you cut it in half yes that's it and get
casters the hardware store for the back
and then you save half and then the
price comes down to like 30 grand per
car because now it's only half the price
of the basement which we're guessing is
about 60 it's so like Wayne said it's a
model s basically underneath so it's
going to have a ten to twelve percent
reduction in range because it's a bigger
vehicle to move through the air so the
range on the model s would come down ten
or twelve percent they're guessing and
once it gets to production pricing
should be similar 0 to 60 they expect in
4.4 seconds which as they like to crow
is point for faster than the current
carrera 911 you know all these little
bullet points that they had to make it
seem like it's a great SUV in a great
sports car and has the space and the
accessibility of a minivan which was
their story about the folding doors
that's a fast car I got a little quick
ride in it yeah and the driver just
hammered it and it had all that that
locomotive push of an electric
powertrain and no noise which always
makes a car seemed faster yeah it's like
wow how does that happen without a lot
of growling then you've got to pull over
and charge it whereas in the in the in
that boys are you get to keep driving
but you keep going but 300 miles range
that's what they're on the top model
maybe miles range when you're babying it
yeah 300 miles range of doing zero to 60
runs at every way that's about a buck
and a half if you do that and then
you're charging lots yes for the big
banner that's for the big battery which
will be killing seven or something yeah
lots of screens inside we've talked
about the 17 inch LCD that's also got
all stull video gauges and two like
little ipod nano screens on the wheel to
allow the buttons on the wheel to have
almost unlimited functions I'll be soft
buttons oh they'll be soft assigned hard
buttons so anyway that's some of the
tech in that one we've got
all kinds of stuff if you haven't seen
it already go to car tech dot cnet sorry
cars dot cnet.com and you'll find our
slideshow our video it's all up there
just search model x it's easiest way to
get to it okay uh washington state says
if you drive an EV you should be
punished a hundred dollars why is this
road taxes this is sort of your EV road
tax because normally the road
maintenance is paid for by gasoline
taxes electric cars don't use gasoline
that's a problem yeah I think Washington
state is getting a little too quickly
out ahead of this problem right out
other that may electric cars no and
they're out they all use the you know
the super eco tires which have very
little impact you know they're designed
for low friction sirloin so they're not
going to do much the roadway and these
cars are supposed to be light because
they have to be yeah i don't i don't
think yeah it's a little early you know
it's like okay wait wait let psycho a
cumulative problem i would say let's see
what gas taxes in washington and see how
many miles there recouping of gasoline
car tax contribution by doing that
Washington charges a steep I have this
right now thirty seven and a half cents
per gallon state tax that's correct
that's way up there is that the highest
in the country i think it might be
that's part of why they're doing this
look how much they rely on gas tax that
is the highest in the country if i'm not
mistaken no one else comes above 35 if
I'm yeah Wow okay so they have a lot of
gas tax revenue coming in in Washington
State 37 I mean they're only basically
saying they're only hitting you for
about what is that three hundred and no
geez do some math here a couple hundred
miles worth of driving compared to a gas
car so this is not a major recoup it's
just a token recoup some owes have to
turn to punish electric car drivers but
it's not going to bring back the same
amount of money that a gasoline car
would do in the same year well it's like
one of those things that like on paper
probably makes sense like it's just a
nominal fee yeah but then when you
actually say it in public then it
becomes like a why are you punishing us
we're trying to save the entire thing
where it's just like to the bean
counters it's just an avi you're on the
road it makes sense but then to the
environmental
it just seems like a tax on being green
and it looks like like not much you know
if you say it's a hundred bucks across a
year of driving that's almost nothing
and then you get the bill your
registration arrived and it's a hundred
dollars more than it was the year before
see the thing about like taxes that are
built into purchases is they're
invisible to people so a lot of these
people didn't even realize they were
paying a gas tax they just knew they
were buying right yeah it's just in the
cost of its always bails tax like it's
like you don't realize you're really
paying it it's just something that
happens yep and now you're gonna get a
line item on your registration right as
soon as you break it out as something
else it's like you're not hurt yeah you
look at and go what 1037 cent at a time
/ gallons nothing you know feel it and
you're used to the price of gas yes it's
it's a fairly stable thing except for
you know a couple years ago by the way
we have some good comments on this story
actually some people did the math on on
how much this would be equivalent to
driving and we had one per 0 points out
hundred dollars compares to 37 cents per
gallon that's about 350 gallons of
gasoline a year says about what ten
Phillips or something like that 10 tanks
alright so for a lot of folks that's my
meme as little as eight weeks so I have
a lot five weeks yeah depends if they
drive a lot now something says an
average of 15,000 miles a year 25 miles
per gallon that's about two hundred
twenty dollars 222 dollars per year in
gas tax so hundred dollars isn't bad yes
no matter what you're getting a discount
yeah you're getting a discount on the
same amount of tax you'd pay for driving
those miles in a gasoline car but then
the question is is it worth it then
really a hundred dollars per electric
car how many are there in Washington a
few thousand right if you're only
driving say you know 5,000 miles a year
yeah if this is your second car yeah
you're see your city commuter or
whatever it yeah it seems to be not the
time to do this it's almost like they're
standing on principle and the principle
is not admirable and all the cars are in
high volume and some people are some of
our commenters are also pointing out
that sort of punishes the early EV
adopters but the people drive in the 50
miles per gallon Priuses are getting
away like gangbusters well yeah well
it's interesting is there but they're
paying that it's I'm going to do some
numbers on this I'll do a little
spreadsheet see what a Prius versus a
low a low consumption gas engine versus
a no
volt leaf honda fit there are three or
four viesturs some kind of a lice high
mileage four-cylinder see who ends up
coming off the best in terms of what you
pay for the car and what you're gonna
get stuck with in Washington it's like I
don't want to like seem like that guy
but it just seems a little whiny the
whole like they're punishing me for love
like come on we live in a society repay
be punished on taxes all the time not a
punishment is but it's what happens when
you live in this country pay taxes for
things like where do you think the roads
come from if this is an attack Magic
this is an assessment and this is the
thing that people always grouse about on
property taxes like okay I know my
property taxes are X and they can't go
beyond that it like in California with
the loot rules we have so then they go
they add assessments which are basically
taxes but they're called something else
and that's a dredge people crazy is it
this basically an assessment on a
particular behavior and it's
discriminatory it some people that buy
electric cars right I don't know I don't
know if it's discriminatory it's just my
fav the fingers just like I don't know
if it is discriminatory or punishment or
I don't even unfair it well that's it
currently with the prices of electric
cars you know they're high and people
that are fairly well-to-do were buying
them the hundred dollars isn't gonna
make much different they're just like oh
yeah sure it's not a lot of money over
the year it's just it when it arrives as
a new line item it's gonna work that
that's like this is the equivalent of I
own an iphone and iphone case cost
thirty dollars but like a cheap gel case
called five and you're punishing me for
being and I feel like there's rights
because I had to buy the case with the
works with iphone sticker on it Apple
tag totaling about that it is it's it's
the price of privilege that's what it is
if you have an iPhone or electric car
you are in the ten percent at the very
least all right way too much for
something yes you're ready to submit a
top dollar for a premium product all
right well anyway that's where things
are in let us know what you think about
an electric cars substitution fake is
that's been in the news before but I
think Washington's the first state to do
it boom there it is under bucks speaking
of mileage really briefly here Honda
lost this case is about a week and a
half ago they lost a case on how they
were stating the MPG of their hybrids
that they were overstating the mileage
you were going to get this was a suit
brought
by a vehicle owner that she used to I
think she used to be in the carbons and
is used to work at a car dealership
which is kind of interesting and then
she also had a law degree which I don't
think she had used before as a lawyer or
she'd retired or something anyway she's
going back in the law profession which
is an interesting sidebar cuz she's so
stoked by her whim but anyway this is um
where Honda was accused of overstating
the mileage you would get in a hybrid
and I'm surprised that it wasn't just so
simple of is this what the EPA says or
not why is this on Honda well it was
what the EPA said they quoted the EPA's
numbers yeah and they use that in their
advertising and there is actually a
class-action suit based on this as well
the Honda sort of agreed to settle
because it was cheaper to do that than
fight it yeah but this woman decided to
go on her own okay so she went separate
of the class right and she went to small
claims court this is sort of an
interesting side note to the story and a
lot of she had a lot of support i think
amongst the public amongst the internet
public because she was you know fighting
Goliath on her own taking the small
plane claims court he's erin honda fit
of it yeah and she could win like ten
thousand dollars you know in small
claims court now the rules in california
small claims courts say that you can't
bring a lawyer well so that's where her
past legal background helped her out
yeah she's not officially a lawyer and
honda could not bring a lawyer so they
had sent one of their engineering guys
to say well the EPA said this and is not
going to go with oh no is it the
marketing guy they say you're the
engineer you got us on the marketing guy
to spin it engineering guy showed up
with a chart like everyone knows likely
go all right so she made 90 867 bucks
yeah although hot is gonna appeal this
they want to actually have you know
lawyers argue this out and stuff like
this because this could actually have a
huge impact on the auto industry as a
whole yeah if they're saying these EPA
numbers they can't use those which you
know i mean it's it's an estimate it's a
test I mean it seems legitimate
hyundai's next because a 40 miles per
gallon on how much every car we test and
they very rarely get anywhere near that
then the interesting thing here though
is that if the EPA number is all they're
quoting and that got him into hot water
what are they supposed to say yeah I
mean unless they just can really have to
emphasize your mileage may vary
yours just like you start putting an
asterisk next to it with a this is what
it's been tested at yeah but this is not
necessarily an assertion that this is
what you would you like another
paragraph at the bottom of the ad is
what you're gonna get the future is like
you know you look down that like to
point type it's at the bottom of the ads
gonna be like another paragraph well
what I heard her evidence was when she
went to small claims court is she had
photographs of her trip computer in the
honda okay and she and she under that as
evidence you know there's not much
evidence in small claims court
apparently and so honda the rep I talk
to you they were just saying like you
know we'd like to see better evidence
there should be some independent testing
something to show this rather than just
a few photographs of for transmuter
remember that like back when the the
current generation of fit first came out
people were asserting that the trip
computer is a little generous oh yeah a
small 4 gallon estimate and they don't
actually do an empty tank you know you
get your receipt you look at the miles
you drove and you do the math it comes
out like maybe two or three percent
maybe even as much as ten percent like
high yeah on the trip computer yeah and
I heard like yeah 55 miles per gallon hi
yeah and you know somewhat some of it
will depend on polling time like is that
a really a full tank average or is you
know does the trip computer take
segments and shows you the last little
so is this an argument between epa and
what her trip computer showed or EPA and
what her own calculations of pump
Phillips she just use the trip either
she didn't have she didn't even have a
log so the trip computer versus epa and
trip computer said it you got a lot less
mileage yeah well as we know that always
happens there's like very instant
speedometer he tells if you hook a GPS
device up to your car you'll find your
speedometers about 2 or 2 25 miles per
hour fast and the faster you go the more
often walking it yeah it's a gear thing
the gear is not perfectly precise that's
driving a little magnetometer looking in
Subaru now and this I think it's just a
coincidence but I'm looking at their
subaru impreza site and they're stating
up to 27 36 is their new language for
MPG a little bit of couching there i
don't think this is tied to the honda
thing this is business up before that
but that might be the kind of language
we start seeing it a lot of car
makers is up to right EPA numbers you
might get this hey you might even get
more I've seen more occasions your
cheesy good luck with that yeah we never
see a car and that males the EPA not as
well never seen a manufacturer under
under states like Libya they always they
want to like each every little bit of
marketing opportunity how they can every
ounce going from what gets good gas
mileage to what keeps running new
numbers just came out this week from JD
Power you know they have all kinds of
studies they do this one is the vehicle
dependability study this one is the
long-term not the 90 days how many bugs
did your car have but this is the i
believe three years how many problems is
you have in that long period of time and
what they found is that there's an
average of a hundred and thirty-two
problems per hundred vehicles so over
three years a lot of vehicles didn't
have any reported problems at least a
large minority of them didn't have any
problems but who came in number one was
now lexus which used to be way at the
top and was number one for a while and
dropped down its lexus porsche caddy
toyota scion are your top five and those
are all well better than the average
again these are owner reported numbers
yeah this is not where they're doing
hard research and so let's see who did
the worst cuz that's the fun part of
this story number uh let's see uh count
them down from five on up fifth suckiest
is jaguar that's right ram jeep dodge
chrysler except for jag it's all us in
your marking on these brands boom boom
boom boom boom that's not good that's
not good i mean you could afford to God
want Ford and GM went to a press release
on this I just keep wanting to put eagle
at the bottom is like dodge chrysler
jeep right right yeah the a.m seal
around right also kind of low but not at
the bottom Oh many is not as bad as it
was consumer reports that many second to
worst in their version of this study
this one puts many below average in
terms of quality wood dependability but
not not at the bottom anyway i'll have a
link to this too if you want to see
where your car falls and HD radio still
not going anywhere what was the old
Saturday Night Live line so and so it's
still dead who was that Oh help me that
was the general
well Franco Franco okay it's still dead
HD ratio stilted it's just ain't going
anywhere you don't care about HD radio
I'm gonna stop mentioning in the videos
I don't think anyone cares I've seen it
popping up in more cars actually but I
don't think anybody really think anybody
cares yeah it's not a buying point bill
really is that car have HD radio cuz I
want that whatever that is it's like
nice to have it's yeah it isn't car and
got it and it's like oh nice and I think
it's nicer anywhere but the Bay Area and
seattle where a mountainous terrain
raises hell with it and it comes in and
out all the time here as our transmitter
signals are bouncing off of mountains
and buildings we get lots of multipath
and HD rios a hell of a time with that
and so you're going from HD two non HD
and that's worse than having no HD were
you just your ears get you because it
does an a/b comparison all the time and
you are constant being reminded oh yeah
FM sucks the most if you just had FM you
wouldn't compare it to anything but FM
sucks but you want to do that as you
much but you wouldn't know that as much
if you didn't have something really
clean coming in about ten percent of the
time and got oh that's what it could set
oh god did so this is research done by
mark casse often company it's a research
company they found that in 08
sixty-seven percent of people had heard
of HD radio now just fifty four percent
difference they forgot or a lot of them
died in two thousand eight twenty one
percent said it delivers better sound
now twenty percent say so that's gone
backwards in two thousand eight eight
percent could say yes it has more
channels and more choices and that
recognition number hasn't moved at all
this is a mess and seven percent in the
first survey said HD Radio is actually
the same as satellite radio at least now
only six percent like that what a mess
it's just that the yay HD radio I don't
think I don't think it's gonna what's
gonna go anywhere yeah it's you know FM
radio nobody really cares how good it is
if you listen FM you just like you just
want to have something on yeah it's not
what you want in terms of programming
yeah so who cares if it sounds better
you know last thing we got here for we
go on the road forward is got sync
available in more cars let's see what do
we have for 2013 like a fusion asian
fusion and edge thing Oh flex yeah flex
so they're just making it standard it
used to be optional and it was a pretty
cheap option I mean 200 you know 300 x
or something and now they're they're
making it standard in
in both fusion and flex and okay so they
won't get the revenue stream off that
but kinda we're thinking maybe they're
competing with Kia and Hyundai and Kia
and Hyundai are putting those types of
functions standard in their cars yeah so
they're thinking we got to keep ahead of
them all right that's starting with the
2012 fusion if i'm not mistaken not even
waiting for the new redesigned 2013 if i
read that right so this should be taking
effect like right away so next time you
go shop for a fusion reflects it should
have sink if it was you know built from
like this point forward and if it
doesn't just pay the three and advice
get the damn thing it's worth it totally
worth it no like haggle it out of your
dealer right make them pay put it in
there and tell them I hear it's coming
standards so here I am coming in to help
you and buy a car now when you need
money yeah to close the month you know
Papa 200 bottle of bourbon yeah it to me
and then keep the rest hey everybody
gets their beak wet on this one
everybody ok let's go on the road it's a
Subaru that is part of their sometimes
confusing line of impressiveness let's
take let's go for a ride the 2012 subaru
impreza 2.0 i sport limited and see what
this car is all about check it out we've
got a downsized engine here it's smaller
than the previous generation of subaru
impreza ya know these days like a two
and a half later now it's like a 22
point 0 liter right still a flat floor
boxer engine because that's kind of
Subarus trademark and their other
trademark being they're symmetrical
all-wheel drive system right which this
car still comes with standard what's
interesting is that we also have a CVT
in this vehicle I think the first time
Subarus used that I've started to roll
it out through their cars in the last
couple years but it's pretty recent and
I think it might be the first time in
the Impreza yeah every was a big deal in
this car was launched last year at one
of the european motor shows where they
said they were going to be putting a CVT
instead of a traditional automatic
transmission much like the the smaller
engine it to get better
you'll efficiency out of it and if I
mean in my limited drive not that bad of
a CVT either yeah and the kind of whole
point of this cbt am the smaller engine
is to get better fuel mileage and this
thing is rated at 27 miles per gallon
city 33 I think maybe 36 highway I
haven't seen quite that I barely got it
over 27 and some extended freeway
driving so not sure how realistic those
numbers are I think it would take some
significant baby ya think but then as
far as like cabin tech I don't really
have much going on here right there is a
USB port for iphone or for iPod
connectivity and put a USB Drive in
there with some music bluetooth icon
here I'm assuming that means we have
hands-free calling do we have audio
streaming yeah and this is actually one
of the best bluetooth audio streaming
setups I've seen because it will
actually show full track information on
the radio display you know it has the
usual limitations you could only like
skip tracks and pause it but then it
also has the full bit of information
which a lot of system's don't show they
don't show you any like song title or
anything but this would like to show you
everything so that's that's pretty cool
interesting ok so this car was first and
foremost cheap 21 Grand delivered for
the base model actually 17 for the very
base model really yeah then that but
over the deal if you get away from the
two point oh I sport premium thing yeah
but still I mean the engine and the
transmission well it base is a 5-speed
manual yep and then but it still has
that that 2-liter engine boxer engine
and the all-wheel drive too yeah the
all-wheel drive is what makes it a
screaming deal if you need that at all
and a lot of folks you know living the
weather where you do most of the country
does and my first thought about this car
when I start driving it and I might have
mentioned it in that video to is why
wouldn't you buy this car if you're in
the during the market for it for a
compact Civic what an elantra what Chevy
Cruze you got to put this on your list
that sound that sounds like an
advertisement but I was very surprised
by a look at 17 495 if you don't get any
premium or limited or any of those
nights for trims and I
has four-wheel drive real four-wheel
drive these guys do a good job of
serious all-wheel drive that will get
you out of trouble not just help you a
corner faster had some fun with that
because i found a little gravel track
and was doing some good that's a
circular racetrack in there and and
feeling it you know as the back would
start to let out the front would cling
on you know and I was yeah it was
keeping on track and it was fun to drive
it like that too was a blast it was a
fun driving little car for one that
isn't expensive it isn't a driver's car
you know one that has all that all the
BS and all the price to go with it it's
not all that powerful either keep using
the word fun for as a cbt in it not a
bad CVT but not a bad cv2 but i would i
would have preferred we had the
available with a manual we didn't get
that we got the CBT car so that added a
thousand dollars by the way and has
little paddles which are really silly on
a CVT at least if you've got cogs give
me paddles maybe I'm stimming the whole
concept of like fate gears I hate that
hurts me just don't give me they'll give
you a shift gate with a cbt yeah just
shift I mean III don't mind there being
two modes a sport mood yet drive moves
that's more than just transmit don't
pretend like they're gears there you're
completely doing a disservice to the
technology in the vehicle right the
technology is kind of moment being
making it spend time doing what it's not
yeah make me pretend to be a geared
transmission let it behave like what it
is here's my counter point to that is
that putting it in manual mode and I was
driving on some wet roads it was stormy
that week and I was writing you know
drive around these like twisty roads are
all soaked up you know wet and
everything and I'd lock it in third
locking in its virtual third gear yeah
and hold it there and that was third
gear but it work you know kept the kept
a constant you know ratio and constant
rpm which you don't get with the CVT the
RPMs all over the road on these guys
yeah I mean the idea of the CVT is that
is supposed to hit one rpm and just hang
there they never do but that's the thing
it's like you know if you are doing a
zero to 60 run in a cbt every time you
virtually shift you interrupt the power
there you're already not getting like
optimal power to the ground you get the
drivetrain losses of the CVT system so
like if you can put it in
sport mode and then just have the engine
just sit at wherever its maximal with it
about put it yeah you know then then you
you don't lose that power for that
couple of seconds where you and then
have to get back up to that point in the
power of n you actually end up going
faster in a CVT then you would without
one if they would just stop trying to
pretend like it's a regular transition
if you're out with your CVT car and
you're doing zero to 60 runs and you're
writing them down and comparing them you
bought the wrong call it's a CVT it's
supposed to be kind of easy and it has
sacrifices yeah and it's for fuel
economy mostly it mostly I mean it's
it's a bucket in the sweet spot staying
in that three thousand to four thousand
ish rpm range all the time you know kind
of hover there where the gas engines
happy oh it's a two-point that's a two
liter box you guys pointed out it came
down from 2.4 2.4 yeah yeah or five I
think it was two and a half two and a
half and still good numbers for a very
small motor 148 horse hundred forty five
foot pounds of torque and gets 2736 with
the CVT that better MPGs with the CVT
you get less if you go with the manual
and you have a huge difference in 0 to
60 you add a second and a half with the
CVT so yeah it's not the WRX no that's
the thing people mix up impreza with
impreza WRX and the interesting thing is
if you buy 2012 in w RX or 2012 STI it's
the old chassis yeah they haven't bumped
this new model up to the the if you they
have bumped the WRX and STI mileage as a
chassis and instead of just not filling
them this year they just are still
continuing to manufacture the old model
yeah it's one of those messy two cars
under the same name plate but there are
totally different underpinnings from the
only talk of the next WRX actually just
being completely different vehicle they
haven't stated whether they're going to
just make a WRX version of this chassis
or if they're just going to diverge the
tube it would be good for them to
clarify that I know people that drive a
WRX know all about them it's a
specialist it's a mainstream specialty
car but there's a lot of other folks I
think that are looking and not clear
about this is an impressive and impreza
WRX and STI is also neighbors or anybody
call a WRX and imprisoned WRX nobody
says that but it says on the band when
you're when you're in the showroom it
says impreza and the little
we'd like says like oh yeah my
impression of your interview imperfect
yeah it's so great nobody knew just say
my debut intercooler on my super impreza
WRX that doesn't get said no what are
your what about your impreza WRX STI
other notes on this car is um let's see
we talked about it you can only get if
i'm not mistaken a non navigation head
unit i think it can in the anything
that's did oh I don't know there was a
weird mixture in those the sport premium
doesn't come with nav you can't option
nav on it if you go to the very top the
limited or something yeah then you can
option it I've always kind of curious by
car makers that make you go to the very
top trim to then give them more money
it's like why don't you let me be a fool
and buy a mid-range car and then option
it up to as much or more than your high
range car let me have more flexibility
because when I'm comfortable as a
consumer with choice I'll spend more
money they tend to say by the top end or
just spend less money it's like let me
spend more money on any model I want
because it's easier from rolling off the
assembly line that way sue you if your
configuration like I don't want to have
to like build half of these like sports
yeah that's so much work for a global
auto maker with like you know eight
thousand mainframe computers that could
figure this out it's not a matter of
whether it's more work or whether the
canner can't do it it's a matter of we
make more money if it costs us less to
me yeah I'm sure they're being counters
have looked at it and said no this is
the strategy we're gonna get better
average you know revenue per car but
other car makers do the opposite they'll
let you option anything in any model so
one of them that's also the reason like
a nav system to BWW set seven thousand
dollars could you have to pay somebody
to put it in there and why be and why
they the coffee beige shift lever in a
911 is four hundred dollars cuz choice
costs money my favorite option is the
ceramic buttons OMW yes ceramic button
what does that do it like 600 bucks for
those yeah ceramic knob and the buttons
around the eye dr knob absurd you can
upgrade the audio system piece by piece
i found this interesting 10 inch sub 500
additional pair of tweeters on top of
the tweeters 120 and upgraded speakers
in all the same positions no more but
just better 249 yeah i think those are
our dealer accessory upgrade or
installed which surprised me for those
kind of price points yeah
let's have a thing that's I wish you'd
pay just go to bestbuy right so I mean
if you can get the dealer to do it and
it doesn't void your warranty on your
stereo system go for it do it yeah one
thing that's interesting here too we
have the sport premium model and that
had the sort of the standard radio
display yeah at the sport limited they
actually have an expanded display a
display audio kind of thing where they
show you more information on your radio
so not a color LCD just a bigger
monochrome I think it actually might be
color i'm not sure doc said not a big
screen still a ribbon type shape
slightly bigger more like a three by
five kind of thing interesting yeah i
got a lot of displays in this car the
one we had a bigger one a big one yeah
this makes me nuts I want to I want
simple and I want now and yeah they
should you know this whole like expanded
display audio type of screen they should
have brought that down to the the lower
level to i would think I mean if
something's called sport premium premium
it means something yeah this car was
called premium and sport did the sport
ok let's EDT and didn't work me aware
usually means nothing nothing it means a
harder ride and stiffer suspension
whatever that means this is for tunes
disappointed in it that's right i didn't
me it's stiff for me the sport tune or
two who is stiffer will be meaningful
anyway that's the subie of the the 2012
impreza it is a new version of that car
it is to most eyes more attractive can
we agree on that I think it looks the
same Renee I think it looks better in
person than it does in any video or
photograph I thought looking walk around
this car to appreciate it I thought look
pretty good and it also there was one of
the things that they changed on this
that was interesting they got rid of the
oh yeah so yeah so that the styling is
freshened and then of course the engine
is smaller but the mpg is better
significantly better it used to be kind
of like a rotary engine car a technical
Marvel but a pig he used to get 20 27
with the old engine and now as we
mentioned it's getting what was it again
27 36 big happens when you go for a
smaller engine yeah big shit that's a
huge jump in there di in them no no not
yet I don't think there's any boxer with
di yet the-the-the tudo di that's going
to be in the oh the food toyota scion e
di n
court injective yeah that's not the same
car even that same engine even though
it's a two liter oh it's just a box it's
a completely different okay well it
still should be a hot motor yeah all
right folks that's the that's that's the
car we got for the road this week let
suits in the connect car tech garage so
let's see we just rolled out the
wrangler jeep wrangler rubicon got it
good and muddy Thank You Antoine for
turning us onto your mud bog it doesn't
look the same now i'll have you know but
you'll see you next time you're there
and the range rover evoque very
interesting that's probably one of the
most requested cars from you our viewers
and listeners I've ever seen emails on a
lot of folks asking what are you gonna
review the Evoque is the review up
review is yet up went up yesterday okay
I think our video went up yesterday or
it goes up today so both of those should
be up now or by the time you hear the
show if you're catching us after we post
up next we have this on the new honda
crv the 2012 is in right now the new
Buick LaCrosse and the Camry Hybrid
which I didn't know we had in so we got
that too huh good grief okay another
busy week coming up alright that's it
for car tech live you know how to find
us show notes car tech dot C netcom let
us don't you think about the new
proposed regulations from the feds to
strip a lot of tech out of cars and

Brian Cooley all one word Wayne WWAY for
an e how do you mmm it sounds like a
like a like a traction control system
before silent before silent yeah way
with a silent for you guess where it is
