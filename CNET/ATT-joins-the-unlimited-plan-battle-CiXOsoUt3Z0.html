getting heated in the same week that
Verizon began offering an unlimited data
plans t-mobile Sprint and AT&amp;amp;T striked
back to beef up their unlimited
offerings things are changing fast but
to make sense of it all here's the
breakdown of current unlimited plans for
the major US carriers on Verizon $80
gets you one unlimited plan for one line
and you can get this on four lines for a
hundred and eighty dollars
t-mobile's unlimited plan starts at 70
bucks and four lines will cost a hundred
and sixty dollars Sprint's unlimited
starts at $50 and five lines not for is
just $90 in total that's obviously the
cheapest but Sprint's pricing will only
last a year after March of 2018 this
deal changes it'll cost more roughly the
same price as t-mobile AT&amp;amp;T is now
offering unlimited to any customer it
dropped the TV service bundle
requirement it starts at around $100 for
one line and four lines will cost you
one hundred and eighty dollars which is
close to Verizon's prices when you're
comparing prices though remember there
will be additional fees and taxes added
to the bill except for t-mobile they
fold all that into their advertised
prices of course you also have to take
Network quality into consideration
Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T are the largest but it
doesn't always mean they are the best
where you live t-mobile is ranking high
in many reports these days and keep in
mind unlimited is not truly unlimited
the fact is if you gobble up data all of
these networks are gonna slow you down
for example on Verizon if you use 22
gigs of data your speed is gonna take a
hit and other customers will be given
preference over you if the network is
congested throttling limits are about
the same for every carrier but t-mobile
offers the most leeway and waits until
you hit 28 gigs right now all of the
carriers are including HD video
streaming in their plans that didn't
used to be the case Verizon t-mobile and
Sprint also now include the same hotspot
perks offering ten gigs of high-speed
data that you can tether to share with
another wireless device AT&amp;amp;T once again
though is the strange exception
unlimited plans do not include mobile
unless connected to a smart car but as
competition heats up let's hope the
deals get even better networks are
growing to handle more capacity and
consumers are hungry for better
unlimited deals as our absence streaming
habits just demand more data for
