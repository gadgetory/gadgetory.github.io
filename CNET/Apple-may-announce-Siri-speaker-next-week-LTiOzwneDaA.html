will be joining Google and Amazon in the
smart speaker wars hey Siri would you
rather fight one horse-sized Alexa or
100 Alexa sized horses we've suspected
Apple was working on a standalone Siri
device for a while but Bloomberg is now
reporting Apple has begun to manufacture
a smart speaker the company may even
announce it at this year's WWDC which
kicks off June 5th in San Jose
California
now before you Apple fans start whipping
out your wallets and throwing money at
the screen you should also know that it
looks like the device is not slated to
hit retail until later this year so
you're good for now
so what is new in this report rumor has
it this unannounced speaker won't have a
screen but will still aim to act as a
homekit hub Apple music is likely to be
a key integration and third-party
services could be on the menu though
first party services will probably take
the lead something like this speaker
might help iPhone users start using
homekit more regularly opening a door to
other smart home devices and services
Apple might offer in the future and
encouraging users to stay within the
Apple ecosystem as always we never
really know what's up with Apple until
they officially announce things we'll be
covering a WWDC 2017 in full force when
the conference kicks off but for now
we'll just have to hope that a Siri
speaker is very close to being announced
