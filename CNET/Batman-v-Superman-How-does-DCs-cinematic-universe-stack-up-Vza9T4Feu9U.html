Batman V Superman dawn of Justice
black and blue
God vs Man
day versus night
Batman vs Superman represents an effort
to build a fictional universe to rival
that of Marvel's Avengers but how
successful is the first DC Metaverse
movie with me as rich train home we're
going to talk a little bit around that
we've both seen Batman vs Superman what
do you think about the efforts that the
Warner Brothers and DC have put into
this how do you think it works I think
it sort of works I mean the thing is to
remember is that as the Marvel had like
five movies before they got to the
Avengers they had solo movies for most
of the Avengers so to Iron Man movies to
Iron Man movies The Hulk movie which
most people don't talk about bitter it
kk on city council and it's kind of
funny to remember now the how much of a
gamble Iron Man and Captain America
really were but um yeah but DC doesn't
have that luxury of having like a bunch
of movies to the proven hits they've had
to go straight in there they've got man
of steel I don't have to go straight in
there so putting Batman and Superman
together is one thing and I think they
most that really well in terms of
bringing those two characters together
in a sort of quite an interesting
conflict then they've also got to fit in
all these other characters and it does
kind of it had so much weight to the
movie and there's a lot of times in in
in dawn of justice when something
happens and you kind of have to sort of
adjust and go okay that's probably going
to make sense in 2020 right thing yeah
but hopefully it kind it takes you a
little bit at the experience doesn't it
because you are while you're watching it
you are sort of aware but you're not
just really watching batman vs superman
you are watching DC vs marvel yeah it's
a sort of old school yard argument but
now again writ large on the silver
screen so obviously i mean there's an
element here is an air of sort of you
know movie studios looking at what sort
of Disney and Marvel have done and being
a bit sort of envious you know looking
over your neighbor's fence and me like
nice you've got and no maybe I should
buy bigger no I think but you you do
sort of wander is it the right approach
to basically try and do the same thing I
part of me was wondering with bearing in
mind that the Avengers did that super
super hero smashing spectacle a film
with like a mil
Ian people in it they actually pulled
that off quite well first we wondered
maybe would it be better to take a
different approach and try and make
equally successful and good and popular
movies maybe the different maybe like a
quieter more sort of indie kind of angle
I don't know but does it basically what
I'm asking is does Batman vs Superman
have to be a blockbuster is that a
stupid question does it have to be
basically the Avengers but with
different characters oh that's this yeah
maybe baton of superman' could be like
they just got hang out and coffee shop
together yeah black and white yeah they
smoke and talk about yeah and they've
been jilted by their girlfriends and
yeah he's likely they talk about Louis
and yeah maybe I I I think that that
that one of the things that the DC also
hasn't done is that that feeling of like
looking over the neighbor's fence and
and going all quick we've gotta you know
we've got to get a new car or something
but they haven't resurfaced the drive
first which is what immuno Marvel have
done in Marvel has a very unified vision
and so that's why you've got the movies
you've got the Avengers movies you've
got the Netflix shows and they all kind
of slot together but they're all their
own thing whereas DC has got like it's
got the flash and arrow on TV and then
it's got the movies which are a very
very different tone and style it doesn't
feel kind of us as thought through in it
and has put together but that said I
really kind of enjoyed this sort of the
dark vision of the DC Universe it's
certainly certainly I think aimed at
comic fans and I I enjoyed the kind of
the grown-up pneus of it but the other
thing that it's lacking that Marvel
really has is the kind of the fantasy
and the joy and the escapism that will
appeal to to all ages in terms of making
these yet beloved characters appeal to
two kids and two grownups and to you
know have a bit of escapism a bit of joy
to them well we're going to keep this
discussion going down the pub but I
think but let us know what you think as
well guys it sure is a good time to be a
comic book fan alright that's all for
now stay tuned to see net</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
