battle for self-driving car secrets is
over
whammo reached a settlement with uber
over the alleged theft of 14,000 trade
secret files
wham-o is the autonomous car unit of
Google's parent company alphabet
high-profile witnesses like former uber
CEO Travis kalanick would call during
the trial which was expected to last
three weeks but lawyers quickly reached
a settlement at the end of week one when
the settlement came down we heard an
audible gasp throughout the courtroom
everyone was completely shocked as we
were exiting the courtroom none of the
lawyers wanted to give a comment and
none of the jury said they would speak
to us but one / lawyer did say now I'm
gonna go walk my dog how's that for a
comment meaning but he was really happy
the trial was over and he could move on
sources familiar with the negotiations
told CNET that is part of the deal
Weimer gets 0.34% of ubers equity that's
a value of around two hundred and forty
five million dollars
it isn't as much as the 1.8 billion
dollars that Weimer originally wanted
but this is still one of the largest
settlements ever from any trial over
trade secrets so what this means for the
two companies is that they're gonna go
forward and compete fairly so develop
their own technology with their own
engineers Karen uber CEO Derek ozra
shahi issued an olive branch to weigh
Moe in a statement saying the companies
were partners but also competitors he
also said uber did not believe any trade
secrets made their way from Weimer to
uber Weimer said the settlement would
help protect its intellectual property
going forward now the race is truly on
to bring a fully autonomous car to the
world
