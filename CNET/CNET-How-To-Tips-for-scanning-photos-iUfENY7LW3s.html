that photo scanning project you've been
putting off this is it today I've got a
few tips to help you digitize your photo
collection once your scanner is set up
launch the software it came with these
programs are actually pretty decent and
are packed with features specifically
designed for scanning photos in this
case I'm using an Epson scanner and the
Epson scanning utility first change the
DPI or the resolution if you're only
scanning the photos to archive them
digitally and share them on Facebook for
example 300 dpi is just fine but if you
plan to order enlargements in the future
go with 600 dpi scanning will take a
little longer but remember you only have
to do it once next check to see if your
program has an auto crop feature which
automatically crops multiple photos from
one scan this can literally triple the
speed of your project so enable it if
it's there
and finally the file output settings
JPEG is usually the default and it's a
great option if you need to save storage
space but really you should be using the
TIFF file format it's uncompressed which
means no quality is lost when the file
is saved in this same area you should
also be able to adjust the file name
this is really important because you
want to establish a system at the
beginning of your project so decide how
you want to organize your photos if it's
by date and event choose a file naming
system that matches it I'll go with the
reverse order date like 2012 1104 then
the event name and finally I'll number
the photos starting with 1 now that your
settings are set the last thing to do is
clean your scanner bed to make sure no
flecks of dust will be scanned with your
photos give it a quick clean and you're
ready to go now that we're all set up I
can scan a few photos so I'll lay down
three at a time and with that Auto crop
feature you want to leave a little space
between each photo right down
on this scanner I'll hit preview I can
see the thumbnails for each photo and
before I do the final scan I can even
rotate them to make sure the orientation
is right then right-side up
hit scan confirm my settings and now
it'll do the final scan and save the
photos to my computer this is going to
take a while but if you want to scan
your photos yourself the time it takes
is really the only drawback otherwise
you can outsource the project to a
company like scan my photos comm which
takes care of everything for you if you
have any questions or tips of your own
hit me up on Twitter and check out how
to see Netcom for more tips like this
