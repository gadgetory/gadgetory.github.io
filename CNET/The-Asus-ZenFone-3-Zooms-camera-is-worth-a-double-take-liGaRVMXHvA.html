the best camera on a phone which we've
heard before but what about with the
longest battery life to match that's
where this iPhone 7 plus look-alike
comes in it's hard to overlook the
similarities between this phone and
Apple's plus size phone both have a 5.5
screen in this case it's an AMOLED HD
display with a snapdragon 625 processor
and slim design but this time the
fingerprint scanner is on the back but
above that is the shining star of the
phone it's dual camera it has two 12
megapixel cameras with different focal
lengths 125 millimeters wide and the
other 56 millimeters wide this means it
also has an optical zoom much like the
iPhone 7 plus but this time 2.3 X
compared to the two of the iPhone this
means it's capable of doing that
beautiful bouquet effect on portrait
mode and is also great at low-light in
addition it has a 13 megapixel selfie
camera with a wide angle lens combined
with its manual mode pro settings and
raw file support this makes it a pretty
interesting camera and that's not all it
also manages to fit a five thousand
milliamp per hour battery in that slim
design which is supposed to give you
about 8.5 hours of live streaming or six
point four hours of 4k video recording
according tase's the deciding factor
between this and the iPhone might be the
pricing which we don't know yet but it
will be available in February of 2017</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
