and we're gonna take a look at the dent
on AVR 1913 this is at the high end of
Denon's consumer line of AV receivers
and it's currently selling for five
hundred and eighty dollars the down
looks pretty similar to last year's
model although it's a little bit less
stylish it has a matte black finish and
if you push out the cover on the front
there's an HDMI port and an ipod /
iphone compatible USB port so just take
your iPod cable connect it to the front
and you can play songs off of that the
included remote is actually great for an
AV receiver with big easy-to-read
buttons it looks much less cluttered
than other AV receiver remotes so if
you're not planning on buying a
universal remote it's a big plus Denon's
user interface is basic looking but it's
easy to navigate and change the settings
it also shows basic album art and song
information if you're playing music over
your home network or over airplay around
back you'll find all the connectivity
including six HDMI inputs counting the
front panel one two digital audio inputs
and a handful of analog connections for
your legacy gear there's also an
Ethernet port and that opens up all of
the AVR 19 13s networking features
including built-in airplay the ability
to control the receiver using Denon
smartphone app DLNA compatibility and
streaming audio services including
Pandora Sirius and internet radio now it
may seem like the AVR 19 is packed with
features but it's really only average
for this price on Chios TX NR 616 offers
8 HDMI inputs for over $100 less and
Sony's STR DN 1030 has both built-in
Wi-Fi and built-in Bluetooth for just
$500 so for a lot of people those
receivers are going to be a better value
then on sound quality is top-notch again
sounding very much like last year's AVR
19:12 we compared it directly to last
year's model and a new pioneer receiver
and the down are performed great with
both music and movies so if you're
looking for excellent sound quality the
Denon isn't going to disappoint
altogether there's no doubt that the AVR
19:13 is an all-around solid receiver
but it is expensive and it lacks a
really standout feature for this price
point so if you're looking to get the
biggest bang for your
buck you're gonna want to check out some
of the cheaper competitors I'm Matthew
Muscovy AK and this is the Denon AVR
1930</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
