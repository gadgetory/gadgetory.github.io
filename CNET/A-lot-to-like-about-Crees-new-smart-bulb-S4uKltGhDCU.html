first look at the Cree connected LED now
this is the debut smart bulb from Korea
the first connected light that they've
done and I think it does very well we've
tested it out and been very impressed
with it now turning the light on we can
see that we get a nice yellowy golden
color temperature right around 2700 K we
measured that at 26 96 so very very
close to the state at 2700 K it's also a
very nice brightness level you get about
870 lumens according to our spectrometer
and that's very well above the 815 that
standard on the box so they're pretty
generous in that front now Crees for
flow led that this bulb is modeled after
is an 11 watt bulb the new connected LED
is 11 and a half watts that extra half
watt is for the ZigBee radio packed
inside we measured it on our machinery
and found that it was really more like
11.1 watts very very small increase in
wattage for that ZigBee radio so again
Cree's being pretty generous in their
stats there now long-term cree plans to
keep this bulb pretty open and to work
with any hub that has ZigBee built in
that should bring smart things into play
and maybe staples connect but at launch
it's only going to work with the wink
hub which is a smart home platform that
you can find just a few shelves down at
home depot so that makes sense as a
pseudo partnership at launch the actual
controls that we're talking about are
the basic gamut of smart features you
can turn it on and off remotely you can
schedule it to come on automatically or
you can use what wink calls robots to
automate how the bulb operates so if you
want the cree bulb to turn off
automatically when you leave home or
turn on automatically when a motion
detector catches you entering a room you
can set that up on the wing cap that
said I think those smarts are pretty
good pairing the bulb but the wink hub
was really easy and I was happy to see
that because that was a big drawback of
the GE link LED the other big notable
smart ball but you can use on that
platform but the GU link led it took me
several tries to get the bulb pair it up
it was kind of finicky with the Cree
bulbs each bulb paired on the first try
took less than a minute so I'm very
happy with that that's a great result
all in all at $15 per bulb I think this
is going to be a pretty exceptional
value in the smart home category it's
cheap as a smart light as we've seen
tying the GE
iled of 15 bucks and I think that I like
this bolt better just for the fact that
it pairs so much easier with the wink
platform thanks for watching be sure to
