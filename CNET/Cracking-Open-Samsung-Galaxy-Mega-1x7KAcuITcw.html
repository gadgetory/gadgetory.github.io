oversized version of the s4 but is it
well no as I'm going to show you looks
can be deceiving
I'm bill Detweiler and this is cracking
open at nearly three and a half inches
wide and over six and a half inches tall
the Galaxy mega is a monster of a phone
or a small tablet or a phablet
or whatever now luckily like the s4 and
most Samsung phones and tablets have
cracked open disassembling the mega is
relatively easy and doesn't require any
special tools just a Philips triple zero
screwdriver and maybe a thin blade now
thanks to a user replaceable battery the
back cover pops off with just a
fingernail after removing several
Phillips screws you can remove the lower
speaker assembly and then the circuit
board cover with a thin tool or again
your fingernail the Megas overall
internal design is similar to the s4 the
main board is located at the top and a
smaller board at the bottom now after
detaching the lower boards connectors it
can be removed and after removing a
single screw and detaching its
connectors the mainboard and rear camera
come out the last few components to be
removed are the headphone jack earpiece
speaker and sensor assembly and the
front-facing camera like the s for the
Megas front panel display and internal
frame are fused together if one part
breaks you'll likely need to replace the
whole assembly so this is where our
teardown ends now if the mega is so
similar to the s4 in appearance and
overall construction why did I say it's
looks we're deceiving well it all comes
down to hardware the s4 has a quad core
processor two gigs of RAM a 13 megapixel
camera and a screen resolution of 1920
by 1080 the mega is a step behind with a
dual-core processor one and a half gigs
of ram and 8 megapixel camera and twelve
eighty by seven
20 screen resolution the only component
that's actually bigger is the battery
but then again the Megas larger screen
likely necessitates the bigger battery
so why would you want a device that's
really too large to be a phone in my
opinion and has hardware that's less
than cutting edge
well price at release the mega is a
hundred and forty nine dollars compared
to the s4 which is still $1.99 although
some carriers offer slightly better
deals and even when Samsung releases the
Galaxy Note 3 which will likely have
much better Hardware it will likely cost
around $300 so if you're in the market
for a mid-range phablet the mega is
worth a look now for more information on
the Galaxy mega including real world
tests and pricing information check out
