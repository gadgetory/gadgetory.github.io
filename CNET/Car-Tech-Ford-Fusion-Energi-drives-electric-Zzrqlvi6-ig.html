hybrid
that means gets electricity straight
from the grid to drive the wheels let's
take a look at this car that's more
hybrid than a hybrid
the Ford Fusion is a good-looking and
versatile sedan Ford offers it with four
different engines a hybrid version and
this the energy the plug-in hybrid
version now with a hybrid you're
recapturing kinetic energy and storing
it in the battery to drive the wheels
you're not burning up your brake pads
you're actually creating electricity now
with a plug-in hybrid you get all that
but you also can plug this car into the
grid overnight to charge up the battery
here we have this port here this is a
standard J 1772 port you can charge up
the 7.6 kilowatt hour battery in this
car takes about two and a half hours on
a 240 volt outlet seven hours on a
standard wall outlet now a full charge
will get you 21 miles of pure electric
range
that's the EPA number it'll vary
depending on your driving style that
doesn't sound like much but it beats the
range of the Toyota Prius plug-in and
the Honda Accord plugin both come in
about 13 miles now driving the front
wheels is 818 horsepower electric motor
we also have a gasoline engine a 2-liter
four-cylinder gasoline engine that
produces 141 horsepower 129 pound-feet
of torque
those two power sources when mixed
together in this cars transmission get a
total system output of 188 horsepower
now that gets you according to the epa
100 miles per gallon equivalent that's
just using the electric power source or
when driving this car as a hybrid using
the gasoline and electric motor that
gets you about 42 miles per gallon
average now in this 2014 Fusion Energi
the myford touch interface comes
standard we've seen this a lot in
different Ford models different future
models as well so this is a set of four
quadrant paradigm here we have phone in
the upper left we have navigation in
that but right now that's an optional
device we've got an SD card plugged into
an SD port in the console that powers
that we have climate control on the
lower right and entertainment on the
lower left that we got a navigation we
get our map views I've noticed this this
navigation system kind of fills up the
map a little bit slowly else's traffic
and it'll automatically avoid traffic
problems so that's a pretty modern good
system under entertainment we've got of
course audio sources here we've got a
lot of audio sources they're stacked up
neatly along the left side here pretty
easy to get to we got AM
FM HD radio satellite radio still have a
CD player in this counter that hasn't
gone away yet we've got a USB port in
the console here I've got my iPhone
plugged into it right now and then go
down we also have Bluetooth audio
streaming and you could also use that SD
card slot currently used for navigation
for music as well now the phone has the
usual functions here I've got a dial pad
I can go straight to my contact lists
and what's really good in the Ford cars
in general and this Fusion Energi as
well is the voice command system with
voice command I can place any calls via
my contact let's can just say call dad
or something like that and it'll pull up
the number for my contact list
I can ask for music directly from
anything plugged into the USB port so I
can say play Led Zeppelin for example or
in navigation I can enter an address is
a single string that's all pretty good
stuff everything here is mirrored on the
right-hand screen in the instrument
cluster and I control that by this d-pad
here I can see my climate controls here
and I can go up and see what's playing
on music or I can go down to navigation
and get my turn-by-turn directions if I
have a route programmed into the system
and I have a neat little thing because
this is the fusion Energi I've got this
little energy button here so this gets
me some energy screens here this
settings screen actually lets me program
in a charge time so if I had this
plugged in overnight I could say charged
at 2:00 a.m. in the morning or something
when electricity is cheaper even cooler
than this though is on the left side of
the instrument Custer I've got this
pretty detailed screen which shows me a
lot of information about how power is
being used in the car I could also shift
this around and see different things
like a standard trip display different
fuel economy display a lot of things
going on here to monitor how the car is
brought
it's driving just like an electric car
pretty good pickup seller inter feels
good quiet
moving forward and when I hit the brakes
I can see this little display showing me
that I'm recharging the battery and
that's always a little bit gratifying
because I'm gaining miles with that big
battery pack that weighs quite a bit
that actually adds 500 pounds compared
to a standard gas engine toward fusion
and I feel that in the suspension when
I'm going around corners there's just a
little more load on the suspension now
when I run out of my electric range
which I'm almost there dental one mile
and the engine kicks in but I'm really
impressed about is that power hand out
adding the gasoline engine to the power
mix is totally smooth I mean I haven't
noticed really any change in the power
response from the accelerator the power
curve doesn't seem to change much at all
the ride still remains comfortable this
car does a good job of remaining feeling
like a Ford Fusion
so let's price out our 2014 Fusion
Energi in SE trim the base price is
thirty-five thousand five hundred
twenty-five dollars with destination to
do it up CNET style add navigation for
seven hundred and ninety five dollars
that's an SD card that plugs into the
car driver assistance package goes for
one thousand one hundred and forty
dollars that includes blind spot and
lane departure depth of cruise is
another nine hundred and ninety five
dollars the rear view camera is a cheap
two hundred ninety five dollars that
probably should have been standard but
it'll be mandatory in 2016 that puts us
at a total of thirty eight thousand
seven hundred fifty dollars now plug-in
hybrids are kind of odd vehicles they
depend a lot on your working lifestyle
but you have a commute of twenty miles
or less you will spend asset in gas all
week and then on the weekends for the
longer trips you won't have range
anxiety either with that gasoline in</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
