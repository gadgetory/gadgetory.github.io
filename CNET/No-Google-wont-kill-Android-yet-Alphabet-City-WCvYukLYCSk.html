show that covers everything related to
alphabet Inc otherwise known as Google's
parent company I'm your guide I as act
are and you are the wonderful audience
today we're talking about Google getting
into trouble
loon getting a deal and the potential
death of the note but first let's talk
operating systems first up few shovels
remember project fuchsia
that's a mysterious operating system by
Google that runs on phones and laptops
it's not Android and it's not Chrome OS
Bloomberg published a report that says
fuchsia is a plan to create quote a
single operating system capable of
running all the company's in-house
gadgets like pixel phones and smart
speakers end quote the goal for fuchsia
would be to replace Android in about
five years but a roadmap for fuchsia is
not concrete
CNET says there is no five-year plan yet
Google gave us a statement and said
fuchsia is just quote one of many
experimental open-source projects end
quote
so is Android dying soon yeah probably
not
next stop the First National Bank of
alphabet
Google got hit with a massive five
billion dollar fine by the European
Union the European Commission says
Google has committed illegal practices
regarding Android mobile devices to
strengthen dominance of Google search
engine here's what the EC's statement
says in particular Google has required
manufacturers to pre install the Google
Search app and browser app Chrome as a
condition for licensing Google's App
Store the Play Store made payments to
certain large manufacturers and mobile
network operators on condition that they
exclusively pre-installed the Google
Search app on their devices and has
prevented manufacturers wishing to
pre-installed google apps from selling
even a single smart mobile device
running on alternative versions of
android that were not approved by google
so-called android Forks the Commission
decision concludes that Google is
dominant in the markets for general
internet search services licensable
smart mobile operating systems and app
stores for the Android mobile operating
system the statement also says that
Apple's devices cannot indirectly
constraint Google's market power the EC
says Google has 90 days to change their
behavior or we penalize up to 5% of the
average daily worldwide turnover of
alphabet so Google issued a response
like the very serious company that it is
in a tweet Google Europe tweeted Android
has created more choices for everyone
not less blah blah blah
we will appeal the Commission's decision
hash tag Android works Google CEO sundar
Pichai penned a much lengthier post on
the Google Blog it also features the
hash tag Android works
next stop Android Avenue
according to the Bell Samsung is
considering merging the Galaxy S Plus
and Galaxy Note lines
the report says Samsung has been kicking
around the idea for about a year now
why would Samsung go ahead and do this
it's all about the money
one line would reduce costs for
comparison the s9 plus has a six point
two two inch screen the note eight uses
at six point three inch screen they both
have the same resolution by the way both
have six gigabytes of RAM the s9 plus
has a slightly larger battery apart from
a few cosmetic differences the two are
really similar except for that whole
s-pen thing the next note is expected to
debut on August 9th at the Samsung
unpacked event let's head on over to
loon Lane Lunas side to deal with
telecom Kenya to provide Internet
services by balloon because that's what
loon does Luanne just spun out of
alphabets X company X's alphabets

internet service will go live next year
last stop comment Cove
this is a part of the show where we
shine a spotlight on the best audience
of the world
you guys obvious Eze hey what happened
to fuchsia ass from Google is it dead or
under development
Abbi I hope you watched this episode for
the answer rice says I dumped Chrome
browser years ago because it was a
memory hog now they want to make it an
even bigger memory hog I will stick with
edge on the rumor that Microsoft may be
working on an Android phone
Darnell says Microsoft should not make
an Android phone they should make
another Windows Phone instead they need
to make Windows better for a mobile
operating system to make developers to
want to make a sport invest in your own
platform that's a strong stance Darnell

get one Marvin I got that shirt from
Midtown comics thanks to everyone for
