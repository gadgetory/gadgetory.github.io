wearables but it's also got a smart
light bulb it's called a misfit bolt and
it's this color-changing bulb seeing
here the idea is that this light can
help you kind of set the mood if you
want to relax if you want a nice cascade
of blues and greens if you want a
volcanic eruption of reds and oranges
whatever you want this bulb can do now
the bulb itself is really cool looking
it's got this black spiral body it's
very heavy and metallic it looks sort of
like a slug to an alien rocket grenade
they've been playing to it Dexcom but
it's a cool looking thing and I like
that about this bulb the app looks
really good too as you're scrolling
through all these sort of cascading
preset options movie night date night
this forest mode for cascading greens
you've got a very nice appearance there
in the app and it's also very easy to
use you just select one and then you
select the speed at which you wanted to
cycle through the colors what I don't
like is that you want to select a
specific color you're gonna go here to
this color ocean of pixels and that's
not the best way to select the color
dragging your thumb or your finger
across the screen and you're blocking
the colors you're trying to see you
can't see where that bulb icon is
landing it's kind of awkward and
difficult to get to the specific shade
you're aiming for now compared to bulbs
like lifx the mystic bolt is a bit more
dim when you turn it on at its default
setting you're gonna get about 600
lumens of soft white light now you can
change that and get up to the 800 lumens
that this bulb promises by scrolling
through the soft white part of the
spectrum and finding a sort of sweet
spot the colors are also a bit dim you
see here in these comparison shots
that's it on the right it just doesn't
come through quite as bright as lifx in
the middle or philips hue there on the
left it's got a good tone of color it's
hitting those colors accurately it's
just not as bright as the competition
this with bolt retails for 50 bucks you
might be able to find it a little bit
cheaper if you shop around I like that
price for a smart bulb that changes
colors but I like lifx better it's
brighter it's got a better app and
better integrations with IFFT and Amazon
echo I say stick with that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
