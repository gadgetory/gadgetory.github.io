you're a soccer fanatic every one of
those 64 games mean something to you in
a perfect world you're not even watching
this video you're in Brazil watching the
whole thing go down with a beer in one
hand and a contraband vuvuzela on the
other but for the rest of us here are
the top 5 ways to keep up with the cup
as told to me by Cena espanol anessa
hand oriana starting off at number five
social networks a lot of these matches
take place during work hours and unless
your boss is somehow cool with you
watching them at work you're going to
need to keep up with them on the sly
that's where social networks come in
handy the Twitter account for FIFA is a
great place to start but if you really
want to feel like you're in the stands
hashtag Brazil 2014 will give you the
up-to-the-minute trash talk at number
four apps a great way to go if you can
sneak off for an extended lunch break or
lock yourself in the bathroom and fake
some food poisoning download the
Univision app for android or iOS to see
the world cup live and in spanish you
will see the first 54 games without
registration for the last you'll have to
enter your credentials from your TV
provider for english try the watch ESPN
app coming in at number three the web if
you can contain your excitement try
watching the world cup on your web
browser and listen over some headphones
fifa calm Univision or ESPN unplug your
keyboard and just pretend like you're
getting work done just be careful not to
get carried away and start screaming at
your computer the only soccer fan at
work people are just going to assume
you're going crazy my favorite option
comes in at number two a big TV at your
favorite bar let's face it every sport
is made better with beer the trick in
the u.s. is to find a bar that is as
excited about world cup as you are a
British pub makes a solid choice or
better yet just gang up on a bar with a
bunch of your friends and ask the
bartender to change the channel so long
as you and your friends are drinking you
can probably have your run of the place
and finally the number one way to watch
world cup on a 4k TV 2014 is the first
year that the World Cup we broadcast in
4k resolution twice the resolution at
1080p and usually on it
be big enough to crush a small family
really one of the only situations where
4k is justified since lets you see every
detail on every player down to their
shoelaces of course you may as well call
this the find a rich friend option as
the prices on 4k TVs are still
ridiculously high worst case find a big
box electronic store and bring a lawn
chair and a cooler of beer and if you're
lucky a disgruntled employee may let you
hang out for a game or two so there you
go five options for watching the world
cup either secretly at work or drunk
with your friends I'm Donnell belen for
