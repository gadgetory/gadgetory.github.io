hey what's up everybody welcome to the
for horse show my name is Jeff Bakalar
I'm joined by Russ brush dick actually
he could not be here today it is I
Barney he would you think of his Bernice
hello Justin yeah Justin what do you
what do you think do you think this is
where the country is going I think you
said Barney that doesn't sound like it's
born at all
yeah it does sort of sound like you're
swallowing your words I feel like this
is the last time that I will be a
relevant person so if ever I had to make
this voice it is now and now alone the
best part about all this is that Russ is
like sitting on this Bernie Sanders
thing not telling anyone that he's gonna
be whipping it out it just like starts
going in like Gary areas this is what I
can say I need to be in control of my
own future and if that means bashing
ahead and through anyone that stands in
my white Soviet Soviet if it's Justin if
it's Geoffrey he would call me Geoffrey
first sure that's what I would say how
long are you gonna let this I know I the
top of the podcast what's funny cuz like
remember when I used to come on and do
those like ridiculous Michael Caine
Michael Caine was good this is Bernie
I'm sorry don't you have to be in
Philadelphia yes goodbye I need to be
speaking soon I will be playing Pokemon
while I'm in Philadelphia Mew is there I
don't approve of him he goes over the
150 original Pokemon Bernie what did you
think about a Trump speech yesterday
where he was welcoming all of your
previous followers to his camp yeah you
know what to them where they're gonna go
to Hillary now good you gotta go it over
here like Larry
if you're not collecting pidgeys right
now and saving them for your lucky egg
you are doing it wrong well he knows a
lot of it I'm surprised how much Mr
Sanders knows about Pokemon goes what
can I say I started with Pokemon red
yellow Nixon no no like a JFK thing yeah
yeah yeah
all right Bernie you take care with
Montana Philly hey Russ come in come in
oh hey guys what's up who's that guy you
see you see do you pass by senator
Bernie no I saw someone with white hair
looking down at his phone Oh was he
chasing a Bulbasaur he might have been
Justin you on the program today just
used back in action hey what's up duuude
here's my thing about Pokemon go okay
why why doesn't the app the characters
in the app why don't they make the same
sound as they did in the TV show what do
you think it's saying that they don't
say their own names well I don't think
they want to pay for the voice acting
yeah but I thought if it was owned by
the same company that put out the first
TV show voice well you got to know you
would have to pay those actors again you
already know more about Pokemon than I
do I don't even think in the games they
say well no they do in the games they
say them now originally they just went
so they could afford its own Game Boy
that's all they could handle it's all
the bandwidth could afford um so today's
been a week it's been a thing today it's
been a week I'm sorry this week's been a
week it's been a week as of 7 degrees
outside Jeff's face sufferable dude how
are you wearing pleasing studio
how's your week on it's going pretty
well yeah I've been exposed to a lot of
Pokemon I'm not playing Pokemon myself
which I feel like Jeff you and I might
be the only people in the office that
are not playing it I'm surprised about
because I know a lot of people that
didn't play the game boy game and didn't
watch a TV show but just but are now
getting into Pokemon go as they're older
which is weird
weird yeah we're the same age I'm Russ
we're all no 32 no that's what I'm
saying is that there's
wait you're 32 now oh no 32 no that's
what I'm saying
so oh so that sort of defeats my heart
he proves my point
yeah okay so there was but that we were
all sort of on that borderline window
where it's like if you were a little bit
younger a hundred percent yeah
and Jeff was far too old I mean you know
far too far too old the pipe bug lunge
how old are you now I'm a 32 going on 33
in October yeah Warren it might have
been the cutoff maybe yeah sure if you
want to assign a specific age to it I
love Pokemon I think this is all great I
play it every day hmm my now wife and I
literally walked a target a target
opened in our neighborhood recently
literally walked the target just cuz
like it was a good excuse to catch
pokemon yeah doesn't have enough people
stopping in the middle of the sidewalk
to look at their phones so I'm really
happy to put yeah thanks for being part
of the problem no problem
nothing like a variable suddenly changed
directions in front of me well I have a
high end Pokemon I'm trying to capture I
stand to the side yeah let people go I'm
not standing in the middle I am a New
Yorker at heart yeah I'm also a polka
maniac so like those two things are not
mutually exclusive right like you just
want to punch him right you're like
actually punching in the face
they were here first man yeah they were
here first they're the original they're
the natives all right so we obviously
don't want to spend any more time
talking about that speaking of things
that are going out of style real soon
like real soon Justin you wrote a story
on seeing it about the last VCO oh yeah
it's like the last he the last of the
Mohicans in other news VCRs have been
manufactured for the past 30 years
apparently I had no idea until I was
researching the story but it's true
the last remaining VCR manufacturer
which happens to be in Japan they
distribute I think to companies like
sanyo okay another news Sanyo is still a
company I do yeah they're called I
forget what they're called Funai
electric isn't a Japanese company and
it's weird because VHS tapes cassette
tapes are still going to get
manufactured just like this still make
regular audio cassette tapes okay it's
er that you can no longer on what are
you what are they
VHS tapes Bank no yeah yeah they're
blank and so you can tape your soap
operas everyday okay
so the follow-up question of that is if
let's say I feel like there's archivists
and stuff like that that might need a
VHS so essentially they're just gonna be
repairing the old ones that exist yeah
yeah I think so okay so they're like
pinball machines at this point I feel
like look at the story there I think it
was around 300 no no I'm sorry 750,000
that were sold last year which is really
a worldwide number yeah but see oh that
is like you wrote the word only but it's
like you should've built with a with I
can't believe this 3,500 no 750 that's a
lot man I guess so for a day how many
beta tapes are being what was the last
time you even seen a VHS player 50,000
like we you would kill for that number
yeah that is so amazing I can't believe
that
how are you sure that's right that's
true wow that seems unlikely
you said there been steadily declining
over the last few decades right know
what the peak was that's obvious yeah
fifteen million units a year it's okay
for me yeah I still think this is a lot
who are these people who are the only
proposed last time you've even seen a
VHS tape that was a life story I've seen
uh weirdo
whenever here's where you see them when
you rent places right oh yeah yeah it's
like a summer home yeah right four by
three TV yeah Sound of Music
VHS by the way and then they just have
like Brazil on VHS for some reason
you're like all right I guess I'm gonna
watch Brazil right now well there was a
remember that was an app that got really
popular last year that made anything you
record on your phone yeah but that's not
gonna come around to where vinyls come
around
yeah there's no legacy where it's like
this was really the best quality there
is no sort of novelty yeah using but
yeah
whew those like throwbacks like that
Donald Trump movie that Funny or Die did
run shot like it was a VHS mm right a
lot of this a lot of a dose and stuff
yeah
so all right that's the story with that
last of the vh VCRs are relevant at all
in August so I guess blu-ray is still
like the thing that for physical media
is that it for physical media it's gotta
me is this the end that's what we done
with this dear God let us be done how on
earth does it make sense to continue to
make physical media like you would need
something that increases in fidelity so
outrageously that you no one has the
harddrive space for it but even that's a
sense the cloud would make more sense it
does not make sense for these intangible
things it makes me so huge it all zeros
and ones to be held on to write like on
your purse unless it's a collecting
issue which a lot of people do collect
movie that's do they do but like that is
kind of going away too
okay well I know like I mean in the same
way that like all I listen to now is
spot of a stuff on Spotify
like I don't listen oh I get it any
physical stuff I haven't bought a
physical piece of music in probably a
deck I haven't even bought a digital
piece of music and probably a decade
because I also a piece of streaming
services for the streaming service but
like that's not the same as going to
iTunes and buying an album I don't do
that it is not it is not and that's
where things are going
I feel very happy that I never like
bought into the blu-ray thing I bought
in the DVD thing a little bit I did I
jumped in part yeah I bought like a
hundred DVDs
real maybe not like a keeper now there
are no movies that I want to re-watch
that many times because it's so easy to
watch a new movies and then right so
it's like overload of content and choice
right the hassle of like getting up and
putting something in I realize that's
lazy and stupid I just remember it's so
much easier just use a remote it's so
funny you bring that out like for a very
long time my brain was fixated on the
problems of physical media and how like
how do we leave e8 yeah how do we like
get rid of like the of like I was like
wait so my dad had a five DVD disc
changing right mmm oh it's like a
frickin gun it's like a revolver like a
bullet chamber for the 300 discs each I
had that like outrages through it that's
really cool
no I had a Sony 200 CD disc change cool
and like you could go in and program
each slot ya know so like what you did
was we put in like the names of stuff so
there was a point where like some CDs
were made with there's like a little
logo on the jewel case called like CD
text and like that would send metadata
to player yeah so you could be like oh
this is Red Hot Chili Peppers right so
like I remember so the thing I had had
that Tech in it but like only an eighth
of the CDs I had damn so it like so
it'll be like give us an hour and we'll
check off you like let it run its course
and you're like alright you stopped to
fill in a hundred and eighty
you know maybe CDs I'm like screw this
I'm not doing that you know anybody that
had one of those multi-disc changers in
their car yes yeah not 50 but I had ten
I think I tend it's not very much yeah
yeah my mom in the trunk yeah oh no so
my mom had a 2004 Jeep Cherokee that had
it in the glove box
oh no it was in the middle divider oh
yeah you lift it up lift it up and you
could just take the the magazine in and
then to my stupid-ass car I had a 1999
cougar mercury cooler that that's the
stuff I've just changed was in this
freaking trunk you're done after like a
week and you just like how to open a
door redic and I finally like replaced
the head unit and at least you had the
multi one I had the single disc and then
the - my sleeve yeah you talked about I
was talking about laziness and I feel
like the epitome of that is was this
purchase I just made for the echo which
I bought during Amazon Prime I talked
about it prime day whatever where it's
literally I've gotten to the point where
I'm too lazy to switch inputs on my TV
and pull up my Spotify app to play
Spotify through the PlayStation 4 I just
want to talk and have music be presented
to me like that's how lazy so what did
you more I bought an echo ok and and
like I'm it comes today I'm very excited
I will report back to see whether it's
changed my life
Jeff is very jealous oh that's super
jealous I just think like why would you
say I'm jealous cuz I'm you said you
won't yeah you said you wanted one yeah
I don't know do you have one of those no
I don't but you don't have to go in and
sort of specify like what you all your
favorite orders are or yours just say
you assign so you log in as I understand
it you log in through the app into your
Spotify account and once you do that
once the the echo knows oh this is your
Spotify account so then you can just say
hey Alexa yeah play sting fields of
barley yeah
which I'll be doing non-stop I'm
learning a lot of that should've been a
discover playlist a few months back and
it really made just who's discovering
sting apparently Spotify wants me to
discover do you have your entire music
library in your head where you can just
conjure if you want to just like look at
your library and just click on so the
way I listen to Spotify is like oh hey I
want to hear whatever I was listening to
the mountain goats this morning I want
to hear the mountain goats so I can
literally just be like hey wax have
played me the mountain goats and I could
specify an album if I wanted right you
specify a song you can specify a song I
don't know how it works with like like
if there's multiple songs with the same
name whether it asks you or how that all
works but yeah I'm gonna I'm gonna be
messing around with it this weekend a
very cool and it's lazy and it but it is
the most like demolition man thing I own
or will own right you walk into the
hotel room and you could be like lights
on yeah welcome John Spartan use the
three seashells
I do morning mode two right where you
have like soft music playing yeah yeah
so apparently I heard that apparently I
heard yeah that's what I heard um the
tap oh yeah they're making a new one
that's why they don't sell me
so the tap is like just the puck I
wonder what their changing oh no the dot
 I don't this is the yeah yeah right
so that echo so there's an echo it's a
full size one the tap which is like a
portable one like the size of a water
bottle yeah and then the dot is just
Alexa in a hockey puck yeah and like you
can put like uh you know you put into
everything into something yeah okay so
what's the water bottle one day that's
like a portal you bring that to the
beach yeah that's the one that's like a
wireless Bluetooth speaker that you
bring anywhere but it works with voice
yeah it's got a battery in his got
better but it yeah so that's that it's
weird yeah yeah I want that I wanna so I
want the brain you don't mean like I
wanted the dot right but I want that to
be easily synced with something that's
like kind of always on and again like my
biggest hang-up was I don't want an echo
because I don't want to play the music
out of that shitty speaker yeah I don't
think it's that shape look you're the
bars low I can't bars low yeah your your
sonically handicap music think of how
much money that saved me like I can
listen to streaming it doesn't bother me
I can Street garbage music if you
actually do you have bad no ears no but
I'm not picky
so like I don't need to listen to one
one 60s ABS yeah is mp3
I think it's average at best no I know
people that listen in 96 to consider Oh
savages yeah yeah I wonder what Spotify
screams out I have no idea
Spotify I think high-quality streams at
3:20 yeah yeah okay uh but yeah so we'll
put well we'll get off that Amazon let
me know how it is because if it's cool
and my people do up - yeah right you
want to go in on that yes but it you get
it Mondays and Wednesdays joint custody
does that work done ah
let's talk about Facebook you guys
remember a while back
Mark Zuckerberg had these like super
lofty ambitions of bringing Internet to
like vastly remote places on earth
I also remember he wanted to kill his
own meal
remember that little bit I was like
flirting with that lifestyle for a while
and then he's like wait a minute I'm a
billionaire
I could have people cook things for me I
could yeah this is a little bit it's
similar though because he's trying to
bring to third-world countries bring the
Internet and they might have to kill
their own meal yeah sure if that's how
you want to you know so he's bridging
the gap suss it out so they secretly
kind of did this test launch of a drone
Oh God
that will hopefully one day be able to
deliver internet service mmm Wi-Fi to
extremely remote places on earth okay so
they're calling the drone akela so it's
AQ u ila akela it's got the wingspan of
a regular jet but it's like a full-size
jet yeah well that's it it's kind of
just the wings okay oh it looks like a
looks like a bee - yeah yeah crazy but
there's like nothing there and it does
kind of have like missile e looking
things which is I guess a little
upsetting but anyway that's gonna bring
Wi-Fi to my office you're gonna deliver
Wi-Fi it's really scary and they won't
know it is almost like a predatory
looking sort of drone anywhere that this
flies above like they're not gonna know
they're gonna think they're about to get
bombed well you know here's why they
won't know because this thing is
supposed to fly 60,000 feet oh that's
very high above the surface of the earth
which is roughly twice the cruising
altitude of a normal commercial jet you
might still be able to see that though
up just the wings that's gonna be tough
seriously how does this distribute Wi-Fi
so that the tech behind that is kind of
still top secret okay but what's really
cool is that they want to have these
drones going up in like fleets and the
drones will communicate over laser
communication okay okay
so now so it's like a satellite but low
satellite connected yeah a little lower
satellite connected 60,000 feet altitude
drone Wi-Fi delivery service okay now
just think about how freaking sci-fi
crazy that sounds
right yes they not only that they're
hoping these drones can fly for three
months at a time yeah
that's not surprising no drone has ever
even come close to that little bit
drones that they're using now I have
like all sorts of like cameras and bombs
and stuff in them right much heavier so
these are solar powered right obviously
they use the same power that three hair
dryers were draw yeah okay yeah but it
doesn't dry your hair no not from that
height look Facebook they can't do every
now there are limits it's insane they
had only planned to test this for 30
minutes but there you wind up going
three times longer
I guess cuz they were just having so
much fun to an hour and a half bombing
internet to everybody ah yeah really
really crazy unbelievable kind of
fantastical stuff how would they like it
lasted three times longer than what they
thought it would last no it wasn't like
Hanukkah that's what I thought no they
just had only planned for 30 minutes but
they wound up there like fun we got a
mood meeting pushback I feel like we
were making this for three years I kind
of want to get a little bit of more of
our money's worth Google has talked
about doing very similar things with
blimps very similar idea like a Zeppelin
why does f-1 Wi-Fi thing and to give
access to the Internet to like third
world countries and also countries where
they had like a natural disaster yeah so
all the wires and stuff per hour would
be cut but this is an access although I
guess you would need the power whatever
device you are using
I just want to know like why this is the
best solution for this well because at
Facebook as a company it bent it
benefits them dramatically they have
more people connected especially people
connect oh no no I understand own I
understand the reason to bring Internet
look I'm saying why is it through drones
why is that them what's the alternative
yeah I don't know obviously the they
find this to be the most cost efficient
if you're
running a wire you can like zero like
signal to like a seagull that doesn't
seem like that's a lot of seagulls so
yeah really cool like I saw this sounds
like wow ah
color me impressed yeah yeah you guys
see the I think they put out a new
design for the New York subway cars
really no not to take away from this
story but this this story kind of feels
like it's closer to home yeah I guess I
think people know they're gonna have
Wi-Fi on the subway cause I was thinking
like if they have this why don't they
happen on the subways right it's
actually coming I mean they do have it
in stations they have yes yeah so like
and I get actually a cell signal almost
my entire commute in you know it's all
underground yeah so they have that but
you're saying it'll be in the cars yeah
I guess they're gonna have Wi-Fi inside
the cars where you're traveling okay and
then they're also gonna have power
outlets inside the car oh that USB port
not a good idea not a good idea cuz we
don't have fights enough fights in New
York City well it's also gonna be like
people are gonna that's gonna be the new
like Starbucks where someone's just
gonna like camp out yeah in a but like
how long are you on the subway for well
if you wanted to be on there all day
jump on that ac3 right exactly
free air conditioning and Wi-Fi and
power yeah go it's like a little mobile
office for you I heard a funny story
I'll tell you about that right after
this quick break the four for show is
supported by city cards with Android pay
how cool is it that we live in a world
where you can use the same device to
listen to our fine program and buy your
morning coffee groceries and more and
did I mention it's a super fast way to
pay just use your city card with Android
pay at the register get in get it get
going download the Android pay app on
Google Play or visit city comm slash
Android pay to get started Android pay
is available for eligible CD consumer
credit and debit cards so I was watching
the news and they were talking about the
Staten Island Ferry and now they've had
to deactivate all of the outlets on the
boats oh no because these asshole
people are fighting each other like like
animal to recharge to get access like
you're on the boat for how long
yeah I don't actually know how long to
think to get this thing I don't know 15
minutes okay so they go so they're
interviewing someone who who witnessed a
fight and the kids like yeah people are
super stun like one guy's like oh I've
got 50% you've got ten yeah it's like
what a nightmare just jump off the boat
just get out well here's what I would do
no ticket when I when I travel I always
bring a multi-port plug with me so I I
will always be able to get a plug when
I'm waiting in the terminal because I
can just say hey I have this and we'll
both plug into it and then everything's
good they'll be like no you're you're
you're splitting mice my juice that's a
great hack right great let you bring it
like an entire power strip no it's it's
a mini travel power strip essentially
like two inches long they're like it's
yeah it's got like three plugs in it it
has USB chargers and on the side of it
love it I read you're such a peacemaker
yeah well I bet you save situations all
the time well I'm not a peacemaker cuz
the it's all about just benefiting me
which is to say I always have a plug
because I just go onto any blog and be
like hey I'm gonna use this if do you
even say anything or you know I just
unplug at least I'd be like hey I got
this thing has anyone ever said no I
know it's never no one's ever said I
don't just anyone ever been like all
right they do sometimes they look at me
weird but like they won't say no because
whatever who are they care yeah do you
ever see people in New York plugging
into the bottom of lightness people and
all that's meant for a construction
where kind of comes off all of them in
saying I don't like that I don't like
that those panels come off so easier
like you could hide in there yeah I
don't like that it's like a good dead
drop spot it is a good geocaching spot
yeah that worries me and also those
random ass gas canisters that just sit
on the sidewalk hydrogen tank we got to
the bottom of that before we meet me out
it seems like but I know they look like
helium take a look like that man yeah
traps
so all right I think I'm gonna guess
because I think I remember okay if you
walk around in New York sometimes you'll
see just on the sidewalk maybe three or
four giant gasp like maybe hundred all
you can do is type NYC space in the I
yeah and what came up is if I should
mention tanks on the street going back
to 2008 and it's got the Miss post okay
and yeah here's a recent one from July
last year they actually say liquid
nitrogen
yes so here's what I think and I'm not
gonna read this I'm pretty sure it's too
cool something underground hmm are they
plugged into something yeah yeah they're
not just chilling out I thought they
were just chilling they're just chilling
out acting like a light post testicles
okay just like just trying to do
anything why would they need
construction or something down there
yeah so here's what it is it's
pressurized it's a pressurized system to
keep cables dry when repairs are going
on because there's too much steam okay
so it's kinda in the ballpark okay
you're terrifying though yeah like they
so own so then there's also like the
weird air monitoring things in Subway's
yeah ever seen that I've seen those yeah
those I don't know that's what they are
like it's like subway air monitor air
maybe they're air filters I don't know
it's not showing up as easily but like
there are these weird things in the
subway yeah that look like they're
testing for like biological attacks and
they're labeled they're not labeled they
have like my PD stickers on them okay
but they're not like the sell your
things that hang from the ceiling no
okay
no I can't pull anything out here that
falls in line with that but that's not
the best feeling when you see those no
that's scary
those aren't fun yeah they're
weird-looking machines they almost look
like the overhead display of like the
transparency sheets and you've seen high
school that's kind of what they look
like if that makes sense yeah yeah real
we're with the neck yeah it's weird
all right so we covered some stuff there
that was fun uh
Ivonne Musk back in the news as he does
once or twice a month
he has a vision for the future yes or
Tesla's vision for the future Russ what
do you know phase 2 for Elon Musk
I believe that's what there are we are
we at phase 2 for him well it's just
starting phase - yes phase 1 was a huge
success with just the SEC you made a
bunch of money selling electric cars and
launching things into space there you go
master plan part deux was the title of
this post and the big focus is
essentially on solar power specifically
for homes so his plan is to essentially
build solar panels that'll just sit on
your roof and power your entire house
now I think if anyone were to say this
anyone other than him were to say this
we'd be like yeah okay sounds great man
but like dude came through with part one
dude came through so he envisions a
fully autonomous solar-powered future
yes which makes so much sense the Sun is
used for everything it's the reason
we're here is reason there's plants and
trees and all this other - look at
all the waste right now all it's been
doing is giving us skin cancer we might
as well like get some Ben tell me about
it so I feel like what like so so so
what is so he says be hey remember that
plan I played out ten years ago I'm
almost done right what else am I still
think I'm worth it saving the planet
right this is kind of crazy so he claims
that he's at the final stages of his
10-year master plan and he just I mean
the fact that he figured out a way to
make like his cars relatively like
reasonably priced always low-end low-end
is cheap the low-end is cheap right
that's what I'm saying falls in line
with the cheaper so if you're looking
for this net like this technology
clearly he knows how to put these pieces
together where it's not out of reach of
normal man especially when you factor in
oh I'm gonna save X number of dollars on
heating and cooling cost you know I I
believe that I think you could pull it
off and that'd be pretty crazy it'd be
very crazy if we all of a sudden just
kind of unplugged off the grid and like
everyone while everyone's their own grid
everyone's their own grid yeah
like are we gonna live to see that I
think so you share yeah why not well I
mean if you're in an apartment you would
have to share I feel like I feel like
the future that we'll see like when
we're senior citizens is like the Power
Cell future yeah we're like you can hold
on to power like I'll bring these Power
Cells with you and like they'll last a
week right do you know I mean like yeah
they called this backpack as a Power
Cell backpack I mean but we already have
like I'm not saying week but we have
like we have okay stuff sure I think to
me the least impress a least impressive
but I think the room for improvement
lies in batteries we're like yeah
Internet's pretty fast kind of we're
kind of yeah we're bad good fidelity
graphical fidelity we're getting to a K
and then that's kind of like the ceiling
right I guess energy power yeah like Oh
Apple watch home Leslie it's
yeah like we're not at that like to me
that's the next great evolution yeah
your your cell phone should last as long
as your Kindle does right and like the
Kindle no lis reason that's the case is
because the Kindle not using name it's
not using any pound you know yeah you
want to go like weeks at a time yeah
like I really think like that's where
we're headed and we're like a very
interesting Power Cell future like
they'll unlock something and I you know
I think whether it's solar whether it
might be like a who knows if it's like a
micro fusion thing that knows what it is
yeah but like they'll figure it out make
it portable and that's what the new
energy commodity will be and then the
weapon to beat that all down as clouds
like a lot of clouds right someone that
eyes in and like seats the class like no
more solar no more sweet sweet solar any
although guess what what that it goes
through clouds does it as potent lee
though biodome biodome no it goes
through and it makes it through high so
you know I'm not moving anytime soon but
I'm moving within maybe five years out
of ho
here I want the house I move into to
have like a solar ready situation I
guess any house can be retrofitted to
support that yeah but like when I move I
would really almost pay extra yeah be in
a solar situation guess what Jeff you
can't I know but like I look at we look
at a lot of houses just you know sort of
leisurely and and you know prospectively
but we don't you don't see that yeah
like I feel like no one's selling their
awesome super solar-powered house yeah
cuz it's not there's no like mass-market
solution right now I feel like it's a
lot of like small companies kind of
forcing it and but if Tesla got in the
game and then as we've seen with other
car companies trying to like chase Tesla
you know these all these big companies
start getting in that game then yeah I
think it becomes like more of the norm
so are you did you understand anything
else that he laid out cuz it's not just
about power right that's true it's not
just about power he said something about
he was talking about yeah try transport
I'm like upgrading transport systems
where you know we've been talking a lot
about autonomous vehicles and how we're
not there yet but like his end goal was
to essentially get there and to cut down
on accidents and stuff like that almost
entirely like they basically would never
happen cuz everything is fully
autonomous yeah and again like this has
I would say way even more problems than
the power idea of making it happen
because you have to factor in like all
the people that would be like I want to
drive my own car yeah and the legacy
people the legacy people who we should
just put on a boat somewhere something
so yeah on a boat have a like a you can
have like a Disney World but it's like
oh I can drive my Subaru here and only
here and then once you leave the Disney
World sorry back to riding in style and
not getting car accidents anymore yeah
of all the places to have this
conversation in the world I had it in my
hockey locker room we were talking about
like what how long is this gonna take
for that for this to happen and so like
the question I like to ask people or
like just you know bring up was like oh
well Dylan will Dylan have a driver's
license all right like will he grow up
and have a driver's license and I feel
like here
who is a year and three months old yeah
he's like the perfect candidate yeah
maybe that generation that sure won't I
think he might I think like I think it
also depends on where you grow up right
like where you're raised and what your
economical situation is and what your
social situation is but I think based on
like what his life and where he's like
wait are you saying that they would just
stop giving our drivers licenses
entirely I don't know or like what would
that look like like what will it what
will it be like when we when we were 16
17 you got your permit then you got your
license I was that any kids not always
not always it but that that's what I'm
saying where it depends on where you go
up sure I think for him if you're
comparing it to the conventional like
suburbia you know yeah turn 16 you start
your permit and then you get your
license right I don't know if that's
gonna be the norm anywhere will it be
like we're only certain kids decide to
get it where it's like not everyone gets
it cuz now no one needs it because my
family has an autonomous car so I don't
need it
like right you know what I mean yeah but
you could still theoretically knee I
feel like 15 years from now you're still
gonna need some level of knowledge of
how to maybe drive a car
maybe I mean a lot changes in just three
years yeah that's true I don't know and
I again like we've talked that we've
beaten this topic to death but it's like
and a fully autonomous driving situation
will take a massive overhaul of the
infrastructure of of what this country
looks like do you think that before
Dylan graduates high school you will be
putting him into an autonomous car and
letting it drive him place and maybe
without you in it maybe I feel like 15
years for that isn't it enough he no but
I would I know but like you wouldn't you
feel more safe to have an autonomous
vehicle than your 15 year old son you
driving the car here I would because
you'll because they'll be data by then
where it's like robots only kill six
people right right teenagers kill for
forty thousand and you're like what the
hell am I even thinking about yeah weird
dark future get ready for it it's
happening it's coming it's he
well what does anything freak you like
I'm really freaked you out yeah having
kids oh wow I mean come on
why you got one the oven no definitely
not I thought I know what about you rest
no not that I just got married
gratulations by the way buddy thank you
very much it's done it's done I'm
wearing the shackle or am i riding in a
shackle yeah that's fine I do I have
been taking it off I feel like everyone
has tips for rings and like one person
was like you never take it off just
leave it on all the persons wrong person
gave a lot of weight and can't remove it
and they get rashes on their finger and
they're allergic to that metal yeah this
or they don't yeah clean it enough or
whatever so alright a record I've never
clean my ring not once
I mean I've watched you take it off but
I've wash also washed my hands with it
on so therefore it's clean I did isn't
there like a metal that's like
antibacterial like copper or something I
don't think there's like a metal out
there that's just like kills germs there
is because sometimes they use it for a
bathroom handles because it kills germs
right on the bathroom handle it's like I
don't know a middle germ cleaning middle
yeah
killing metal maybe uh this is telling
us how to clean metal yeah no I think
there are metal there is metal that does
that you're saying like a germ resistant
metal yeah see that heavy metal toxicity
and resistance not getting to where you
need to be no bad bad googling only get
the only good the Parral ago dynamic
effect what is that oh yeah this might
be it it that thing I just said raptured
Oh silver spoons self sanitizer yeah
there you go due to the only god dynamic
effect
I think that's holy good dynamic
probably the root of oligarchy meaning
rich or head of state this is kind of
crazy kids we're on earthing something
so the metals react with feel and a mean
they have groups of enzymes or proteins
a mode of action to which micro
organisms may develop resistance
so silver and brass you can just leave
out you could poop on a silver spoon and
the poop just vanishes Wow
that's science science is amazing I go
over to your place and then they kind of
go through like a bunch of elements here
and there's a bunch of stuff that
doesn't that that can do it
zinc tin zinc oxide is used as well
that's what I didn't know that know that
I want to know about so so I I've had my
dermatological issues over the last six
months as everyone's aware and I feel
like every time I come here we talk
about dermatology I know so like I ask
me or do you guys know it's just a
coincidence I am we haven't brought up
in a couple shows okay so I had a follow
up again for my leg and the doctors like
this looks great it's healing real nice
you're looking good I'm like cool I go
how I go lay it on me doc like what's
the deal should I not go into that like
what's the deal with the Sun and me yeah
yeah and I'm like is that 15 minute burn
thing a real thing he's like no that's
 oh really
yeah he's like you don't be in the Sun
at all doesn't watch yeah he's like it's
not about it doesn't take 15 minutes for
your skin to mutation so makes like the
second the Sun touches Oh God it's like
the second you're in the Sun it's doing
things to you yeah so I'm like so even
I'm like is the radiation so I told them
I'm a shadow jumper we're like I just I
am a shadow hopper you'll cross the
street and and like it's really tough
because there's only a very sweet spot
in the morning we're like once I was
fully covered okay for me I have to
constantly because I don't start walking
till like nine o'clock yeah sure
I feel like constantly yeah be moving
move like you're looking for pro-gay
stops sure you need an umbrella so I am
so I did bring an umbrella I have one in
my bag now where like I've had to use it
a few times where I'm just like look
that is a long-ass corridor there's no
shade yeah I am F so it's you and it's
like HBase don't have as much hair on my
head as I used to like you pop your
heads a problem oh yeah it's it's a
thing it got eliminate all your black
t-shirts from this season it's not a
problem
but that it does but like I the Sun so
yeah not in the Sun the black shirt
doesn't do anything yeah so you
dermatologist actually told you not to
he said never go in the Sun now he said
you should wear sunscreen every day
regardless in the winter - in the winter
- although we are the sun's a little
further away but like you do that I
don't know winter no no see right now so
I so I put on moisturizer that has it in
it but isn't like a 5 it's like 15 yeah
so I was asking them and I'm asking
people who are listening
I need like at least 30 yeah so baked
into a moisture while you just do
moisturizer and 30 because then I would
look like Casper I can't do that I go on
camera too much I can't do that yeah so
I need to find this kind of solution and
when I saw this thing on this you know
freaking Oleg isn't wholly good yeah how
do you say that holy guard them dynamic
Oleg oligo dynam a legal dynamic sounds
about right
they're talking about zinc and zinc is
one of the ingredients in a lot of
sunscreens okay yeah I don't know not
really relevant to the burning situation
I'm just saying like I know but he's
scared the out of me yesterday when
he's like no dude it's it's all the time
so does he just go in like like a a
sheet he was wearing a hazmat suit yeah
let me said that to me I mean it's I I
think about that stuff a lot because I'm
obviously very pale and I also like
whenever I go to the beach I'm just like
shade 100% yeah there is no moment I'm
just like ah the sun's hitting me it's
not fun it's just too high he said the
best thing is shade she's bought my
girlfriend and I bought this really
really cool Sun tent that you can bring
to gauge well cool is relative going
it's awesome
well yeah you look a total dork when
you're yeah it's inside of it but it's
awesome
you can unfold it it you know it's maybe
the size of like a windshield shade so
it's design what is it unfold and it's
basically like a like a camping tent but
half of it is open sure you could just
crawl inside and and have a makeshift
cave for yourself cool and you don't
have to worry about the Sun hitting you
it's a very comfortable way to enjoy the
beach
that's what you guys look I like that I
like that and now I get super paranoid
with the little guy you know he's like a
little marshmallow I'm like oh god don't
toast yourself right so what we just we
just turn them upside down lather up and
like a fondue yeah just dip dip them
right off terrible for parents in the
summertime that have to wear those baby
Beorn's just to have like this hot rock
again oh my god it's crazy like this
other thing that's 98 yeah I guess I
never thought about you know we don't
weird but dipping him in that's how
Achilles was made and that's why he had
a weak point on his ankle right as he
was dipped and we hold his big toe we
all combined so that's his weakness yeah
so we just did that and then he gives us
the thumbs up when he's running out of
air and then we just pulled my up it's a
it's actually a really seamless process
on man
yes he's so funny when we put him when
we put all the sunscreen on him because
he's this little white baby he's just a
little whiter
he's very white so I wanted speaking of
ghosts I want to talk about the ghost
he's in the bus these yeah no idea what
you guys ghostbusters
okay a film so the original the so the
review so when we talked about it again
I know this is like the 83rd time in a
row we're talking about this yeah well
you brought it up what do I want to say
about it I just want this so the reviews
have not been enormous ly glowing
they're like bees it's like bees yeah
bee bee - etc for comedy it really needs
to be pretty glowing for me to go and I
just like have no like after having read
a bunch of reviews even the positive
ones I just have no desire because all
the reviews are just like yeah it's a
fun time right there's like no passion
behind any of the conviction or write
ever it's because people are afraid to
have an opinion about this movie and I
don't think that's what no I think like
all of the controversy has just
compromised everything like you know but
like but I don't you don't think you
think it's a great movie and people are
afraid to say no I agree I don't think
that I just think like people are just
treading lightly I think it's probably a
fun summer movie to go to but not
obviously better than the original right
well the
yeah but I'm not I'm not expecting now
like I'm not either and I don't think
anyone's trying to do that yeah I think
they're just you know it's fine I get it
like I want to see the movie I'm gonna
see you tonight I guess I just don't
have a lot of passion for movies and
particular especially like where they
bring back old franchises to the point
where it's like well if this movie's bad
I'm just gonna be like so pissed at them
know like the last time I felt that it
doesn't happen often it happens a couple
times
Batman the third Batman movie in the
Chris Nolan movies I was pretty pissed
off it wasn't that bad it wasn't that
bad but I was disappointed I was
disappointed with the two but I still
thought it was pretty good as Batman and
Indiana Jones for then we were the last
two times that I was like you know what
enough but like for the most part I just
don't
I like remain very zen about it and the
reviews come out there I don't have it I
just won't go or I'll see it on Netflix
or I'll see it on whatever and like I'm
just I'm totally fine with that I have
been hearing enormous ly good stuff
about one movie like consistently from
multiple people the Weiner documentary
yes Todd Solondz movie I didn't know he
directed it yeah I believe he did Wow so
it's called wiener dog what really I
think it's called weird this was called
Weiner
no waiter dog yeah yep Todd Solondz wait
no that's not a documentary though it's
not a documentary no I'm talking about
something else
oh I'm talking about Anthony we wait
yeah no you manners yeah this is an
actual dachshund movie yeah yeah yeah oh
okay now I've no no relation that's
funny that we just did that that is I
guess Weiner is blowing apology you
really like this day talking about the
the Anthony Anthony Weiner documentary
which is supposed to be like one of the
best documentary here not I don't
believe he was like sort of supporting
it I think they just did it yeah he let
them into their his life I take that all
back yeah
and they actually have that so his whole
controversy obviously happened where he
was sad or something about his did
yeah Twitter he sent like a dick pic to
someone it is a lot of people that I
eventually why not
well yes several oh yeah he said I know
Carlos danger Carlos danger was his name
and so that happened and it sort of like
just kind of ruined his career
and then he was making a comeback and
then it turned out he did it again yeah
and so what was amazing was the crew was
actually this I haven't seen the
documentary but I've heard amazing I've
heard literally from everyone I want to
watch this the crew was with him when
the second scandal broke so they
literally are in the room with him when
it becomes out that he's still doing
this and he got caught again
oh that scene and it's supposed to be
just like the most fascinating thing
yeah and and the other crazy thing I've
heard about it is that people that go in
sort of feeling lukewarm or passive
about Anthony Weiner wound up liking him
wind up like definitely really
interested I mean so like I don't know
if it's playing near you I I've heard
excellent ex variety called it the most
relevant documentary since Fahrenheit
now that's what I'm saying man and that
so that's the movie I go see in a
theater or whatever like the movie that
is just like universally glowing I will
go see yeah the movie that's like a it
was fun it's a fun the summer movie is
not enough for me unless you have kids
yeah I guess I don't know I do want to
see The Secret Life of pets yeah I mean
that didn't get amazing reviews no I
thought it two weeks in a row it's
number one it's like well I just wanted
like it's making money iOS I thought it
was like around Ghostbusters in terms of
reviews okay
yeah I I want to see it I I have I just
want to like I want to hear Ghostbusters
music no yeah you don't want to hear
that theme song why they do it different
you guys didn't even make vision of the
original hold on I'm changing my plans
yeah you're gonna hate that song Dillons
too young for movies I understand I'm
just saying there are bad bad parents
out there Stacey and I have the night to
ourselves this evening so we're gonna go
out to dinner on a date and then
I'm gonna take my date to a movie
ghostbusters you're gonna move the arm
rest up and snuggling close uh yeah
that's we're gonna and lean back a
little bit yeah I'm excited I still want
to see it though screw you guys I mean
I'll see it on TV but just like you know
it's responding to our books
ya know 15 bucks left that oh we're
sneaking in we're not gonna work out
smart we're stealing it we're gonna
steal this movie yeah and then finally
before we say goodbye Comic Con is going
on yeah
Comic Cons happening this week in terms
of like news stuff yes like is there a
Marvel thing going on there like or do
they have you that anymore it's day two
is today day two I think I feel like the
big news would happen during the week so
they can look like an ape get coverage I
think what's happening to comic-con is
cs2 yeah right where it's like we don't
need like I know Steen it doesn't CBS
isn't officially there from our site
like interactive I think she's doing
Star Trek stuff right yeah but interact
there's not there a couple people from
scene at San Francisco were there just
because it's like a 40-minute flight
yeah and I but we're not covering it in
any like ultra official capacity the
last year I went was the year after you
stopped going yeah so I think my last
year there was 13 yeah feels about right
did you enjoy it when you were there I
enjoyed never gets kind of like a big
party for geeks which is fun yeah yeah I
enjoyed it I enjoy it like kind of
buying stuff
I just love buying like yeah you know
comic right temperate there in San Diego
supposed to be very nice oh he's very
nice yeah but the scene is not temperate
yes it's kind of it's kind of wild
yeah that place is really crowded yeah
it's a bit much is there any comparison
to New York comic-con
yeah like similar New York comic-con is
a solid 1/4 okay of what San Diego size
or event I feel like everything yeah
okay like the cosplay the the vendor's
epic cosplay in New York um there is but
it's a quarter short you really get out
there and the panels
I think are like yeah wait time
that's definitely true I guess so yeah
like there's a lot of exclusive stuff
that you can get only a comic-con and
then like they want end up releasing it
like right on yeah
but in terms of like the news and all
that stuff yeah I feel like a lot of
these guys are saying you know what why
do we need this flagpole event just to
get lost in the ether like we can do a
right thing and not have to that's like
Apple the way they treat it yes it's
like tapping it's all these companies
for whatever reason the expo circuit is
like the last to get the message well
it's because well a there's a bunch of
companies like read pop etc that built
their business around this country so of
course they're gonna try to do a four
they have can they have a new trip but
it's it's the nature of social media
it's the nature of like the fact that
anyone could do a live stream from their
phone means that like being in a
physical space somewhere is no longer
the value so you know having your own
event where you can control when you
have all the eyes focused on you rather
than sharing the spotlight it makes
perfect sense it's funny it's just like
it's all really just become a gigantic
cosplay party yeah and like if you're an
artist
you can go there and sell some of your
work yeah I do find it interesting
cosplay is interesting I know you love
Halloween right where'd you hear that I
think it's your favorite holiday if I
recall oh not accurate no it's up there
it's I enjoy that time of year Halloween
the way I treat Halloween is I don't
want to be the asshole that doesn't
dress up but I also don't want my night
to be ruined by what I dress up as which
is to say like if I'm walking around
with a giant like cumbersome costume it
kind of ruins the night for me and I
can't have a good time
cosplayers all the time are walking
around in these like giant mech suits
that have got to be just hot and
miserable and like but just being seen
is enough for them and ours them through
just getting someone to take a photo
they love it that's it
it's it's their sustenance I mean look
today it's 75 degrees there's lovely
freakin gorgeous really nice like what
else could you ask for you know in Japan
the cosplay culture is a little bit
different where you're not supposed to
take like random photos of people you
need to get their permission obvious ort
of a nice how do you know them cuz when
I went to TGS this was told to me before
I went
this was a couple years ago but it's
still the case cosplayers are so serious
there that they everything about their
presentation is like very curated and
they can only be shot at certain angles
and like okay can only be like yeah pose
they want to do they don't want to be
caught in line for the bathroom yeah so
right they don't want to be on their
phone right yeah so if you even if
you're like like someone's posing for
someone and there's like a crowd of
photographers in front of them and
you're not like on the in front of them
they're on the side they don't want you
taking that photo they want you to wait
for them to like make their pose to you
or whatever it is yeah you wanna make
eye contact with the lens
yeah that's a tough damage control but
culturally I mean it's sort of it's an
unwritten law kind of yeah it's just
like a thing that's the norm over there
it's really interesting I spend that
much time on a costume why would you
want a crappy photo yes so ya know it's
he went there was a guy walking around
called the cosplay doctor and he just
had a bunch of tape on him and like
random pieces of PVC pipe and stuff like
that and he would walk around and you
know you could hire him to fix your
cosplay cause he's cool on the showroom
floor yeah just amazing just cardboard
and stuff like that and paints and
whatnot and look like he was given a lot
of work we have good times out there man
I feel like those Expos are cool because
they had the space for people to come in
and do really big things you won't be
able to see anywhere else when we went
they had all the Batmobiles from the
various movies and TV shows and right
they had the real estate to just Park
them all back and I was really cool but
come on if those go away and like be a
bummer but come on what was the best
thing we ever did there The Walking Dead
thing yeah what was that
so they took over so who put it together
I forget who put it together it was like
AMC and image teamed up with some sort
of event company yeah and turned a
section of Petco Park or the Padre
splasher into a walking dead obstacle
course okay with like real zombies yeah
sure and it was a game by grabbing you
yeah yeah well trying to grab you yeah
you basically imagine if you're at a
game Brian all of a sudden a zombie
apocalypse broke out yeah she was like
set up like a baseball
yeah a baseball game
and it's it was in the stadium it wasn't
like you have said she walked through
the I say bleachers and stuff like that
and they be grabbing you through fences
the coolest part of that was they had
the original makeup artists from the TV
show right doing the zombie good uh and
this was like the GoPro breakout year so

like a two million dollar but they also
