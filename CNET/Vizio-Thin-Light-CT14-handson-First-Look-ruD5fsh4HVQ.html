a look at the Visio CT 14 is one of a
pretty highly hype line of new laptops
and all-in-one desktop PCs from Vizio a
company that usually makes TVs you may
ask yourself why they making computers
now well it's a good question it's
actually the second kind of consumer
electronics manufacturer getting into
pcs this year that we've seen after the
razor blade from razor a company that
makes all kinds of computer and gaming
accessories unlike that system which was
very ambitious but maybe a little bit
too outside the norm
these Vizio systems are fairly standard
ultrabooks with some you know unique
design features and some interesting
choices as to what they left in and what
they took out I will say for a 14-inch
Ultrabook the CT 14 is very thin it's
very light it really has that sort of
consumer like trying to vibe to it where
they sort of designed it first to be
really cool and then figured out how to
put all the parts inside rather than
maybe the other way around which is how
you get a lot of sort of generic
ultrabooks that you see these days so
definitely thumbs up on the overall
design the size and the weight this
particular version has a core i7 CPU it
will run you about 1,200 bucks there's
also a Core i5 and a core i3 version
they all have solid-state hard drives
which I always like to see in anything
that calls itself an ultrabook
you'll see that the keyboard is probably
the biggest departure from current
laptop design instead of the island
style keyboard pretty much everybody has
these are widely spaced keys that are
packed very tightly together you'd kind
of remind me especially because it's got
the same sort of light silver gray color
of what macbook pro keyboards used to
look like although in this case it's not
really as good you know there's a good
bit of flex under your fingers while
you're typing you know not unusable not
the best keyboard that I've used and the
touchpad B click pad style but again not
as responsive as let's say you find on a
MacBook and-and-and clicking down in the
corner over here for a right-click a
little bit hit or miss you really got to
nail it in exactly the right spot now
they've packed a couple USB 3.0 ports in
here and an HDMI output that's great but
there's no SD card slot which is really
weird the only other laptop like that I
can think of is maybe the 11 inch
MacBook
err and I know he turn it Jack but you
know a lot of super Sun ultrabooks don't
have that I do like the screen in that
it's a 1600 by 900 screen which is a
nice resolution for something like this
but it's a little bit of that wavy
quality sometimes you're seeing cheap
screens even though it's an IPS display
which means the off-axis viewing is
really good and it's actually fairly
crisp and bright so if you're looking
for an ultra book that has more of a
consumer electronics home-theater sort
of tint to it that it's definitely worth
checking out this new vizio line they
take a couple leaps of faith and a
couple of first generation jitters in
there but I'm really really interested
in seeing what they do for the next
round of systems I'm Dan Ackerman and
that is the Vizio CT 14</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
