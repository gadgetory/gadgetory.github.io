about the biggest story across movies TV
shows and games this week the Dark
Phoenix trailer dropped and honestly it
looks like it's gonna go up in a big
ball of flames because that's what
Phoenix is - Dark Phoenix was supposed
to be a new x-men trilogy involving one
of my favorite villains of all time
Phoenix force and the trailer looks
pretty decent though I'm reserving
additional hype until I see more footage
since Fox's x-men movies have generally
been mixed in terms of quality
alright everybody show of hands how many
of you watch this trailer and couldn't
stop wondering when will you see the
x-men in the Marvel Cinematic Universe
same-same of course yeah you know
everything though so you get out
everyone else put your hands down let's
break this down
the Fox Disney merger is a go and will
officially close sometime around the
middle of next year if everything goes
smoothly
that means Disney won't officially own
the x-men until sometime in the middle
of 2019 so if you're hoping for that
post-credits Avengers 4 scene with your
favorite x-men in it well you're
probably gonna be disappointed and if
you don't believe me how about the words
of Disney CEO Bob Iger in an interview
with The Hollywood Reporter they asked
him who would be overseeing the x-men
transition into the Marvel Cinematic
Universe specifically if Kevin Feige
would be taking charge and this is what
he said I think it only makes sense I
want to be careful here because of
what's been communicated to the Fox
folks but I think they know it only
makes sense for Marvel to be supervised
by one entity there shouldn't be two
Marvel's I can't possibly imagine a
world in which Kevin Feige would want to
take all of these different movies and
everything and try to make those work so
I'm predicting this means a full set of
reboots for all of Fox's superhero
franchises since I may be Deadpool
because that's been pretty pitch perfect
and they can incorporate him into the
MCU
or not as they so choose if in fact it
does mean full reboots when would we
potentially get our first glimpse at any
of the new x-men and how could they be
mixed into the Marvel Cinematic Universe
this is where we get to have a little
bit of fun and speculate so since this
deal doesn't close until mid 2019 it
follows that any movies produced after
that point wouldn't hit
until at least a year later so I think
we have to take a look at the Marvel
Studios released late for 2020 to figure
out when we might see the x-men so there
are three unannounced superhero movies
for Marvel in that calendar year May 1st
July 31st and November 6th we have no
idea which MCU movies are gonna end up
in these slots but I have some ideas
bear with me the way that they could end
up in the Marvel Cinematic Universe
could be telepathic in Doctor Strange to
Doctor Strange could connect with
Professor X or even Jean Grey now that's
a long shot but still it's cool or we
could have a cosmic connection there's
an upcoming Eternals movie and of course
the guardians of the galaxy 3 both of
them equally good opportunities to have
a universe altering thing happened that
somehow affects the DNA of some humans
on earth creating mutants now there's a
really good reddit thread with a fan
called faux better or worse that talked
about how Thanos to snap may have caused
some sort of cosmic event that's sort of
similar to that idea and I have to give
a shout out to that because I thought it
was really cool but that brings us to my
favorite theory which is a science and
technology connection we're definitely
getting a black panther too so in that
sequel sure he could discover that
Scarlet Witch wasn't actually enhanced
by experimentation and that her powers
were always a part of her DNA and she is
in fact a mutant and then they go find
more since that first appearance is
probably going to be a mid or end credit
scene you might be asking what about
spider-man far from home there's a
couple of problems there one that's Sony
and Disney hasn't bought them yet and
secondly they're gonna be really busy
trying to incorporate venom into that
franchise so probably not if Disney can
find a director for guardians 3 and get
that movie out relatively on time that
could be a good place to do it but I
argue that this is a better franchise to
relaunch Fantastic Four via somebody
like the Silver Surfer and if you
remember from guardians 2 they did in
fact hint at Adam warlock I think I
shall call him
but if Marvel doesn't use Black Panther
- my money is on Eternals for the
reintroduction of x-men in a
post-credits scene from a business
standpoint this would be a brilliant
move because it would get audiences into
theaters to learn more about the
Eternals as phase 4 starts its rollout
just so they could catch a glimpse of
the x-men and a teaser for things to
come but at the end of the day there's
only one man who knows how this is all
gonna play out and that's this guy Kevin
Feige so Kevin if you're watching call
me and tell me how it's gonna go cuz I'm
dying to know but if there is one other
man who could decide how all of this
should go down it's Marc Cyril's right
how would you do it Marc alright let's
play almost there Wolverine jumps in
nobody jumps in he's really small and he
wants to take a while I saw you once I'm
dehydrated it's ready then the ice guy
comes in a spell or a sit-in there's a
one house fire fire comes in a sauna
it's not rated anymore it doesn't in the
epic is he's not going to die
dehydration have anything they want how
many do they want
there already go oh no II love Lavoie
illegal black panther they got into the
galaxy guy the guy that looks like a
tree the pack rat did this have a WWF
and anyone Nia
can we just move on and make it movies
no probably get x as 100 marks Errol
should be the president of Hollywood
don't you agree
drop your best theories down in the
comments I'm dying to read how you would
incorporate the x-men and the MCU you
can check out last week's episode right
over here and of course you want even
lower stream economy and why wouldn't
you click right over here biggest rumors
