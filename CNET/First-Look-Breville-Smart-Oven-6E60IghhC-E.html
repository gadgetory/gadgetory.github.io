for cnet.com and I'm standing next to
the Breville Smart Oven with a price
point of 249 dollars standard retail
this is one of the more expensive
toaster ovens on the market but if
you're in the market for a luxury
toaster oven this is definitely worth
your money one of the reasons the
Breville offers you a lot of bang for
your buck is as well as features it has
an optional convection and it has nine
preset functions that you can use to
cook a variety of foods this brings me
to one of my favorite parts about the
Breville Smart Oven which is this user
interface it involves three dials and
four buttons all of which are very easy
to use and understand it's an incredibly
intuitive machine and even without
reading the manual the average consumer
could probably figure it out on their
own a feature that is both a good and
bad thing about the Breville Smart Oven
is its top which gets very very hot
during the cooking process Breville
designed it to double as a plate warmer
but if you are not warming plates you
should use caution as with all of our
toaster ovens we put the Breville Smart
Oven through some pretty rigorous
testing involving toast pizza chicken
cookies and burgers with regards to the
chicken the Breville Smart Oven was the
top performer compared to some of the
other toaster ovens the Breville does
have some hot spots you'll notice when
making toast that your toes towards the
center of the rack gets more Brown and
when you're making pizza the part of the
pizza that is closest to the door will
be browned slightly more than the rest
but overall these warmer spots were not
enough to deter us and giving it a
favorable rating the Breville Smart Oven
also boasts the largest interior oven
space of any of the toaster ovens that
we've tested so far so if you're looking
for a toaster oven that has extremely
large oven capacity and can handle a six
pound chicken or a roast or a 12 inch
pizza the Breville Smart Oven is
absolutely a good choice if you're
looking for a basic toaster oven that
performs all of the functions that we
tested and does them well we recommend
the Panasonic flash Express which
retails at 149 dollars so you can
find it on Amazon and other sites for as
low as 90 but if you're looking for more
of a luxury purchase with a toaster oven
and the 249 dollar price point doesn't
put you off then the Breville Smart Oven
is absolutely a recommended by for seen
