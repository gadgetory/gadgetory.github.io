4k blu-ray player on the market it's
speedy and offers great image quality
and there's pretty much all the
streaming services you could want
while the Sony competes with other $300
players out there it's the styling and
build quality that sets this model apart
from the others the sony is solid metal
one little grumble is that there's no
LED display and no play button which you
would normally expect on a premium
device the interface is simpler than the
cross media bar evolved and it has the
ability to arrange shortcuts the way you
want but pretty much the only service
that isn't available is HBO it's
fantastic for streaming apps at under
four seconds to start Netflix it's the
quickest of any blu-ray player we've
ever test and almost indistinguishable
from a Roku box image quality is
absolutely up there with the best
and especially for standard blu-rays
1080p movies look as good as you could
possibly make them surpassing even our
high-end Oppo reference meanwhile 4k
video with HDR looks as good as with any
of the other players we've seen while
audio quality isn't as remarkable and
its digital output only this can be
solved by using auto instead of PCM via
the player menu until companies start
talking about 8k content the 300 bucks
or Sony offers pretty much everything
you need in a blu-ray player right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
