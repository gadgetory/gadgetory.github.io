we're all gonna die someday and your
friends and family are gonna want a
place to grieve and say goodbye and
share their stories now you're not going
to care what happens to your facebook
profile when you're dead because you're
dead but your friends and family will
care so you should assign one of them as
a legacy contact this allows them to
post a memorial at the top of your
timeline respond to friend request and
update your awful cover photo with
something a little classier sounds like
a good idea right so here's how to do it
using a browser but you could do the
same thing in the app open up facebook
click settings and then click security
select where it says legacy contact then
click where it says choose a friend type
in a name and don't worry this person is
not going to see any of your messages or
be able to post as you also if the idea
of your profile page living on after
death feels a little weird there's an
option here to have facebook delete your
account after you're gone if you do pick
a person to manage your page facebook
will generate a short message to send to
them which helps take some of the
weirdness out of things sorta of course
you can also customize this message if
you want that's really all there is to
it I know it's kind of morbid to think
about but it's a quick process and
honestly it's kind of a relief to know
that you're dumb profile picture doesn't
have to live on as your virtual
gravestone go out there and live your
life</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
