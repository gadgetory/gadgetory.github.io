claiming that the CIA has hacking tools
designed to break into devices like
phones TVs and routers these hacking
tools allegedly include malware viruses
and zero-day exploits that would let the
CIA access iOS and Android smartphones
turn Smart TVs into listening devices
and access Microsoft's Windows CE net
and CBS are currently unable to verify
the authenticity of the WikiLeaks
documents here are some of WikiLeaks
main CIA hacking claims we've seen it's
security reporter laura Hatala breaking
down what these leaks actually mean so
the CIA according to these claims has
developed tools to hack into lots of
popular smartphones phones like Android
phones and iPhones the ones we all use
and that allows them to have the same
kind of access to the smart phone that
you as a user would have if you unlock
it with your thumbprint or a code and so
the limits on these tools really are us
surveillance law and the fact that the
CIA is mandate is to spy on people
outside of the United States
signal and telegram have come out and
said that this is not a problem with
their apps it's a problem with the
operating systems if those operating
systems can be hacked then that means
that they can access all kinds of apps
on the phones so cyber security experts
have a lot of concerns about smart home
devices because a lot of them are very
easy to hack and they do have things
like embedded microphones and cameras so
the fact that the CIA might have this
tool to turn a Smart TV into a listening
device goes along with all of those
concerns and it's also true that Smart
TV manufactures some in particular have
come under fire for collecting user
information without their knowledge
so right now with the claims unverified
and the company's still investigating
what vulnerabilities they might have on
their systems it's really hard for us to
know what we can do to protect ourselves
from these hacking tools but generally
it's always good to have your software
updated to the most recent version of
your operating system and have all your
applications updated to all so it's
gonna be really interesting to see what
these companies come out with in terms
of software patches coming forward
WikiLeaks has said that this is the
beginning of a series of leaks about CIA
hacking tools so you might be wondering
how this is different from the NSA spy
programs revealed by Edward Snowden and
the answer is that those NSA programs
went after information in different
places in places like company servers
and the backbone of the internet and
they swept up tons of information in
huge dragnet programs and these alleged
CIA hacking tools are very targeted and
they get into specific devices like cell
phones and TVs to scoop up information
on a specific person and they also get
around a lot of the encryption tools
that helped protect that information
from programs like the NSA s</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
