educational tools for children handing
over your iPad to a kid opens up a world
of potential problems such as a broken
tablet accidental in-app purchases or
inappropriate content
fortunately kid proofing your iPad is a
quick and straightforward process here's
how to do it before ever considering
putting your iPad in the hands of a
child you should first put it in a
protective case even a thin and stylish
case can help protecting in small bumps
and drops but if a kid will be handling
your iPad regularly you may want to
purchase a more rugged shockproof case
Apple has built parental controls
directly into iOS to turn on
restrictions go to Settings General
restrictions and hit enable restrictions
into a four digit PIN different from the
pin you use to unlock your iPad and
confirm it restrictions are divided into
five categories allow allowed content
privacy allowed changes and Game Center
in the allow section you can restrict
access to Safari camera Siri FaceTime
airdrop iTunes Store Apple music Kinect
and news it's up to you to determine
what your kid should be allowed to use
but the biggest feature here is the
option to restrict the ability to
install or delete apps and make in-app
purchases in the allowed content section
you can filter explicit content from
music and news or choose which ratings
are appropriate for movies in TV you
could also disable explicit language and
web searches from Siri filter apps by
age limit in the App Store and limit
adult content from Safari of course
Safari will be the toughest app to
restrict without completely disabling it
so Apple has also included the ability
to blacklist and or whitelist specific
websites privacy allows you to restrict
communication and other connectivity
options of the iPad you can disable
location services and restrict the
ability to make changes or which apps
have access to contacts calendars
reminders photos share my location
Bluetooth microphone speech recognition
Twitter Facebook and media library this
for example can prevent any new apps
from gaining access to your Twitter
account or calendar under allow changes
you choose what your child can modify on
the device you can restrict the ability
to add
move or modify mail calendar and contact
accounts or change which apps can use
background app refresh for younger ears
the volume limit option is useful to
make sure your child won't listen to
audio louder than they should last but
not least are the game Center options
here you can easily disable multiplayer
games the ability to add friends and
screen recording games are one of the
biggest reasons kids want an iPad and
these settings go a little further than
the regular privacy settings to make
sure your kids are safe when gaming and
lastly you may want to keep in mind that
if you restrict your kit from
downloading their own apps you will have
to do it for them the App Store has an
entire section dedicated to kid-friendly
and parent approved apps age-appropriate
apps are separated into three different
sections kids ages 5 and under kids ages
6 to 8 and kids ages 9 to 11 here you
will find apps such as YouTube kids PBS
Kids and Nick jr. as well as a healthy
selection of educational apps and games
