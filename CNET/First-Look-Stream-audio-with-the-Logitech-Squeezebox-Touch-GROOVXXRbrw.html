this is a review of the Logitech
Squeezebox touch personally I've been
looking for a digital music streamer for
myself for a long time and though the
sonar system is really good it's limited
in its inability to play high resolution
audio files and while it's been out for
a while the Logitech Squeezebox touch is
the first digital music streamer I've
seen that ticks all the boxes for sound
quality and is easy to use and fun the
device itself consists of a 4.3 inch
touchscreen and despite its plastic
looking fascia it comes with a stable
metal base the screen is quite small for
use across the room where its touch
ability becomes useless anyway but you
can increase the size of the fonts for
use with a remote control or just use it
to display cover art but regardless I
think the main control method will be
either via a tablet or smartphone with
apps available for both iOS and Android
and you can also use PC and Macs as an
older device the logitech lacks proper
DLNA support but uses its own
proprietary server which runs from a PC
or Netgear nares
as such the device has more appeal than
geeks than the competitive Sonos device
which just works but if you have a big
library like me or exotic file types and
like to tweak the look and feel of your
device then the Squeezebox is for you
making playlists is easy and its
integration with Spotify in particular
is superb even if you just use this
device as an internet radio it works
really well sound quality was surprising
with excellent sound coming out of the
onboard analog outputs but you can add
an outboard digital processor or just
connect a digital cable to your receiver
while it's not perfect it can sometimes
suffer from brain farts and lose its 802
11 G connection I think this is the best
device of its type so far especially if
you use an ethnic cable connection while
it's more expensive than a Roku it's
cheaper than most dedicated audio
components and at 250 online it's highly
recommended
this has been type in debrief for
