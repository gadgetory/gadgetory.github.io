facebook launches new features and
ruffle some feathers HTC thinks it's
time for the plum colored rhyme a look
back at apples biggest flops and a site
that offers to manage your social life
for you it's all coming up right now
hi everyone I'm Hollywood and welcome to
the senior tech review where we collect
our hottest videos of the week and tell
you what's good and what's bad in the
world of tech plus we offer our own
unique tech wisdom in the form of the
bottom line let's start with the good
we'll get to my facebook gripes in a bit
here but first HTC's long rumored bliss
handset made its debut in New York this
week and it's actually called The Rime
and not the bliss we sent Bridget Carey
the newest member of the cnet TV family
to get the scoop on this decidedly
female friendly phone hi I'm Bridget
Carey wits cnet TV here with your first
look at the HTC Rhyme I'm at the launch
event here in New York and they didn't
exactly say this was for women but you
kind of get that vibe because it comes
in purple and has lots of accessories
like the one I'm holding right here you
might be wondering what is this dangling
thing it's called the charm so you plug
it in and let it stick out your purse
and it lights up when you have a missed
call or someone's calling you have a
text message it also comes with a
docking station that kind of reminds you
of like an alarm clock you can put it by
your bed and it also comes with headsets
as you can see the headsets are a flat
rubber so it's supposed to not get
tangled as easily because we all just
hate when that happens sold separately
are also some other matching accessories
like the plum colored bluetooth headset
or a speaker visor for your car and also
a workout armband so the phone itself
has a nice feminine feel the specs
inside aren't too bad it comes with two
cameras one five megapixel in the back
and another one in the front for video
chatting it's a 3.7 inch screen a 1
gigahertz processor it has four gigs of
memory internal 8 gigs in a separate SD
card now as far as the interface goes
you're going to notice there are
slightly different tweaks in this
HTC sense like the ability to just
quickly get a glance at your latest mail
or messages without having to go all the
way into the program and the camera
itself has a few other tweaks like being
able to take five shots at once in 2.5
seconds so ladies if having some
accessories tickles your fancy it's
going to be available September 29th
that Verizon for 199 and that includes
the three accessories like the charm the
charging dock and the matching earphones
for cnet TV I'm Bridget Carey thanks
Bridget and welcome aboard and yes let's
just actually say that the rhyme is
really aimed at women well women and
prints honestly I hope HTC was nice
enough to give him one for free the new
fall TV season is in full swing with a
whole slew of new shows hitting the
airwaves one such show is the new CBS
series person of interest which imagines
a world where no one is safe from the
prying eyes of government surveillance
kind of like Facebook Brian Cooley
visited the person of interest set to
find out just how close the show might
be to real life
the eyes that never sleep in streets on
buildings at ATMs 50 million video
cameras silently rolling on our every
move capturing our location and when we
were there four billion hours a week
recorded typically and monitored live
possibly and all of it at the core of a
new CBS drama the CBS show person of
interest revolves around this concept of
a machine that can hear see and
therefore no just about anything about
any of us who's doing what with that
information that's part of the mystery
you have a decision to make machine gave
you another number the leads on our show
are doing work that they're uncertain
out they feel ethically uncertain about
and yet compelled to pursue it most of
them are just ordinary people like her a
thousand two thousand five thousand
different images simultaneously this
machine can see all at once it's almost
like you know dare I say big guy even if
you think you can get through the day
without being caught on video your cell
phone can sell you out eighty-three
percent of american adults now carry one
thirty five percent a smartphone with
advanced integration into their daily
lives the public wanted to be protected
they just didn't want to know how they
were being protected the government been
actively trying to build exactly the
sort of databasing technology that we
talked about in the pilot that we
feature in the show for at least ten
years so when they finally got a system
that were kept it secret so while person
of interest envisions a specific machine
in fact we already live with one the
connectable dots of many forms of
everyday surveillance that are perhaps
even more powerful than what finch and
reese work with
really gives you something to think
about doesn't it we'll have more from
Cooley's visit to the set later in the
show if that piece has scared you into
giving up your smartphone it doesn't
mean you have to stop taking photos and
sharing them with your friends here's
Josh Goldman with a new point and shoot
camera from Samsung that has plenty of
social networking features built right
inside hey there I'm Josh Goldman with
CNN and this is a look at the samsung
sh100 so it's probably no surprise that
smartphones are killing some of the
sales of lower end point and shoots with
all the apps and instant uploading
there's just no way to compete with that
however the sub $200 sh100 is a solid
attempt for starters it has built-in
Wi-Fi that can be used for quickly
connecting to a hotspot for wireless
uploads to facebook or sending off in an
email the Wi-Fi can also be used to
backup photos to a PC or connect to
smartphones for use as a remote
viewfinder all you have to do for that
is just download an app available for
Samsung Galaxy devices and the iphone 4
support for other Android devices is in
the works anyway you just open the app
and you can use it to connect the sh100
to your device and use it to control the
camera the camera is also loaded with
photo and movie filters and some simple
editing tools and the 3 inch touchscreen
on back makes using them pretty easy
plus you can drag and drop icons around
just like you would on a smartphone now
photo quality isn't much better than you
get from a smartphone particularly low
light shots but for sharing online they
look very good and you do get a 26
millimeter wide angle lens with a 5x
zoom and you really don't get that with
a phone basically with this camera you
get a lot of the same benefits of your
smartphone's camera but with a better
lens faster performance and more
comfortable shooting I'm Josh Goldman
and
the Samsung sh100 I do miss having an
optical zoom on my camera phone but i'm
not sure i miss it enough to start
carrying both a phone and the camera
again while we're on the topic of social
networking is anyone else feeling
overwhelmed trying to manage all of your
alert settings or missing posts that you
should have seen if so Sharon Vaknin has
yet another service to sign up for but
this one aims to help you manage all the
rest what if you get a text message
every time someone posts an apartment
listing on craigslist or maybe you'd
like to automatically backup facebook
photos to your dropbox i'm sharing
backing frisina com here to show you how
to use a web app called if this then
that which lets you automate tasks for
web services like facebook dropbox
twitter flickr and more if this then
that or if as i like to call it is based
on the simple logic of its name if this
happens on one service then do that on
another service here's how it works head
to ifttt com enter some new account
information and once you confirm your
email address you'll see the dashboard
to start things off click create a task
on the next page click this and you'll
see a couple dozen web services more are
being added but if this then that added
the most popular ones first also you'll
need to activate most of the channels
before you can use them but only the
first time around so as an example today
I'll make it so that whenever I favor to
tweet the article from that tweet will
be added to instapaper which is really
useful for me since I get a lot of news
from Twitter but can't always read it
right away to do that first I'm going to
select Twitter if you haven't activated
it yet you'll need to do so now so now
you're presented with many triggers for
this I'll select new favorite tweet then
create trigger to select an action
channel click that I'm going to select
Instapaper then read later for the
action if this then that fills the
section out for you so just click create
action give your task a name and then
click create now whenever I favor
tweet it will be added to my Instapaper
account you can create hundreds of
combinations for tasks but if you go to
the recipes section you'll see that many
people have already created many useful
ones for you just filter by service and
when you find the task you want click
the arrow then create task to enable it
I personally like that this site uses
text message actions notifying you via
SMS about anything from a new post on
craigslist to a brand-new how to blog on
cnet com play around with the tasks and
recipes and let me know which useful
ones you find by tweeting me or leaving
a comment on my facebook page for cnet
I'm Sharon Vaknin and i'll see you on
the interwebs great now I can set it up
to call my phone every time I get a new
gmail message I'm sure that wouldn't be
annoying at all information overload
much while you work out all of your
trigger combos I am going to take a
break but stick around there's a lot
more tech review coming up right after
this
welcome back to the scene at tech review
our weekly video digest of all things
good and bad we've seen your at cnet TV
continuing on in the good let's check
back in with Brian Cooley on the set of
person of interest for some
behind-the-scenes secrets and whether
the Machine might really exist
I'm Brian Cooley from cnet com or on
location in prospect park brooklyn with
richard j lewis the producing director
of person of interest in his CBS fall
series richard as we're watching this
take place and people have to detect a
certain a certain discomfort between the
characters the technology that they're
using that's a key part of what the
whole energy isn't this show isn't it I
think it is I mean I think there's a
real kind of mystery around not only
Reese and Finch the two lead characters
of the show but the technology that is
instituted to uncover or surveil all the
people of New York City a wireless
camera you can keep an eye on them from
anywhere we call it the machine and the
machine can detect a violent act that is
about to happen to a victim or
perpetrator Finch gets a social security
number and basically he knows which
person the person of interest is going
to be that person of the week you have a
decision to make machine gave you
another number where is the machine you
know it's funny i asked i asked Jonah
Nolan where the machine was and he said
I don't know maybe in Fort Knox maybe
not we don't know that's part of the
mystery that's part of the idea around
the show is that there's there's a lot
of enigmatic stuff
we leave in 1984 it's just like you know
28 years ago just a little late all
being looked at we're all being listened
to every transaction we make every time
we get on the subway when we use the e
zpass to go over a bridge we're being
trapped we're being tracked globally by
satellites we're being tracked all over
the map in lower Manhattan there's at
least 4,000 surveillance cameras they
can see 360 they can actually rotate on
axes they can pan they can tilt and they
can think techniques of facial
recognition looking an IRS looking at
stride the other way they think is
basically by discerning what an object
is and the computer is programmed to
understand certain shapes and it becomes
pretty interesting becomes a little
unnerving let's use the real I think
it's a very scary part where I have to
agree with its provocative material it's
scary it's stuffed in it's stuff that's
happening to us right now then you hack
into their cell phone in fact it's
interesting to note that even if our
cell phone is off the authorities can
tap into the microphone in the cell
phone and hear a conversation in the
vicinity that's one of the most eerie
things you see in this show is how the
cell phone becomes this eavesdropping
device without really any apparent
effort this is not some server room this
is not some sterile technology
environment we're here in the normal
real world a street in New York it's
where where they're sending that
information because they're sending that
information to a bank of servers that go
on forever and ever it's like a huge
kind of I like a giant insect I in which
you see a thousand two thousand five
thousand different images simultaneously
this machine can see all at once you
know it's almost like you know
dare I say big guy now we're watching
your monitor here Richard and things
look like film but I know you're not
shooting with film cameras we're using
an aerial Alexa which has a very
interesting film grain look we're able
to kind of color time and and get proper
exposure and looks various looks and
you're doing that it sounds like in real
time where most of us effects we would
do that in post in some final cut thing
on the fly right now what's really
interesting about using digital the
digital medium is being able to control
it on the spot and that's what we're
doing and we have a number of different
types of cameras that we use as you know
the world has all these different
surveillance cameras we have our own
this is your big camera this is the pro
cameras like you're losing a bunch of
basically surveillance cameras look for
a show about surveillance right we want
to separate the two looks we want to
make sure that people know when its
surveillance and we downgrade that image
and we mess with it and screwing it this
is our HD POV and it is a fantastic
camera see this lens right here it's
essentially an equivalent to about an
eight millimeter fisheye lens really
what really why sometimes I'll take it
and I'll put it in the corner of an
elevator or we'll put it on an ATM
machine or we'll put it you know in a
phone booth it's a really important tool
that we use all the time I found it but
somebody else found him first you're
blending looks in a production today
that I don't think was necessarily the
case in most productions up until fairly
recently because there wasn't an array
of video looks or languages was there no
I mean I think filmmakers like Oliver
Stone Martin Scorsese in the past they
have blended these looks Tony Scott you
know they have used super 8 footage use
video footage used 60 and 35 and I think
now that language is coming into
television and you know we're hoping to
be sort of
and doing that
been talking richard j lewis producing
director of person of interest CBS
series that airs 9 p.m. eastern on
thursday nights eight o'clock central
i'm brian cooley from cnet com I hope
Michael Emerson really is one of the
good guys this time but we've fallen for
that one before haven't we alright now
let's see what we can find in the bad in
light of recent success stories like the
iPhone the iPad even the Mac itself it's
easy to forget that Apple has also had
its share of failures over the years so
for all you Apple haters out there feel
free to gloat as coolly counts down this
week's top five
Apple's had so many hits the last 15
years or so it really seems cheap and
small and petty to run down there duds
the boy is it fun I'm Brian Cooley with
top five Apple flops ranking these is
real subjective so I went the way you
would let's rank him by how much you can
get for them on eBay here we go the
number 5 apple flop is the Newton OS
message pads this is going to raise
hackles since descendants iphone and
ipad are now apples biggest business but
Apple made like six models of the
message pad and Motorola made some and
sharp took a whack Adam and nobody could
get it right it was just this
slow-motion disaster I recall when these
were new and they were scorned
everywhere and didn't they have Newton's
stores too what a mess price wise these
don't fetch a lot 30 to 50 bucks for one
on ebay number for the mac g4 cube we've
never seen a computer like this and it's
short time in production keeps it that
way this silent fanless monolith with a
toaster slot on top for CDs was real
different but thanks for that odd shape
you couldn't really put any expansion
cards in it back at a time when you
actually cared about such things and it
was pricing about 200 bucks more than a
conventionally shaped mac that had
similar performance oh and the cases
often cracked which is really annoying
on a machine you pay top dollar for for
its looks they made about a hundred and
fifty thousand of these so they aren't
real hard to find on eBay and they seem
to fetch about a hundred or two hundred
bucks number three was the Pippin
remember this one it was produced with
van die of Japan rolled out around 96 as
a game console with a lite version of
system 7 on it as its OS it was gutless
it was damn near nothing to run on it in
terms of titles and the price was like
600 bucks about 850 in today's dollars
forty-two thousand or so were made ebay
prices top out around four hundred bucks
or so for a really clean unit number two
is the 20th anniversary Mac it was one
of the first things Steve Jobs killed
when he came back to the company and I
suspect he did it
inside a pentagram because this thing is
so not him like all crap labeled
executive it's full of form over
function for 7,500 dollars over ten
thousand bucks in today's money you'd
get an all-in-one design okay kind of
cool with a small 12 inch display and
beyond that not much interesting oh
there was a Joey pouch disk tray in
front and buttons on the front panel
arranged for looks instead of works the
whole thing came off like sharper image
had a one-night stand with Bang &amp;amp;
Olufsen and the 20th anniversary Mac was
star-crossed from the beginning it
launched in 1997 Apple's 21st year that
said you seem to be able to get about
700 bucks for a good complete one on
ebay before I take you to the number one
Apple flop ranked by eBay price let's
consider one so awful and so unimportant
it doesn't even deserve a true spot on
the list that damn round USB puck mouse
from the original iMac totally round so
you never knew which way to point it
sighs so only a raccoon could articulate
it and just ugly with that bad late 90s
semi-translucent plastic with Jolly
Rancher color accents this thing was a
mess I found a basket of 20 of them on
ebay for 35 bucks overpriced my number
one Apple flop Macintosh TV I'd actually
forgotten about this this was the first
black mac it was basically a Mac
performa that had a Sony Trinitron
television bolted to it and a cable
tuner inside you could use it as a
computer or switch to watching TV but
you couldn't watch TV in a window or
anything cool like that it made a
mockery of the word integration about
10,000 were made so there's a handful of
them sticking up ebay any given day at
around eight hundred dollars now for the
brighter side of life don't miss my
other companion video to this top 5
Steve Jobs greatest hits that's also
available at top 5 cnet com I'm Brian
Cooley thanks for watching
to steal a phrase from brian Tong those
are truly some bad apples although there
is something about that lil McIntosh TV
it's a little clunky but that black case
is pretty slick alright with that let's
move right along to this week's bottom
line Facebook rolled out yet another
redesign this week and just like
clockwork the masses immediately took to
the site to complain about the changes
and that was even before the f8
conference held yesterday we're even
bigger changes were announced take a
look at what the future holds in store
for facebook hi Rafe Needleman from CNN
here at the Facebook f8 Developers
Conference we're very polished Mark
Zuckerberg just announced some important
new changes in the way people share
information and connect with friends
we've been working on it all year and
we're calling it timeline this is very
very exciting for every entrepreneur is
trying to build an audience and build a
personalized web experience for their
audience using the Facebook products
first there's a new view of what you're
doing what you've done on face book
called the timeline now with this
everything you do from taking photos to
cooking shows up in one place in
chronological order information is
summarized automatically as you go
further back in time and users can
customize most aspects of the timeline
to show friends how they want to appear
whether it's you're endorsing a friend
posting a job maybe you just change jobs
or maybe you just got a promotion things
that are important to you professionally
that should go into this new timeline
and Facebook now this is a developer's
conference and this news is big for
facebook developers now they'll be able
to get data into the timeline
automatically and without spamming users
profile pages every time someone say
goes for a run or listens to a track of
music he has this nice running app that
he's using to keep track of his runs and
I think that's pretty cool so I'm just
going to hover over it and click add to
timeline and I'm going to get this nice
pop up and I can just click on it add to
my timeline it's right on my timeline
most of these activities will appear in
the new Facebook ticker the live view of
what people are doing in real time on
Facebook six of my friends are watching
and
episode of glee on hulu and i can just
hover over that and click and watch it
in a new social canvas app that hulu has
built and that's another key point for
users and especially for media services
like spotify and i heart radio and video
sites like netflix we think the radio
listening experience is inherently
social that people love to talk to their
friends about stuff they like to go
places in the old days it was the
request line it was the song dedications
now they're able to virtually by using
Facebook your friends can see what
you're doing immediately and pop up
their own windows to show the same show
and watch it with you you have complete
control over your timeline what you show
there how you display it and who can see
it to share the media that you're
viewing on facebook with your friends in
real time is rolling out today the
Timeline view is rolling out in beta
today and to the general population in a
few months it's the story of your life
you have all your stories all your apps
and a new way to express who you are for
cnet i'm rafe needleman the bottom line
this week facebook is your entire life
they've now collected everything you've
ever done and made it easier to collect
everything you ever will do everywhere
you go Wow hey but maybe seeing it all
collected like that will freak us out
and make us share less yeah not likely
alright that's it for this time everyone
but come back next week for an all-new
cnet tech review until then there are
tons of great videos available every day
at cnet TV com see you next time and
thank you for watching
