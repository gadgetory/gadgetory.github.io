PlayStation 4 will be available at three
hundred and ninety-nine dollars
399 euros and for the folks in my
homeland 349 pounds sterling in the US
and Europe this holiday season it's a
very compelling price that offers
incredible value given the amount of
entertainment ps4 will provide to gamers
over the next decade and beyond is
PlayStation the best place to play
without a doubt in addition to creating
an amazing library of new titles on
PlayStation 4 we're equally focused on
delivering what gamers want most without
imposing restrictions or devaluing their
ps4 purchases for instance playstation 4
won't impose any new restrictions on the
use of people
yes that's a good thing we believe in
the model that people embrace today with
playstation 3 and continue to demand
just heard you there when a gamer buys a
ps4 this they have the rights to use
that copy of the game they can trade in
the game at retail sell it to another
person lend it to a friend or keep it
forever
in addition playstation 4 disc-based
games don't need to be connected online
to play
or for any type of authentication if you
enjoy playing single player games
offline ps4 won't require you to check
in online periodically
and it won't stop working if you haven't
authenticated within 24 hours
of course the experience on PSN will be
amazing our goal for PlayStation Network
on ps4 is clear build the best gaming
network in the world a network that is
tuned your preferences is immediate and
intuitive and delivers a breath of
entertainment offerings that is
unmatched in the industry in New York we
announced several new PSN capabilities
that will be available day one on the
PlayStation 4 such as the ability to
play games that are being downloaded in
the background cross game voice chat to
transition to a friends network based on
real-world friends to provide a more
meaningful social gaming experience and
the new share button to immediately
upload live stream via ustream
PlayStation Network also offers
incredible value to our customers
through PlayStation Plus and we're very
focused on expanding the benefits of the
service
we've received lots of questions from
our community over the last several
months about whether the existing
PlayStation Plus memberships will apply
to ps4 I'm pleased to confirm that your
PS Plus membership will carry over to
PlayStation 4 so members will have
access to all the benefits across ps3
Vita and now PlayStation 4 for one price
in short if you're a plus member today
or become one tomorrow you're already
set for PlayStation 4 for less than five
dollars a month members will get
discounted games cloud saves automatic
game updates early access to beta
programs an instant game collection as
well as the ability to fully immerse
themselves in the incredible ps4 games
the online multiplayer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
