and your fingerprints are all over
comic-con how is it like coming back
here and what if you could really kind
of describe what kanokon is for you what
would you say is the giant playground in
my backyard that i forgot to build its
it feels very much like home except its
way louder and and it's a lot sillier
but I'm okay with both of those things
now you're here to talk about Buffy kind
of returning to you know the first girl
you dated you know one of your true
loves and how was it bringing back about
buffy the vampire slayer too dark horse
you know she's lived there for a while
now and it's a very very very good
relationship I think that you know the
things that are about season eight that
I felt like we're a Miss were all on me
I felt like the people the dark was
brought to the party but I brought to
the party they all did amazing work but
I felt like structurally I missed the
point that even in comic book form where
you can do anything you want with people
really want to see is the Buffy that
they relate to I want a very sort of
day-to-day level and so I'm excited
about season 9 because we're coming back
to that is it almost it sounds almost
for yourself a little bit of you know
personal retribution because from what I
just heard it sound like you kind of
were let down by it but you're here to
bring her back you know in better ways
for yourself well I loved a lot of the
stuff we do the season me but I do think
I know I I had in my head oh my gosh you
know we could be the authority we can we
can we can do anything and people were
like can they just talk and obviously
they're not just gonna talk you know
there's most mystical monsters and all
sorts of fun but that phone is rooted in
the experience of going through a normal
life I'm going to abnormal way and
that's really what made the show work is
that people could be Buffy and when
she's running army it's a little harder
to be heard I think I missed on that so
I'm excited to get her back to her
roots the ethos of the show which is we
never tell a story no matter how
exciting unless it's about her and
exactly where she is you know in school
or out of school now a lot of people may
not be familiar but you kind of have the
musical gene inside of you you did dr.
horrible's sing-along blog you even
directed an episode of glee with Neil
Patrick Harris is music a big part of
you know kind of one of those creative
outlets that you have that you'd like to
explore here and there like how does
music fit into everything that you do
well you know me and my brothers were
raised with a ton of music and musicals
and just it was in our lives not that
anybody played anything my brothers all
learned to play instruments somehow
really easily bastard soon but it's you
know music has been a way that we
understand expression and I'm a huge fan
of music and dance and it's just you
know it comes and goes because you know
when you have a ton of projects or very
very young children you don't get a lot
of time to to make music and sort of
coming back in again and it's a great
feeling because it really does nurture
it's a it's a really delightful way to
express whatever you're going through
alright also with the Avengers one of
the unique things is you really started
building characters from scratch on your
own and kind of building there you know
the story and the character itself with
the vengers they have an established
characters a storyline that people are
familiar with how is that a challenge
for you it's an enormous challenge to
take all these characters that already
exist in very different universes and
bring them all together and not tell
their origins but just sort of have
people get by the way you're telling the
story who they are in case I haven't
seen those movies same problem I have a
serenity quite frankly it's a little
easier because most people will know
Captain America is even if they haven't
seen the movie but it is a you know it's
it's all about sort of dancing around
these different perspectives and keeping
a real narrative flow while you're
you're shifting constantly from person
to person it's enormously difficult now
one of the characters that I don't know
if it's been confirmed or not but there
are rumblings about an about ant-man in
the movie is that is that true or not
you know I'm really not allowed to say
what happens in the movie but
can say that it's not true well it's not
sure yeah man something with me I was I
was looking for a role because I might
be able to save you some budget costs on
the CG so that that could work in your
favor if you're looking to stick them in
somehow it scroll around with all the
bottom will call you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
