question of how fast is it
but how fast does it feel last time we
had a Maserati we had in the Grand
Turismo and I was absolutely smitten
even then it's cabin technology it's
appointments its lines and it's
responsiveness we're all super strong
plus his idli can match up
let's face it you want to sell really
big volume in the car bizzy's days
you're doing it with four doors look at
a BMW 6 grand coupe I'll get a Panamera
Cayenne now look at Monza riding for the
first time ever they have two four doors
and the lineup at once Ghibli is the
latest now inside the deeply you find a
nice Maserati interior they've always
had a real sort of a distinctive design
and a real sense of taste it is of a
lower scale than their upper range cars
that are absolutely sumptuous this one
is more like very nice dominated by as
you can see two LCD screens a slightly
smaller but ample one here between the
gauges and the big boy this 8.4 inch
centre stack unit now unless you review
cars all the time like I do you may not
notice this as a buyer but there is that
day in the Maserati owners life when
they're going to drive to the airport
and they're giggling fly down to a
business meeting pick up their Dodge
Dart rent-a-car and see the same stuff
that's a black day in their calendar the
sharing though is it's a little awkward
especially at a brand of this prestige
everything works well touch response on
this particular implementation as well
is very quick big buttons and fast
response I like that
235 second Street San Francisco
California voice command is also quite
good they give you lots of prompts on
the screen so you know what you can say
without memorizing things and it lets
you dictate addresses in one go not
piece by piece I like that as well it's
only painful once in a while when the
Garmin nav is full screen giving you
directions and looks a little cartoony
in this car that's jarring there are
three audio systems available on this
car we have the full deal we got the
Bowers &amp;amp; Wilkins 15 speaker 1280 watt
monster now I always check a sound
system to see what it does to make
mediocre sources sound good like highly
compressed satellite radio this one
doesn't Wow me in that respect feed it a
good source like a high bitrate file
here on that SD card really comes alive
up here behind the mirror you may have
noticed cameras looking forward this one
is part of an intelligent high beam
systems it can go into a high beam mode
automatically ducking you can also set
it to go manual like a normal car
there's a town beam mode which is kind
of like a smarter in town low beam for
customers who live on the continent and
cross the channel a lot this Carl figure
what side of the road you're driving and
curve the lights appropriately of course
as almost every Italian car we review
there are little quirks that make it
Italian these knobs for volume and for
tuning very important
they aren't illuminated at night they're
gone this shifter is so persnickety and
such a slight movement I defy you to put
this car in Reverse accurately three
times in a row and you're best advised
to put your CDs in while you're driving
because when you're in park you almost
can't get the disc in there in all we've
got a fairly high functioning cabin with
a few quirks and a really nice sense of
style Charlie's in the front there means
set the seat where it's comfortable he's
six feet tall very normal height and I
just can't sit behind him I'm not sure I
can close the door which is a shame
because the Headroom is phenomenal back
here and the trunk is huge but this is a
problem now the biggest bragging right
to any maserati is under the hood
because you can pretty credibly say it's
got a Ferrari engine it's a Maserati
design but it is built by Ferrari on the
modem to line so it's got some real
pedigree this one is a 3 litre v6 true
twin turbo not a two-stage single turbo
so there's one for each bank on this car
direct injection highly variable cam
timing pretty much all the modern tricks
are in here
some numbers 410 horsepower 405
foot-pounds of torque zero to sixty
happens in 4.7 seconds for a car that
weighs over 4100 pounds
it gets pretty good mpg of 1525 and all
that through an 8-speed automatic on all
Ghibli's no matter which trim you get
because we have a q4 all-wheel drive we
of course have all four wheels driven on
demand that means the rear does all the
work normally but when the car needs
traction because of slip or for
performance they can call in the front
wheels and get almost a perfect split of
traction across the - speaking of
perfect splits by the way this car is
weight on the ground is a perfect 50/50
it's a pretty good accomplishment yep
got a crick in my back standing kind of
funny it's cuz I got the Maserati key on
the right side oh this is the biggest
heaviest key yet maserati said it's okay
it fits in a purse and you'll never have
to use it that's all keyless well it's
pushing a quarter pound that thing
compared to an iPhone it's just about
the same league that's huge
it's interesting driving the Ghibli is
quite quick
but how fast does it feel and how fast
does it sound they spent a lot of time
laboring over the exhaust note in this
car give it a listen this engine is
incredibly smooth out II like to be
honest that's the first thing that came
to mind shifts are quick especially when
you engage two things here M for manual
no that's toggle between manual and
automatic and s for sport mode also a
toggle engage them both of you have your
sharpest possible evening of course
we've got a turbo v6 instead of a larger
v8 we're looking at here is a car that
has very limited turbo lag but it does
have turbo motor feel it's not got that
immediate kick or grunt what it does do
though is breathe amazingly well once
you get to about 2500 Wow there's just
no end of the lungs on this car but that
super low bottom and pump that is
definitely got a little delay around it
now we start our little Odyssey with the
Ghibli I said cheaper and that's because
that's what it is we're starting about
seventy seven thousand dollars base on
this car then you start to add the seen
that style towards the premium setup is
eighteen hundred bucks for power movable
pedals remote start rain sensor for the
wipers and parking sensors the biggest
thing on the list though is Bowers &amp;amp;
Wilkins audio at over five thousand
dollars I was impressed not sure I was
that impressed a power of sunshade is
six hundred and seventy a hotspot
although I wouldn't get it is 720 the
skyhook adaptive suspensions a little
over three grand and if you're going to
splurge on B&amp;amp;W audio you may as well
kick in another 1200 to get laminated
sound deadening glass down the sides of
the car to match that that's in the
windshield base now we're in about
eighty nine five all in still
comfortably below a hundred CNET style
and comfortably differentiated in the
Maserati lino
