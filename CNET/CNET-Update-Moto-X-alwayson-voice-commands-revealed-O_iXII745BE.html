your command I'm Bridget Carey and this
is your cnet update Motorola's new
flagship smartphone the Moto X will be
listening to you and awaiting your voice
command even when you're not touching it
at least that's one of the features
mentioned an elite promo video about the
upcoming smartphone the video was made
by the Canadian telecom provider Rogers
and in it a woman shows how to pull up
weather information without touching the
phone on her desk she simply says ok
Google now what's the forecast for today
and the phone responds this video also
mentions a new camera feature to turn on
the camera users will twist their wrist
twice and the camera app will be
activated a photo can then be snapped by
tapping anywhere on the screen this
phone has not even been officially
unveiled yet by motorola the leaked
video was posted on someone's Google+
page and it was first reported by the
Australian Android blog Austrade but
this isn't the only sneak peek we've
gotten of the mysterious Moto X Google's
executive chairman Eric Schmidt was seen
last week using it in public at a media
conference this will be the first
smartphone released by motorola mobility
since the company was acquired by google
and we're expecting the Moto X to be
launched sometime in the summer the
rumors about smartwatches continue to
roll in among the latest reports
Microsoft is putting its surface tablet
team in charge of crafting a SmartWatch
and that the Xbox accessories team was
previously trying to develop a prototype
watch that would come with a heart rate
monitor that's according to the verge
and as for Apple the Financial Times
reports Apple has gone on a hiring spree
to bring in more talent to create an
iWatch apparently the iWatch team is up
against some difficult engineering
challenges and it may pay to order car
service on the uber app if you can share
a ride with your friends because now the
applets users split the cost of a ride
among multiple passengers as long as
everyone has the uber app sometimes it
pays to not be the first to buy a gadget
Microsoft has cut the prices of its
surface tablets now the entry level 32
gig model without a keyboard costs 300
and fifty dollars it used to cost five
hundred dollars looks like Microsoft is
hoping the lower price will win over
back-to-school shoppers the surface is
also discounted for schools and
universities Microsoft is leading these
institutions by the tablets for as low
as 200 dollars each and blackberrys
flagship smartphone the z10 it's also
discounted it originally sold for two
hundred dollars with a contract but AT&amp;amp;T
and Verizon are selling it for a hundred
dollars and you can even find it for
fifty bucks at amazon and best buy
