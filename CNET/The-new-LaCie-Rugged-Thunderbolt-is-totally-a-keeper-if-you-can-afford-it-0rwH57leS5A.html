rugged Thunderball all-terrain purple
drive from lesea now it's not to be
confused with these rugged you speed
through tangled funnybone series that
came out two years ago the look seemed
simpler but on the inside and outside
the new dry is very different from the
Oh tomorrow now on the outside there is
layer of rubber right here to keep the
drive from shock and drop but now there
is a little right here to keep is USB
3.0 port for moisture and dust so the
question is where is the Thunderbolt
port well there's none because with this
new drive here it comes with a built-in
Thunderbolt cable that highs around is
Sai right here
very smart you can take the cable out
like this and put the lid back on now
the dry is protected even when it's in
operation you can even peel the cable
out just a little bit if you don't want
to put the drive too far from the host
computer now if you take out the outer
case on the inside you can see there is
a very rugged aluminum casing right here
this I to withstand questioning fourth
let me show you even I can I put a dent
that's how strongly you can also survive
from 6.6 feet or 2 meter height but
don't drop it on your foot though
because I don't think your toe can
survive that well let me show you what
happened to mine there you go
disgusting isn't it actually just don't
deliberate drop your drive at all or
bike over it with your SUV that's
because it drive here is designed so
that you don't have to handle it with
care the way you're supposed to do with
other storage device it's not meant to
be a weapon or an anger management
device and that's the outside on the
inside the drive here comes with a must
faster so stay dry and in my testing
with fundable it registered very fast
wheel will sustain speed up some 300
megabyte per second for writing and some
330 megabytes per second for greeting
that is right now the fastest among
purple drives on the market now when
used with USB 3.0 it also one of the
fastest you can find the dry also works
with your speed 2.0 now you know I love
this dry especially the design but
there's one thing though is the lid
right here it seems like you can lose it
very easily and I just lost it
but take a look here oh is here again
that's right the dry here come with two
lids so the question is what happened if
you lose the second one too well in that
case I go buy another drive and with the
money you spent on it you will remember
really well not to misplace anything and
that's because a drive here is not cheap
at all it costs them $300 for 250
gigabyte or $500 for 500 gigabyte you
totally what they've done
now if extreme performance is not what
you care about you can also offer the
hard drive version of the drive right
here
that's cause - or $20 for one terabyte
or $300 for two terabyte I'm on the
drive here check out my full review at
CENTCOM you know it's a great drive for
somebody like me and so I'm a very
humble man with extremely strong grip or
maybe not too humble but one thing for
sure though I'm dumb no and this has
been the first look at the rocket
Thunderball all-terrain turbo drive
