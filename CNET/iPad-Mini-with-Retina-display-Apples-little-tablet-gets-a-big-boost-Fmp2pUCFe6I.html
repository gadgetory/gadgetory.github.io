iPad Mini with Retina display you know
it was a year ago that we looked at the
iPad Mini and we said well here's a
small really light iPad what's it
missing Retina well in 2013 you get the
retina and it's finally available on
sale now but there are two things first
of all it's expensive 399 is the
starting price so it's more expensive
than last year's iPad Mini but also it's
got a lot more under the hood it's got
an a7 processor it's got a Retina
display that's the same resolution as
the iPad air that was just released and
it's got all the other bells and
whistles as the larger iPad so really
it's a shrunken down larger iPad that
you're saving 100 bucks on does it's not
a bad deal if you're looking for a
top-of-the-line tablet but it's
expensive if you're looking for a really
small tablet if you hold it in your
hands it doesn't feel any different than
last year's Mini it's a little bit
heavier 0.73 pounds and the display
again the resolution is 2048 by 1536
that is a very high resolution 326
pixels per inch so it's a higher ppi
then the iPad air and that bests just
about everything else that's out there
compared to get something like the more
affordable tablet market however you can
see there are a lot of tablets with
super high resolution displays Kindle
has got high resolution fired tablets
now you've got the Nexus 7 which has a
1080p display in a 7-inch tablet held
side-by-side this still has a higher
pixel resolution but you can see that
there's a lot of stuff out there
competing well this has got under the
hood though that a7 processor and an m7
processor for tracking and it's also got
better LTE and Wi-Fi in here for faster
throughput and better range and you can
only if you do opt up for the LTE
version know that this will work across
the world and across carriers you can
sim slots content so you don't have to
pick one particular carrier to stick
with which is nice so all of that adds
up to a lot of things that the
competition doesn't have no there's no
touch ID what do you use this for
well definitely for better reading for
videos for games and the good news about
the mini is that for all the
apps that we've thrown at it that I've
thrown at it you can see that they all
work really well in this size they don't
feel cramped and so that's why having
that bump up compared to last year is
helpful I mean if you had the iPad Mini
that at an a5 processor this goes up to
the a7 so it's kind of like a two-year
leap in terms of performance upgrade
compared to your year over year and
iPads does that mean you should upgrade
well you know some people may still
prefer the iPad Mini because that's $100
less expensive and the screen for a lot
of people might look perfectly fine if
you pay for the LTE you're paying an
extra hundred thirty dollars more so it
starts at 529 then you start bumping up
to something like 128 gigabytes which is
the top-end configuration and you're
looking at something that's pushing $800
now I'm not generally one for taking
pictures on my iPad but the front-facing
FaceTime HD camera in the new iPad Mini
has better light sensitivity and makes
you look generally snazzier the only
other thing that's different in the box
is that there's now a 10 watt charger as
opposed to the 5 so the brick is a
little bit larger and that's it if you
wanted to get retina and an iPad Mini
this is the time you do have to spend a
little more money the funny thing is
though the iPad air is pretty close in
weight 0.732 one pound and has the same
specs and a larger screen which some
people may like for watching movies do
you pay $100 or more for that do you
save a hundred and get this
I'm Scott Stein and that is a look at
the new iPad Mini with Retina display
available once again in black or space
gray we should call it or white silver</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
