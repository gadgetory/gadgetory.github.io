look at the toshiba satellite you 845 t
this is a very generic-looking laptop
but i mean that in a good way and that
it is exactly middle of the road it's
got a brushed metal exterior it's kind
of ultrabook thin it's kind of Intel
Core i5 128 gig SSD a touch screen and a
backlit keyboard all the things we want
to see in kind of a mainstream laptop at
a very mainstream friendly price that
799 and that makes this a lease for the
moment kind of by default go to if you
want a laptop that's kind of a midsize
mid-priced pretty darn good laptop now
you could spend a little bit Lori get
something that's a little bit thinner a
little bit lighter you could spend less
and get something that's still a core i
series laptop with a touchscreen for
maybe 5 50 or so but it's going to be a
thicker bulkier more plastic model I
really think that this particular system
really does hit that sweet spot
especially because it is so thin and has
such a great kind of ultrabook style
design and the brush metal the backlit
keyboard kind of upscale features like
that now it's not all perfect I'm not a
huge fan of the current generation of
toshiba satellite keyboards all the keys
are kind of squished down the little
rectangular as opposed to square a
little bit of flex right in the middle
and I've never really liked the really
small short space bars you have on a lot
of toshiba laptops there's also only one
USB 3 port a cup of older USB to ones I
think everybody should be using the
higher speed connection at this point
but if you want something that's not too
expensive still looks pretty nice I
think starting off at least with this
model as your default beginning point to
start examining what to get you may find
that it's exactly the right model for
you i'm dan ackerman and that is the
toshiba satellite you 845 t</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
