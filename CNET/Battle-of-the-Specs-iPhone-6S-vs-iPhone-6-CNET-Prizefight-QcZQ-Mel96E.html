and the iPhone 6s is here so to get you
ready
it's a prizefight battle the specs break
down between the iPhone 6 and the iPhone
6s let's start off with the tale the
tape it's their weight and dimensions
the iPhone 6s brings an ever so slightly
larger size at 138.236.128.7 hd480 but
the 6s is 3d touch pressure-sensitive
screen is a hardware feature that no
other major phone has and it's a
flagship feature of this new phone with
its reinforced glass the iPhone 6s
brings its 64-bit a 9 processor and 2
gigs of RAM over the iPhone 6 is a 8
processor with only 1 gig of ram with
claims of 70% faster CPU performance and
90% faster graphics the Geekbench
benchmarks tell the story here with the
6s is single core score of 1811 over the
iPhone 6s 1633 and a huge jump with the
6s is multi-core score of 45 77 over the
iPhone 6s 29 2000 fingerprint scanner is
twice as fast on the new 6s
wireless connectivity has been improved
with LTE advanced for data speeds twice
as fast and improved Wi-Fi that doubles
the speed as well compared to the iPhone
6 and we won't forget about one of the
most important parts of a phone these
days the camera
the iPhone 6s brings that improved 12
megapixel camera compared to the sixes 8
megapixels but the new camera now
records 4k video and can take Apple's
new live photos and its front-facing
FaceTime camera has been improved to 5
megapixels and uses the screen as a
flash now the iPhone 6s brings a
slightly smaller battery capacity with a
17 15 milliampere hour battery compared
to the iPhone 6 is 18 10 milliampere
hours but both bring the same 14 hour
battery talktime internal storage
capacities will stay the same at 16 64
and 128 gigs and pricing will vary
depending on your carrier your location
and if you're using Apple's iPhone
upgrade program so there you go we've
stacked up the major stats for you to
consider and yes the next generation of
a phone should be an improvement but the
iPhone 6s is arguably their biggest leap
when it comes to the S line of their
phones bottom line if you're an iPhone
user that's ready to upgrade this one's
a no-brainer
