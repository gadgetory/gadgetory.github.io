from Philips it's going to put a ZigBee
bulb and a ZigBee switch in your home
and what that's going to do is allow you
to wirelessly control the light turn it
on and off and dim it using this little
handy remote you can stick the switch
plate up on your wall wherever you like
no wiring necessary and then from there
take the remote out and use it to
control the bulbs wherever you like now
this is a lot simpler than the typical
Phillip T product you're not going to
need the Philips eBridge you're not
going to need the Philips you app you
can leave your phone in your pocket and
just use the switch with the bulb
directly if you want you can add in a
Phillip T bridge or if you already have
one and then make this bulb a lot
smarter at that point it will work with
all of Philips use third party
integrations with IFFT and the nest and
amazon echo out of the box just like
this won't work with any of that
you can't even schedule it to turn on in
the morning or turn on at night you
can't do any of that unless you have the
bridge still I think the simple approach
is pretty appealing the installation is
especially nice you just take this
little plastic tab out of the bottom of
the remote there and just like that it's
paired up took me about five seconds out
of the box get this thing up and running
I also like that the bulb dims very well
it goes down all the way below 1% at
that minimum setting and that maximum
setting gives you over 800 lumens we
clocked it right at 801 so very accurate
in its claims and a very nice bulb
overall in terms of the specs what's
also nice is that $40 price point now
this won't change colors like a normal
philips hue bulb doesn't have that
novelty factor but it is an accessible
smart light a more affordable option
than those $200 starter kits for the
color changing varieties i like that if
you're curious about smart lighting but
don't want to buy in on that level this
is a nice way to sort of differ feet
into those waters for more check out my
full first take at cnet.com and filled
your lighting questions my way on
