the Fujifilm xq1 delivers pretty
excellent photo quality just not as
cheaply the camera incorporates Fuji
films aps-c sized x-trans sensor the
sensor uses a non-standard color filter
array layout so it can drop the
softening anti-aliasing filter that
combined with really good JPEG
processing results in excellent photos
as high as ISO 1600 and really usable
ones through ISO 6400 it's also got
great dynamic range and good color to
the flip side however is relatively poor
video quality with a lot of edge
artifacts that the anti-aliasing filter
usually deals with it also has pretty
severe rolling shutter artifacts the
camera has a really nice design though
with an excellent electronic viewfinder
and photographer friendly physical
controls well I wish the LCD could tilt
to articulate the EVF is probably a
solid trade-off it has a more analog
feel than other cameras with a manual
shutter speed dial exposure compensation
dial and a kit lens that has a manual
aperture ring there are physical
controls for all the frequently needed
settings plus a programmable function
button and a threaded remote socket in
the shutter button the surprisingly good
on-camera flash can be tilted back to
bounce or to reduce intensity easily the
grips a lot shallower than I'd like but
it's not bad the one design drawback
will affect tripod users the tripod
socket is right next to the battery and
SD card compartment which makes swapping
hard the feature sets pretty
unremarkable though there's almost
everything here that most serious
photographers might want it just like
spells like connectivity GPS expansive
bracketing controls time lapse and so on
the real downsides performance it's okay
but it lacks its competitors and though
it can burst at about 5.7 frames per
second it can only do it with fixed
focus and exposure if you're looking for
great photo quality with a moderately
analog like shooting experience the XC 1
is it it's just not the most
well-rounded option
