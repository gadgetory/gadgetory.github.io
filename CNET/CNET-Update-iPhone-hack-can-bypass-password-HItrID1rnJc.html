digital pet I'm Bridget Carey and this
is your cnet update iPhone owners just
because you have a password on your lock
screen doesn't mean all your info
guarded from strangers there's a pretty
easy to do hack for getting into
someone's iPhone without knowing the
lockscreen password and a YouTube video
is going around showing just how it's
done i'm not encouraging you that you
try this hack rather it's good to be
aware of what's possible so this
sequence of steps involves coming close
to turning off the phone placing an
emergency call and holding the power
button and when you do it right it opens
up access for a user to listen to
voicemails place calls and look through
contacts but that's as far as it goes if
you try to open up another app it'll
take you back to the passcode screen if
your phone is ever stolen remember you
can use an app like find my phone if
your GPS is turned on or contact your
carrier to see if they can remotely wipe
any data or brick the phone so it can't
be used there's another bug Apple's
focused on fixing it's affecting people
who connect to an exchange account on an
iOS device the recent operating system
update is causing battery drain because
it excessively communicates data with
exchange servers Apple set a fix is
coming in another software update in the
meantime you can avoid this bug by just
not responding to an exception to a
recurring event on your device also in
smartphone news the research firm IDC
broke down which smartphones were the
most popular during the end of last year
now this is based on shipments Android
dominated seventy percent of the market
a big jump from the same time last year
when it made up about half of the market
and Samsung was behind much of that
success Apple was in second place with
about twenty percent and blackberry came
in third with an 80 bitty piece of the
pie just three-point-two percent market
share windows phone shipments did
increase during the fourth quarter but
it was only making up about two point
six percent of the market and speaking
of windows firefox is working on a
touched base browser for the windows 8
operating system it's still in testing
but it's called Firefox nightly and it
lets users navigate with swipes and
stood
using a menu bar and if you're feeling
lonely without someone to love on
Valentine's Day well I got just the
Android app for you ladies and gents the
Tamagotchi has been reborn in app form
called tamagotchi life this free app was
just released the google play store it's
been 16 years since band i first came
