lot of high-tech innovation in power
plants as cars increasingly are hybrid
or plug-in hybrid or pure electric they
don't emit those aural engine cues that
told you there's a car behind you sorry
and that means a whole lot more
scenarios wear them and you can come
into contact in a bad way so the u.s.
pass to the pedestrian safety
enhancement act it requires that quiet
electrified cars intentionally make some
kind of noise up to 18 miles per hour
above that speed tire noise and other
mechanical sounds tend to have a
sufficient audio signature to warn
pedestrians now what kind of sound is a
question of much debate listen to some
of the sounds the industry's toyed with
tell me you aren't in the transporter on
the enterprise car makers want to be in
charge of that decision so the noise is
one they feel is pleasing to their car
own not annoying the sound is a major
part for the brand of the vehicle so as
electric vehicles could potentially
sound like anything manufacturers having
to think quite carefully about what what
their electric vehicle should sound like
others argue that all electrified cars
should make the same noise so
pedestrians can learn a consistent sound
and know that's a car specially designed
directors speakers emit sound in the
driving direction and nowhere else it's
probably somewhere in the middle enough
leeway for car makers to sound what they
want to sound but within limits
so parking lots don't end up sounding
like a cell phone shop full of ringtones
how important is this our partners at
State Farm point to a federal estimate
that there could be a reduction of
around 2,800 injury accidents between
pedestrians and cyclists and these new
quiet breed of cars over the lifetime of
each model year</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
