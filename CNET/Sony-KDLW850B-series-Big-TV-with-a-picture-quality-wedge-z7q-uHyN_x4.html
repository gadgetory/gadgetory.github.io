editor from CNET and next to me is
sony's 60-inch kdl 60w 850 B this is
Sony sort of mid range TV for 2014 it's
a 60-inch LCD there's also a 70 inch
size in the series one of the first
things you'll notice about this TV is
its strange design from the side Sony
calls it a wedge-shaped design so the TV
kind of tapers toward the top and the
screen angles back a little bit the
whole effect is a lot thicker than most
LED based LCDs out there but on the flip
side sony says you get better sound we
did test the sound quality in this TV
and while it does sound better than some
of those LCDs out there it's really not
spectacular and a dedicated sound bar
I'll get you a lot better sound moving
on to the design this TV's seen from the
front is relatively normal the only real
difference is this little feat here on
either side this is a new design thing
that a lot of TV manufacturers are doing
this year it improves the stability of
the TV Sony allows you to actually take
these feet off and move them toward the
middle if you want a more traditional
look or you don't have a wide enough
piece of furniture to accommodate this
TVs width aside from that the TV's
design is relatively basic with a nice
thin frame around the edge of the screen
and a pretty much matte black finish
Sony's feature set is pretty extensive
on this TV it includes a smart TV suite
that has all the apps you'd expect
although I didn't find them a little bit
more difficult to find
for example Netflix is kind of hidden in
the bottom along with Amazon Sony's
content on the other hand is pushed
right to the front so as soon as you
click on the smart TV suite you're asked
to choose from among some Sony videos
from their online video on-demand
service as well as music from Sony and
other services I'd like to see a little
more easy access to those apps like
Netflix and Amazon that people use a
little more frequently finding those
additional apps is also a little bit
difficult because there's this massive
firehose of apps that are not really
categorized that well and there's
hundreds to choose from of course once
you do find it you can add it to Sony's
favorite app screen another feature on
this TV is 3d compatibility Sony does
throw in two pairs of 3d glasses it's
the active variety we did find the 3d on
this set was a little bit disappointing
we're asking Sony what the problem was
we noticed there was some artifacts
there that we don't normally see on 3d
perhaps the company will push out a fix
but in the meantime don't buy this TV
for its 3ds capability picture quality
on the 850 B is very good it has nice
deep black levels not quite as deep as
some of the better TVs we've seen it's
contrast is also a little bit less
because
you achieving those deep blacks the TV
actually tends to mute highlights a
little bit so you have slightly less
contrast color is very accurate although
again there's a little bit of an orange
tint to the red but really not enough to
make a huge deal
thanks Fitz Matt screened the TV is
excellent in a bright room and it does
mute those reflections very well which
is really important on a TV this large
connectivity is ample on the Sony with
four HDMI to USB a component video input
and a standard video input
you also get an IR blaster included with
this TV that will control your cable box
if you want to take advantage of that
functionality the TV includes a standard
remote but Sony does have the option to
add a 50-dollar touchpad clicker if you
want to get around the menus a little
bit faster so in some aside from 3d this
TVs picture quality is very good it is a
little bit more expensive than some of
the 16 inch TVs out there but if you're
in this range and you like the design
it's definitely worth a look that's a
quick peek at Sony's KD lw8 50 D series
