watch ever since last year where was a
big success on Kickstarter this dream of
a SmartWatch with apps has been kicking
ran and finally is being released to
early adopters except now we're
surrounded by smartwatches seemingly
everywhere there are a lot of these
little devices that are all promising
the dream of living this futuristic
interconnected life with something
wearable on your wrist or maybe later
this year on your glasses kind of cool
accept it all boils down to what does it
do and what makes it worth the money
that you're paying the pebble is $150
and if you look at the website you see
what it's promising it suggests a
plethora of features notifications
health apps an open SDK that allows a
whole bunch of applications to be
developed in the future and of course
very cool retro watch faces some of
those are available now others aren't
what you get right off the bat that does
work is you get the interchangeable
watch faces which are cool but are a lot
like kind of like we got with the iPod
Nano if you ever wore that and slapped a
wristband around it which I did and love
doing the pebble watch also connects via
bluetooth to get a bunch of
notifications post it up to your watch
turning it to a kind of like a pager you
get your SMS your texts your eye
messages you get your phone calls coming
in you can screen them on the watch if
you've been dreaming of doing that
what's the point I mean why don't you
just pull out your phone well if you're
busy if you're in a loud noisy place if
you've got a really important phone call
at home it's kind of fun to be able to
screen that call and make sure you don't
miss it there's also an additional
feature of music playing now what that
means here is really showing you a
display of what's being played on your
app on your phone and allows you to skip
and pause the track and not change the
volume it does work on iOS with not just
the music player but with Spotify any
radio app anything that's Bluetooth
hooked now as far as the health tracking
stuff well that is not here yet when it
does arrive I think a lot of people will
be interested the pebble does have an
accelerometer built-in and it has
magnetometer so there's no reason why it
can't be perfectly capable of doing that
type of activity there's just no app
that takes it
of it yet there is a pebble app that you
can download on iOS or Android that is
currently available and works pretty
easily for pairing and for removing and
adding apps which right now amount to
watch faces it's cool though how easily
you can remove and add those apps via
bluetooth it will be interesting to see
one more of those become available and
if pebble will be allowed to charge
within that app or not on Android you do
get a few more third-party apps that are
floating around out there
that are interesting there's a there's a
couple of random title chart apps and
other things like that the style here is
definitely more Casio geek tech than the
retro Dick Tracy on the Martian watch
that I reviewed before $150 the Pebble
watch is half the price of the Martian
watch but it also has much more of a
plasticy geek look which may not be for
everybody the monochrome ePaper display
is not a Inc but it's a black-and-white
LCD that's highly reflective and also as
an anti-glare coating you can see it has
a decent resolution for playing games
like the built-in apps snake but don't
expect it to be anything very advanced
battery life is one of the limitations
to and it's a problem across
smartwatches 2 to 7 days I found it was
a little more like 2 it does come with a
USB charge cable that magnetically
connects easily just be careful not to
lose it because there aren't any other
cables I know of that connect like that
another really nice thing about the
pebble it is 5 ATM resistant to water so
they suggest you can swim with it you
can take a shower with it that's up to
you if you're feeling that bold but you
certainly could wear it while washing
your hands the pebble SDK should provide
a lot more life for this device we're
gonna have to see what apps come out for
it and where it's going to hold its
place and the SmartWatch wars whether
it'll be something that people will
remember or whether it's gonna be a blip
on the radar
I'm Scott Stein and that's a look at the
