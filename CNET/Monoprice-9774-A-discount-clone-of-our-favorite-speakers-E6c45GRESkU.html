we're taking a look at one of the most
intriguing products I've seen in a long
time
the monoprice 9 774 now monoprice is
best known for selling cheap hdmi cables
but the company has started to make more
traditional consumer electronics at
pretty incredible prices what makes the
9 774 so interesting is one it's a 5.1
speaker system selling for just under
250 dollars and 2 it's almost identical
to our longtime favorite budget speaker
system the energy take classic 5.1 which
costs nearly a hundred and fifty dollars
more and I'm not exaggerating when I say
they're identical if you put the two
speakers next to each other the
resemblance is striking with the finish
and design looking almost exactly the
same the satellite in center channel
speakers have the same point 75 inch
tweeter and 3 inch driver and around
back the binding posts are the same too
the only real difference is the logo and
the speaker grilles where the energy has
a rounded edges and the monoprice grill
is more square now side by side the
energy subwoofer looks taller but that's
only because the plastic feet on the
bottom are bigger the actual sub is the
same size and they both have the same
8-inch down firing subwoofer the base
port on the energy looks bigger too but
that's only because of the shape of the
surrounding plastic the port itself is
the same size you can even see the back
panel controls are laid out in the same
pattern and these speakers don't just
look similar they both offer the same
outstanding sound quality that's really
exceptional considering their compact
size we had the mono price and energy
speaker set up side-by-side in the same
room and while it's always hard to say
that any two products sound exactly
identical these were as close as you can
get the mono price speakers sounded
truly fantastic with movies and they
held their own with music too which is
tough for speakers as small the next
best value is the Pioneer SP PK 52 FS
system which does sound considerably
better but it costs over $600 and it's a
much larger system
really my only hesitation with the
monoprice 977 for system is more of an
ethical one
there's no denying these speakers feel
like counterfeit versions of the energy
speakers and I definitely had some
reservations about recommending a
product that at least feels like it
ripped off the design and engineering
work of another company however there's
also been no formal complaint from
energy or their parent company clips
even though it's been two months since I
made them aware of the mana price
speakers so maybe they're on the up and
up the bottom line is that at the moment
the mono price nine seven seventy four
is the best home audio value on the
market which is why it is our editors
choice award whether you feel right
buying them is a decision you'll have to
make I'm Matthew Muscovy ak and this is
the monoprice 9 774</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
