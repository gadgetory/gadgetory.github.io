answering some of your emails about
high-tech cars and modern driving in
just about all the ones we've received
lately have to do with this VW emissions
debacle some of our questions come in
from Chris C in Chicago who says you
know in the u.s. we kind of just seemed
to hate Diesel's for some reason you
think the media is just zooming in on
the problem especially hard
Kelvin's C says I know you like diesel
engines he's referring to me and I do
I'd love to hear your perspective on why
VW would do this and what a repair would
look like for VW diesel owners and Peter
T says how about a discussion of old vs.
new diesel technology that helped enable
this scandal to happen in the first
place this is an unprecedented issue in
the auto industry sure we've had some
big debacles before I mean look back at
what's happened with Toyota gauge that
was the unintended acceleration Hyundai
and Ford had some issues with stated
versus observed mpg that were pretty
stark General Motors still working
through an enormous recall on badly
designed ignition switches Jeep had some
unprotected rear fuel tanks that were a
big problem and of course takata's
massive recall of airbags that explode
but all of those are in a different
category than what volkswagen has done
the revelation of some 11 million
Volkswagen and Audi turbo diesel powered
cars have technology to willfully and
repeatedly skirt emissions standards is
truly unprecedented specifically VW
engineered the software in their engine
ECU on these cars that's the engine
electronic control unit to sense when
it's hooked up to an emissions testing
program and then to modify its own
software parameters to meet low emission
standards got it then when the car
sensed it was disconnected from an
emissions test it went to a different
profile entirely that allowed it to get
better performance but at vastly higher
emissions 10 to 40 times the legal
allowed rate and to do it actively when
not connected to an emissions test is
what is so evil about this not that many
years ago
engine control units weren't that
sophisticated it would have been almost
impossible for VW to engineer this kind
of deceitful behavior I've had a lot of
folks there wish it were those days
right now they wouldn't have been able
to step in it like they did instead
they've taken a huge hit on many fronts
it's cost them who knows how much in
market value it's measured in billions
of euros
they've lost their CEO they've yet to
even see likely billions in penalties
from US regulators and they've got to
figure out what to do with all those
cars on the road somewhere from an
expensive re-engineering and recall to
possibly the largest buyback in
automotive history and they've given
diesel cars a black eye on the US market
a market that was already kind of
sketchy on them in the first place
in all it's an amazing case of an
automaker abusing the sophisticated
power of modern electronic engine
technology
