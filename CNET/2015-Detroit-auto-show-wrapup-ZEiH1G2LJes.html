north american international auto show
better known as the Detroit Auto Show
arm Tim Stevens I'm antuan goodwin and
I'm Wayne Cunningham we are happy to
give you a quick rundown of some of our
favorite cars from the show this year is
a very busy show this year pretty
exciting a little bit exhausting for us
as we're coming off the heels of the
International Consumer Electronics Show
in Las Vegas but it's always been a fun
to Joe straight here and jump right in
the car things I'll start I'll Terrell
my favorite car the show probably the
biggest car of the show the new Ford GT
supercar there's a lot of expectation
for this car but for successfully kept
it under wraps before the show we didn't
see any League pictures anything like
that and it is an amazingly great
looking car our really interesting
design they went with a fuselage type
design basically which means the rear
wheels are on pontoons it's hard to
explain without seeing it flesh but it's
really really interesting cars got
similar lines to the original GT and
gt40 but a very different looking car
beautiful looking car really exciting
600 horsepower twin-turbo v6 different
sort of powertrain than before but
pretty exciting stuff yea though we also
saw the acura nsx which is I think a
little more highly anticipated than the
GT because really the GT was just
rumored a little bit about before the
show NSX we've been seeing concepts for
the last three years we finally got the
production 30 years more like it yeah
actually a really amazing looking car to
cedar mid-engine sports car yet beyond
that it's also a hybrid it's got three
electric motors in it two electric
motors driving the front wheels engine
longitude Lee mounted driving the rear
wheels so all-wheel drive hybrid could
be good fuel economy didn't talk about
that but total system power comes up to
over 550 horsepower was all they're
willing to commit to you would you say
this Ricardo show I think so i think it
had a huge crowd around it yeah and
again acura built up all that
anticipation for the car it's got the
historical side to it as well I mean
everybody loves the original NSX all the
one thing I got to say about that when
acura introduced it they said oh this is
great this is going to be an American
car it's designed in America built in
Ohio and I just thought
kind of missing the the Japanese
mystique of the previous car all the
people that were into that previous car
I thought highly crafted you know
Japanese craftsmanship this one built in
Ohio so yeah Japanese craftsmanship with
tuning from Ayrton Senna of course
famously help to tune the car finally so
Brazilian tuning of the Japanese car now
an American car in a lot of ways which
is interesting but you know right for
America that's good definitely a great
story as well 150 ish thousand dollars
they were saying for that Ford would not
say how much they're going to charge for
the Ford GT just it would be more
expensive in the original Ford GT which
came about in 2005 that's car started at
140 thousand dollars but of course was
quickly sold for a lot more than that so
there are lots of speculation might be
well over two hundred thousand dollars
which would be interesting to see I
think the Ford GT would probably be in
the more fun to drive if only because
it's only rear-wheel drive versus
all-wheel drive but ultimately yeah I
think they had a sex would be the more
practical the two for sure Angela what
was your favorite car of the show I'm
gonna go in a completely opposite
direction but the car my car the show
was the the new Chevy Volt 2016 Chevy
Volt for the bolter the Volt the bolt
with the fee there were actually two
cars that were enough that found a lot
alike but the bolt because it takes a
car that a lot of people kind of
overlooked when they start thinking
about electric cars in about plug-in
hybrid and it just incrementally makes
everything about it better the electric
range is up from 38 miles 250 that
should cover pretty much anybody is home
to work commute most drivers are never
going to get into the gasoline engine
portion of that but then when you factor
that in you can take this electric car
on a road trip and fill up at any
station they've also dramatically
improved the look of the whole a lot of
people including myself kind of
complained about how the first
generation bolt went from like a sweet
electric roadster and kind of became a
sort of boring angular sedan well this
new one looks really sharp really sporty
and then probably most importantly what
they've done if they completely revived
the interior I hated the interior the
first generation Bowl he had like a
thousand buttons
had a digital instrument cluster and
looked like it was put together by a
college student this new system just
looks a lot more better put together and
a lot easier on the eyes as far as less
distraction do the duck pricing they
didn't talk pricing but I don't
anticipate that it'll be much more than
the current bolt and the price of the
bolt recently actually just dropped for
the 2015 male years so it's going to be
reasonably affordable i think that
increased 250ml should really make a big
difference and jim did just say that the
average volt driver covers 900 miles on
a tank of gas which is pretty impressive
to think about you know the actual
gasoline range of the car is probably in
the two to three hundred mile range so
that's a lot of miles covered on battery
power for sure and of course they did
unveiled the bolts as well which was a
name that we're all having kind of fun
with but but that is a concept EV full
battery powered without to at a mile
range really yeah that's what they're
aiming for is to turn mile range and
they said they'd like to Saul up around
thirty thousand dollars and i've also
heard rumors haven't really verified any
of this yet that they're going to
produce it or they're trying to
production model in 2017 and that is
certainly goes up against the Tesla
Model 3 the Tesla's been talking up and
hasn't shown us anything yet so I think
in some ways Chevy kind of beats them to
the punch with the bolt what was kind of
cool looking it's kind of a versa shaped
car it's got a hatchback high roof line
a lot of glass around the cockpit so a
lot of visibility I'm not sure if they
can keep that or not in production it
might need a little more rigidity around
there but I kind of like the looks
actually yeah somewhat reminiscent of
the BMW i3 certainly a bit more
practical shape I think then the Volt
has been in the past and winters of
cargo and that kind of thing I'll be
able to see it'll be interesting fight
whether you'd rather go with the car
from GM or a car from Tesla in a couple
years but certainly I think if indeed
they produces car will be cheaper than
the Tesla's we all know what are the
stuff did you see the show that the cut
your away well speaking of concepts we
actually have read behind us here this
new Buick the a venir a vendor owner I
French its French me I think it's a
really nice looking car Antoine you did
a piece on this one yeah it kind of
harkens back to the sort of Buick
flagship cars of the past with the sort
of long hood really sort of like taper
tail it's a good-looking car and I think
that's pretty much the whole story there
if that you would really want to put
their design out front and really show
they can make good-looking cars
especially because most people think
about those 80s boxy Buicks when they
think about the brand and the Cadillac
showed off the cts-v basically taking on
the m5 next George so that's great we
saw the 80s feet not too long ago taking
on more than three series so great
looking car as well and a lot of great
concept cars and more talk about fuel
cells from Honda this year and overall a
lot great news from link the Auto Show I
think there's a good show lots of trucks
trucks all over the place that's a
druggie I you want to tell us about the
Hyundai have you yeah that was the car
that I did not expect to see here
Hyundai actually just announced that
they've got like a small sort of compact
crossover kind of pickup truck it's
about the size of the Hyundai Tucson and
it got this cool sort of tailgate that
slides out and gets about as long as you
need it to I don't expect Hyundai's
going to build it but then at one point
we didn't expect in a build a luxury car
i'm eating expect a little sports car
and they did all those things i'm kind
of holding onto hope that maybe they get
into this weird little segment on guy
loves to surprise any any closing
thoughts here from detroit before we we
shut things down yeah i don't think we
have a general theme at the show there's
well like i said a lot of trucks there's
a lot of energy here i mean it's
interesting Buick come out with stuff
there's a lot of new models on the show
floor and certainly that that really had
that duel between the supercars you know
the NSX and four GT is very interesting
it's great to see the economy is
obviously picking up the auto
manufacturers are definitely feeling
this well and that's good news for us
more news more great cars and good news
for you because lots of great sheet
metal to take a look at all right I
guess we call things to a close here in
Detroit Oh what's next for us in New
Yorkers in Geneva geneva auto show
because starts at the beginning of march
in march in geneva will be there
bringing you live coverage from the show
floor so look for to that until then we
are your seen that crew i had said the
