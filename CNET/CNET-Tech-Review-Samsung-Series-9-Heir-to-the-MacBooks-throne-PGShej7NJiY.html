use Amazon Cloud Player on your Android
phone how to turn on parental controls
on your iPhone how to get free ebooks
from the library boy that sure is a lot
of how to's all that and the samsung
series 9 are coming up right now
hi everyone I'm Molly wood and welcome
to the CNET tech review where we collect
our hottest videos of the week and tell
you what's good and what's bad in the
world of tech plus offer some unique
tech wisdom in the form of the bottom
line let's get started with the good in
really good news for those of you who
like me have digital music stored on
three different computers two old iPods
and an Android phone Amazon launched a
new cloud service for storing all your
tunes and then downloading them anywhere
which is awesome and here's how you use
it on your Android phone hi I'm Sharon
Vaknin for cnet.com here to show you how
to use amazon's cloud player with your
android device
sorry iPhone users you're going to have
to sit this one out
Amazon didn't release an app for you
first set up an account on amazon.com
and upload music to your account it's
pretty straightforward
you can upload almost any mp3 or AAC
files so music you've downloaded from
iTunes Amazon or other stores will work
you can also use music ripped from CDs
no matter where you got them Amazon
gives you the first five gigabytes of
storage free if you want to get more
storage through the end of the year you
can purchase an album from Amazon and
they'll bump you up to a total of 20
gigabytes for free for a year after your
purchase now you're ready to stream your
music library to your Android device
download the free Amazon mp3 app from
the Android Market once it's there go to
Cloud Drive music and sign in with your
Amazon account now you're ready to play
music you've uploaded to your cloud just
remember that your device must be
connected to your network or Wi-Fi to
stream music if you know you'll be off
the grid but still want to access your
music the app lets you download tracks
directly onto your device hit the green
arrow next to any playlist artist or
album to download multiple titles or
long-press any song to download a single
track the player also lets you create
and modify new playlists and access
music stored locally on your device you
can also use this app to purchase new
music from the Amazon mp3 store and save
it to your Cloud Drive for safekeeping
since amazon wants you to purchase music
from them purchases made from the store
won't be counted against your storage
capacity for now Amazon Cloud Player is
only available for Android devices Macs
and Windows computers expect to see more
developments around cloud storage though
Apple and Google should be jumping on
the bandwagon any time now for cnet.com
I'm Sharon Vaknin and I'll see you on
the interwebs I love that service so
much all right now speaking of Android
there are so many new phones and tablets
out there that you're probably looking
for ways to get the most out of your new
devices
well here's Antoine Goodwin with two
tasty tricks most Android users will get
their apps fix from the Android Market
but there are plenty of very cool apps
to be found outside of the market from
small developers and more recently from
third-party sources such as Amazon App
Store for Android now to the box your
Android phone will not allow you to make
use of these third-party apps plugging
them as untrusted sources but come on
you can trust Amazon right I'm Antoine
Goodwin with cnet.com and I'm gonna show
you how to enable third-party app
installation on your Android phone
now enabling this function is actually
quite simple just pop into your Android
phone setting menu look for the
applications option tap that and then
look for an option that says unknown
sources it's usually the first one here
but the placement can vary from phone to
phone check that box then back out of
the menu and why you'll be able to
install third-party apps from anywhere
now the apps themselves are usually
transported as apk files and can be
found all over the place the easiest
place will be from Amazon's app store
but don't let your hunt stop there often
time app makers will make beta versions
of their apps such as the swipe
alternative keyboard available on their
website which can be downloaded and
installed directly from your phone's
browser other places to look include
android hacking communities such as the
XDA developer forums or the droid forums
where devs are always
neat little applets that you can
download to your phone's SD card and
then access and install using a file
manager such as Astro
unfortunately access to the third-party
app installation function is at the
discretion of your wireless service
provider so for example users of AT&amp;amp;T
powered Android phones such as the Atrix
4G and Samsung Captivate are unable to
use or even see this option without
first rooting their phone and possibly
getting your hands dirty with some
command line action well there you have
it your now for you to get your apps
from wherever you darn roll please be
sure to check out the Android outlets
blog for even more Android tips and
tricks and seeing that TV for even more
how-to videos this has been Antwon go
with cnet.com showing you how it's done
we've all been there you're trying to
track down the group of friends in a
crowded park on a Sunday afternoon but
tell them that you're standing near that
one tree and a pack of hipsters isn't
very useful when there are dozens of
trees and literally hundreds of hipsters
I'm going to show you a quick way to
share your location with your friends
using a little more than your Android
phone the easiest way is to use a
location sharing service like Google
Latitude to keep your pals constantly
updated of your whereabouts
however services like this also require
that your friends sign up which they may
not be too keen on doing or may not even
have access to so here's how you send
your location to your friends using a
little more than Google Maps and a
well-placed text message or email pop
over into the Google Maps app and make
sure that your phone has an accurate fix
on your location by tapping the find me
button in the upper right corner of the
screen if you see a gigantic blue circle
surrounding your location then you only
have an approximate fix and you'll need
to wait a few seconds for your GPS
accuracy to improve or move to a spot
where you have a better view of the sky
once you're satisfied with your
positioning accuracy tap on the blue
arrow marking your location then tap the
text bubble that appears you'll be
brought to a menu that shows more
information and options relevant to
where you happen to be the option that
you're interested in is the one that
says send location to others tap that
and you'll be presented with a variety
sharing options you can now use your
male clients or text messaging app to
send your location to your pals on their
end they'll receive a Google Maps link
that can be used with the Google Maps
app on their Android or iPhone in the
Google Maps web app on any other phone
or computer or opened with any other
mapping app that supports Google Maps
coordinate system such as MapQuest you
can also use this message for sending
any address business or a meeting place
to your friends simply search for the
business for example your favorite
burrito spot and tap the location to
bring up the Places page then tap the
more options icon to share the location
complete which street address return by
turn directions with your friends using
the share this place option and that's
all there is to it you can now help your
friends find you wherever you are or
wherever you may be going without
compromising your or their privacy be
sure to check out the Android Atlas blog
for even more Android tips and tricks
and seeing that TV for more awesome
how-to videos this has been anthlon
Goodwin showing you how it's done you
could find me right here on CNET comm
naturally when it comes to mastering
your Android phone these tips only
scratch the surface but rest assured
we'll keep bringing you more Android
how-to advice all the time over at CNET
TV calm now if you iPhone and iPad folks
are feeling a little left out here's a
video that's just for you how to manage
the parental controls on your iOS device
hi I'm Sharon Vaknin for cnet.com here
with some advice that might save you a
lot of money we've heard many stories
about kids who spent hundreds of their
parents dollars on apps especially games
usually it's the in-app purchases that
rack up your iTunes bill like the $25
barrel of Smurf berries in Smurfs
village or a $20 jar of stars from taps
ooh maybe a few of you purchase happy
non parents should also take this advice
I've seen enough adults obsessed with
farmville to disable in-app purchasing
on your device go to settings general
than restrictions when you turn
restrictions on you'll be asked to set a
passcode pick one that no one can guess
now you can configure a number of
controls to disable in-app purchases
scroll down to allowed content and
switch it to off remember that on iOS
4.3 apple asks for your password each
time an in-app purchase is made but this
setting will completely disable these
purchases you can also disable the
installation of apps so that you choose
what goes on the device there may be
other things you don't want your kids
doing either like downloading explicit
music sharing their location or playing
games with strangers all those settings
and more are available here disabling
downloads and in-app purchases it's good
for passive control but here's an option
that will help your child learn about
budgeting iTunes has a little-known
feature called store allowance it lets
you send a monthly iTunes credit to
another user so you can give your child
$10 a month for app purchasing and they
can decide how it will be budgeted go to
the iTunes Store and click buy itunes
gifts scroll down to allowances and
click setup &amp;amp; allowance now before you
do this you'll need your own iTunes
account and the account of the person
who's getting the money if they don't
have one you can set one up in the next
window once you fill out the form select
the monthly allowance and you're set if
you ever want to make changes go to your
account information page allowance lets
kids learn about budgeting without
putting your credit card at risk if they
run out of money they'll have to wait
till next month
for cnet.com I'm Sharon Vaknin and I'll
you on the interwebs of course if you
make your parental control strict enough
your kids will probably lose all
interest in using your iOS devices
anyway so it's really a win-win
situation okay let's wrap up our how-to
extravaganza this week with a handy tip
that anybody can use no matter what
platform you're on assuming you like to
read that is I'm Sharon Vaknin for
cnet.com here to bring you back to the
good old days we're seeing
brick-and-mortar bookstores like
foreigners go bankrupt as cheap online
stores and ebooks are taking over so
let's help keep one thing alive
libraries today I'll show you how to
checkout ebooks and audiobooks from your
local library for free first you'll have
to get off the couch walk out the door
and head to your local library to get a
library card then download the overdrive
app it's available for almost every
platform including Windows Mac iOS
devices Android Blackberry and Windows
Mobile overdrive is like the Kindle or
iBooks apps for libraries once it's on
your device open the app hit get books
and then add a website you'll be asked
to find your library once you do select
the right library system now you're
ready to find a book to download here's
the annoying part though right now most
libraries only have a few copies or
licenses of each book you'll have to
think back to your childhood and
remember that if somebody else checked
out the book you want you'll have to
wait your turn each book can be loaned
out for up to 14 days so if three people
are on the waiting list ahead of you do
the math that's 42 days but every
library system has its own licenses for
e-books and audiobooks so you might have
to check a few libraries before finding
the copy of your book when you do find a
book that's ready for download hit add
to cart and checkout this is the one
you'll be asked to enter your library
card number now confirm your checkout
and hit download in the next screen
overdrive will reopen and begin the
download one thing to keep in mind is
that books downloaded with overdrive
can only be used with that app you won't
be able to open them in any other
ereader app like iBooks or Kindle
overdrive isn't for people who need
instant gratification so if that's what
you're looking for you'll probably have
to purchase your ebooks on digital
platforms or go to one of the few
physical bookstores left if you have any
how-to questions comments or ideas for
one of these videos email how to at Xena
com4 CNET I'm Sharon Vaknin and I'll see
you on the interwebs and the best part
you don't have to return the books when
you're done goodbye overdue charges
alright let's take a break but come
right back for more tech review right
after this
welcome back to the CNN tech review our
weekly video digest of all things good
and bad we've seen here at Sina TV
continuing on in the good switching
gears from phones and tablets let's talk
to laptops and tablets as Brian coolly
points out in this week's top 5 Apple
may have cornered the tablet market for
now but there are plenty of worthy
competitors nipping at Apple's heels
something like eighty-two percent of
people who are considering a tablet are
actually thinking of an iPad pretty
stark numbers from a recent survey by
change ways but I know you're more
creative than that
I'm Brian Cooley with top five tablets
to beat the iPad listed by their
ecosystem or platform number five
check this out the Barnes and Noble Nook
Color that's right an e-book reader but
if you root this Android based reader
bump it up to Android 2.2 Froyo you'll
get a very credible Wi-Fi tablet it only
costs about two and a half bills even
less if you root around
eBay to buy one and unlike the rest of
the tablets in our list it's actually a
real ebook reader with all that great
screen technology now it'll have no
access to 3g for data might be a little
unstable and routing will void the
warranty but what the hell you can
afford to buy two of these for the price
of most real tablets number four the
blackberry playbook here's another
category of one if you will the PlayBook
has been impressive in our hands it's
compact enough and it doesn't require
you go bag shopping the same day you buy
one and it uniquely pairs with your
blackberry to inherit contacts calendar
and email so it's like a blackberry that
does media well which is something we
weren't sure Rim would ever figure out
number three the Windows 7 tablets from
many of the big netbook names in most
cases like a soos Lenovo Samsung now
some people think a Windows 7 tablet is
kind of oxymoronic since tablets
normally have a lightweight operating
system and use apps and this is of
course a real operating system that uses
programs and with Apple and Android
blotting out the Sun these days
Windows 7 tablets are a bit of a dark
horse but 7 gets a lot of love for its
performance on netbooks and you know how
to use Windows right out the box and
Microsoft has the guts of a great tablet
OS already in Windows Phone 7 if it'll
just liberate it to go to tablets number
2 the HP TouchPad running webOS
everybody loves this operating system
but in the past no one liked any other
hardware it lived on the touchpad seems
to give webOS the kind of device it was
always meant for and don't forget HP is
the biggest seller of PCs they sell a
bajillion to consumers and businesses
they're spillage alone is more than many
companies actually make a living on so
they can move a tablet before we get to
our number one tablet that makes you
think twice about an iPad here's a look
at where tablets are going in 2011 after
selling about 18 million tablets nearly
all of them Apple in 2010 the
predictions are that in 2011 Apple
remains in a big lead role but the
tablet sales will soar to 45 maybe 58
million units this may be the fastest
hottest introduction in tech history
okay the number one tablet to make you
think twice before you pull the trigger
on an iPad is anything Android from a
Dell Streak 7 to a hefty Motorola Xoom
this platforms breakout success on
smartphones greases the skids with
consumers and developers alike and the
freed auto version of Android Honeycomb
is white-hot and tablet centric oh and
most of the new tablets that are gonna
come out period are gonna be Android
based they'll have multi carriers
support in most cases oh and that's the
other thing too they can display a flash
website ok those are the families to
watch like a bunch of mafiosi you got to
be careful the specific tablets are
breaking out weekly so stay on top at
CNET's tablets section it's the busiest
burner on our stove these days and for
more top 5s like this head to top-5
cnet.com
i'm brian coulis thanks for watching
I don't like the idea of routing a note
to turn it into more of a tablet than an
e-reader if only someone could show us
how to do that I'm looking at you Antwon
and Sharon in the meantime let's see
what we've got going on in the bag first
off let me just say that the Acer Iconia
isn't really all that bad but I had to
put something in the slot so let's take
a look at a laptop that's really cool
and no one's ever gonna buy that's the
bad part I'm Dan Ackerman and we are
here with a laptop we have been waiting
for for some time that is the Acer
Iconia and as you can see it ditches the
regular setup of a screen up on top and
a keyboard down here for two independent
14-inch touch screens that's a little
bit like a Nintendo DS or maybe like
your iPad because you're supposed to use
an on-screen keyboard to type now the
way you get to that on-screen keyboard
is simply by taking ten of your fingers
and resting them lightly on the bottom
screen and that pops up a keyboard that
works about as well as the one on the
iPad does which means that you'll need a
few days of sort of self-training to get
used to it
but I actually found it fairly easy to
use once again you kind of get over that
learning curve you can also take one
hand and put your five fingers down and
that would give you kind of a media
control jog wheel that lets you launch
them specially apps and also get into a
bunch of different settings designed for
the touch screens and this machine in
particular now we call systems like this
kind of executive laptops because
they're kind of gimmicky they're highly
designed sometimes they're kind of
overpriced and they're really meant for
a sort of the CEO of the company to go
hey I need one of these fancy things to
put in my you know desk to impress
people but they're not really meant for
everyday use in terms of executive
laptops the Iconia was actually a little
bit easier to use than most even though
it is really based on a big gimmick once
we got used to typing on the screen even
though there's not really any sort of
feedback besides a clicking sound when
you time we eventually got used to
almost touch typing on it it was just
enough of a hint of lag on the typing
that if you're a super fast touch typist
you might run into that for most people
not so much of a problem our bigger
issue was this there's a touchpad built
into the bottom here but it's really too
small and since it's a virtual touchpad
you feel like they could really just
make it as big
they wanted but you're gonna end up
going off the signs a lot and I actually
found myself not using the touchpad as
much just reaching up and clicking on
the things I wanted on the top screen
now I'm going to demonstrate very
quickly some of the cool things you can
do if you have two screens because the
number one question we get about the
system is why would I need two screens
the first thing you can do is open up a
web browser and maybe have it on the top
screen or hit this little button there
and flick it down to the bottom screen
or you can have one window open at the
top and an entirely different window
open in the bottom and they're both you
know touch sensitive so you can play
around with them like that we also took
a HD video and put it in the top screen
then we took another HD video and put it
in the bottom screen and play them both
at once and it actually worked pretty
smoothly we also did this with some
online video and that worked as well
there's also some custom made apps
designed for the touch screen if you do
the Fivefinger thing and you hit the
touch browser that brings up a web
browser that works across both screens
automatically although you're really
more likely to just use Chrome or
Firefox or your favorite browser there's
also a custom eight social media app and
photo and video apps again you're more
likely to just use your regular versions
of those but there is a nice kind of
control center where you can turn the
back lights for the different screens
off and on and perform a bunch of other
power and system control functions now
with 214 inch touchscreens this thing is
pretty much a tank it's really thick
it's really heavy especially compared to
other 14 or even some 15-inch laptops
we're also not happy that it uses the
last generation of Intel processors if
they moved up to the newer version
there's something called Sandy Bridge
you've helped me get better performance
longer battery life and even some basic
game playing ability as it is right now
this thing really can't play games
although as you saw it does the HD
videos just fine one thing we did like
about it is that for a so-called
executive laptop compared to a lot of
other laptops that are super fancy like
the samsung series 9 or Dells at amo XPS
this guy is actually relatively
reasonably priced considering what you
get it's about 1199 which certainly
doesn't put it outside of the mainstream
of a high-end mid-sized laptop pricing
I'm Dan Ackerman and that is
Acer Iconia I kind of feel like Acer
made the Iconia just to prove that they
could but in the end isn't it really
just a big tablet that you have to fold
and have to carry around all right let's
go ahead and check out this week's
bottom line from the laptop no one
wanted to one that everybody does it's
time to feast our eyes on the beauty
that is the samsung series 9 I have been
drooling over this thing since I first
saw it at CES in January and here's
Scott Stein to show you why hi I'm Scott
Stein and this is not a MacBook Air it's
a samsung series 9 laptop you may have
heard about this back at CES 2011 and it
is one of the most hyped laptops of this
year especially if you're a Windows user
it is a rival to the MacBook Air in
terms of its design in terms of its size
and weight and also in terms of its
price this is a 1649 for the 13-inch
samsung series 9 that's not cheap but
it's about the same price as what you
get for a similarly configured MacBook
Air 13-inch actually it's a little bit
more now the design on this features a
duralumin exterior now that's a metal
that samsung says is used to construct
airplanes and has a nice brushed
aluminum feel it certainly feels sturdy
but on the inside it's a little bit
plasticky around the keyboard area
that's not the case on the all aluminum
MacBook Air but it still feels great the
keyboard is nice and large nearly the
same as a MacBook Air and it has a nice
large trackpad definitely one of the
largest trackpads
that we've seen on a Windows laptop it's
a click pad so there are no discrete
buttons you click on the bottom here on
a sort of a levered button system it has
a matte glass surface it feels great for
multi-touch gestures very quick
responding now as far as ports they're
buried on the sides behind little doors
that slide out it's a little unfortunate
we prefer direct access to our ports but
there are a few of them there are a
couple of USB ports there's a mini HDMI
port and there's a very funky special
dongle that will connect to Ethernet
well that's a little annoying
there's no
in a port on that MacBook Air either now
inside this has a Sandy Bridge next-gen
Intel Core i5 CPU but it runs in a
slower clock speed than of those other
core i5s that you see out there a low
voltage processor we'll have to see how
it tests in our full review and the
battery that's integrated promises
hopefully equivalent battery life as
well comes with four gigs of RAM and a
128 gigabyte SSD drive that for the
price range is half of what the MacBook
Airs tend to provide for the cost you
can get a 13-inch MacBook Air with a 128
gig SSD for about twelve hundred forty
nine dollars which is cheaper this has
integrated Intel second-generation
graphics which as we've shown before are
capable of playing some games we're not
expecting a lot out of this one but it
should be capable of playing some games
we did get Street Fighter 4 -
technically playback on this and
speakers are buried on the sides here
there are a little speaker ports on the
side of the unit which actually have
pretty good sound for its size I mean
it's not going to shake a room and there
are a couple of other nice little
features on this laptop it has a backlit
keyboard the screen as you might notice
is matte which is very rare on laptops
and some people are gonna want this
laptop just for that and it has a very
fast sleep-wake system built into it by
flipping the lid and putting it to sleep
it actually turns off all of the power
to the unit and then will wake up
extremely fast in about 3 seconds which
is nice I'm a super speedy startup time
and will conserve power boot up time
they claim is about 60 percent faster
than other hard drive based laptops we
definitely found so far that it's a
pretty fast boot time compared to
Windows laptops overall this is
definitely one of these sleekest sexiest
Windows laptops and if you want to show
off in a coffee shop with your
futuristic high-tech machine over your
latte well pick this one but you're
gonna be paying a high price to do it
however for its size for its portability
it might be worth it for some people
I'm Scott Stein and this is the new
Samsung it's ear
the bottom line this week why did I buy
this thing oh all right well I'll save
my buyers regret until the series 9
prices come down a little bit but oh my
god it's gorgeous so gorgeous alright
folks that's our show we'll be back next
week with a brand spanking new CNET tech
review until then there are tons of
great videos available every day at
scene at tv.com see you next time and
