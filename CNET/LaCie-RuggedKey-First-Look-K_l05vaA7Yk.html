something very personal my key which
opened to many nice cool places and if
you notice having this here an excellent
choice of keyring which at least three
times a week
opens up fun and good time but today and
Cheer something else I find even more
useful Yuri the lasse rocket key and now
don't worry is not a mini grenade it's
not gonna explode
if it does I'm catch it for you now this
is only a thumb drive and a thumb drive
coming in the key fob desire is not new
but the rugged key caught my attention
for a few reason number one it's support
USB 3.0 which is very important because
it's fast and secondly come with these
rubbery cover right here that keep does
moisture and water away from the drive
now that means for the first time I can
store the dry in my pocket without
worrying that it was scratched my iPhone
or having the drive right here is
scratch up by other sharp object I also
store in there and don't ask me what's
sharp object they are now the dry scone
rocket key not for no reason the cover
here keep it safe from crazy impact
let's see said that the draw has been
tested and survived a drop from 325 feet
and I personally throw it up and it
dropped like that a few time and it
survived - and yes I can throw really
high well one thing you should know
however despite the bright orange color
here the dry does not float which mean
it would not help you survive better
when swimming in the ocean
I personally throw in my bathtub and
it's sank pretty fast to the bottom the
data on the inside survived however for
now and the cause of some fried oil for
16 gig or $70 for 32 gig I fight a good
investment it's really too bad that a
dry doesn't come with high capacity
however and for that reason I might just
go ahead and keep the beer opener and
that's because once again my name is
dongho and this has been the first look
at the
we'll see rugged key thumb drive you
know on a second thought I might keep
bored of them why not
let's come in handy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
