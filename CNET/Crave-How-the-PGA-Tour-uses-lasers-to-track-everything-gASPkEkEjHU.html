thousands of years and some of the major
golf tournaments are well over 100 years
old while the sport of golf hasn't
changed much through history the
technology surrounding the way we watch
the sport as advanced dramatically from
drone the golf course mapping technology
the game of golf is involved into a
high-tech high-stakes game where every
shot is tracked and uploaded to the
mothership known as the server track we
went to the World Golf Championships at
Harding Park in San Francisco over the
weekend and got a first-hand look at how
the PGA Tour uses a laser system to map
tee shots and putz which is then
uploaded to the commentators television
viewers and the mass is following the
tournament online shot link is a
comprehensive scoring system which uses
lasers to survey and map the distance of
a golf shot on a mapped grid of a golf
course once a golfer hits a shot a PGA
Tour volunteer then uses the laser
rangefinder to measure the distance of
the ball from the tee this distance will
then provide the distance to the pin for
the next shot the technology is also
used on the putting green when a shot
comes into the green from the fairway
PGA volunteers quickly laser the ball
and get a measurement of the distance
between the ball and the cup this data
is then input into a small keypad
computer system that is sent to the
server truck and in almost real time
shows up on the television screen and
any device that a user may be following
the tournament the shot link data has
proven to be a vital part of the PGA
Tour and not only helps viewers at home
gain an understanding of how the golfers
are doing but the golfers themselves use
the shot link data to better their
performance
shotlink plays a vital role in the game
of golf today and will continue for a
long time to come as the game of golf
continues to grow so will its presence
online and the data will continue to be
an integral part of how we interact with
and consume the sport of golf</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
