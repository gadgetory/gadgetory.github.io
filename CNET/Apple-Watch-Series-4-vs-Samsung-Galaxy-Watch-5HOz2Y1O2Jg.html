lot of options we're comparing apples to
Samsung's on features like design health
and fitness tracking and connectivity
this is Apple watch series 4 versus
Samsung Galaxy watch
let's start with design the obvious
difference is that the galaxy has a
round screen while the Apple watch is
square the galaxy is thicker so it
sticks out on your wrist more than the
Apple watch both come in different sizes
either a 42 or a 46 millimeter version
of the galaxy watch or a 40 or 44
millimeter for the Apple watch for the
galaxy watch you have the choice of
either black or silver plus an
additional rose-gold option in the
smaller model while the Apple watch also
comes in silver space grey and gold to
make your watch more personal you can
change and customize the galaxy watch
with many third-party faces while the
Apple watch has a more limited selection
and both are water-resistant to 50
meters
I love the analogue look of the galaxy
watch that said the Apple watch is still
super super customizable because of how
easy it is to swap out the wristbands
and I find myself using different ones
to kind of change the look whereas the
galaxy watch it's just harder to get
that strap out so I ended up sticking to
the same one I love the screen the Super
AMOLED on the Galaxy watch tips it's
really bright it's easy to see in
sunlight and that bezel oh that tactile
response of just being able to turn it
and navigate and also just play with it
it's just a nicer way to interact with
the device than that digital crown on
the Apple watch at least for me
the galaxy watch is compatible with both
Android and iOS devices while the Apple
watch is tied exclusively to the Apple
ecosystem as you'd expect both can bear
most notifications from your phone and
there are plenty of third-party apps
available on both both also let you tap
into payments from your wrist using
Apple pay and an NFC only version of
Samsung pay but if you want to leave the
phone at home they do have GPS built in
as well as an LTE version that costs
extra at the time of recording the
cheapest galaxy watch gives two hundred
and eighty dollars in the US and another
$70 for LTE but the cheapest series four
is $400 add $100 more to get LTE so
there's something about the interface on
the Apple watch that I still take a lot
of time to figure out like I don't know
when I turn the crown I don't know when
to press the button no the other button
the galaxy watch on the other hand just
a couple days and I feel like I'm a pro
at the interface like I know where to
find everything I know what the buttons
do it's just easier to pick up when it
comes to the voice assistant lawyer
let's just say I was being polite about
Siri on the Apple watch not being I
guess as fully fledged as Siri on the
iPhone and then I tried big speaker on
the Galaxy watch and that was a big
letdown because all I could do is check
the weather and she sounds like this
what I do like about the Galaxy watch
though is that it's so customizable
right from the watch face itself you can
just drag and drop widgets rearrange get
rid of some on the go it also has more
watch faces to choose from because it
has that watch face store what I will
say was a disappointment was the fact
that Samsung paid doesn't work like how
it works on the Samsung phones because
it doesn't have that MST tip that allows
it to work on any terminal so you're
stuck with NFC just like the Apple watch
with Apple pay please second generation
like let's make MST a theme while we're
at it from generation to something about
the galaxy watch that does drive me up
the wall is that raised awake sometimes
works and sometimes doesn't I'd say like
7 times out of 10 it's fine and then
that three times out of 10 I just I
can't get it to work the Apple watch on
the other hand works consistently every
single time
stuff to be quite violent though with
both of them where you're like thank you
it didn't work that time I also also
what's with the phantom vibrations I
feel like I haven't quite gotten why
it's nudging me just wants to get to I
don't know I think there's no
notifications pending so I'm like what
do you want the Phantom in you you watch
these watches go all out when it comes
to fitness features the Apple watch has
14 workout types built in while the
Galaxy watch has 39 both also let you
track more workouts under the other
category if you forget to start a
workout both give you an alert when it
automatically detects that you've
started one the Apple watch only detects
certain activities like indoor and
outdoor running and walking but only the
galaxy watch Auto detect cycling apart
from your basic activity tracking both
have added health features the Apple
watch has an FDA cleared
EKG feature plus it lets you know when
there's something abnormal about your
heart it sends you a notification when
your heart rate is too high too low or
if it detects an irregular rhythm that
could signal a chill fibrillation
it also has fall detection the Galaxy
watch uses the heart rate sensor for
fitness and for tracking your stress
levels and it's the only one you can use
to track your sleep it breaks down the
duration and quality of your sleep aside
from the extremely helpful Find My Phone
feature what I use these watches for the
most are Fitness features and I could
say that they both do a really good job
of tracking activity they show you all
the stats that you'd probably want to
see I like that the Apple watch shows
you more stats on one screen while you
run whereas the galaxy watch you have to
swipe I like seeing them all at once I
also I'm very responsive to the ring
system that the Apple watch has it's
just visual it makes you close rings
that you've those goals that you've set
for yourself at the end of the day and I
find that myself pushing myself harder
just because I'm obsessive about closing
rings I'm not as obsessed with the rings
as you are I have to say I don't feel
really bad if I don't close them on one
day for example but I'm glad to bring up
that point about information because the
problem for me is not on the screens is
that information I think is totally fine
on the watch screens it's when I want to
track my progress over time and I pull
that information in from the first party
apps apart from the galaxy watch having
two apps in their ports having three
apart from not knowing where to look to
find that I find it really difficult to
know how I'm making progress over time
say for example if I'm running the same
route every week am I getting better in
terms of my speed in terms of segments
that I'm running how's my pace doing
like I need to know this information
and you have to basically pull it out
and work it out yourself there's no easy
way to find that within those first
party apps which is something that third
party apps of course are really good out
but I would love to see the next
generation of these apps and Watchers
have a little bit more of that progress
tracking built in the Apple watch lets
you stream or store your tunes from
Apple music directly to the watch and
listen to podcasts you can also use
third-party apps like Spotify but you'll
get more basic functionality the galaxy
watch has better spotify support so you
can download playlists to listen to
offline if you're a premium subscriber
and the galaxy also lets you transfer
songs from your computer when they're on
the same Wi-Fi network we tested the
smaller versions of both these watches
side-by-side to see how long the
batteries would hold up during normal
use and with a workout in between we
found the Apple watch lasted about a day
and a half the galaxy watch will give
you about a day more battery but the
larger version of the Galaxy watch
claims to last up to four days this is
by no means a scientific test and your
battery mileage may vary what is clear
is that you will be having to charge
both these watches on a regular basis so
with that in mind Vanessa it's crunch
time are you choosing the Apple watch or
the galaxy watch this is a tough one
because this one is so pretty it's
distracting my choice but ultimately I
think I'm gonna have to go to that with
the Apple watch because of the fitness
features what about you soyou'll Fitness
First
I am hybrid of SmartWatch and fitness
features first I I think they birth do
an excellent job on this front and the
galaxy watch hasn't really grown on me I
didn't expect to love it as much as I do
and now I think it's gonna be really
hard to take off with that in mind there
are a couple things that it doesn't do
quite as well at four right now if I
have to buy one and I post I was an
iPhone user I would choose the Apple
watch but I love the Android and iOS
compatibility on the Galaxy watch that's
great so what do you guys think leave
