Bridget Carey and this is your cnet
update google maps are back on iOS a new
google map app is available for Apple
users to download and it includes spoken
turn-by-turn directions and public
transit information within just a few
hours of it being in Apple's iTunes
Store Google it was the number one free
app ever since apple cake Google office
latest operating system update it's been
nothing but chaos for anyone who tries
to use apples Maps bridges are
collapsing entire cities are wiped out
steak restaurants are showing up in the
middle of a baseball field and in
Australia people have needed rescue
after getting lost in the wilderness
there's really a noticeable difference
between the quality and usefulness
between googles and apples Maps so if
you've been holding back on upgrading to
iOS 6 because you didn't want to lose
that google map well this could make you
feel better but upgrading you can watch
amazon videos now on more devices amazon
instant video streaming app is now on
the iphone and ipod touch users can buy
or rent a show and Prime members can
also access the library of content
included in that subscription and
amazon's cloud player can now also be
accessed on roku and samsung smart tvs
the cloud player is a free virtual
Locker of all the music you buy on
amazon as well as imported song files in
the glory days of blackberry it was the
must-have phone for businesses and
government agencies well looks like
blackberry has a shot to win back the
hearts of professionals the US
Immigration and Customs Enforcement
Agency will run a pilot program to test
new BlackBerry 10 devices back in
October this agency said it was going to
switch over to iPhones but research in
motion is hoping to sway them not to
switch and just when you thought a
smartphone screen couldn't get any
bigger prepare yourself for the Samsung
Galaxy Note 3 because a report from The
Korea Times says Samsung is working on a
6.3 inch display for the next note which
many call a phablet between a phone and
a tablet the current version of the node
has a 5.5 inch screen and while some may
make fun of the size it's a hot seller
for Samsung
I began the show with news about
Google's Maps coming to apple devices
but Windows 8 users won't be hearing
similar news anytime soon in an
interview with British tech publication
v3 the product manager for Google Apps
said his team has no plans to build apps
for Windows 8 or Windows Phone if
Windows becomes more popular then Google
might consider releasing apps for things
like drive docs Gmail and calendar for
now users have to stick with the web
versions that's your tech news update
you can find links to all of these
stories on the blog cnet com / update
