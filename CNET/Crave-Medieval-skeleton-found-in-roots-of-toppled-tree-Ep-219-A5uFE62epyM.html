edition star wars watch by Devon works
which will cost you a whopping
twenty-eight thousand five hundred
dollars the watch was produced in
collaboration between Devon works Disney
and the United States aerospace industry
and according to Scott Devon the founder
and creative director of Devon works the
watch uses a revolutionary new system of
telling time with time belts which use
for micro step motors powered by a
hybrid electric mechanical power source
along with an optical sensor that tells
time more precisely than any purely
mechanical watch made today the watch
was inspired by Darth Vader's helmet in
a TIE fighter and sits on a wireless tie
fighter charging stand there will be
only 500 of these watches made and they
will go on sale in October on Amazon and
high-end watch dealers around the
country oh and did I mention they come
with matching tie fighter cufflinks
DARPA is working on new types of
experimental landing gear for aircraft
the defense advanced research projects
agency released a video showing off
insect-like landing gear that can land a
helicopter on almost any type of terrain
according to the agency they believe the
technology could be useful for forward
operating areas ships at sea and natural
disaster zones landing legs are equipped
with contact sensors that respond to
force until the computer how much the
landing gear legs need to extend or
retract to safely land on an uneven
landscape so far the landing leg
technology has only been tested on
unmanned aircraft in a similar robotic
experiment involving transportation and
robotic legs the halloo 2 x is an eight
legged robot with wheels that might just
be the future of automobiles the halloo
p2x is the second prototype of the
hallucinogen iya project under
development at the future robotics
technology center of Japan's Chiba
Institute of Technology who showed off
the hallucinogen iya 01 concept in 2010
both robots are modeled after an extinct
organism called the hallucinogen Ian
which was discovered in fossil deposits
in canada and china and resembles a
horseshoe crab according to the future
robotics technology center website the
concept of halloo to model two of the
hallucinogen you project is a future
vehicle that can coexist with a natural
environment it features a newly
developed ultra multi motored system
with 56 motors which makes traveling on
unpaved services possible and eliminates
the need for paving
