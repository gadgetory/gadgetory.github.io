Johnny salesman I'm Alfred ring well
that was a marathon after what is it now
six six and a half hours of testimony we
just were almost done it's still
actually going on Facebook and Twitter
showed up to DC and we're gonna break it
all down for you and there was a lot to
take in
we'll break it down into two sessions
the first session Facebook CEO Sheryl
Sandberg and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey
showed up to talk about foreign
influence on social media what were some
of the big takeaways free to you know
from from the first session well I
composedly miss the procession but what
you think like for one thing we assumed
that you know censorship was gonna be a
big part of that and it didn't it ended
up being more about well about the
actual topic of foreigners right yeah so
it was another opportunity for these
tech giants to show up and answers the
basic questions about what they're doing
and make apologies for what they've
missed and promised to get better
generally I mean I didn't notice a lot
different from you know when Zuckerberg
showed up yeah yeah I think that there
was even one point you know they were
pressed a couple times about things like
will you put a value on the data of your
users and when they were pressed they
kind of especially Sandberg sort of
defaulted to that line well I go we're
in favor of you know regulation but the
right regulation we want to work with
you not really giving a lot of firm
commitments it seems like these
companies were really playing nice in my
mind it's sort of in a bid to to kind of
create foundation for crafting
legislation that they want as well as
what Congress wants and you know as X
sort of demonstrated few months ago like
these folks are pretty smart when it
comes to how these companies work a lot
smarter than the senators who are asking
the questions although to be fair the
the questions were lots more this time
right they were they seemed a lot more
informed there weren't any especially
during the Senate one there weren't any
glaring like except for well I think one
of the first questions was
asking both Jack Dorsey and Joel
Sandberg can you define what a social
network is oh yeah there was that to
like kick off the entire day that was
the first question but there was a lot
more I did think that there was more on
the surface welcoming of regulation
right from the to right and we did have
the the extra exhibition of Alex Jones
outside of the hearing holding his own
press conference our own rich needs
actually you know interviewed him short
briefly where we what he said he was
basically trying to you know he was
facing his accusers calling them cowards
weird it was a weird sideshow aspect to
it getting moving on to the second
session because we're running out of
time already
you know Jack Dorsey was sitting by
himself basically facing questions about
transparency and accuracy bias and it
turned into a bit of a shouting match
between a fella between the Democrats
and the Republicans right it was less
about Twitter and more about like the
political motivations behind this
session yeah the second one definitely
felt a lot more like political
grandstanding whereas the first Senate
hearing did feel a little bit more like
there were legislators attempting to do
some legislative groundwork right right
there was a lot more like how can my
Republican colleagues be doing this or
how is it possible that you are such a
biased service against conservatives
there's a lot more of extremity well
yeah if you take a look at the second
hearing you know a lot of the questions
were it started off with shadow banning
which was something that they thought
was targeted specifically at
conservative voices Jack Dorsey
explained and this was actually an
algorithm issue that they had with it
where he basically said this effect is
six hundred thousand accounts and really
didn't have anything to do based on your
politically he was he was sort of
pressed by at least one representative
who was asking whether or not the the
breakdown was you know what was skewed
more towards conservative or yeah
liberals and Dorsey generally have an
answer for that yeah he said they didn't
really have a breakdown based on
political views it was just kind of done
across the board for everybody all right
so this is an ultra complicated
conversation with the cram more than
four minutes and we just ran out of time
you can if you want the full coverage
check us on CNET I'm Roger Chang I'm
Jody Salzman I'm Alfred ring thanks
Wilson
maybe talk about like cane
we're talking about you ain't kidding
Roger you say barely scratch the surface
that was a dense day and a lot the
process I think you guys did a good job
doing a highlight reel here so I applaud
you for that in the meantime as always
if anybody has any questions or comments
what was your takeaway today we want to
hear what your feedback is mine was that
it was largely reminiscent of Zuck with
a whole lot more subtle shade throwing
from around the horn anyone else get
that vibe I thought it was more shade
thrown at each other as opposed to
Dorsey I thought it was at Google we
didn't get to Google and I really wanted
to bring that up the fact that Google is
missing that they were asked to send way
to Larry Page or sundar Pichai the CEO
of Google they opted to send Ken Walker
Ken Walker who is their general counsel
or vice president SVP of like publisher
right the policy guy they're like nope
he's not high-level enough so we're just
gonna have an epi seat there and we're
gonna we're gonna like continuously mock
Google throughout the session what's
take away from that like is there any
repercussions I don't even know how
words is there any repercussion if
Congress is like we want you to send
this person I think the repercussions
are probably gonna be like a political
like this is terrible publicity like
they've gone for like two and a half
hours like pretty much every senator
took their turn bashing Google a little
bit right come on Harris was like hello
invisible guests so that's not actually
there it's kind of shame because there
are a lot of questions that I think
Google needed to answer about foreign
influence on on the elections like what
the midterm elections coming up I think
Google has because you know they control
Android control YouTube Gmail I mean
that that's like a huge number of
platforms that yeah Facebook has about
like 2 billion users like a month which
is you know about the same level of
people that use YouTube or
or you know Android devices everyday but
I would argue that because Google has
like so many different platforms and has
like two billion for each of them that
has more of a surface area for attackers
to go after and it's been like shown
that you know nation-states have
targeted these like John Podesta's email
that got hacked was a gmail account the
influencer campaigns that happened on
YouTube as well as the ads that were
bought on YouTube right it's just like
it's a massive like puzzle piece that's
missing that when Google is not there
that being said to though they did offer
Ken Walker is still there even though
he's not testifying publicly he's giving
like private briefings to these
congressional members so you know
Google's representative or their CEO
won't be there to you know get yelled at
if you public by everybody including
Alex Jones but I mean in private he's
still like Google is still briefing all
these Congress members on what what they
should know I suppose but I think the
biggest loss is that you know the the
public doesn't really get to hear all
the things that Google is doing right
you know what else we also didn't have
time to talk about was the Justice
Department releasing a statement right
after the first right after the first
hearing ended the Justice Department
puts out a statement basically saying
that they're having a bunch of attorney
generals meeting later this month to
talk about a growing concern that these
social media companies are hurting
competition and intentionally stifling
the free exchange of ideas on their
platforms back to this censorship notion
that what's been going on and we didn't
really even know the the call out to
Huawei and ZTE yet again like these
companies can't catch a break like you
know in a session that's really designed
to put the the microscope or put
Facebook and Twitter the Microsoft you
know Huawei and ZTE it's like random
shots yeah there was also a call out
during the house hearing from rep I hope
I'm pronouncing her I was like Luhan or
Lou Jean one of the two but he's from I
believe yeah he's from New Mexico and he
just mentioned Equifax out of nowhere
he's one of the Democrat Congress
members I was basically saying this
hearing is a waste of our time we should
be focusing on real issues right
there really isn't like any censorship
going on at least according to him there
is no censorship going on let's focus on
like actual issues I was like basically
having dorsey's like presence there
right writing any questions I just don't
want to start off with this one from
Matthew - or what's worse being hauled
in front of Congress or having to report
on it
we should get rich in the a vertical and
I would say I mean even for us report I
would say reporting on it because if I'm
getting hauled for Congress I'm probably
getting paid a lot of money I'm probably
a pretty important person
so I'll deal with it not paid by
Congress and like the CEO of a company
I'm important enough that Congress
decided I needed to show up there I'm
probably getting paid more so also
Dorsey did have like some some branding
opportunities we offer you my personal
my personal thoughts on this matter
after I tweet it yes right now anybody
get a head count about how many times
they said we'll get back to you a lot
and the second one a lot yeah there's a
lot more than the second one the first
one I think it was only like two or
three times actually it was a fairly
thoughtful exchange of ideas the yeah
the I think cuz the second one was just
all over the place
Dorsey wasn't quite prepared watching if
you liked what you heard from Taylor
foils have we followed up on the changes
made after the first facebook hearing
specifying a tally of the issues that
Congress brought up that have actually
been addressed other than their fluff
commercial saying they can do better
follow up on that Facebook's like put
out a that while they released the
answers to all of congress's questions
that they said we'll get back to you do
they actually change anything I feel
like a lot of privacy settings they
changed before the zucker well I know
like they might have changed a lot of
stuff behind the scenes but the stuff
that they've done publicly they've
changed like how ads can be bought on
their platform yeah Google said they've
done the same thing was that done before
after this was done
after cyclists if I like where you can
see who's like that the donors are not
donors but things like that they've been
much more public about influence
campaigns like it doesn't take for a
reporter to find out about it now for
this to be public it you know we like
they announced the Iran yeah yeah enough
on their own yep
they like created this bug bounty for
like data abuse and things like that
yeah they actually have done a lot to
address this because I think they do
take this issue seriously I would not
agree with the statement that they have
like that they you know are are meeting
it at the pace that it's like
challenging them at but I think they are
like throwing a lot of their resources
at it right I mean I think part of it is
they still I don't think they quite
grasp how big a problem this is well if
they do then they don't really have an
answer for right I would say it's the
latter I think they know it's a really
big deal okay
from Josh Buda on the point of Equifax
has anything there been changed Alfred
no well I mean it depends on what angle
you're looking at nothing has been
changed as far as from the victim's
perspective it's not like Equifax aside
will you know give you your money back
or anything like that we caught who did
this or anything like that but Equifax
in itself has been shifting their
security culture I spoke with their of
chief information security officer yes
yes not the one that was fired around
February and he's like talked about how
Equifax has this whole three year plan
to regain your trust right and how
they're creating this new culture of
security within the company so that you
know a massive mistake like that
wouldn't happen again also some of their
like staff has been indicted for insider
trading not the big ones that we've we
knew about bought like some like random
staffer is that like were Neiman on our
radars were hit with yeah but as far as
you know consequences for Equifax the
company like have they been like
successfully sued or anything like that
we have not seen anything like that or
any legislation that's changed there's
still one of the three companies that we
have to go to for our
yeah so yeah so day like today there's
not a whole lot of conclusiveness to
take away from it there never is for
there never is but let's let's be the
optimist for just a moment what were
some of the good things we took away
from both of the hearings today whether
it just being little moments that you
thought shined light on something
potential progress surprising comments
anything along the lines I mean the the
comment that Dorsey kept making about
the victim shouldn't have to be the one
who's responsible for reporting yeah the
issue like that's I think that's a noble
thing to say I really want to see how
Twitter actually backed us up I don't
think Dorsey or anyone on Twitter knows
what the answer to that question is but
just the fact that he kept that was
something that he kept impressing was
was good was at least comforting to know
that like he understands that that is a
fundamental issue yeah I was gonna
mention that but also it is insane to me
that so when they mentioned the Megan
McCain tweet that had to delete yeah if
you're not familiar with the image it's
a photo of her with a gun like that was
edited in was to show a gun pointed at
her it took about five hours for twitter
to take that down to spy who's know well
Jack Dorsey says that it was five hours
the person Meghan McCain's husband says
that it was up for over half the day yep
and then another Congress member said
there was up for 16 plus hours yeah it
depends on whose timeline you're looking
at here but I the point was that Jack
Dorsey mentioned that the reason why
that was up for so long is because the
threat that they were looking for next
face was text based and they said that
the threat like was in the image and
that's why they're a I didn't detect it
immediately okay which is crazy to me
because if you think about how much of
Twitter is based on images and like the
fact that they're only yeah and video
and the fact that they're only looking
for threats like their AI at least is
only looking for in text that's maybe it
just hasn't learned yet I still young
that's such an incredible oversight
because I mean like Facebook learned
that before with it's fake news where
they realize that a lot of hoaxes were
spreading through
through images so they like started
using AI that like reverse searches
images and things like that and it's
it's like it just it's such like a mind
boggle for me that like they didn't
realize that like so much of like
harassment and abuse can come in image
and video right worm yeah speaking of
video I mean there was a lot but there
was interesting discussion on deep fakes
which I didn't really think that was
kind of interesting but senators are
aware the special effects and CGI have
existed for decades yeah but like the
fact that it could be done like at home
fairly cheaply and it
yeah those is interesting that they
acknowledge that and that that was part
of dialogue all right there was a good
comment coming in from mecca men for
government corporations have guidelines
and codes of conduct crying about
censorship over what is usually paid
speech patreon it's hard to feel
sympathetic any thoughts on that
sentiment it's hard to feel sympathetic
for the companies or feel yeah those
crying censorship oh yeah well yeah I
enjoyed that part of Jack Dorsey's
opening statement on the second hearing
at the end when he talks about you know
you earned your followers but we have no
obligation to promote like your tweets
to anybody like like you you deserve to
have your followers see your tweets but
like people that aren't your followers
like we don't have any obligation to
promote or boost you in any way yeah I
have a position on this that I just kind
of want to put out there where I'm not
explicitly defending anybody involved
but the way I kind of see one of the
arguments I saw that kind of stuck out
to me is I forget which representative
it was but it was during the house
hearing the second part that pointed out
like people are trafficking drugs on
Twitter it's like well people are
trafficking drugs on telephones and on
streets is it that is that the the
government's fault for building the
street I mean I just I struggled with
that thought and that's me just I didn't
mean I didn't notice that the open issue
the opioid issue it was every was both
in the Senate session and this one and
they spent a lot of time on it I feel
like that's just because it's
a politically sensitive issue it's
probably one they want to like wave the
flag on that's what I feel like those a
bit of grandstanding yeah right I don't
remember all the instances really talks
about it but the one that comes to mind
is when there was a West Virginia
congressman talking about it and you
know if you this is representative of
democracy and so it's an issue that
matters to his constituents and sure I
think it's fair enough that he brings
out that I think it's very interesting I
think that you know so they pointed out
these very public examples one of them
he just looked up percocet by yep and on
Twitter and I did it myself too and I
found several posts on that like people
selling drugs but I think it's very
interesting that no one's ever like
actually gone through and seen how
legitimate these are because I looked at
those tweets and they look like they
were just spam posts that were like
automatically posted like if you looked
at the accounts I'm and this is just
take this was a grain of salt because I
didn't really look into it myself but
like my I'm not sure how many of these
are actual drug sales in the same way
that like if you saw these like spam
tweets saying you know hey like me like
sexy singles in your area and then would
you say like oh Twitter's allowing for
you know like prostitution on it like
those are most likely also scams so I
don't know how many of those are actual
drug sales I considered calling the
number just to verify but yeah I think I
think to be interesting to see like how
many of those are actually people trying
to sell drugs because I think you'd have
to be incredibly stupid to make a public
account with a phone number and email
listed and actually sell percocet on
Twitter you raise a very good point
Alfred
the point is based that there aren't
stupid people on Twitter
case in point present company included
before we wrap it up Josh wants to know
can you clarify the comment that was
made about Twitter deleting BOTS and
that it was a conspiracy which comment
is this yours
Josh help us clarify what comment you
specifically I know is the conspiracy
about like no people bombers and
certainly that's what you're talking
about
when Twitter did its purge of bought
accounts I think everyone lost a bunch
of I think I lost about two or three
thousand I didn't lose any because all
my followers are real ones thank
see all I was talking about mom but no I
think he's one of the reps made the the
point that I think Trump lost about
300,000 Obama lost like 2 million 2.8
million I think it was sort of the
reverse is like well does Twitter have
some sort of conspiracy
you know theory some conspiracy against
Obama which Dorsey was like no we don't
and if I recall right that was a
democratic raising a rhetorical point
that's like if that is a conspiracy then
there's then the the idea was like to
get Dorsey to say there's no conspiracy
yes yeah so I mean he's trying to it was
grants anybody's making the point that
like this the the other examples being
put up or as ridiculous as this
particular example right yeah I don't
know soon that's the question you were
asking about that was the one conspiracy
theory I think that I heard about today
yes you are correct that's exactly what
he was looking for I think when we
screamed so many conspiracies out there
I think I think you folks give these
guys too much credit I think they're
just too dumb for their own platform
that's a shot at the developers by the
way not all the users we love you guys
all right we are just about out of time
I do it feels you're doing it so late
but I thanks everybody for sticking
around and joining us and I hope we
brought a little levity following up
we're all in the same boat before we go
what what are the next steps when is
going to be the next procedural ones the
next hearing what's happening on the
hill next that's I mean the in terms of
the Senate hearing I think this was like
the capper for it's the fourth one JJ
Abrams reboots it and it's the exact
same thing as the house I feel like the
house ones just sort of came on because
the Senate was doing one or like the
argument of the censorship no yeah well
argument was that the the leader of the
House or the whip or the speaker or
somebody was like hey
committee look into shadow banning
please that's not that was actually the
third one that the house that the House
Committee had because so they had the
first one where they invited all three
and they all bailed and then they had
diamond and so gone for like three hours
nothing substantial came out of that
then the second one came a few months
ago where it was like the policy exact
time all three so college stretchers
there and Kent Walker I can't remember
who it was from YouTube or Google but
yeah and then this was the third room of
just Jack I think that these hearings
will continue happening at least until
Google sends one of their like Agassi
that's a good point because he's Google
is now like the the last missing piece
of this puzzle now what are we exciting
if there was a subpoena that could be
intriguing I think that actually do that
sure they can
I don't know what are the odds but that
what I'm saying yeah that would be
it's definitely drama an extreme measure
be more exciting than today maybe I
don't know today was a thrill we did we
didn't talk about the the one random
person the woman who like Oh Lauren
Loomer yeah them shouting and then like
the once presentative who became an
auctioneer for so weird that was really
wanted her verification back yeah I know
that was uh that was her big gripe we
couldn't hear what she was saying there
but she was chanting Jack Dorsey lies
yeah she's a mega conspiracy artist and
he could lie about things anyways it was
just interesting to watch the that
representative rep long jump in there
and just I just figure is that his like
usual response to like Siemens job he's
just a former auctioneer my point is
like when you see like dissent or
anything like that is is like internal
like defense mechanism like start that's
a pretty good one I guess they've really
distract everyone like you got that's
the core like what's going on here
and we completely ignore the protests
they woke me up from my stupor yeah as
silly as silly as the circus got it was
kind of nice to have a little break in
the action there yeah I choked I
couldn't help but chuckle definitely
yeah I think we're out of time guys we
put in a good long day today
congratulations everybody good work
let's wrap it up school get drunk and
that's not condoning anything drunk but
I'm going to positive vibes there's our
colleagues yeah so yeah I bought off of
Twitter thanks for joining us we'll see
ya maybe tomorrow I don't know we might
take the day off we'll see anyways
wishful thinking the 359 is available on
iTunes TuneIn stitcher feedburner google
play music google podcast the amazon
echo of course you not to come we'll see
you tomorrow
probably maybe we'll see probably thanks
