might call v2e vehicle to environment
where vehicles use sensors not unlike
these to figure out where they are and
what's around them they're sort of on
their own right now to read the world as
they navigate it just count the array of
sensors on Howdy's current self driver
that uses v2e technology to handle its
own driving up to a full 40 miles per
hour let's count up some of the sensors
that make an Audi autonomous car of the
future
autonomous first of all around the
bumpers you've seen these before we've
got these sensors here that do sonar for
those pretty conventional back in these
body panels hidden there are also radar
devices that are doing the same thing we
see in the front on radar now in the
windshield camera actual optical camera
that we've seen before ray domes left
and right up here you might think those
are fog lights they're not more sonar
sensors here laser here is new in this
technology demonstration that's not in
production yet but this allows high
bandwidth detailed 3d modeling of the
shapes that are out in front of the car
here's without II is done they've
combined adaptive cruise control which
maintains distance and speed ahead of
you they've combined active lane
departure which keeps a car in a lane
using active steering and they've added
very sophisticated rear sensing
technology to monitor what's going on
behind the vehicle put that together and
you get complete perimeter awareness now
in a pure v2e approach the vehicles
responsible are making sense of a lot of
data you can see on that screen behind
me how the car sees me and that is not
an easy bunch of bits to make sense of
that puts a lot of processing power in
the car and a lot of the past prototypes
I've seen that computing power fills the
trunk of a self-driving car but more
recently I'm seeing it fill up maybe a
space the size of a shoebox the next
layer of self-driving is v2b
vehicle to vehicle where cars report
their position and trajectory to each
other Ford recently showed us a very
clear demo of how this moves the ball
forward the great car behind me is about
to blow a red light the blue car can't
see it because of that truck but because
these guys are in communication the gray
car told the blue car's driver
something's wrong he was able to hit the
brakes nobody got into a collision
here's another sphincter-tightening
scenario we all know this car has
stopped the car two vehicles behind it
can't tell because of traffic in the
middle but thanks to vehicle to vehicle
communication the driver in the back
gets a warning to break even though he
couldn't have seen it humanely also
current in vehicle sensors wouldn't have
been able to help here either only
vehicle to vehicle can see through other
cars now here's where the rubber or the
RF as it were hits the road the shark
fin antenna you've seen before is doing
a lot more now there's a flat antenna
right here facing the sky picking up GPS
satellite coordinates there's a vertical
antenna here in the sail that is
broadcasting information out to other
cars within about a thousand foot radius
it broadcast an update of this cars
speed in position every 10 seconds the
speed data comes from the cars own
internal computers and data bus that's
been in vehicles for decades now a key
part of v2v that car makers don't
entirely control is setting up the
standard language and protocols that all
vehicles of all brands will use to talk
to each other that needs to be done in
concert with regulators and so far do
tea and Nitza are kind of late
they'd promised some early guidelines by
late 2013 as of right now early 2014 we
still haven't seen them which brings us
to v2i vehicle to infrastructure that's
the ultimate layer where cars roads
traffic signals and network centers all
talk to each other to really take self
driving to a rich level now this stuff's
pretty green but it rolls up the concept
of the car getting signals not just from
other cars but also from let's say the
metro traffic control center or sensors
in and around roads it can manifest
itself several ways traffic signal
sequencing can be sent live to a car so
it knows the next signal and the ones
after that and what they'll be showing
and when this helps traffic move more
quickly and use less fuel due to less
stop-and-go congestion management this
is the vision where a central Road
Authority can direct cars connected nav
systems during a
you to spread out from the main route
and use alternate paths to alleviate
congestion and yet get everyone there in
less time intersection management like
we saw in the foreign cars a moment ago
that can be accomplished via smart
intersections that tell cars who it sees
approaching as well as v2b as we saw
sort of a digital return to the old days
of traffic cops sitting in the middle of
an intersection with white gloves on
okay some reality checks vehicle to
environment that's already happening
today we test lots of cars that see net
where you see things like adaptive
cruise control or active lane departure
correction that is basically v2e and
it's in an active form then you get to V
to V that's a little different thing
vehicle to vehicle is not really on the
market yet Ford says that technology we
showed you earlier can be retrofitted to
cars in the near future if it's passive
if it's supposed to take over brakes and
acceleration and steering that requires
factory integration that's a little
tougher finally there's vehicle to
infrastructure this is the big dig if
you will we have millions and millions
of relatively dumb cars and dumb roads
out there right now that are gonna have
to be refreshed and that means the
current stock of both has to age out and
be replaced
