cnet.com we're on the floor in Alpine's
visit CES 2013 taking a look at the
Alpine ICF x7 HD has a pretty
interesting interface as everything
that's being rendered by it right now is
coming off with a samsung galaxy s3
phone next to it head unit uses what's
called mirrorlink
it's an app mirroring two-way
communications profile that allows you
to pretty much anything that shows on
your phone shows up on the indebt screen
that you've got here so we've got full
touch control we can see our music if
any music were on this phone we can also
pop over into location and get
navigation now again the whole interface
is provided by the Samsung Galaxy s3
phone that's next to it so your mileage
may vary depending on what apps through
on your phone it also does a lot of
other interesting things that's just
your standard Bluetooth audio streaming
your standard HD radio reception it also
is compatible with iPhone and iPod and
if you have apps on those phones such as
Pandora or a high radio you also get
integration there this is a $599 unit
it's a 7-inch display and it is necklace
there's no CD player behind this it's
pretty much just the screen designed to
work with your phone so it's a really
interesting head unit for smartphone
users I've been an Swan good in which
the Netcom we're on the floor at CES
2013 and this has been the Alpine ICS x7
HD</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
