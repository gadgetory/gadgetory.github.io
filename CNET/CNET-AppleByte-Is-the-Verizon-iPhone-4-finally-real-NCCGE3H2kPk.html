there will be girls are all right here
here's hat you got charlie all right so
everybody all in favor here after the
show for the party say I hi okay all
right I would ever want a blow by 100
episode that's how we do it whoa
what's up i'm brian Tong and welcome to
the apple pie for all the good and bad
inside the world of Apple I've got to
say we are all really excited to be here
celebrating our 100th episode 100
episodes you believe that the staff is
ecstatic they're jumping off the walls I
can't hold back my joy we've got an
amazing giveaway from our friends at
mophie so let's get to the show now it's
been the longest running tease for over
two years but the Wall Street Journal is
reporting that Apple is planning to
begin mass production of the verizon
compatible iphone 4 by the end of this
year allowing verizon to sell the phone
in the first quarter of 2011 verizon has
been meeting with Apple to beef up their
networks for the heavy data load
expected with the arrival of the iphone
they also report apple is developing the
next-gen iphone so you're telling me
Apple is already working on the next
iPhone like they've been doing for the
past four years that's crazy top and you
know what's even crazier the white
iphone 4 we haven't heard a peep about
it and this magical unicorn is still in
hiding now we hear a lot about the ipad
but if you still like a good old laptop
with a keyboard Apple Insider reports
that inventory levels for the macbook
air have dried up for third-party
resellers and they aren't expected to
get a new shipment until mid-october
Apple has been known to do product
refreshes in October in the past so we
could potentially see the next macbook
air featuring the rumored smaller 11.6
inch display powered by an intel core i
series ultra low voltage processor that
was rumored back in july and in other
laptop developments apple was also
recently awarded a patent that opens the
door for 3g or future LTE and 4g
connectivity to be built into the
housing of a macbook it's probably too
early to see this implemented into the
new macbook air but this stuff is come
in the future and if you think your
laptop gets too hot right now it could
get even hotter now a few episodes back
we showed you how to make ringtones
directly on your iPhone but did you know
you can also make ringtones with itunes
10 for free go check it out
brian Tong here with sina com and with
the release of itunes 10 Apple has
removed the ability for you to make
custom ringtones for 99 cents from your
purchase music but there's no need to
stress because you can still make
ringtones for free using just itunes 10
for the mac and pc the first thing this
will not work with older music purchase
from the itunes store with DRM on them
but it will work with mp3s aiff files
and non protected AAC files like music
purchase from the iTunes Store today now
if you're not sure what type of music
files you have right click on this bar
and select kind and a column will appear
to show you so let's find a song like
this one that I want to turn into a
ringtone right click on the song and
select get info a window will appear
with track information and you want to
select the options tab and look for the
start time and stop time settings click
it on the boxes next to those settings
for now I already know where i want my
ringtone to start and for this song i'll
start it at the beginning and go until
the 30-second mark there's a 40 seconds
max duration for itunes ringtones now
once you've set the time press ok then
go to advanced on the main menu bar and
select create AAC version itunes will
create the shorter version of your song
below the original track and you want to
drag and drop that version onto your
desktop to make a copy now there's a
little housekeeping we need to take care
of if the option to create AAC version
is not available go into your
preferences and in the general tab find
the section that says when you insert a
CD click on the import settings button
and then select import using AAC encoder
and the option should appear now you'll
also want to go back to the original
music file in itunes and uncheck the
start and stop time so that it plays
normally from now on back to our music
file on the desktop we're going to
change the extension name on the file
from m4a to m4r you'll be asked to
confirm the changes and we'll use em for
our for windows users you'll need to go
to your control panel then choose
appearance and personalization select
the folder options and in the view tab
make sure you have unchecked the box to
hide extensions for known file types
that will allow you to see and change
the file type as well ok guys we're
almost there but before you bring your
ringtone back into itunes you have to
delete the
30 second version that we initially
created and if you don't do this itunes
will not accept the ringtone so this is
an important and crucial step now drag
and drop the renamed m for our file into
the source column of itunes and the word
library should highlight it will copy
the file into itunes and voila you have
a new ringtone plug your phone into your
computer make sure you set it up to sync
ringtones in the appropriate section
sync your phone and you'll be doing the
dougie in no time i'm brian Tong we're
how to portray in ringtones with itunes
10 use it wisely look Thank You mr. Tom
but you might want to work on your dog
in a little bit like this okay here's
the latest in iPad rumors and news
according to ticonderoga securities
component suppliers in Taiwan say apples
next gen ipad will sport a 7 inch high
res Retina Display camera and 128 gigs
of capacity with a mini or micro USB
slot the report also made no mention if
Apple would still produce the 9.7 inch
model now this sounds all exciting and
everything but it's a little ambitious
to think they'll be able to make a
Retina display at that size and still
keep the iPad around the same price
points something tells me that this is
the last time I'll say ki Kondor Olga on
