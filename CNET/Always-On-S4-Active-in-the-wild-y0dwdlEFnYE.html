s4 active now I get a ton of email from
people asking me to torture test devices
with animals in some way so we're taking
that idea to the extreme as we like to
do on our show so we're here at
Discovery Kingdom and we're gonna start
off with the waterproof test now I have
heard this thing has some problems being
fully submerged I already have some good
animal pictures on here that I don't
want to lose but I'm gonna try to take
it in the water see how it does with the
dolphins
okay so here's what happened I got in
the pool it's why I'm across the pool
now the phone will come on this is
saltwater and that could be partly what
happened it's also possible I did put a
strap on here because I didn't want to
lose it it might have pulled this back
cover loose a little bit but I have to
say I have been in this cold cold water
for like less than two minutes and I
haven't even got to play with any
dolphins in this freaking bone is dead
already
loser
let's see if the Sun that can bring this
dog back to life before we move on to
our other tests
our first test is complete to the
underwater test and I have to say I am
NOT impressed this should not be billed
as an underwater capable phone however
we're going to continue with our
structural integrity tests and it's on
to the elephants
so but does Valerie like to play with
phones just about anything she can get
her hands on yeah yeah I've actually
already been told that while dolphins
like to eat things elephants like to
break things yes that true that is true
I think that she's gonna prove that it's
not as drought proof as we think it is
all right we'll test it out okay good
girl
you go have fun oh thank you gave back
to you I like it
just hold your hand out hope you miss
there we go all right kind of like she
doesn't she hates it it smells like salt
water it's all younger the balcony oh
there you go
Bravo Val how's it taking some damage
yeah a little wet in there too oh well
yeah that's not however Val just hurled
it to the concrete and I'm not saying
there's like a little bit of scratching
scratching all right Valerie how do you
think you're gonna have to try harder
than that yeah get it get out for it all
right oh thank you she doesn't like it
out here
got a little bit of denting on the
corner there not bad well Green is still
totally intact I can't believe how water
comes out of this every time yeah this
is like altars also a form of drying it
out hold it trunk perfect good girl that
was awesome
that's fantastic and it's still totally
fine other than the water just streaming
I don't even know where all that water
would go its boogers to some of its
boogers
all right now that iPhone is soaking wet
and covered with elephant boogers I know
you thought it was the obvious thing to
have her step on it but we're saving
that for the giraffes you know and rafts
are my favorite animal look so beautiful
okay so we're gonna try the step and
step on awesome how much does Rosie wait
so Rosie weighs about 1,200 pounds 1,200
pounds all right you know we've had a
1400 pound Boulder on a MacBook Pro it
went okay went okay let's see how the
active handles it all right so here I'll
do a screen side down okay good luck
sweetie come here
we can try the Brendon
bye-bye
I guess their pride smart enough to
avoid an obstacle baby
good kick oh yes I think I heard some
cracking I think I definitely heard a
little bit of a crack oh hi
hey are you doing it took us a while but
we have touchdown
Brandon Belt our two-year-old giraffe is
standing right on top of the s4 active
oh yes all right Brandon did all the
damage that you might have expected a
1,300 pounds ought to do yeah this would
be the cracking that I heard I'm glad
that this was a glass side down we have
some obvious scratching and stuff back
here but I think now we know the limits
of the Galaxy s4 active screen I mean
granted it's a pretty high limit but
this is it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
