welcome to the apple pie for all the
good and bad inside the world of Apple
now the big news of the week the Steve
Jobs biography is out on Monday and it's
the closest look in an essay that most
of us will ever see Walter Isaacson has
written biographies on benjamin franklin
and albert einstein and his latest work
involved over 40 interviews over the
past two years with jobs and some of
them were taped right before his passing
now Isaacson sat down with 60 minutes to
talk about the book and how SJ initially
refused surgery on his cancer and then
they do a biopsy and they're very
emotional they say this is good it's one
of these very slow-growing 5% of
pancreatic cancers that can actually be
cured but Steve Jobs doesn't get
operated on right away he tries to treat
it with diet he goes to spiritualist he
goes to various ways of doing it
macrobiotic Lee and he doesn't get an
operation why doesn't he get it operated
on immediately you know I've asked him
that he said I didn't want my body to be
opened I I didn't want to be violated in
that way he's regretful about it and his
wife is a very solid decent person
understood it but said no no the body is
there to serve the spirit you should get
this operator and soon everybody is
telling him quit trying to treat it with
all these roots and vegetables and
things just get operated on but he does
it nine months later too late well one
assumes the lakers by the time they
operate on them they notice that it has
spread to the tissues around the
pancreas how could such a smart man do
such a stupid thing yeah I think that he
kind of felt that if you ignore
something if you don't want something to
exist you can have magical thinking and
it worked for him in the past he regret
it wow there's going to be a lot of
interesting stuff from that interview
the full episode airs Sunday night on
CBS but you can check out clips at our
sister site cbsnews com where Isaacson
discussed how jobs pled
not to let money change him an SJ
putting the odds at 5050 that there is a
God now earlier in the week Apple paid
should be the steve jobs at Cupertino
headquarters where employees gathered
inside the company's courtyard with
large pictures of SJ draping some of the
buildings you can see just how filled it
was with some of our own aerial footage
where Apple CEO Tim Cook gave a speech
and musicians Norah Jones Chris Martin
from Coldplay and Randy Newman perform
now let's shift over the Apple product
side and if you doubted how well the
iphone 4s was going to sell apple sold
over 4 million 4 s's in the first three
days compare that to the iphone 4 which
hold 1.7 million units in that same time
a year ago now those are just monster
numbers now you've all seen from last
week that I've started creating my own
personal bond with Siri I'll spare you
the details but the Android and Windows
Phone big guns have downplayed series
threat at the asia d conference android
boss Andy Rubin said that he doesn't
believe your phone should be an
assistant your phone is a tool for
communicating but Andy what if my phone
is the only person that will talk to me
plus do you know she talks dirty talk
dirty to me the carpet needs vacuuming
get your mind out of the gutter you
sickos but it was you the Apple biters
that really need to get some help
because that was one of the responses
you sent me from last week's show and I
would never talk to my phone like that
all right now one big problem with Siri
though is its security the iphone 4s is
default settings lets anyone send emails
text messages and even make calls with
siri even if it's passcode locked
awesome see that's a big nasty bad apple
but the good thing there's a fix that i
would highly recommend for you so go
into your settings then general and
passcode lock settings and switch Siri
to off you can still use the feature but
not when your phone is locked like it
should have been alright plenty of you
were able to feel like you received a
brand new phone with iOS 5 and one of
the most subtle and greatest features
included is custom text tones not
ringtones but text tones so we decided
to keep
asian skunk around one more episode with
this how to bryan song here with sina
com and one of the new features in iOS 5
allows you to use your custom ringtones
as custom text tones because there's
plenty of you that have reached for your
phone when it was someone else who
received the text message loser so we're
going to show you how to do it and if
you've seen our ringtones video the
process is almost exactly the same but
let's refresh your memory so first off
let's start in itunes and find a song
like this one that i want to turn into a
ringtone or text tone right click on the
song and select get info a window will
appear with track information and you
want to select the options tab and look
for the start time and stop time
settings click on the boxes next to
those settings for now now i know where
i want my custom tonus start so i'll
enter in a start time and a stop time
there's a 40 seconds max duration for
itunes custom tones and if you want to
use sound effects or sound bites from
your favorite movie just make sure you
have an audio file that's playable in
itunes once you've set the time press ok
then go to advanced on the main menu bar
and select create AAC version itunes
will create the shorter version of your
song below the original file you'll see
the duration time and you want to drag
and drop that version onto your desktop
to make a copy now there's a little
housekeeping we need to take care of
first if the option to create AAC
version is not available in iTunes go to
your preferences and in the general tab
find the section that says when you
insert a CD click on the import settings
and then select import using AAC encoder
the option should now appear in the menu
bar you also want to go back to the
original audio file in itunes and then
check off the start and stop time so
that it plays normally from now on ok
back to our custom audio file on the
desktop we're going to change the
extension name on the file from m4a to
m4r you'll be asked to confirm the
changes and we'll use em for our now
from Windows users you'll need to go to
your control panel then choose
appearance and personalization select
the folder options and in the view tab
make sure you've unchecked the box to
hide extensions for known file types
that will allow you to see and change
the file type ok we're almost there but
before you bring your ringtone back
into itunes you have to delete the
custom version that we initially created
and if you don't do this itunes will not
accept the ringtone so this is an
important and crucial step once you've
done that drag and drop the renamed m4r
file into the source column of iTunes
and the word library should highlight it
will copy the file into itunes check out
the ringtone section and voila you have
a new ringtone plug in your phone into
your computer make sure you set it up to
sync the ringtones in the appropriate
section and your custom tones will be
synced to your phone now the final step
is to take your iOS device go into your
settings then sounds and we already know
about ringtones so this time let's go to
your text tones and you'll be able to
choose your default sound of choice from
the ones you've created and if you want
even more customization you can go into
your contacts and set specific ringtones
and text tones for your friends I'm
Brian song with your how to percussion
learning jones and text tones for iOS 5
there's no reason for you to pay money
when you can do it this way hey
Chewbacca just texted me use it wisely
that's one of our most requested tips
throughout the year but we also want to
know how the battery life is working out
for you because it's been a mixed bag
since the update is it a bad apple a
sweet apple pie just let us know all
right onto the quick bite it looks like
the iTunes Match service is just around
the corner and the big a did say it
would be ready at the end of October but
the music settings in iOS 5 has now
gained a toggle for turning iTunes Match
on or off so it's coming soon now Apple
likes to talk about its retina display
with a resolution of 326 pixels per inch
and it's really sharp but toshiba is
taking it to the next level with their
498 pixels per inch 6.1 inch screen
display an apple doesn't have any 6-inch
products but the technology is rapidly
advancing and I've got it new rumor here
right here on the apple byte the ipad 3
will be a 6 inch tablet with the super
and finally if you're a fan of the
iphone 4s camera so is the avengers
cinema photographer cmas mcgarvey who
filmed parts of the movie with the
iphone that made it into the final film
and a couple of those shots are also in
the movie trailer see even i told the
production crew here it's completely
legit to shoot a movie with the iphone
