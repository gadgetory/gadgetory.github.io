Francisco is packed with history that
hotel guests can now unlock with very
modern technology we are in the dashiell
hammett suite and it's kind of a
coincidence that we are filming here
because he typed on a typewriter and
we're talking about mobile key wireless
access to your room when a guest checks
into this hotel she can download the
free personality hotels app onto her
smartphone once the desk clerk assigns a
room it alerts the app when the guest
reaches the door she presses the key
icon to emit a sound that activates the
door sensor and unlocks the room I think
that our guests are embracing that
because they're right here where all the
high-technology and new technology is
happening as a security measure in case
the phone is lost or stolen guests can
create a special pin for the app in
addition to the pin on their phone it
doesn't say which hotel it is they
wouldn't know the room number
personality Hotels isn't the only group
to experiment with mobile keys some
properties in the Starwood Hotel Group
like aloft are expected to roll out
their version of the technology in the
coming months besides guests convenience
there's also the environmental impact
Ivonne deterred from personality hotels
estimates that at least 100,000 plastic
key cards are handed out at her for San
Francisco hotels every year five years
from now it may just be your thumbprint
it may be the glasses you're wearing
that have the computers set into it they
just blink at the lock and you're in
plastic key cards are still available
for those who prefer the old fashioned
way in San Francisco I'm Kara Tsuboi
