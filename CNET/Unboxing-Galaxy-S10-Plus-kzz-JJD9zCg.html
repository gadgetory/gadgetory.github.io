Samsung Galaxy S launch event the launch
of four new Galaxy S 10 phones you can
see this is the S 10 plus here the Box
has the same bold lettering that we've
seen throughout this entire campaign
we've got white here this is the prism
white phone and 128 gigabytes when I
move the box you can very subtly see a
little bit of iridescent so that's kind
of cool and I'm kind of bummed that I
didn't get the ceramic version because I
would really wanted to see what that was
like
okay first thing I notice is a pull-tab
and that's new it's nice because usually
I have to dump it over and then catch it
keep screen a little cleaner in this way
I really am liking the iridescent look
that I see right now it's pretty
now before I turn it on I already see
that there is a six point four inch
display that's a qhd+ resolution and
there are the two cameras on the front
that's how you know this is the galaxy s
10 plus you've got a 10 megapixel camera
and then an 8 megapixel camera as well
over on the back we've got three cameras
we've got a regular 12 megapixel camera
that is dual aperture which means that
the settings will automatically change
and low-light conditions to try to let
in more light get you a better shot we
also have ok let's do that later
all right on the back so we've got the
12 megapixel dual aperture lens we've
got a 12 megapixel telephoto lens and
then we have an ultra wide-angle 16
megapixel lens so all three of these
together are kind of what make the s 10
camera system work
here we've got the Faust wall charger a
USB a 2 USB C converter dongle and a box
this is the typical USBC cable
right
so here we have a pair of AKG headphones
with a braided cable and that will help
keep your cord from tangling up and here
are some ear tips of various sizes if
these are too big or too small
so this was the quick unboxing of the
galaxy s 10 Plus</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
