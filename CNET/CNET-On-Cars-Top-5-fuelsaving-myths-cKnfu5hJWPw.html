that gets a lot of people's attention
too bad a lot of that attention is paid
to things that don't matter
I'm Brian Cooley with my top five myths
about what saves gas in your car
number five warming up your car will
save gas like anyone does this anymore
it makes no sense anyway but today's
materials engine machining techniques
oils lubrication channel design and more
mean you can drive off a second or two
after you turn the key and not warm up
your engine wasting fuel ditto goes for
idling at a stoplight by the way hence
the new prevalence of automatic
start/stop tech in cars these days which
is generally considered to increase mpg
five to ten percent put another way
idling your car can burn a quarter to a
half a gallon of gas an hour going
nowhere number four a dirty air filter
will harm your fuel economy not unless
it says clogged as a cork in a bottle
you see your car's electronic control
unit will adjust the fuel mix to match
whatever amount of air is actually
getting in for the optimal blend now you
may get less power and torque with a
badly clogged air filter but probably
not lower mpg number three premium gas
gets you better mileage I never really
understood this one but I think it comes
from the misconception that higher
octane gas is more combustive and
therefore gives you more go for a
droplet of fuel in fact higher octane
fuel is actually less likely to detonate
and therefore it has no impact on mpg
unless you've got a car that really
specifically needs it number two
additives to increase fuel economy now
turn off the daytime TV folks these
additives and devices are basically all
BS the EPA has been testing this stuff
for decades and if they deliver any
improvement at all it's tiny I mean
seriously if you think a twenty dollar
additive or gadget for which you get two
if you pay separate shipping and
handling can outdo a hundred million
dollars in engineering your car maker
did to invent your car I can't help you
you'll save gas money and the
environment the number one myth I hear
all the time in this area is
annual transmissions delivering better
fuel economy it was the case but that
was a while ago today the automatic
gearbox will almost always deliver
better fuel economy and typically better
acceleration that's because an automatic
can be lashed to the vehicle's
electronic control units and managed for
optimal shift points how long it holds
our PMS and whether it locks up its
torque converter let's face it your
modern car is a computerized
transportation appliance and typically
when you intervene with all your fuzzy
logic things just get worse high-tech
cars and modern driving at CNET on cars
calm I'm Brian Cooley thanks for
