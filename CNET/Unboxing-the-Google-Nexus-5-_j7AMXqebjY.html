buy get the right gift at the right
price all at your ultimate holiday
showroom it's finally here after a long
time of waiting I've got the google
nexus 5 in this box and we're gonna
unbox it ready Oh lots of paper more
paper okay so I have a review unit so
Google sent me a couple extra goodies
I've got the official bumper and I got
it in this cool coral color let's open
up first it also comes in other colors
like a bright yellow black the phone
itself of course comes in white and
black oh my gosh that's a knife all
right there's a way to open it that's
with a little muscle oh there we go haha
okay here's the bumper it's a nice
silicone the Nexus logo right here it's
not raised really sleek should look good
and 10 things to know about your Nexus 5
oh and a little information about Kit
Kat because of course this is the first
phone with KitKat pre-installed now what
we've all been waiting for the Nexus 5
oh look it's got a sort of five right
here nice very sleek let's open it
AHA here it is looks good okay come out
of here we'll get to that in a second
let's see what else is in the box I
think there's anything here no no
surprises and so we've got oh it's like
a little key to get the sim card out
what I've got here is an unlocked unit
so it's compatible with any sim and a
little more instructions that we don't
need warranty more warranty you got your
power brick USB goes right into my
computer for USB cord and that's all
that's in the box so now that we've made
a mess we can get back to the Nexus 5 so
one of the most notable design changes
is this back panel right here it's
smooth nice grip LG logo is really small
really sleek Nexus logo here's your
camera 8 megapixels and here's the front
boom that's a pretty phone the keys on
the side are ceramic really slim phone
