that has only gotten better over time
with the addition of things like the
Siri remote applications and a TV Guide
still the Apple TV is not impervious to
problems here are five common problems
with the Apple TV and how to fix them
just like with your smart phone things
can go awry with apps on Apple TV they
can sometimes lag or freeze up all
together if anything like this happens
the best thing to do is to force close
the application to do this on the Siri
remote double press the home or TV
button slide left or right on the
touchpad to select that app and then
swipe up to force close it sometimes
it's more than just one app that's
acting funky or the Apple TV connect
glitchy in general just not right if
this is the case then you just need to
restart the Apple TV you can do this by
going into settings system and selecting
restart or on the Apple TV remote you
can hold menu and the TV or home button
until the light on the front of the
Apple TV begins blinking when this
happens release those buttons and the
Apple TV will restart if the Siri remote
just randomly stops working or doesn't
work at all one day it may need to be
charged you can charge it using a
lightning cable in the port along the
bottom edge of the remote you can
actually also check its charge level
under remotes and devices in the
settings you may need to use an iPhone
or iPad in the remote app to get there
if that doesn't work you may need to
reset the remote and repair it with your
Apple TV to do this hold the remote near
the Apple TV and hold the volume up and
menu button for a few seconds and it
should repair every so often without
explanation audio on the Apple TV will
cut out obviously this depends heavily
on what your own sound system setup is
but if it happens to you try restarting
the TV and any audio hardware connected
to the Apple TV such as a sound bar that
should fix the problem but if not try
restarting the Apple TV if that doesn't
work go to settings audio and video and
make sure you've selected the right
speakers under audio output and then in
audio mode make sure it's set to auto if
you've installed a lot of applications
and games on your Apple TV storage space
might get tight over time the obvious
solution is to remove some of those apps
and games if you do this from the home
screen it's going to take quite a few
steps for every single application you
want to remove highlight the application
homescreen that you want to remove and
long press on the trackpad until it
begins to wiggle
then press the play pause button select
delete and then select delete again to
confirm if you're trying to remove
several applications at once a faster
option is to go to Settings General and
manage storage there you will find
applications sorted by file size in
descending order click the trashcan to
the right of any application to remove
it and then click delete to confirm for
