a first look at the brother MSC Jay 470
DW multifunction inkjet printer so if
you're shopping for an all-in-one
printer with a small office and don't
have more than 100 bucks to spend this
is a great option with a lot of features
to keep you productive first you can
save money on paper using the built-in
duplexer that thing automatically flips
over a sheet of paper to print on both
sides you can fit a hundred sheets of
paper inside that removable tray on the
bottom here but you can also put an
extra 20 sheets inside this other tray
on top that's called an auto document
feeder you can put all kinds of
different types of media in there from
regular photo paper to envelopes or
index cards and it'll automatically scan
or copy your batches so this is the
control panel here it has a 1.8 inch
color LCD screen that shows you things
like ink levels and Wi-Fi setup
assistance but one thing I don't like is
the rubber buttons they feel pretty
cheap
not to mention dated compared to the
tactile or sometimes even touchscreen
buttons on competing printers you can
easily connect through a USB cord
underneath but if you want to establish
a connection with a Wi-Fi network you
can take advantage of all the cloud
printing features those include printing
from any Google Chrome browser using
Cloud Print or through any Apple iOS
device using AirPrint brother also
offers a full suite of cloud printing
software that gives your portable
devices access to the printer to
automatically upload jobs to services
like Facebook Flickr Dropbox and more up
here you'll find the flatbed glass
scanner that works in conjunction with
free software included called scan soft
paper port now that lets you control
where your scans go and you can easily
save projects in a number of different
formats then automatically have them
saved onto a hard drive folder an email
message or a Microsoft Office project
unlike a lot of inkjet printers that
hide the ink cartridges underneath the
scanning Bay this one actually has a
front loading bay so it's really easy to
swap out refills thankfully ink refill
prices are actually lower than average
too so check out the full review to see
those figures and of course a
performance evaluation for output
quality and speed but that's going to do
it for this video I'm Justin you you
just took a first look at the Brother
NSC J 4:17 DW inkjet printer thanks for
