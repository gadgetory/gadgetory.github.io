is back the beloved best-selling toy
from the 80s has been given a modern
tech makeover with animated LCD screen
eyes and touch sensors in his paws
I remember having Teddy tell me stories
when I was really little kid it's so
crazy getting to hold him again but now
the exact same stories that were once on
a cassette tape are available digitally
on the new Teddy Ruxpin Teddy Ruxpin is
an animated storytelling bear and in the
80s he came with books so kids could
read along to follow his adventures but
now all those same exact adventures can
be found in the app and these are the
original voice after recordings so Teddy
sounds the same as I remember hey honey
do you remember this song hearing them
again gave me chills and I can't believe
30 years later I'll be able to share the
same experience with my baby girl what
made the original Ruxpin doll so bulky
was this massive tape player on the back
but the new version is much more cuddly
he is so much lighter than the original
and very soft and very huggable and
squishy you don't need to have a phone
or tablet around to enjoy storytime he
has three stories saved inside but
you'll need the app to purchase more
stories which would be priced around
four or five dollars when the toy comes
out later this year the bear itself will
cost $100 kids can control the pace of
the story by pressing a paw
to pause or skip ahead a total of ten
stories will be available at launch but
the plan is to release more down the
road we may even see additional outfits
but what about grubby his caterpillar
best friend well that's a dream
possibility for next year for CNET I'm
