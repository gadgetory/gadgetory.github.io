welcome to the Apple buy for everything
good and bad inside the world of Apple
are you all tired of the iPhone news and
rumors you know even if it's still six
months out well let me try to spare you
this week April is just around the
corner and all the talk is about new
iPads now a report from digit Times says
Apple has moved up their production
plans for the new rumored 10.5 inch iPad
and will unveil the product at an event
in early April right now we're expecting
to see an edge-to-edge display with a
possible virtual home button and a form
factor that is almost the same physical
size as the current 9.7 but it will gain
point eight inches in screen size by
getting rid of the bezels on the sides
earlier reports said the new 10.5 inch
model would not be ready until May or
June that might still be the case but
it's now been pushed up which could mean
an earlier release date an upgraded nine
point seven inch is expected to be a
minor refresh with just that a 10x chip
for a speed boost a refresh twelve point
nine inch iPad pro the iPad that I'm
looking at better get at least the true
tone display and we expect to see both
announced at an April event but the
availability of the entire iPad family
might be a little staggered now
analytics firm fist few reports that
they have seen for new iPad identifiers
appearing in their logs they're labeled
iPad 71 72 73 and 74 and represent the
next gen iPad fisca says roughly 40
devices have been spotted and this is
normal to see about a month before a new
product announcement now some of the
iPads were spotted running iOS 10 point
3 that makes sense and some we're even
running iOS 11 we know this iOS 11 isn't
expected until September during its
normal release time but that's not all
running a new OS the co-founder of firry
Games reports a device with the
identifier Apple TV 6 - has appeared in
its uses logs running TV OS 11 with an
IP address within you know a close
proximity of apples headquarters now the
current Apple TV is known as Apple TV 5
3 all signs would point to new hardware
coming and multiple reports including
Bloomberg have claimed a new 4k model
could come as early as this year now my
suggestion get a a 10 X processor in
there for 4k support get rid of the
requirement for games that have to work
with a standard remote only so guess
what we can get more in depth games you
know even if it feels a little too late
for that
you're also way too late on that TV
streaming service but if you get one you
know then it becomes a whole lot more
interesting for people outside of the
ecosystem Apple has also released the
seventh beta for iOS 10 point 3 which
brings find my air pods
Apple's new file system and even a
podcast widget like the music app has
they've also released the seventh beta
for Mac OS ten point twelve point four
whose biggest change is the addition of
nightshift to the Mac now with the
seventh Vedas out we should be getting
an official release very very soon
also the big a release our newest TV
commercial called sticker fights and
it's a fun ad promoting Apple stickers
for their messages app but let's go back
to that caterpillar sticker or waffle
scene what's that on the left side like
if you ask me it looks like a white
iPhone 7 now I put it on Twitter and
some people said it's the silver iPhone
but look at all those white things in
that shot they're all the same color
that's white and the knife above the
plate that's silver in that shot and if
it was the silver iPhone you see those
like antenna lines on the top edges but
I don't see them there now there were
rumors of a jet white iPhone 7 that
still haven't seen the light of day but
that looks like a white iPhone to me and
I probably spend way too much time on
that you know maybe it's a white iPhone
story ok let's wrap things up on a good
note there are very few Apple ones in
existence let alone ones that work but
according to the Telegraph a German
auctioneer will be making a functioning
Apple 1 available for an option with an
estimated sales price of 320 thousand
dollars there are believed to be only
eight working units in existence the
Apple 1 will also come with all of its
original documentation from the
computers first and only owner including
the receipt and original manual you know
just like how you all do your eBay
auctions when you're reselling Jordans
it easy is that I can't get any more
because of all of you all right that's
going to do it for this week you can
email us at the Apple bite at cnet.com
or to me at brian tong thanks so much
for watching we'll catch y'all next time
for another bite of the Apple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
