the standard Prius the household name of
hybrid cars in three important ways
first of all it's got a much bigger
electric storage battery than a standard
Prius hybrid second it's got a charging
port over here you can hook it up to a
charge or even a fast charger to get
power off the grid not just by driving
third it's got software that says
utilize that additional battery power to
run on electric longer up to 13 miles
and faster up to 62 miles per hour all
much higher numbers than a standard
Prius hybrid but of course this car
still has a gas engine that is involved
in most of its driving in a blended mode
with that electric motor certainly if
you drive more than just 12 or 13 miles
between charges if you want to go more
electrified than a plug-in hybrid then
you go to a range extender now the
macdaddy of range extenders these days
is clearly this car the Fisker Karma
let's start with what it has in common
with that Toyota Prius plug-in first of
all they both have very large capacity
batteries in this car it's most of
what's lying under the belly here like a
Prius plug-in it's got that charging
port over there so you can plug this guy
in and get your first head start on pure
electric driving in this case 50 miles
on that charge but then things get
different under the hood a range
extender like this only runs on
electricity yes it's got a gas engine
but that never drives the road wheels
all that does is turn a generator that
either powers the battery or can also
send current directly to the electric
motors that move this thing but never is
it moving by the power of the gas engine
directly that's a key distinction now
the reason you put a gas engine here at
all is because you're able to run it at
very controlled rpms and loads in its
sweet spot so it's just sips gas while
generating a lot of electricity on by
the way it's got a solar roof as well
all that comes together to give this guy
50 miles of pure electric driving before
it has to then augment it with power
generated on the fly as long as you have
gas you have electricity it's kind of
this weird thing about range extenders
but very handy
