gear s2 SmartWatch which uses a rather
interesting method of control you
actually move through menus and things
like that using this rotating bezel
around the side now that's a little tip
for entry of smartwatches we've seen in
the past including the Apple watch so
what does someone who's been using the
Apple watch for several months to make
of this new bezel technology with me is
my scenic colleague Andrew Hoyle
Andrew hello hello hi Luke so bearing in
mind that we have only been using this
for a few minutes and that this is very
new technology so this very preliminary
what are your first impressions of that
rotating dial first impressions is that
I actually like it quite a lot it's
really easy to grab on the sides and to
skip through you can kind of grab hold
of the watch in a way that you can't
with other smartwatches
so far so good moving on to the Apple
watch which I can see they're sitting
pretty on your wrist here it is
now you've been using this thing for a
few months and your overall are you
happy with it overall yeah I like it a
lot I like what Apple's done with it I
like the way it actually works in terms
of the differences between the two I
would say that the digital crown is a
bit small and fiddly compared to this
dial you can roll your finger like that
but if you want to grab it and use it
you kind of have to really get fine
movement there this just a bit easier
speaking of that digital crown do you
find that you use it because you don't
need to use the digital crown do you you
know you don't actually most of the
interaction I do is actually touch and
so I end up getting my fingerprint
smeared all over it I will swipe between
I'll turn it on and go into going to the
menus and stuff but I usually do swipe
around my finger partly because I'm too
lazy to do this so again it is very
early days but would you like to see
Apple adopting or experimenting with
something like what Samsung's cooked up
I think Apple system so far it is is
actually is actually fine they have very
different interfaces apples doesn't use
this circular menu system of the gear s2
has so maybe maybe this big dial is
better
that okay so finally physical controls
don't tell the whole story in terms of
navigating through any gadget there's
also the software right of course yeah
and another thing Samsung does have a
bit of a history of making some of its
software on both his Galaxy phones and
in fact some of this earlier wearables
as well the software can be a little bit
clunky a little bit difficult to
navigate
whereas Apple on the Apple watch I found
it's it's stripped it down a bit made a
lot more simple to use so we'll
definitely be looking out for something
like that on the gear s2 I thank you
Andy Oh a thousand welcomes Luc and be
sure to stay tuned to see Netcom for
much much more</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
