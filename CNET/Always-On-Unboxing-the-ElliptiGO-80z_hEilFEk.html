at the elliptical machine and thought to
yourself I'd really like for this thing
to not just stay in one place
yeah me neither but somebody did and the
result is actually pretty cool this is
the elliptic go it works like an
elliptical machine so it gives you the
low impact on the joints work out but
it's crossed with a bike so you can go
out in the world and experience the
out-of-doors so I don't have a box for
unboxing but remarkably this thing comes
almost completely fully assembled it
looks like this when you get it and the
adjustable height handlebar set comes
kind of strapped to the chassis like
that all you have to do pull it out
stick it in this little groove here
something like that
pull all there and there you go the
wheel the front wheel also comes
unattached but you fit that in just like
you would in normal mountain bike so
really there's not much assembly but it
is it is a full sized much bigger than a
bike clearly you stand on it thusly like
an elliptical machine and I may kill
myself because I'm not exactly yeah
don't cats don't stand on the kickstand
like that very important point I yeah
you just go you just you just a lift a
go that's what they tell me and he
claims we're gonna be able to get this
into my Honda Civic so we'll find out if
that's the case or not the elliptical HC
uses a Shimano Alfa nay 8-speed geared
hub it has a trigger shifter for
climbing up steep inclines the whole
unit is six feet three inches long and
weighs 44 pounds it has an adjustable
steering column and adjustable stride
length they aren't cheap the three-speed
model starts at 1800 bucks and this 8
speed version lists at $24.99 that's not
too far off from high-end street or
mountain bikes but it is an investment I
meant just to get my feet on this thing
I'm a runner and this thing is designed
for runners there's several Olympic
athletes that use it to Train
some of the high-end marathoners are
using it to Train and it eliminates all
the wear and tear on your knees because
you're in that constant flow like you
are on an elliptical machine in the gym
it's beautiful
I don't know what else to say here we go
just be ready for this push off and
stand up now I'm walking oh yeah
I have to kind of consciously think that
I'm running I'm walking I'm running and
I'm riding all the same time
I have looked at went</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
