wrist when you can have everything you
could possibly need on your feet
these are a smart suit concept from
Lenovo here at tech world in San
Francisco smart sneakers with LED lights
on on the bottom and a bunch of motion
trackers an accelerometer a gyroscope
and everything else you needs to track
your run or your everyday movements it's
based on the Intel Curie platform and
you can basically have all of the same
functionality you would expect from a
fitness tracker like step counting
calories racking and the differences
with these is there is wireless charging
so you can just simply place them on a
base and then you'll have power to go to
track your run or your walk all your
everyday movements now the product reps
here told me that you get around 10 days
of battery life on these babies if
you're just wearing it with normal use
of you're doing some intense running you
are gonna get around 10 hours before you
need a charge now tracking steps and
watching your calories is not the only
thing you can do with beads you can
actually use them to integrate with
gameplay so you can jump around move
around and interact with the game and
actually see that reflected right on the
apps these are not available just yet
now the product reps told me that expect
them to be available later this year
there are going to be some trial
in China next month no pricing yet but
if you want to step to it and get your
fitness into gear
these might just help you out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
