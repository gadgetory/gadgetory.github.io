arrived yes the Chromebook pixel I think
this is the one that was so cool looking
that there was like a YouTube video
about it and then everyone thought it
was a hoax because it looks so cool but
it wasn't a hope but it wasn't a hug and
here it is we've got one and you have a
knife of incredible mattress I have the
rad knife that the rad viewer sent us
your car shoot sunday night yay and then
look for safety all gone there we go
right okay hey it looks like there might
be a macbook in here I'm not look is it
a Mac boner no I don't know wait it's Oh
does the same novel on it do you plastic
it down here honey oh is it one of those
flap oh for God's sake why do they could
do they did this is the nexus 2 and it
took me like half an hour to get it out
of the box we go
oh wow I heard that is get the awesome
chrome hinge okay can I just take a
moment to say that this is basically all
I've ever wanted in a laptop industrial
design like no branding no kind of crap
cluttering it up just a flat black box
but seriously look at this that's really
pretty much it yeah I do what the only
place that says chrome is right there
that's pretty wow it's so nice it's
absolutely stunning did turn right on
yeah yeah I did I look like you need a
few picture right on the display so you
can see it right off the bat but it's
got that weird 32 aspect ratio that's it
huh yeah chord so just our two sets of
power yeah cuz this just totally meant
to be Wireless all the time I don't know
I'm clicking continue but nothing's
happened well that's the thing it has to
be Wireless all the time cuz there's no
hard drive in it yeah in fact speaking
of the total lack of hard drive and
other things on the inside let's break
down specs the Chromebook pixel runs
google chrome OS it has a dual core 1.8
gigahertz intel core i5 processor it has
middlin graphics an integrated intel HD
4000 graphics card and four gigs of
memory the hard drive is a somewhat
surprising 32 gigabyte solid-state drive
and it's not the fastest drive on the
market either the display is 12.8 5
inches it falls into the 13-inch
category it's HD as you probably noticed
with a resolution of 2560 x 1700 also a
touchscreen so if you feel like putting
your grimy paws all over your beautiful
pixel display go crazy the Chromebook
pixel weighs three point three pounds it
has built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 3.0 it
also has USB 2.0 a mini DisplayPort an
SD card reader and a microphone
headphone jack in terms of pricing it
starts at again a somewhat surprising
twelve hundred and ninety-nine dollars
you can also step up to a version for
1449 that has built in
4G LTE support so unquestionably
gorgeous yeah I like crazy gorgeous I I
can tell you love it I do already
totally in love with it although I
completely understand the drawbacks the
hard drive space it's I think over the
long term you would be very frustrated i
would think actually over the extremely
short term I would know frustrated by
that I have 128 gig solid-state drive in
my macbook air and that's probably the
primary competitor to this mm-hmm I'm
out of room I mean I'm completely out of
space already and it does feel a little
heavy but boy that display is gorgeous
would you want to touch it I mean like I
do want to tell I mean I know you do
want to but over the long term you know
you've got this beautiful display well I
personally really hate mouse pads so i
would love the touch no i love the touch
screen I've been looking forward to that
too I i mean i have to say i think it is
sort of a typical Google product their
industrial design has gotten phenomenal
this is a gorgeous machine the price is
definitely high and it's for a small
subset of people who kind of only live
on the web but i don't know i think i
could maybe become one of those people</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
