2012 Nook lighter and given an
anti-glare screen protector
they added a killer feature for
nighttime reading and integrated light
I'm Bill Detweiler and on this episode
of cracking open I'm going to show you
what's inside the new Nook Simple Touch
and reveal the secret behind its glow
light if it weren't for the gray edge
along its bezel the Nook Simple Touch
with Glo light would look identical to
the standard Nook Simple Touch which I
cracked open last year but holding a
button down for a few seconds and the
difference comes shining through so how
does the light work well according to
CNET's David Carr knowing glow light
uses a form of LED front lighting
instead of the traditional back lights
found on everything from tablets to TVs
Barnes &amp;amp; Noble developed glow light
in-house and has filed for a patent so
let's crack this thing open and see
what's inside
first I popped off the power button and
removed the screw underneath
I didn't slid the matte cover down and
lifted it off disconnecting the battery
in the process
now the 1530 milliamp hour battery has
the same model number as the one on the
standard Nook this makes the batteries
interchangeable but it also means a
single charge won't last as long when
running the readers light as with the
outer shell and battery the circuit
board is nearly identical to the one on
the standard Nook there's an 800
megahertz TI OMAP processor 256 Meg
mobile DRAM chip a 2 gig storage chip
and a Georgian Wi-Fi module besides a
few extra really small ICS and
components the only big difference is a
connector used for the glow lights LEDs
on the underside of the board are the
emitters and receivers for the touch
screen system with the main board pretty
much covered we can turn our attention
to display assembly and finally
investigate the glow light system the
device is six inch display assembly is
held the front bezel with double sided
tape and separating the two is a bit
tricky but a plastic spudger and a
little patience should get the job done
now looking at the assembly one
difference between the Glo light and
standard nook jumps out immediately
the screens mounting plates are made
from different materials the standard
nook screen has what appears to be an
aluminum plate the glow lights plate
however appears to be made from a
diecast magnesium alloy the new material
may be necessary for the glow light
system but it also shaves about half an
ounce off the weight of the display
assembly flipping the assembly over we
find the glow light system mounted above
the actual e-ink screen I know this
because I reconnected the motherboard
and battery to the display powered unit
up and turned on the light knowing I was
in the right spot I removed a piece of
black and white tape from over the LEDs
and again powered on the light with that
glow lights eight individual LEDs were
finally revealed
I really enjoyed dissecting the Nook
Simple Touch with Glo light it was a
cinch to take apart has a beautifully
simple internal design and I discovered
how Barnes &amp;amp; Noble made it way less and
light up now to see more tear down
