natali del conte and it's time to get
loaded Facebook rolled out a new privacy
feature it will alert you if your
account has been logged into from a
computer or mobile device that you have
not used before you can choose this
alert to be sent over email or text
message Google is having a change of
heart over the Nexus One distribution in
a blog post on friday the company said
that selling the phone on the web has
not been the success that they had hoped
for and that they will now try to get it
into physical stores over the next few
months once the phone has enough retail
presence Google will use the website as
a place to showcase but not cell phones
the palm pre plus is now available on
AT&amp;amp;T it costs $150 after contract and
rebates this is the first time the phone
is available on a gsm network it was
previously available only on cdma with
sprint and verizon we of course have a
full review of the AT&amp;amp;T version here on
cnet cell phones &amp;amp; brain cancer are
still something we really can't wrap our
head around yet the World Health
Organization's international agency for
research on cancer has found
inconclusive links between brain cancer
and cell phone use this is the longest
project we know of that studies these
things and even more extensive study was
recently launched in Europe so basically
we don't know that much yet and we won't
for a long time if you're a fan of The
Today Show you can check in to the Today
Show's plaza on foursquare The Today
Show has concerts in Rockefeller Plaza
where the show is filmed now you can
check in if you actually go and get a
special Today Show badge kind of silly
but an interesting way for old media to
be using new media especially if you
like Al Roker a couple in Japan were
married by a robot this weekend the
marriage was presided over by I ferry a
four foot robot whose day job is to
direct visitors in a museum this had to
be far more exciting those are your
headlines for now we will be back later
this afternoon with more so stay tuned
I'm Natali del Conte we've seen a TV
and you've just been loaded</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
