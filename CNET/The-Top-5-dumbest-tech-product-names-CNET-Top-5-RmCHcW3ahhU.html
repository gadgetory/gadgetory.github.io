brandings in recent history a name can
mean a lot when it comes to success I
mean no one wants to buy a crud book or
a scum phone or an LG g5 okay that was a
cheap shot anyway companies spend a lot
of time coming up with branding and
sometimes odd ones get through here are
the dumbest at number five is the Apple
iPad at this point in time hearing the
iPad name does not seem as bad as it
once did but when Apple introduced the
iPad the name was constantly compared to
hygiene products Star Trek did introduce
the pad a tablet like device way back in
the day or the future depending how you
look at it the iPad name probably came
from that Apple's reality distortion
field had to work overtime to get the
world's to not snicker an iPad number
four is the Wii U Nintendo's Wii U is
the follow-up to the Nintendo Wii
console the Wiis codename was a very
awesome Nintendo revolution Nintendo
said that we named symbolized the
controllers the two remotes are like the
eyes I guess
however the we name made people think of
a bodily function then there's the Wii U
it still reminds people of bodily
functions or the sound and ambulance
makes worse yet the Wii U name caused
confusion some people thought it was
just an accessory and not an entirely
separate console from the week coming at
number three is oh yeah you might be
scratching your head wondering what's
anuya was it a kool aid related product
did have anything to do with Macho Man
Randy Savage was it someone at Starbucks
trying to pronounce my name nah it was
an android-powered game console and to
be fair the Ouya was a very interesting
idea with a $99 price point
unfortunately it just wasn't ready for
prime time when it was released way back
in the olden days of 2013 at number two
is the Casio G ' lowercase e uppercase o
lowercase ne I'm not sure if it's
pronounced as own or G's own or gz1
it doesn't really matter it's a terrible
name for a product the whatchamacallit
was an Android phone that also had a
commando variant if only the ghazan
partnered up with Pizza Hut maybe you
could get AGA's on with your pers own
okay that was dumb
and so was that name before we get to
number one let's talk about some
honorable mentions as suggested by you
the viewers there was quick stir that
was Netflix is branding for its DVD
delivery service
when Netflix decided to split its
streaming and DVD services then there's
Microsoft Bob this was Microsoft's
attempt to make operating systems more
friendly you know somewhere in an
alternate universe Microsoft Bob was a
hit with a professional version called
Microsoft Robert and last but not least
squirting this was a term used to
describe sharing music between Microsoft
xun's I did some research and apparently
squirting may not have been an official
Microsoft term however Steve Ballmer did
use the term squirting to mean sharing
in an interview
let the dumbness continue and the number
one dumb tech product name is opposed Oh
face branding yeah this is new when
Apple introduced the world to the Apple
find X it showed off its new 3d face
scanning tag Apple used to put the
letter i' in front of everything
Oppo has decided to put o in front of
things it has emojis and for its face
scanning Oh face yeah do I even have to
explain this one
oh no thanks to everyone for writing in
ideas on Twitter it is very appreciated
if you think of any dumb tech product
names let me know am i as a colonel see
you online wait is actor who thought
that would work</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
