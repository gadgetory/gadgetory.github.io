this is one nerdy camera in this box is
the Samsung Galaxy camera which is the
first to come equipped with Wi-Fi
it runs jellybean and you could even get
it with a data plane galaxy camera whoo
powered after all right look at this guy
I love it pretty big camera bang it's
pretty good-sized I like the white
though then you got a little handle okay
let's see what else we have here
Quick Start Guide whoo all the cables
are white I like that nice touch got our
international power brick here some
adapters for those a nice white pleather
wrist strap and our battery I'm still
looking in the box though because I
don't see an SD card and I hate that
like why do you give me a camera without
SD card come on
okay let's put the battery there let's
fire it up it's like a phone or
something like all the actions happening
on the back screen it's also just like a
phone because when you take it out of
the box you got to go through setup
alright let's do some of that while I go
through set up and get it on the network
and all of that let's talk a little more
about what this guy can do the Samsung
Galaxy camera is 16 megapixels with a 21
X optical zoom and a 23 millimeter wide
angle then it records 1080p video
there's a 4.8 inch LCD touchscreen on
the back and the touch screen is
actually pretty high res 1280 by 720
pixels there's a handy headphone jack
here that you can also plug a microphone
into it charges over micro USB charges
and transfers there's onboard Wi-Fi and
Bluetooth and also GPS this thing is
decked out it runs Android 4.1 or
jellybean it has a quad core processor
inside there's 8 gigs of storage with
one gig of ram
to power its features it does have
microSD not standard SD so you will have
to buy new cards if you have a
collection of SD cards it's expandable
to 32 gigs and it's 3G enabled you just
pop in a SIM card and away you go the
price on this guy is $4.99 now that's a
little bit steep but not as bad as say a
$549 smartphone because this thing is
running a full version of Android you
can download all Android apps to it you
can of course upload directly to
Instagram from the camera and it has
voice control it allows you to zoom zoom
in and also take photos without touching
the camera sees plus you can pair it
with a galaxy s3 and unlock even more
tool nerdiest camera ever now I got to
admit I'm having a full-on nerdgasm over
this phone except this is the part of
the show where I buzz kill you a tiny
bit because despite being a super
awesome internet-connected camera that
acts just like your awesome android
smartphone apparently this camera
doesn't take great photos that's a
bummer
you would expect that since it is $500
the camera quality would be pretty good
and it's 16 megapixels but apparently
our reviewers have noticed some muddy
photos some problems with low-light that
kind of thing now it does have a nice
collection of controls in fact you can
even enable a manual mode and try to get
more granular that way that could
improve the picture quality I don't know
though I have to say the pictures are
probably good enough for me because this
thing is awesome talk about innovating
on a point-and-shoot
I'm definitely digging it you should go
over to cnet.com though and read our
full review before you make up your
money it's been a really long time since
I got this excited about a camera how on
it
