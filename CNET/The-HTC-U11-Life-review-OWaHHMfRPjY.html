with the most impressive specs sometimes
what you really need is a pretty good
phone with pretty good specs at a damn
good price
that's exactly with the HTC u 11 life is
for it looks almost identical to the
powerful and beautiful u 11 but comes in
smaller with more relaxed hardware specs
it really is a mini u 11 down to that
gorgeous blue color and those squeezable
sides just like with the u 11 you can
program the phone to open up to two
different apps when you give it a
squeeze like the camera for example
squeeze once to open it and squeeze
again to take a photo you can long
squeeze to flip it over to selfie mode
warning though your shot may not be
totally in focus you can also open
Google Voice Search flashlight the
browser or any other app the you 11 life
has a 16 megapixel lens on both the
front and the back there's no fancy
portrait mode and photos won't be as
crisp or as detailed as those from
high-end cameras but they're good enough
for posting online and sending to family
and friends despite a few trade-offs
with battery life and processing speed
you still get a fair amount of here
instead of the glass backing you have
acrylic and there's no headset jack but
the you 11 life is water-resistant and
comes with a pair of noise cancelling
headphones in the box they plug right
into the USB C port there's also a micro
SD card slot option to boost the phone's
32 gigabytes of internal storage the u
11 life starts out with the Android
nougat but will update to Android Oreo
by the end of November look it's pretty
and the price is more than reasonable if
you're looking for a low-key phone that
still makes a statement you'll want to
keep this one in the running</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
