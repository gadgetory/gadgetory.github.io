revealed I'm Bridget Carey and this is
your cnet update someone spilled the
beans about the next version of Google's
pure Android smartphone a repair manual
for the Nexus 5 was posted online it
featured images of a purple phone so
maybe this comes in a few colors it also
had some hardware details this LG
smartphone will have a four-point 95
inch screen a quad-core Snapdragon 800
processor 2 gigs of ram and internal
storage options of either 16 or 32
gigabytes the 8 megapixel camera on the
back will be able to assist your shaky
hands with optical image stabilization
and the front will have a basic 1.3
megapixel camera it has chips to support
NFC technology for sharing data between
devices and the film can also be charged
wirelessly the battery will be slightly
better than the nexus 4 which is no
longer being sold by google this nexus 5
has specs similar to the LG g2 phone but
there are a few differences like how the
g2 has a better camera on the front and
back we could see the Nexus 5 this month
but whenever this phone is officially
unveiled it's very likely that it will
be the first phone to run android 4.4
nicknamed KitKat and that's not the only
juicy smartphone news images of the not
yet announced HTC One max were posted to
a forum on Android Central apparently
the phone is being demoed to employees
at a verizon store and the back of the
one max is said to have a fingerprint
scanner there's another image of the one
max that was leaked back in August place
next to the one and the one mini it
seems that the fingerprint scanner is
located right under the camera Nielsen
is now releasing data on how many people
are tweeting about television shows
along with data on how many people are
actually watching and as you may expect
the show's getting the most buzz on
Twitter are not always the ones with the
most viewers for example at the end of
September AMC's Breaking Bad was the
most talked-about show on Twitter but it
wasn't among the top 10 most watched
programs and looking ahead t-mobile is
making an announcement
Wednesday which is said to be the next
part of its plan to shake up the
wireless industry and for the
announcement the company is bringing in
Shakira to perform for some of its
customers I'd say she has experience
with shaking things up t-mobile impacted
the industry this year by eliminating
contracts and charging customers monthly
payments for a phone in exchange for
lower service rates and it also
introduced an early upgrade plan called
jump other carriers followed t-mobile
steps by offering different types of
early upgrade plans so check back on
cnet Wednesday to see how tmobile could
change things again that's your tech
news update but you can get more details
