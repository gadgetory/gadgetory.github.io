to the buzz report the show about the
tech news that everyone is talking about
this week my gadget pick for the entire
year Verizon poisons the Galaxy Nexus
before it even launches whenever that
might be and paypal applies to be the
biggest Grinch of 2011 but first it's
the gadget of the week the gadget of the
week is a little pimp for our cnet
Holiday Gift Guide holiday cnet com for
all our recommendations including our
top gift picks tech under 50 bucks tech
gifts for wise asses all kinds of good
stuff now last year I chose my number
one gift pick for the entire year and it
was Roku this year if there's anyone on
your list who doesn't already have a
Roku here's my gadget of the year the
gift that you can give just about anyone
and make them happy and that catch it is
the macbook air I know I've gone up and
cost a little bit here but I personally
have found the 11-inch MacBook Air to be
basically the perfect laptop for casual
around the house use travel photo video
and music management and just daily use
the newest models are fast they have
amazing battery life and they started a
relatively affordable 999 bucks I love
mine so much that I go to bed with it
most nights although that's probably a
personal problem and now for the news
Verizon continues it's slow and steady
hit job on the Samsung Galaxy Nexus we
had expected the phone might come out
this week after being released in
November in Europe now there are reports
that it's been delayed even though it
never had a launch date to start with
and I'm just saying didn't I tell you
this was going to happen back when it
was announced sketch II and to make
matters worse even if the Galaxy Nexus
does come out it apparently won't have
google wallet on it even though it has a
built-in NFC chip for mobile payments
Verizon apparently asked Google not to
include the Google Wallet feature they
cited security and user experience
concerns also the over Eisen as part of
a group called Isis consisting of
Verizon t-mobile and AT&amp;amp;T which is
trying to establish a competing mobile
payment platform how convenient what I
really find amazing though is that
Google apparently agreed to take its
wallet feature out of its flagship pure
Android phone that was supposed to get
mobile NFC payments off the ground and
give us a japan-style mobile phone
payment system for the future grow a
pair of google another verizon news the
company is launching a movie and TV
streaming service that would compete
with netflix it would be web-based and
not limited to just 50 subscribers and
it could launch sometime in 2012 and
okay maybe then Verizon could like block
Netflix apps from its phones or maybe
keep the website from working for fios
subscribers you know just if they really
want to be evil because after all you
have to work harder when you're in
second place AT&amp;amp;T was just rated the
worst cell phone carrier for the second
year in a row by Consumer Reports
customers continue to complain about
poor voice service and terrible customer
service over the phone and actually 18
tease ratings were slightly lower than
they were last year although to be fair
all the major carriers saw lower scores
this year and the top three finishers in
the Consumer Reports survey were all
small MVNOs or regional carriers kind of
like the credit unions of the mobile
phone world continuing on in our Grinch
theme paypal stole christmas from a
bunch of poor kids this week or almost
in regret c-calm that brilliant site
that makes fun of bad crafts on etsy
held the secret santa fund raiser to buy
toys for needy kids but apparently they
used the wrong paypal button it said
donate instead of by now so obviously
paypal froze the regretsy account kept
all the transaction fees and then
apparently got a little bit AT&amp;amp;T with
the customer service when they spoke
with regrets the operator April winch oh
it's all blogged in great detail on the
regretsy site my favorite is the part
where they tell her that she can use the
donate button to raise money for like a
sick cat but not poor kids good show
paypal so you know how this story goes
blog post twitter outcry internet smash
story shows up on CNN paypal issues
apology roughly 48 hours later and
offers to make a donation to regret see
and of course unfreeze the accounts and
then
drin get toys was all that really
necessary paypal children toys and now
let's take a look at what's clogging the
tubes this week it's a cannonball
smashing through the burbs okay
Mythbusters the popular Discovery
Channel show that scientifically test
common beliefs to find out if they're
true accidentally missed their target
while firing a cannon at a firing range
the Cannonball overshot some water
barrels meant to slow it down went
through a cinder block and then bounced
into a residential area where it punched
through a bedroom bounced off the roof
of a house and then went through the
window of a minivan where it finally
came to rest incredibly without hurting
anyone turns out cannonballs hard to
control I hear they built those houses
way too close to the firing range anyway
though so we got your back Mythbusters
and that's the buzz report for this week
everyone I'm Hollywood and thank you for
watching
grow a pair of Google oh if the O's doze
kick it bigger ah grow the O's grow the
O's they don't watch this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
