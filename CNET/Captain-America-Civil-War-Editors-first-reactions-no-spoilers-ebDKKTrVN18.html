of Captain America Civil War thought
maybe some of you might be interested to
hear some editors reactions I've got
luke westaway cnet to restrain I'm also
from cnet in the middle here SaLuSa
James from gamespot so we're going to
try and not drop any spoilers here so
don't worry if you're trying to maintain
the surprise Lucy why don't you go first
what did you what do you think of the
movie so I loved it I mean I'm a huge
marvel fan anyway look big fan of what
they're doing the Cinematic Universe and
this was a great way of introducing new
characters to the Avengers and they'll
slot in with the old faces incredibly
well and they really feel like a
cohesive well two teams i guess in one
but it's it's a lot of fun and it
balances some like big difficult
subjects and big plot points it balances
already well alright what do you reckon
it's a big old marvel party there's so
many new faces an old face and they all
come together really well I have to say
that I didn't quite buy this sort of the
political that the plot that actually
kind of drove a wedge between when the
first was I didn't fully by that but
it's just it's a big old fun wild party
ok and I've got to say I really enjoyed
it i mean i think what i really like
about other Marvel and MCU that's Marvel
Cinematic Universe movies is that they
seem to throw all this stuff at the
screen all these characters and all this
plot and and somehow it doesn't feel too
bogged down it's good score that sort of
light touch and I thought this was
another good example is really really
fun the action was great so I think we
all enjoyed it so thumbs up yeah anyway
if you've seen the movie let us know
what you think and stay tuned to see no</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
