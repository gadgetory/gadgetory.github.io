everything I look for in a fitness
tracker there's all day tracking
heartrate GPS for tracking pace and
distance smartphone notifications and
automatic exercise detection there's
even four gigs of space to store your
favorite songs right on the device I'm
also a huge fan of the design the curved
AMOLED screen is beautiful to look at
and actually pretty comfortable to wear
but what really excites me is the price
at $179 it's cheaper than both the
Microsoft band two garments new
vivosmart HR plus and the Fitbit surge
all of which also have GPS so based on
all of this you would think I really
like the fit too but that's not the case
battery life is extremely short I got
about two and a half days and that was
with only 30 minutes of GPS with no GPS
it lasted a little longer at about three
days so sure it's better than the Apple
watch but a lot worse than product from
Fitbit and Garmin one of the features
Samsung highlighted was spotify
integration it actually sounded really
cool but in reality it requires a phone
connected and is pretty much just a
glorified remote control it would have
been a real game-changer if you were
able to actually load your Spotify
playlist right on the device for offline
listening and then when it came time to
work out that fit to continue to fust
rate me the heart rate sensor wasn't
very accurate on runs and the GPS signal
took a long time to lock on it's also
annoying that each screen has a
different data point so I wasn't able to
view pace and distance at the same time
instead I had to swipe over to a new
screen which got really difficult as my
fingers got sweaty err this may be fine
for an extremely casual runner but you
could just be better off saving your
money and using your smart phone as a
fitness and sleep tracker it's actually
not bad but I just can't get over that
poor battery life and its really shame
since I really like the look and feel
