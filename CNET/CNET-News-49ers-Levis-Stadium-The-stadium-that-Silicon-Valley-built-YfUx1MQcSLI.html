a hefty price tag
1.2 billion dollars but the Levi's
stadium is a football field like no
other the game is still the hero whether
it's a football game or a soccer game
but done everything we can to make the
experience around the game that much
better here's what happens when a
stadium is built from the ground up in
Silicon Valley an interactive Museum
let's visitors cozy up to the Niners
star quarterback thanks to augmented
reality and so here you see our
quarterback Colin who comes out and
you'll see him do a signature move for
more fun play one of the four motion
sensing games more than 1,200 Wi-Fi
hotspots placed above and below the
seats allow fans to share gameday
selfies and tweets online without
frustrating delays it doesn't matter
which of the 68,000 500 seats you're
sitting in you can order a hot dog and
beer without missing a moment of the
game using the stadium's mobile app
we've created a system wherein a
prescribed period of time you'll get a
hotdog and a beer and a soda to your
seat the app offers ticket holders a
slew of convenient features tickets can
be paperless for replays fans that the
game can view different angles you're
gonna get multiple camera angle high-def
replays right after a play so Kaepernick
throws a touchdown pass to Crabtree you
can see it from the quarterback camera
from the wide receiver camera from the
endzone camera the app also tells you
which bathroom has the shortest line and
the wayfinding feature shows the
quickest path from one stadium location
to another the 49ers are also putting
tech to work to solve a major challenge
parking at the stadium's first sports
event a soccer game visitors endured our
plus waits for public transportation
after the game we have videos that we
send each man on like a video
demonstration of how do they can get to
their parking spot and it's not just the
stadium that's wired soon players will
be too the NFL is working with zebra
technologies to embed sensors in
shoulder pads unlocking stats never
before available there's also something
that they're talking about doing in
helmets there's obviously some in this
shoes too so there's a there's a lot of
different pieces we want to be the
guinea pigs for whatever the NFL is
trying
in the quest for a sixth Super Bowl
trophy the 49ers will take advantage of
every edge they can in Santa Clara
California
