anniversary of the Galaxy S with just
one phone it's actually giving us four
including the galaxy s 10 plus sir the
galaxy s 10 II the regular Galaxy S 10
and their very first 5g phone with the s
10 phones
Samsung has taken the very best of the
galaxy s 9 and refined it giving you
extensive screen space in a much smaller
package than you'd expect there are
those curved edges we love an extremely
thin bezels that really pull you into an
all screen experience thankfully there's
no eyebrows shaped notch on these phones
that will interrupt your view of the
screen instead Samsung has amped up this
expansive screen by cutting out a tiny
hole for the front facing camera to fit
into the display or in the case of the
s10 plus an oval that fits in to lenses
here's another big feature an in screen
fingerprint reader that unlocks the
phone when you press your finger to the
target this is a huge improvement over
blindly searching for the s nines
fingerprint reader on the back the
galaxy s 10 phones are the first to have
qualcomm ultrasonic fingerprint
technology which uses sound waves to
unlock the phone other phones with
fingerprint readers use optical sensors
which are critiqued for being easy to
fool I didn't get a chance to set up my
own fingerprint this time but I will be
all over that in my final review these
phones feel thin light and easy to hold
they have a headphone jack water
resistance and wireless charging support
there's even a mode you can turn on to
wirelessly share power that lets you
charge another Qi enabled device using
the Galaxy S tens battery reserves don't
worry the phone stops sharing when
you're down to 30% so you won't
completely run out of juice by now
you've probably noticed that the S 10
phones come in flashy colors like
flamingo pink prism blue prism green and
canary yellow in addition to glossy
white and black the larger Galaxy S 10
plus also comes in white and black
variants made with ceramic backs samsung
says these are more durable than the
regular glass packings unfortunately you
can't get every color in every country
but she should have at least one snazzy
shade to choose from Samsung cameras
have always been a selling point and
this year at the galaxy s 10 plus and II
have a 16 megapixel ultra wide lens and
a 12 megapixel wide-angle lens so you
can take portrait moon shots the s10 and
SN plus now add a third camera to the
back a 12 megapixel telephoto lens with
2x zoom you can toggle among the lenses
from the camera app I'll pre have a 10
megapixel selfie camera on the front but
only the plus model adds a second 8
megapixel camera for your portraits
selfies the 5 G version we'll see later
this year will have a 3d depth sensing
camera on both the front and back but
it's for better portrait shots and a are
not for unlocking the phone like the
iPhones face ID if you like a little
help lighting up shots and optimizing
settings the s10 camera will let you
turn on shot suggestions this is brand
new and it gives you guidelines for
getting the best pic AI software onboard
will also recognize the scene that
you're looking at and apply lighting
settings automatically to help make it
look good you can turn it off with the
tap if it's dark enough the bright night
setting will automatically kick in to
enhance a low-light scene these as 10
phones support HDR in UHD video
recording and there's a super steady
video mode as well
still with me good because there's more
our old friend Bixby is back this time
with some routines that you can program
to automatically change her phone
settings as you go about your day so for
example it can turn on Spotify and turn
off Wi-Fi when it senses that you're in
your car these phones are the first to
come pre-installed with Samsung's new
when UI software which runs over android
9 you care about this because it's
samsung's attempt to overhaul a
previously cluttered galaxy skin when
you eye is supposed to help make
navigation more one-handed but I did
notice that you still have to reach up
to the top of the screen to engage the
notifications shade still too early to
say how when UI helps or hinders but I
will say that larger buttons do seem
like easier targets for your fingers to
hit okay so how do you tell these new
Galaxy S 10 phones apart well the Galaxy
S 10 5 G which we weren't allowed to
turn on is the largest of the bunch with
a 6 point 7 inch screen
of 4500 milliamp battery 2 cameras on
the front and 4 cameras on the back
including that 3d depth sensing camera
we talked about it will have 256
gigabytes of storage a gigabytes of RAM
and no external storage
next comes the s10 plus with a 6.1 inch
screen and those two cameras on the
front there's a 4100 milliamp battery
and you can buy it in 128 512 and even
one terabyte storage options with
expandable storage up to 512 gigabytes
the regular s10 has a 6.1 inch screen
and one main selfie cam the s10 a screen
drops down to a 5.8 inch display all the
galaxy s turns run on the snapdragon an
855 processor
finally we get to the money question how
much do they all cost and when can you
buy them you'll fork out a thousand
dollars for the Galaxy S ten plus 900
for the s10 and $750 for the s10 II
those three musketeers will go on
pre-order February 21st and you'll get a
free pair of new Galaxy buds as a gift
they all sell in stores on March 8 but
if it's the 5g Galaxy S ten year after
you're gonna have to wait a little while
longer in the US it will come
exclusively to Verizon in the second
quarter before coming to other carriers
pricing is still unknown this was just a
very brief taste of all four new Galaxy
S ten devices but we're gonna dig in
with a full review coming up soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
