the old new bike applause desktop from
Seagate now this is a very first five
terabyte external hard drive I have seen
a 5 terabyte is a huge amount of space
in my testing the drive here is also
very fast offering the sustain will will
speed up some 150 megabyte per second
for writing and more than how 280
megabyte per second for reading and that
is really fast but even with that speed
he said take you up to 10 hours to fill
it up with data as how spacious it is
but having more storage space never
hurts it is a backup Drive and that
means you can actually use it to store
multiple backups or multiple versions of
one backup set against the time that you
accidentally make wrong changes to your
data and speaking of backing up this one
here come included with Seagate
dashboard software like backup software
I feel very useful for a home user you
can shoot the backup to your computer
your social media content and even your
mobile devices if a computer you can
choose what you want to backup or let
the software pick what should be backed
up for you and after that it would
backup when changes are detected or on a
schedule that you set now the software
only works with Seagate Drive and
doesn't allow for all the time backup
that available in the market but for
home user is more than good enough I
think is added a lot of Vantage the
drive here now the drive designs very
straightforward on the inside has 13.1
in desktop into a hot rod like this one
and over here there's a one USB 3.0 port
and one power port
now there is one USB cable and one
powered ever included and that's all you
need to make it work you can see on the
side here on the bottom there's many
small openings to work as the
ventilation and to keep the drive on the
inside cool and in my testing it was
very cool and also very quiet there is
not even vibration at all when it's
working now after back to dry is pre
formatted for Windows but it comes great
driver software to make Mac's also able
to read and write
to it now the dry here work best with
USB 3.0 but it also works with USB 2.0
as much slow performance obviously the
backup plus desktop here is available in
four capacity two three four and five
terabytes and actually very affordable
they'll fight here by here the more
expensive cost just less than two
hundred and twenty dollars it's a good
deal I would say now for more the drive
here check out my full review etsy.com
you know is a great drive for any
computer or server the support USB 3.0
so the real question is what do you have
to fill it up with don't tell me though
without things I just do not want to
know and that's because I don't know and
this has been the first look at the
backup plus desktop from CD</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
