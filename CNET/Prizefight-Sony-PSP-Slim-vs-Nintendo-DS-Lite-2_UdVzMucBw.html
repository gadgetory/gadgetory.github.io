is it's time for Tech's battle for
bragging rights
i'm brian tom and we're here to find out
who comes out on top in the battle for
portable gaming dominance in this week's
prize fight it's a face-off between
sony's PSP slim and a Nintendo DS Lite
let's get to it with round one we're
talking design both of these gaming
systems received makeovers to bring back
the sexy and it works for them the PSP
is slimmer and lighter and showcases its
PlayStation controller layout on the
device the DS Lite had a more drastic
redesign cutting off a lot more fat and
it kind of looks like an Apple MacBook
the PSP screen is enormous and the DS
has dual screens that are smaller but
you can also close the DS to protect its
screens and that makes it more durable
too both of these devices feel sturdy
enough to me but the DS Lite just gets
the edge up with a four and the PSP gets
a three next round gameplay the PSP
offers a gaming experience that
PlayStation owners are used to the
control scheme is a lot like a
PlayStation controller and I was really
able to get used to the analog control
as well the DS Lite offers a gaming
experience like no other with its touch
screen technology it's so unique because
it offers interactive gaming you can't
find anywhere else it even uses its
microphone to give a dog commands or
cool down food when you blow on it
Nintendo strikes hard this round up with
a five and the PSP gets a three Sony's
getting a little bloody but if I'm a
betting man their fortunes might be
changing next round is all about
features the PSP isn't just the gaming
machine it's a multimedia freak and then
some outside of gaming you can use it as
a music player a picture viewer and
movie player using Sony's UMD's that
never really caught on or your own
videos on its memory stick you can
stream live TV to it stream media from
your ps3 remotely browse the web use it
for Skype listen to internet radio I'm
not even done but you get the idea it's
ridiculous the DS Lite is basically just
made for gaming you can get a web
browser for it but that's about it there
are third-party options for music and
video playback
it's not nearly as elegant and all of
Sony's features are officially supported
both of these are Wi-Fi equipped but
Sony's PSP gets a huge bounce back in
its step with um of five and the
Nintendo's DS Lite gets a three so knees
down by one next up the mornings the PSP
has graphics on a portable that you
can't match anywhere else it's basically
a portable ps2 and games look great
especially on its large widescreen game
load times are faster than before but
you'll still have to wait a bit it's
battery life gets about four to five
hours of real gameplay and you'll have
to charge it more frequently than you
want the Nintendo DS Lite won't allow
you in the graphics category but its
battery life is ridiculous I've a t'
hours of gameplay before charging it and
game load times are pretty much
non-existent Nintendo swings back with
hum a 4 in this round and the PSP gets a
3 the DS Lite leads by 2 going into the
final round
what will decide the final round it's
all about the game library the PSP is
game library tends to cater to the more
hardcore gamer and it does have its
seller titles like God of War and Final
Fantasy but it delivers a gaming
experience that isn't really any
different from ps2 which is both a good
and a bad thing the DS Lite tends to
cater to the casual gamer but it has
such a wide range of unique titles like
Zelda Phantom Hourglass for more serious
gamers to Big Brain Academy for anyone
both of these systems have great gotta
have titles but in the final round the
DS up gets a 4/4 it's super diverse
library and the ps3 gets a 3 so let's
look at the final score in this portable
gaming duel the Nintendo DS Lite ends up
on top 22:17
the DS Lite wins the prize fight now you
know we like to have fun here on the
prize fight ring and if you're looking
for a unique portable gaming experience
you can't go wrong with the DSi
but if you're looking for a gaming
device that is also a multimedia monster
and jam pack of features the PSP is the
one for you i'm brian tom thanks for
watching and we'll catch you guys next
time on another prize fight</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
