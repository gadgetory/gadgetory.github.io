a look at dimmable LEDs and testing out
some of the concerns that people have
about them now what we've got here is
our light bulb testing rig that's set up
with a couple of common wall switch
dimmers we've got a Lutron model a
Leviton model there in the middle and
then a cheap $5 rotary dimmer that's
supposed to work only with incandescent
now one of the chief concerns people
have about dimmable LEDs is the fact
that they might buzz but that's not a
problem that is unique to LEDs take a
look at this incandescent bulb it's been
buzzing the whole time I've been talking
and you can't hear it that's what it
sounds like
the reason it's buzzing is because of
the dimmer the dimmer is cutting the
power back and forth from full to low
strength as you dim it up and down so
it's not actually halfway it's actually
just approximating it by alternating and
that causes electromagnetic resistance
which makes the filament vibrating
Wiggles around in there you can kind of
see it almost if you look close with
LEDs you get the same problem there's no
filament but there are still parts in
there that'll move around in that
electromagnetic resistance that's it now
let's look at this Cree 60 watt
replacement LED as you can see it dims
fine it goes up and down and it's
definitely dimmable like they say but
there's still that buzz and I take my
microphone off again you can definitely
hear it but now take a look at this
probably the most interesting result
we've got in our testing was this
philips LED this is the standard Philips
60 watt replacement LED not the slim
style flat bulb we'll get to that one
but this is just a normal LED that they
sell and you can see even on this
incandescent only cheap rotary model it
dims just fine and there's also no
buzzing if I hold my microphone right up
to the bulb you might be able to hear a
little bit of buzzing but to the naked
ear just about a foot away I can't hear
any buzzing none of us can and that's
the same on all three of these dimmers
so that's a fantastic result for Philips
that said remember that slim style model
that I mentioned well this is it right
here and as you can see it works with
dimmers but as you can hear buzz is
pretty badly it was one of the worst
performers in our dimming test in that
regard
it also flickers a bit at low light
levels which I don't like either one
last thing we want to point out if
you're thinking about going with smart
LEDs that dim on their own they have
built-in dimming capabilities you're not
going to want to use them with a
built-in wall dimmer this is the
connected by TCP bulb one of my favorite
smart LEDs and it works well when you
dim it on its own but when you use it
with a wall dimmer like this one you get
really really bad performance but he use
this bulb in a lamp or any overhead
light that doesn't have a built-in wall
dimmer it'll dim on its own with the
built-in remote or through the app and
there won't be any buzzing there will be
any flickering and that's across the
board for life X Philips you any smart
bulb that dims on its own moving forward
we'll be testing out a lot more dimmers
and a lot more bulbs looking for things
like buzzing and flickering in the
dimmable range how low those bulbs can
go before they cut out and all that's
going to lead up to our big series of
LED reviews we'll be reviewing every
bulb that we test in full and
recommending our favorites all to help
you make better bulb buying decisions
for CNET appliances I'm red Chris</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
