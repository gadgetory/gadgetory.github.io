the stories that matter right now at CES
it's become clear that Amazon is
doubling down on Alexa enabled products
as a number of new gadgets and
appliances being debuted at the show are
taking advantage of the company's
digital voice assistant brands like dish
ADT Lenovo whirlpool and many more seem
to have chosen Alexa as their foundation
for smart home integration and we expect
to see more items making use of the tech
as the show continues it appears that
Samsung is attempting to re-enter the
gamer market with a new gaming centric
laptop and after the company's press
conference right here at CES 2017 the 15
inch notebook Odyssey will include a GTX
1050 GPU which is good enough to produce
some fairly impressive visuals but we're
really curious about the higher-end 17
inch model which will likely ship with a
better graphics card both laptops allow
for upgradable memory and SSD drives
finally the war of TV streaming services
rages on as word that hulu service will
go for less than forty dollars a month a
subscription will also give users access
to gulo streaming service and we'll be
finding out much more about who lose
plans right here at CES
we can say up to date with the latest by
downloading the cnet tech today app in
the Apple App Store</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
