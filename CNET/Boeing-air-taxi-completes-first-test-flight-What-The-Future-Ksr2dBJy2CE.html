destination for all those tech stories
that make you say WTF now today we are a
step closer to flying around in air
taxis boeing tweeted out this video of
what it says is its first test flight of
its autonomous vertical takeoff and
landing vehicle now during the flight
the vehicle only demonstrates a few
abilities namely takeoff hovering and
landing as well as some autonomous
abilities boeing says it will expand
testing to include traditional wing base
flight and transitioning between those
two states the company says that's the
trickiest part boeing hasn't named the
aircraft though we do know it's designed
to be completely autonomous and that
it's electric motors and battery are
designed to give it a range of up to 50
miles now this comes just weeks after
helicopter bell unveiled a non working
prototype of its Nexus flying air taxi
at CES both Bell and Boeing have
partnered with uber on its plan for our
network of flying air taxi uber has said
it hopes to launch uber air by 2023
Blue Origin returned to space this
morning after a six-month hiatus this
marked the tenth successful launch of
the new Shepard rocket now onboard were
eight research projects sponsored by
NASA the Shepard is like a smaller
version of SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket now
last week we origin which is owned by
Amazon's Jeff Bezos showed us its vision
of its own future with dis animation
this is the planned new Glen rocket
named for NASA astronaut John Glenn it's
designed for launching heavier payloads
like satellites and even people into
orbit Blue Origin says the Rockets first
stage will be reusable for 25 missions
they're hoping to launch the new Glenn
sometime next year
what you're seeing here is thousands of
microbots behaving like human cells now
that means they can communicate with
each other and determine where they're
needed on their own they don't need to
be told what to do now if this looks
familiar
it may be reminding you of the microbots
from big hero six what I want them to do
in this instance scientists program each
bot with various levels of a simulated
substance they called morphogen now the
green BOTS have the highest morphogen
levels researchers told all the bots to
seek out others with those high levels
of morphogen now you end up with these
concentrations of green bots that
scientists say resemble what's known as
a turing spot those are patterns that
emerge naturally in nature now in the
future researchers imagine thousands of
these BOTS creating dynamic shapes like
a temporary bridge that adapts to shape
and fits the terrain alright time for a
question Kevin wants to know if the Bell
Nexus flying air taxi would be really
loud Bell is touting this as the future
of urban rideshares now even though it's
powered by those six massive fans Bell
says it will be quiet enough for city
travel of course we haven't seen a
working model yet and Bell says testing
won't begin until 2023 all right what
makes you say WTF let us know in the
comments if you enjoyed this video think
about giving us a thumbs up that's gonna
do it for this week i'm andy Altman
thanks for watching what the future</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
