California has just wrapped up and seen
at senior writer char chick who was
inside Apple had a record quarter with
iPhone sales did we hear anything from
team about future products areas of
interest that Apple is working on so
there's always a question that relates
to something about the future you know
this year I was surprised nobody asked
about an Apple car augmented reality
artificial intelligence we also had some
questions about how Apple views iPads
versus Macs
Tim said that he sees them as separate
but he sees the iPad stealing more share
from computers but he was quick to say
not the Mac because the Mac is different
than other computers and does more Tim
also talked about how important the pro
community is to Apple so Apple revised
its laptops last fall for the first time
in about four years but they haven't
made any changes to desktop computers in
in years basically he reiterated that
Apple really cares about creators it
really cares about creative
professionals it's just because we
aren't seeing anything yet it doesn't
mean that they're not working on things
so I think it was his way of saying hold
on we're gonna come out with new
products for you soon just wait we
really care about you
last year's shareholder meeting was
focused around obviously the big
discussions around privacy and the FBI
investigation into the San Bernardino
case what was the mood like this year
now those discussions are mostly wrapped
up yeah so we didn't really hear a lot
about encryption Tim Cook mentioned it
you know in terms of politics there were
questions about net neutrality so this
is the treatment of all content over the
internet being treated the same Tim Cook
made some comments about how they don't
like politics but they know it's
important to be involved in the
conversation about policy I think this
also kind of speaks to Tim meeting with
Donald Trump Tim was basically trying to
say we think it's important to have a
seat at the table you know to have sort
of influence in some way one of the
notable people in the room was Reverend
Jesse Jackson he was here last year as
well several hundred billion dollars in
offshore monies that must be some plan
to repatriate those monies it's it's
Apple or Cisco it's it's Microsoft and
other companies
they get the money back - in two targa
the investment for reconstruction of the
urban cities and rural areas about
country sharra thank you very much for
the inside scoop on everything Apple at
the shareholders meeting and make sure
to stay tuned to see net for all Apple
