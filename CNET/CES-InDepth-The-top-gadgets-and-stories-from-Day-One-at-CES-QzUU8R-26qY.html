depth from the cnet stage at CES 2014
i'm brian Tong you know these two
knuckleheads right next to me donna bell
and brian cooley jolly Neapolitans to
use thank you the theist my esteemed
colleagues that here with seen it now
for the next 20 minutes we're gonna kind
of wrap up and bring you some of the
hottest news and products that we heard
about today from CES day one yesterday
was pressed day today is really
officially CS day one so we want to jump
right into it we started the day with
Sony's keynote and they revealed their
new service called PlayStation now if
you guys aren't familiar with it this is
Sony's kind of answer to bringing some
of those games from the ps3 and possibly
ps2 backwards compatibility back to the
ps4 but through a streaming service
streaming gaming service streaming
gaming service yes ah you're not you
don't care I never got into the Sony
stuff so by I'm excited that it looks
like it's a way for it's an answer that
Microsoft is not provided for like
streaming of the back catalogue of games
right I mean it seems like a unique Sony
proposition was there any pricing around
that or pricing it's going to be either
subscription or like a or pay service on
the spot but they didn't give any price
it wasn't strictly games either right
wasn't it kind of like all their audio
content another component that they
haven't announced yet which will be like
live TV or recorded TV on demand that
you can stream from the that's the
question is what live TV and what DVR
ability will they have because that's
where they can go ahead to head with
Xbox which that's a big Delta right now
his xbox is going stronger living room
and ps4 has gone stronger to rate
remaining more game this is an important
ketchup move I think to make them more
on parity with xbox 360 and it sounds
like it's got a little bit of steam box
DNA in it right the streaming games
moving them all through a lingua franca
of the net and just playing them out
that way I won't like worry about well
or lingua franca do you like I'm kind of
hungry exactly that says like a sandwich
though absolutely also with Sony they
revealed our ultra short throw 4k
projector this is called the life UX and
think of it as a projector on top of
your ceiling really short range maybe
more below or via or below somewhere
like four or five feet away projects a
147 inch 4k image on your wall retail
price ranging around anywhere for
30 to 40,000 dog McDonald described it
best there's a picture of it right there
you see it down bike as kind of a left
to kaz hirai there it looks like a
baseboard heater hey this is warm but I
mean the way I'm assuming I haven't
talked to Kozma about this but I'm
assuming this is his dream for what the
ideal for case situation would be
because he's been pretty strong about
how 4k televisions in that 60 70 kind of
mostly consumer range of televisions 4k
really doesn't make a lot of sense not
big enough to have that resolution
really deliver anything different port
80 injectors is what he was really
excited about it but who's going to
install do all the work to install the
projector in the back of the room run
the cables do all that mess well so a
short throw projector right on a little
shorter looks like it's throwing like on
the wall right there we do we do need to
mention that Donald showed us how to
build your own projection screen so I
think you would be that guy that's not
would Bill get the dental unit for this
valve I'm sorry thank you for giving
that Thun all right also kind of cool
little retro throwback Polaroid shows
off their Android camera now how many
you guys out there remember Polaroid
take the picture get the picture
instantly this is a cool Polaroid
Android camera and it prints out the
photo right after you take it it's about
a foreign a half inch device socialmatic
socialmatic I just love the fact that
it's it's bringing some of that
nostalgia back and no price is set yet
which to me is critical this is the 30
bucks for 80 sheets of print paper which
that's just the paper and that is it's
not bad it's pretty that's way cheaper
than polaroid photos are or were they
run about a dollar and exposure you can
still buy polaroid film from fujifilm
but this is an inexpensive media but if
this is like a $90 camera I think people
are gonna use it for a while and then
tell their friends II i use it for a
while then i stopped using it's got to
be a cheap camera otherwise forget it
it's just not that important is there an
Instagram tying or is it just modeled to
look like the insula you know what
happens it's actually I was gonna get
started from a project that was like a
Kickstarter that they tried to launch
and they were saying this is like an
instant Instagram camera of you never
took off and then Polaroid partnered
with them okay rate this device so this
is kind of the the REM
it's of that project library looks like
an icon right yeah but what I loved
about the Polaroid is that it was the
anti-social camera right i mean there's
no social sharing with you flip the
Polaroid film not there has look at your
laptop tell you that let you cut it up
into a lot of pieces he doesn't scale
when I went over to the booth though the
the funny behavioral thing people are
taking pictures with some of Polaroids
other models and they're like well the
picture takes too long to see now you
know everyone so used to taking the
selfie you know you do that a lot here
and then looking at the selfie and then
sending the self you know you got to
shake it out yeah which okay let's
dispel the myth right now you don't
shake fuller Roy photos and you don't
shake these wrinkly you don't shake
those either what was the song that did
the shake it like a Polaroid picture
baby I guess Polaroid pretty to make
that thing with how everyone's doing
maybe they can make it a new me the new
new version of the biggest shake-up a
movie shake n bake everyone wants to do
all right is in kind of a last one maybe
not the sexiest but just another move
for yahoo has their kind of trying to
transform themselves and really be more
even a bigger more relevant content
machine they showcased and announced
their news digest app this will be on
your iPhone first what it does it's a
combination of algorithms and curation
of the top ten stories it'll be
delivered to you early in the morning
and then later at night so you kind of
get two hits of the latest stuff the
most relevant stuff again one of their
pushes to get that new content that they
you know they want that fresh kind of
edge that people are looking for yeah I
feel like if it wasn't yahoo no one's
getting app coverage like that happen
now stream coverage se yes only yahoo
could make that happen but it'll be
interesting to see it happen yeah when
the iPad first came out member all the
magazines that launched an iPad was
gonna be a magazine platform more than
anything at least in the beginning and
there are all these new magazines custom
built for the ipad and we were all gonna
pay for them nobody pays for tablet
magazine I think it's down to like maybe
two percent of all magazines are like
I'm like I'm one of those few people
that actually paid you know i buy i buy
the physical subscription as well add a
little more it's supposed to be really
pop that's why i am on one of those guys
yeah but i think they say this is going
to print magazine like which i don't
necessarily is it's more of a digest
yeah but the magazine on the multiple
thing that arrives at special times like
this on a publication moment that's part
of why the magazine hasn't been very
popular on tablet is we're just used to
what we want when we want it although i
like the idea their organ
I in condensing I think a lot of us miss
the organization of a periodic print
publication all right now you guys we're
gonna check out another headline here
have you guys seen the bendable Samsung
85 inch TV yet you guys check that out
it's cool when it crazy I don't know if
you need it big buzz it's all the big
buzz is here so we've got Sharon Vaknin
ready to give us a live look if you
haven't seen already at one of those
bendy tvs in samsung futon is gianni
because of the Cold War amped up about
this oh hey hey guys we are here at the
Samsung booth which is always one of the
more striking boots at CES they always
put on a big show and this year their
biggest product is their curved TVs on
this wall behind me are a couple dozen
curved TVs and they look pretty good but
some people still think they're a
gimmick and I want to talk to you guys
about that today so 10 feet this way and
while we're here look at this food
that's kind of insane they're showing
off appliances they've got more home
theater solutions but what I really want
to show you guys today is what's really
attracting a huge crowd here at the
booth so curved TVs are new and they're
so new that Samson knows that consumers
aren't necessarily sure whether or not
they want to stick with a flat panel or
the curved TV so may I introduce the
bendable TV this is insane watch as one
of the booths attendants clicks a button
and the screen just bends mind you this
is a glass screen so it's a flexible
display the degree at which it's bending
is called 4200 are ok that's that sort
of describes the radius at which its
spending all this talk you might still
be wondering
and so well first of all you see you
guys see this it's got it's like an
accordion so can we can we close it
again i want to show you how crazy this
is so she clicks a button and the screen
starts to flatten in theory this is
flattening is it going oh my gosh it's
so smooth I didn't even know it as boom
and it's flat again so I a samsung okay
how much is this guy going to be and
when is it coming out no answers this
isn't really intended to come to market
it's really just a prototype to show
just how awesome Samsung's technology is
and what it can do so don't expect it to
come to market as far as the price goes
um very expensive 99 ballpark amount so
again curved TVs are new they're big hit
at CES this year but I think that
companies like Samsung do have a long
way in convincing consumers that this is
what they want my experience I've spent
some time in the Samsung booth and I
have to say that if you are sitting dead
center right smack in the middle of that
curved display you're going to have a
really immersive experience it's going
to feel like you're at a movie theater
like a little bit of a 3d effect the
moment you step right or left too much
though that angle or that viewing angle
starts to get a little bit distorted so
if I'm over here on the left that side
looks really good to me right because
now it's curved towards me but right
here it's not the best picture for me so
I still need to be convinced a little
bit at a really big size like this 85
inch or it looks good no arguments there
um but for my living room we'll have to
see alright guys there's little peek at
the Samsung booth and their bendable TV
back to you alright guys thanks for
sharing for that I think the same some
people got to her a little bit two
things going on here first of all is
taught listen people earlier and they're
saying wait a minute you're talking
about these curved TVs but isn't the
whole idea right now that we're buying
super thin LED TVs and maybe eventually
Oh LEDs when they become affordable
because we love how they just go flat
against the wall right now the
industry's reverse
direction of giving us curved TVs that
are about eight inches deep so this is
one that answers when you're watching it
curve it if its supposedly a better
image I'm not convinced either and then
when you're done hit the button of thing
flattens into the wall for good looks in
your house or to show slides that are
running just as wall art well even
besides watching sharing with the TV you
can see like the little the light on the
camera that's lighting her was went from
being like a pinpoint reflection in the
screen to being like a streak that just
came out it's like ha I mean of all the
the other one one of the more popular
around us we have on seen it as like the
matte screen TV or TVs for like really
reflective rooms this is a TV that
creates a war with ok that's really cool
the other thing about the whole
immersive thing when you ever if you
guys go out to the Samsung demo they
tell you to stand in the center very
close yeah like of course it's going to
be immersive when it's wrapped around
your peripherals and you're like two
feet away from ok so this is this is the
dirty little secret of 4k TV the BTS
bring it up here when you buy a 4k TV if
you ever do one day you're probably buy
a bigger TV you've ever had before
because you're going to say I want a
bigger TV and 4k is great lots of pixels
to fill it and then your natural
inclination is to say is the biggest TV
I ever had we can back up a little bit
and still have this big TV yours knit
you need to get closer to a 4k TV this
is kind of the counter intuitive thing
the idea is you get closer the screen
there for phils more of your vision
creating the immersive affect whether
it's curved or not and you still can't
see dots or lines maintain the illusion
of reality so when you get a higher res
TV move in don't sit back otherwise you
kind of waste it all right you know when
I get this close to Donald yeah how am I
sure you're very nice okay I want to get
closer ya know okay all right you guys
time for break we'll be back kick this
show in a moment with a live demo of
Panasonic's high-tech moisturizing hair
dryer ladies and gentlemen you want to
take this out
my dad had a Honda my mom had a Honda
who is coming from a 2007 honda accord I
traded it for fusion titanium I am no
joke i test-drove 15 different vehicles
I kinda was indifferent toward fort and
then i sat in the fusion for the first
time but i just like wow this is it you
have the power but you have the fuel
economy that's what EcoBoost does I love
to help people look at what board has to
offer
okay welcome back to CS in-depth live on
the scene s stage now we've got our
friend lovely lexus avedis here all the
way from cnet sydney she's going to demo
off the new Panasonic hairdryer and
Lexie I'm gonna just toss it over to use
tell us everything about this what's it
like thanks Brian well this is a brand
new hair dryer okay we're thinking a
whole bunch of tech here at CES it's all
about bendable TVs everything we're all
sorts of connectivity but this is just a
hair dryer and no it's not the Home
Shopping Network either I'm actually
gonna give you a live demo of it the
main part about the Panasonic nano is
all down to the ionizing technology
that's inside so I have here Jeffrey
guest artist from Panasonic who is going
to be blow-drying my hair now the
hairdryer looks pretty much like a
standard hairdryer and for all intents
and purposes it's got a whole bunch of
the same controls so you get a couple of
different speeds and a couple of
different heats as well as a range of
heads and settings so you can style your
hair any number of different ways the
main difference with the nano e is all
down to the ionizing technology and
that's from a separate vent at the top
that's just above where the actual
heated air comes out so these ionizing
particles are slightly different to the
ones that you find on regular ionizing
hair dryers there are a thousand times
more moisturizing so this means that all
of the moisture from the air and your
hair itself is actually going to be
locked in so you end up with shinier and
more healthy looking hair now Jeffrey's
just blow drying a very small section of
my hair because it's Vegas it's dry
outside it's the desert and my goodness
my hair is turned totally frizzy and
it's going to take a long time to dry
all of it but Jeffrey's doing a pretty
good job of styling it at the moment
Jeffrey tell me a bit more about how the
hair dryer handles is it just like a
regular hair dryer I really really love
about this dryer is number one the
weight of it I've been working all day
and everyone's asking my arms are
getting tired but they're not really
honestly it's a really lightweight blow
dryer but what I love about this is it
literally conditions the hair
as you dry it so the number one
complaint I hear in the salon is about
heat damage and that's damaged from
excessive hair drying but this literally
puts the hair in better condition after
you've heat styled it which is I think
revolutionary guys I've got to admit
something actually did pop over to
Panasonic's group earlier and get my
hair done properly with this nano air
dryer and it's actually stood out really
really well for the remainder of the day
that was about six hours ago or so and I
went outside it's not frizzy it's not
turning into a lion's mane like it
normally does when i get my hair
blow-dried or i do a terrible job of it
myself of course it helps if you have a
professional stylist on an to do it for
you but overall the results are proving
really really nice and I can definitely
see a difference if you want to check
out before and after difference you can
check out the cnet video I've just
popped it up online now so you can see
what my hair looks like before and what
it looks like after all right it does to
be teased hair I know you know you don't
mess with this you no matter this I want
to see that all good ionized nice drive
right yeah I mean I'm a tree died i
loved how but some of the ladies from
the backstage area keep your on to check
out okay for the audience out there
right now um how many of you are act
like kind of intrigued by this product
right now put your hands up hands up all
right all right I see some men to put
guide your hands I see the ladies at the
hands up what you doing about to make me
hair up their rope here you got some
nice hair man you got your gonna be he's
like don't bust me out like that all
