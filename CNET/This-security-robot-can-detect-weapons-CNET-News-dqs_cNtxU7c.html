happy to take a selfie with you but it
has a much more serious side the ability
to do concealed weapon detection to
actually know that someone's carrying a
firearm in an area where there shouldn't
be designed for security and
surveillance these robots autonomously
monitor indoor and outdoor areas for
potential threats this is the k1 it's a
stationary robot that has weapons
detection it uses the same millimeter
wave technology that's used at airports
through TSA security so it can tell the
size and shape of weapons the 150 pound
k1 can also be configured to detect
radiation it's expected to be used at
airports including luggage collection
areas and healthcare facilities for more
rugged terrain like gravel at locations
such as oil rigs and wind farms there's
the seven hundred and seventy pound k7
the machine has holonomic steering so a
very simple way to explain that is it
the machine can move like a crab so I
can turn on its own axis and also go
sideways all the robots collect and
process data from a range of sensors
including sonar lidar thermal imaging
and traditional cameras companies
monitor the activity then implement
security measures if needed in 2018
night scope will add a feature called
audio event detection it says will help
security guards more accurately locate
the scene of a crime the opposite of
voice recognition can you tell me all
the little intricacies of the
environment and not focus on just the
voice of what's happening so if you
heard footsteps can you learn what a
footstep sounds like
previous spots have suffered some
crossed wires with the k5 driving itself
into a fountain and in 2016
running into a child at a mall tonight
scopes hoping these new real-life
Robocop's will be the ideal partners to
fight crime in Mountain View California
