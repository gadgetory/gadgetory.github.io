today we're gonna take a look at the
Logitech Harmony smart control this is a
universal remote system that also lets
you use your smart phone to control all
your devices and it's currently selling
for a hundred and thirty dollars so this
is the remote but the smart control is
really centered around this the Harmony
hub this little device sits in your TV
cabinet and it distributes all your
remote signals to your home theater gear
even better the hub can directly control
Sony's ps3 which typically can't be
controlled by a universal remote without
a separate adapter so that's a big plus
for PlayStation 3 owners what's also
neat is not only can you control the hub
with the included remote you can also
control it with your smartphone using
the Harmony app for iOS and Android load
it up and you get the same harmony
activities like watch TV that allow you
to hit one button and the system does
everything you need including turning on
the TV and your AV receiver and
switching to the right inputs
however in everyday use I found I ended
up almost never using the smart phone to
control my TV as it ends up taking more
time than you think to wake up your
phone unlock it finally app load it up
and all that just to change your channel
it turns out what you really want is a
remote that works as soon as you pick it
up and that's why harmony includes the
basic remote now this is significantly
thinner and lighter than any other
Harmony remote and it communicates with
the hub using RF signals which means you
don't need to point the remote at the TV
for it to work it's actually a pretty
great remote with one big exception
which is that it only includes three
activity buttons at the top that's just
not quite enough and although you can
technically access three more activities
by pressing and holding those buttons
it's not a great solution overall
considering the remote itself can
control eight separate devices one or
two more activity buttons would have
been nice
the other major drawback to the smart
control system is that it can be a
little bit of a pain to set up Logitech
has tried to simplify the process by
allowing you to do it with a smartphone
app
but I still ran into several issues and
the bottom line is it took me a while to
get everything running smoothly the good
news is that after the initial
investment of time it worked perfectly
but you definitely need some patience to
get over that initial setup hassle and
that's the main takeaway with the
harmony smart control it offers
convenient RF based universal remote
control from a nice compact clicker at a
very reasonable price but you have to be
willing to invest some time in the setup
to get it running smoothly I'm Matthew
Muscovy ak and this is the Logitech
Harmony smart control</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
