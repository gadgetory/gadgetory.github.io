leaving welcome to rumor has it the show
where we round up the week's hottest
tech rumors and then we vote on which
one sound legit and what seems like
total bunk but the best part is that you
guys get to vote too so don't go
anywhere our first rumor is from
Bloomberg citing nameless sources who
say that Amazon is working with Foxconn
to create a smartphone that will
challenge android based phones and the
iphone but duh who else are they going
to challenge the blackberry amazon has
desktop shopping in the bag but the
whole world is moving mobile and they
want to capitalize on that so I think
that this makes sense but for it to work
for them the phone's going to need a
huge one button shopping and a big
screen so that people can see what
they're buying and Amazon would probably
sell the phone directly which they've
already proven they could do with the
Kindles yeah i mean this didn't work
that well for google with the droid but
for amazon people feel comfortable
buying stuff from amazon and then
returning it so that's actually why i
say yay to this i think that the person
who has enough hubris to think that
amazon can sell high-end fashion
alongside its penny books and cheese
gift baskets has a lot of nerve and
that's Jeff Bezos so I'll say he'll make
a smartphone here's why I say nay amazon
is smart and getting into the cell phone
business this late in the game doesn't
seem like a very smart idea it's a
brutal landscape out there with so much
competition how would an Amazon phone be
any different than any other phone it
wouldn't so stick with what you know
Amazon Kindles and cheese gift baskets
if you're watching on cnet cast your
votes now using the thumbs up thumbs
down right over there next to emily's
head and the sina interactive player you
have 30 seconds to vote using our player
in the meantime we're gonna go out into
the streets and see what people of San
Francisco think about an Amazon
smartphone
do you think that the website amazon is
going to release a smartphone of its own
yeah actually I just think they are i
don't know i don't believe that he's
sure possibly yes i think that might be
true I think it'll happen and it will be
an exciting new development same here
too yes actually I actually believe that
they're gonna do that because it's
obvious and it's logical I think album
amazon is capable of anything would you
buy one if they came out with one know
how come i'm very happy with the apple
iphone would you made me buy it um
probably not i love my iphone would you
buy it i would look at it and then we'd
survive phones won't seem like the
people on the street we're pretty evenly
net although it did here a few more
yeses i think let's go back to the
studio and here somewhere rumors our
second rumor is just ridiculous the
phablet known as the samsung galaxy note
is being redone according to MK business
news whose sites obviously anonymous
sources the next-gen note would get
android 4.1 jelly bean which makes sense
right but here's the part that kills me
it is rumored to be getting a bigger
screen it's gonna be up from 5.3 in just
a 5.5 inches that is crazy that doesn't
sound like a lot but the phone is
already like the size of a large man's
baseball club sure but we're people
asking for it to be bigger no I don't
think I'm for asking for it to be bigger
I couldn't imagine that they want to
carry a phone around like this like I
want to put it in a wheelbarrow okay our
third and final rumor is my favorite and
it's that the next PlayStation 3 will be
super duper duper slim plans for this
device showed up on the FCC's website
and uk-based gaming site Eurogamer
thinks that it's the new ps3 based on
the model number given which was cec H
dash four Thousand and One X the current
ps3's model number is c ec h three
thousand which means that Eurogamer is
an awesome detective so since it's a
four thousand maybe it will be the ps4
and since it's the 4001 maybe it'll be
ps4 plus something special nope Green
doesn't I don't think so I don't really
care that much of
ps3 getting slimmer but if this means
that this will potentially be the
lower-cost ps3 because there's a ps4 on
the horizon then I'm so bleeping excited
that I wish I could swear on seen it
Sony already released a ps3 slim in 2009
so now this could be an even slimmer
slim a cheaper slimmer slim maybe it'll
fit in your pocket slimmer slim slim
slim maybe I'll buy one some some some
okay let's get back to our first rumour
the cnet Council is composed of five
Cena experts who cast their votes
anonymously opinions org estimates
expressed by the cnet Council are not an
endorsement by cnet or CBS interactive
obviously because these are rumors folks
so we asked them does amazon have a
smartphone in the works and the cnet
verdict is nay oh my gosh there were
four to one against my prediction
finally how did you guys do better than
me our comment of the week this week
goes out to hey it's tony who wrote
apple doesn't have any lawsuits in the
7-inch tablet department so yeah I think
they'll launch their 7-inch tablet after
they do they can sue the hell out of
everyone because they invented it Tony's
from New York all right that's our show
everyone share your rumors that rumor
has it at cnet com or call us at 1 800
750 cnet tune in next week for more tech
