CNET and that was a look at the Smart
interaction power on capability built
into Samsung's
high-end TVs this year these sets have
voice control and gesture control says a
little built-in camera and microphone
along the top of this TV I'm going to be
taking an in-depth look at those
features today this is a Samsung pn6 de
8000 this features available in a bunch
of different LCD and Plasma TVs this
year at the high end of the line in
addition to the camera and microphone
the TVs also include a special touch
remote control with its own built-in
microphone so you speak right into this
like you do in voice dictation and it
actually allows the TV to pick up the
voice commands a little bit better we'll
start out with voice commands the way
this thing works is you basically have
to say hi TV every time you want it to
do something now of course it might
misinterpret what I'm doing because I'm
talking now
but you see along the bottom there's AB
set of commands down there and I can say
more commands that brings up another
menu your video now this is probably the
most useful feature for voice command
because searching on a remote control
takes a long time by voice it should be
faster hi TV search Parks and Recreation
so that was a failure although you know
what there's the search result right
there at this point you can't actually
say down or enter or watch or anything
like that you have to grab your remote
control drive down and select it let's
try another search 2 broke girls another
failure it's not quite as accurate as it
could be let's try the remote control 2
broke girls
a little bit better but again no results
now let's try another show American Idol
that's success
pretty good The Bachelor not bad again
another success rate looking for the TV
show you can also command your cable box
via voice because the TV includes a
built-in IR blaster that I've already
synced to work with my DirecTV system
let's see how it works
channel number two zero zero let's try
again
channel number this one took me to
channel 9 you can also use voice to
launch apps from within samsung's Smart
TV system so let's try that hi TV more
commands Smart Hub so the second major
component after voice to Samsung Smart
interaction is gesture control and
that's literally waving at the TV screen
I'll show you how it works start off by
just sticking your hand up and it picked
up my hand here
let's change channels you kind of grab
it like that go up
you can also use the gesture control to
change your volume and if you click on
the middle of the screen takes you to a
couple of other areas for example the
Smart Hub now this is where in theory
it's a little bit nicer than using the
remote control because again you can
drive around over here let's check out
the web browser that was a little coarse
trying to bring it up here a little bit
more difficult than it could be
to navigate this webpage so as you can
see navigating on the web does work with
gesture control it's just a little bit
awkward and Wow my arms are tired so
after playing a little bit with the
Smart interaction feature voice and
gesture control I can say that it feels
pretty bethe gesture works as well as it
needs to but really it's not going to be
the main way to control the TV
same thing with voice control which
often has a lot of mistakes and can be a
little bit more frustrating to use than
actually just picking up your remote
control and most people actually have
the remote control in hand another big
issue is that when you're watching on
DVR for example there aren't any
commands built into the IR blaster to
say fast forward or skip ahead 30
seconds so again you're going to need to
remote anyway
and once you have that remote you're
going to do 99% of the actions
associated with your TV a lot easier
than you will via voice or gesture
that's a quick look at samsung's Smart
interaction on its high-end TVs both
plasma and LCD for 2012
