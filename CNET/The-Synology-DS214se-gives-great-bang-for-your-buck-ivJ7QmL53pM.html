this station ds2 14 a seafoam Synology
now let me parse that name for you
this station because this one here is a
network attached storage device one that
provides storage to the entire network
to because it's a dual base server and
14 because it's made this year 2014 how
about se that's interesting part it's
not for second admission or special
edition instead is for a single role and
that means two things number one this
one here is a cheap server also I say
affordable it's not made in China not
mainland China at least now this server
here costs $150 for no storage or $340
with 4 terabyte included and for what it
can do that's not much at all now second
any desire to be very good at doing one
task at a time and not for heavy
multitasking it can multi-tassel right
but it's not very good at that and
that's because on the inside is powered
by a 800 megahertz processor and only
256 megabytes of system memory that's it
you cannot upgrade or change that
another thing you can not share with the
server is this table grab a design here
there is no dry baby instead you have to
open the chasis to which the internal
drives on the inside it's quite easy let
me show you you just undo this to screw
on the back right here slice it and now
is open but that though means you cannot
chain the hard drive when the server is
still running so hard right hard
swapping is the very cool feature that
this server doesn't have now to make up
for that it has many other things mostly
thanks to the fact that it runs the
latest this station manager 5.0 that is
by far the best the most robust offering
system for Nash server on the market now
first of all that OS is controlled by a
web interface meaning everything
happened
a web page but on this web page
everything works just like a native
operating system there is a desktop here
for you to put quick shortcut on a
taskbar here for you to see all the
lubrication and quickly switch user and
of course there is a control panel for
you to change everything else as you can
see the server has support all common
setting pal in any server you can create
share folder create new user managed
user by group and so on and all other
things it can also support time machine
natively and there's a Quick Connect
feature right here that allows you to
quickly make the server work over the
Internet
very easily however the best thing about
this server here is the package center
here you can install new packages on
this server X package actually is a
program or an app that adds a new
function or feature to the server so the
packets enter to this server is somewhat
like the App Store to the iPhone the
download center for example is the best
way to Phi and guests up from the
internet so type in what you want shoot
for it and then click on the result
that's it you can actually download
multiple things at the same time the
cloud station is also great it basically
allowed the server here to work like a
Dropbox server except there is no store
limit and no monthly fee either so you
know the ds2 14 se right here offered
tremendous value for Hamas it cost and
my testing the survey also offered great
performance with the sustained write
speed of more than 50 megabyte per
second and the sustained reach speed of
more than 100 megabyte per second those
not the best machine but indeed very
fast now the server did get
significantly slower when I made it the
run multiple habit HUS at the same time
but for a home with casual need of data
sharing media streaming backup it is
still a pretty good storage system from
on this NASA over here check out my full
review at comm one thing though don't go
looking
for me using the download station I'm
not gonna be responsible for what you're
fine you should know how to which me
already
that's because I'm dumb law and by the
way don't go parsing that name it's a
mystery
and this has been the first look at the
distension Diaz 214 se2 from technology</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
