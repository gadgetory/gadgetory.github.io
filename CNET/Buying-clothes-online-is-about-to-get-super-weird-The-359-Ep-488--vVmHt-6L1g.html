Joni salzman something called the Zozo
suit may assure in the future of online
apparel shopping it's a polka-dotted
spandex suit that allows folks to create
3d images of themselves in their homes
then use that data to order Custom Fit
clothing through the Zozo website the
suit is just one of several new efforts
to develop 3d scanning tech to get
better measurements of you for instance
Amazon last year bought the 3d scanning
start up body labs there's also this
company called naked labs that will sell
you a $1,400 3d body scanner to like for
weight measurements but what do you
think of this stuff would you use any of
this well it depends I mean there's a
lot of variation while we're talking
about but the Zozo suit kind of sounds
like an interesting proposition it it's
kind of low low commitment you get this
suit as long as you can commit to
putting this really weird body suit on
by taking some measurements then the
idea is that you can buy a t-shirt
that's perfect for you jeans that are
perfectly fitted for you for like the
price that jeans normally cost right
like something like $58 for jeans the
t-shirt was a little more expensive it
was like 22 dollars but the idea is to
do custom fitted clothing and do it
through online which like apparel is
growing very quickly online anyway but a
lot of retailers obviously understand
that if they can get better measurements
of you they'll be able to sell you more
stuff one of the concerns that I think
people may have about all this is like
what about your data like do you think
people will be pretty concerned about
having their body measurements being you
know controlled by somebody like Amazon
or Google I think the bigger hindrance
will be people just not liking having to
look at him picture of like their body
disengaged from it like when you can't
suck it like the idea is you can't like
you can't suck it right you can't like
angle yourselves because it doesn't
matter I think that's gonna be something
that just settles people that's
unsettles people more than like a
company knowing it but it's true like
you could probably be worried about a
company knowing such intimate details
about you you you were telling me before
the show also about this thing called
volumetric what is it
you metric scanning specifically for
like entertainment as well right yeah
well you metric capture so it's like
imagine in the matrix where you know
they jump in the air and the camera
moves around while their paws in the air
it's basically like that idea except
it's become more accessible and as it
becomes more accessible still you could
take a volumetric video of yourself
walking up and down a straight line and
you could superimpose clothing from a
runway onto you so you can see what
clothing looks like on you before you
even have to have it made and shipped to
you mmm some of that sounds pretty
interesting but yeah I'm still a little
unsure about the data stuff
next up Amazon said it'll soon start
selling more Apple products directly and
have access to Apple's latest devices
which include the iPad pro and the
iPhone 10 are I actually pronounce that
right this time do you think that this
could be worrisome for other retailers
especially going into the holiday season
and was once worrying to all retailers
isn't it I mean that's the absolute
euler plane answer yes yeah and the
other thing that I thought was
interesting about this announcement was
how lousy Amazon's selection of Apple
products was already like if you go and
you try to find some of the newest Apple
products on Amazon you basically you're
stuck trying to get it through the 30
programs as these two come together do
you think that kept them before before
before apart before was on the Amazon
slider on the Apple side like which one
is really hard to say I mean like a lot
of people have raised the issue of like
why now why did this happen now and like
it's it's really hard to say but
obviously it seems like both of them
should benefit the third-party retailers
that have been selling these products
will probably not benefit you bad for
that big caveat so the inventory the
Apple inventory that'll be on there that
is absolutely right the home pod will
not be included thank you very much for
reminding me of that last alibaba's
singles day took place over the weekend
and set a new online sales record big
surprise there
hitting 31 billion dollars in sales in
24 hours just as comparison amazon's
prime day raked in an estimated two
billion dollars in last year's black
friday
Lester's Black Friday brought in I think
this is us only but five billion dollars
yes that's that's all the money if you
read more about these stories check them
out on CNN I'm Ben Fox Ruben johnny
salzman thanks for listening
and thus concludes another broadcast
today no just kidding we're just done
with the audio recording so you can
subscribe to that and listen on any your
favorite potting platforms until then go
ahead and send in questions and comments
for me I'm gonna go ahead and kick this
off the hell's Alibaba Oh
oh yeah it's the biggest entire planet
right yeah it's the biggest online
retailer in China and probably Asia but
not no okay no they're not they're
probably more profitable than Amazon but
as far as like total revenue Amazon is
way bigger than Alibaba but yeah Alibaba
is based in China created by a guy named
Jack Ma who obviously is now a super
duper billionaire and yeah they
popularized this thing called singles
day which is on 11:11 you know because
it's like I don't know those are several
singles lots of ones together and it's
it's similar to prime day and that it
was just an invented holiday by
retailers to get you to buy stuff and
it's very very successful apparently are
there any holidays left that aren't
designed to get you to buy stuff no
actually one of the last ones was
Thanksgiving and now they've totally
taken that over so retailers now like
Thanksgiving is very quickly becoming
one of the biggest sales days of the
year and that used to not be as much of
the case especially with like mobile
phones people do a lot of their shopping
when they're supposed to be talking to
their in-laws which is which is
understandable not for me of course I'm
pretty sure Black Friday started like
three weeks ago so it actually yes this
is true Black Friday starts before
Halloween now so and we're only gonna be
hearing more about this stuff I mean
like the competition is just gonna keep
getting fiercer but Ali Baba manages to
sneak in singles day and snag a lot of
attention for itself with that 1 billion
dollars oh yeah all the holidays and
romanticism of the world boiled down in
this show all right so we're gonna shout
out to our fans in India California be
safe out there guys
lots of a
guess Paraguay and once again thanks
everybody for acknowledging yes happy
Veterans Day and then let's go and take
some questions from the chat kicking
things off right here's sir enjoy did
you notice that the 3d body measurement
suits are advertised by the ideal body
shapes yeah like that's new I mean I
think they so the guy that created this
said that he was having a hard time
finding stuff that actually fit him
properly apparently he was a little
shorter than normal so his idea was why
don't why don't I make it easier for
people to do these 3d scans in their
home and then just get custom fitted
clothing and just do it really simply
online one of the interesting aspects of
this is that apparently at least in
Japan where the started they're going to
be phasing out the suit entirely and
that's because they already have so much
data from so many like hundreds of
thousands of customers if not millions
that they don't they don't need it
anymore you just basically punch in your
height your weight and a couple other
basic details and they'll be able to
suggest specific clothing that's pretty
close to custom fit for you
yeah yeah and it'll be a little less
kind of weird right to tell people to
put on this like polka-dotted cat suit
right take like a bunch of like images
of yourself like all around so yeah as
far as like the feeling of like having
it be a little weird I could solve some
of that yeah because right now they're
sticking with things that are you don't
need detailed measurement information
for t-shirts button-ups
jeans like you don't need like it's not
like having a custom-made suit so I
wondered if like if they would want to
continue to keep the body suits so they
could go in that high-end direction so
right now they're shooting for just like
basic staples yeah which is interesting
you would think that you would want to
do suits suit yeah hey guys you're
watching
Zozo suits please and send me a polka
dotted suit no please don't I'm not
gonna wear it so on that note
Marvin's asking
who would actually want this like who is
a targeted user that would actually
embrace the voluntary bodysuit
measurement thing rather than just go to
a tailor or just figure it out yourself
why is this a market now I think like
Ben mentioned the guy that created it
had trouble finding clothes that fit him
because he's so short
not even so short he just was shorter
than clothes are designed generally for
and so that's one use if you have a body
type that's unusual and you feel like
the fashion industry doesn't really take
into consideration your particular needs
and that's one reason also there are
people that just hate going shopping my
husband's one of them I like shopping he
hates it and so I have to buy all his
clothes for him because he will refuse
to just do it himself
that's another thing if you don't like
going shopping you don't like being
bothered by sales associates if you
don't like going in changing rooms or
having to deal with malls or whatever
then you can just do it at home and I
already know and already know what the
measurements are like if you're looking
for jeans at a new store you've never
been to before you don't have to try on
this pair and then another pair that's
slightly bigger and there are a lot of
people that like shopping online that's
that's a big reason why a lot of
traditional retailers have been dying
off or shrinking people just find it a
lot more convenient but is this the
solution is the other question is like
is the spandex suit I don't know I I
would think that would be very like it's
yeah it's inexpensive and it's like
party right it's it's very durable you
don't have to worry about all these
different connect like bluetooth
connections or whatever like you can
machine you go to you go on the website
and they're like very like specifically
like this is part of their branding is
that they show a bunch of people in
these polka-dotted suits so I almost
thought it was kind of weird that they
would get rid of the suits even like
their primary market because it's it's
part of their branding like this kind of
like goofy funny idea to try to convince
people like hey we're different or we're
interesting and yeah I would definitely
be interested in seeing them do other
types of stuff like suits because that
would make a lot of sense to me yeah it
would be nice if you could for some
things that like it's hard for you to
find the clothing that does I'm not
talking about staples like bathing suits
I always find it's difficult for me to
in a bathing suit that like actually cuz
that's not that's an it's at least for
women that's an instance where it's
something that really does need to fit
your body well and you hate it's just
not fun to have to go and try on tons of
different bathing suits go to tons of
different stores to find one that's
actually flattering for you so like
that's an instance where I think that it
could be really helpful for the whole
female market yeah yeah and this proves
the point that like this is still a very
nascent market because they also don't
provide bathing suits so that's another
area that they could potentially build
out onto sometime later
this is sparking a lot of really great
conversation in the chat people pointing
out like is this helpful to people who
happen to maybe fluctuate in their
weight a lot Mary Ann says I would
totally get this I live in northern
Minnesota the closest mall is like three
hours away and I do most of my shopping
online and it can be frustrating so yeah
this is proving proving the point this
this could be very helpful I forget not
everyone's like me finds the one black
shirt that fits the one pair of black
jeans that fit and then the one pair of
black slip-on shoes that fit and then
bookmark them and reorder them every
eight to ten months yes your Batman
stuff in between that eight to ten
months you just like get to the point
where smell so bad that people like
that's not in the opposite direction
that's not sure I smell great
okay so tech slackers asking did
Americans buy something during singles
day from China I'm assuming the do do
Americans participate in Alibaba
purchasing as well I guess so yeah I
guess so they do
Alibaba does not have a very strong
presence in the US as shown by BVG not
actually knowing who Alibaba is which
like I wouldn't knock you for that
because Alibaba has not made a huge
effort to get its name known in the
United States outside of like the
business industry because there they are
listed in the United States as a
publicly traded company
yeah the IPO is probably the last time
you heard about Alibaba because it was
like the biggest for an IPO ever if I
remember right
correct for it it was at the time yeah
it might still be I'm not sure yeah so
they do not Chinese company coming up
there might beat it but which ones that
one that's we WeChat music we sent music
I can't remember it's it's like the
Chinese Spotify basically they're gonna
be listing yeah Alibaba you could order
from Alibaba I think internationally
using Aliexpress which I know a lot of
people do so that is one area to go but
alibaba's market is so huge in China
that they don't really need to focus
very much on the US and if anything
they're expanding more into India
because India is also a massive market
and a lot closer yeah yeah there's
another really good consideration to be
made as brought up by Marvin when you're
buying things online you can't always
tell if it's good quality material
sometimes the sizes aren't completely
accurate that's a really good point
so can the zou zou zou zou soo is a ho
zou zou I'm pretty it's zero zero so I'm
pretty sure it's not Zhu Zhu unless
there's like an umlaut there that I'm
not reading
there's no Japanese whatever reason I
want to pronounce it so so suit I don't
that's neither here nor there but yeah
it could could this actually are there
better ways to interact with these
online retailers like who who uses Zozo
suit what brands are on board with this
project
nobody's no brain they make the
merchandise themselves well actually
they make it a but they make it in China
so as a Japanese company the merchandise
is made in China and so yeah it takes
three to four weeks for you to get your
stuff so you are getting it is you you
are it's quite a commitment I would say
yeah you're getting this thing sent to
you you have to put on this weird cat
suit you take like 12 pictures of
yourself at every angle and then you
have to wait like a month to get your
clothing so you have to be pretty
committed to this idea of well-fitted or
better fitting clothing online to
actually go along with something like
this yeah do we
we'll see other brands and manufacturers
kind of hopping on board with this
method I and and guarantee maybe this is
quality or do you think this might
actually motivate some kind of shift and
clothing making an industry with people
showing off like we're not all you know
perfectly tall and ten percent body fat
you know well I am good night everybody
statement I've ever made um not
specifically this method I think the
dotted spandex concept is very like Zozo
like they've kind of like but I think
with body labs which Amazon purchased I
would say expect something to come from
Amazon if not next year the year
afterward they're becoming a much bigger
apparel retailer and if they could just
get a little bit more of your data if
they could just convince you to like
hand over more of this info and do a 3d
scan I mean the smartest way to do it I
would think is with your phone because
your phone has a camera and your phone
is pretty smart but I'm sure there are a
lot of complications there so yeah we'll
see how long it actually takes for them
to do it but Amazon I would definitely
expect they would probably come up with
it when they purchase body labs it
probably signal to a lot of other
retailers we have to start paying
attention to the space because Amazon's
gonna be moving into it yeah yeah and I
think also the the fashion industry
merchandising clothes much and I think
industry has generally been moving to be
more body inclusive over the last decade
or so and so I think that one one kind
of implication if personalized fitting
clothing become sort of a thing is that
that could send actual direct signals to
merchandisers that you can't just close
people that look the way you think they
should look that you have to have a more
diverse and broader idea of what
clothing should fit like yeah we just
keep amaz giving Amazon a little bit
more information and a little bit more
information and a little bit more and
then suddenly hello this is your prime
replacement clone oh I was gonna go with
putting a amazon chip in your brain yeah
primer placement clone that's even
now they're far more interested in
replacing you entirely with a perfect
consumer replicant that only buys
everything on Amazon of course oh my god
okay so before we wrap it up well I want
to ask real quick does anybody actually
own an Amazon echo look is that like
still a thing are they it is they're
still selling it was like five people
get those do you know they haven't given
any sales figures right have it it's not
a big seller it's not a big seller I
think Strategy Analytics has I'll try to
pick pull up a study that I think
Strategy Analytics has like the actual
breakdown I don't think the echo look is
a big seller it most certainly is not
but yeah that one is is one where it's a
echo with a camera attached to it and
it's supposed to use like some sort of
AI engine in the background to suggests
like to give you clothing tips so you
try on one outfit and then you try on
another in front of the echo look and it
tells you which one looks better and
yeah a lot of people were already saying
like oh you could just do body
measurements through this and that's
entirely possible yeah but it's not it's
not what they're doing right now but
maybe they will do it sometime in the
future I think it's just kind of a
fascinatingly niche area for them to get
into a lot of people are just kind of
sensitive about their shopping
experience I expect some people to break
embrace this as a way to kind of warm up
to the idea and maintain a privacy to
ironic extent but I feel like there's a
lot of people that are just going to
like no no way too touchy I hate getting
scammed the airport not about to bring
it into my bedroom yeah I I would
completely agree with you there are
probably gonna be concerns about that
and that's why it's important to like
talk about it now because it seems
pretty clear that a lot of tech
companies are already positioning
themselves to do something like this in
the near future so when it comes to the
Zozo manufacturing are they is it
literally custom or they going to a
premade inventory and finding the
closest variant with in as close as
humanly possible
from what I understand from the story
from our very own Jackson Ryan these are
custom fitted clothing not something
where it's the closest approximation
because if you're between small and a
medium or a medium and a large
and you're going through all this effort
to put on the suit and take the photos
you don't want them to just approximate
you'd be like yeah you're close enough
to a small we're gonna send you a small
so maybe but he told me you can either
you can even tweak the measurements
after you've taken the photos to like
add add in a little bit of extra space
like in the hem or the seam or whatever
so that if you want the jeans to fit
slightly differently you can so to me
that sounds very much like a custom fit
as opposed to just kind of closest
approximation I would just wonder if
they had more intermediate sizes so
there's like small a small B small plus
boot stuff like that it might be as
they're going towards this not doing the
suit model anymore they might have
enough they might have the data that
says we have enough templates for enough
sizes and the outliers are so minor
they're so small that they can kind of
you know only custom say certain types
right and they'll have everything else
on hand yeah that does make sense it's
also it conveys the point that like
there is a reason why retail was drawn
to this concept of small medium large XL
you know because most people in general
fit into those sizes whether you know it
didn't fit perfectly or not you still
basically fit into those sizes yeah so
we're almost out of time but Mary Ann is
on fire today this this question kind of
just blew my mind can insurance
companies gain access and raise your
rates if you're overweight I'm assuming
Zozo does not have to comply with HIPAA
and furthermore can employers target
more attractive employees who may be at
lower risk to their insurance pools
holy cow what a great question I mean
that's a dystopia that I don't think
Zozo really wants to enter into they say
so they say that they won't ever sell
your individually identifiable data to
anybody but they might anonymize data
and sell that to a third party so that
means the answer to your question is
unless they're lying and they chain
or there's some sort of dystopian tech
dictatorship that ever takes the entire
world
his name's Yvonne then this data that
you're giving them it's not like your
employer's gonna know what it's not like
your insurer is gonna know it that it's
you that has these measurements or it's
you that has had these memberships and
now it's getting a little bit bigger or
whatever that's a really fantastic
question though my mind did not even go
anywhere near that path when when this
topic came up so props Marianne very
very good question but on that note we
are out of time so thanks everybody for
joining us I hope you all enjoy your new
spandex life-affirming body suits
