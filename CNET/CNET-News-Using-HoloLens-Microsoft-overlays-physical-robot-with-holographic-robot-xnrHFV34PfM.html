of experiences enabled by Windows 10 can
change the way makers like you interact
with the physical things that you build
and to show us mixing holograms with IOT
please help me welcome on stage my very
good friend Miko Miko I'd like you to
meet b15
this year millions of people we use
maker kits like this one to enter robot
competitions and learn about electronics
many of them will use Raspberry Pi 2
which now supports Windows 10 IOT core
we were inspired to see what we could do
with the same hardware and hololens so
let me show you
b15 wake up up say hello to the real b15
because every Windows 10 device has
api's for human and environment
understanding we were able to overlay a
holographic robot on top of a physical
one and one thing we noticed while
working is you need your data to be
easily accessible but adding this place
of this frame increases your cost and
there's no way to see all that
information at once so let me show you
how we check on our data
b15 control panel this facial UI system
is a universal Windows app I'm pulling
the data from b15 making it as big as I
need it to be and placing it where it's
relevant in my world and I love it that
miko didn't have to actually go back to
her desk
to do it this is a great example of how
Windows 10 makes your digital life more
powerful by connecting it with your real
life that's right you can waste a lot of
time tweaking variables on another
device before you test but if all I need
to do is something simple like change
LED color I can use a control scheme
like this so that's how we envision
controls and displays evolving with
Holograms
now so we need us your robots need to
find paths safely through their
workspaces let's take a look at how Miko
can help be 15 and navigate and how
Holograms can help so be 15 sensors
aren't great at detecting obstacles but
the cool thing is they don't have to be
my hololens can communicate that
information b15 pathfinding mode now
with Windows holographic we can scan an
environment we can cue up movement tasks
and visualize the robots path so all I
have to do is err tap the ground my
hololens interprets the 3d points and
tells b15 when to turn and when to move
forward now this is a great example of
how portable our Windows experiences can
be if it didn't have to know its
environment the room understanding comes
from Windows holographic but what
happens when the environment actually
changes that's no problem
because I'm wearing Holland I'm always
aware of b15 I can see it updated its
route to go around you and this is
critical if you're working with bigger
robots like those in automotive
manufacturing you need to always be
aware of a robot's intentions hololens
helps developers understand robots
better at any scale or in any scenario
this is just amazing thank you so much
miko and nice to meet you be 15 be 15
say goodbye
see you later Alex later guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
