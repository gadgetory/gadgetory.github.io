dashboard is packing GPS but it's not a
new V and it's no Navigator I mean it's
one good one let's take a look at the
Garmin dash cam 20 now the dash cam 20
is a dashboard camera or dashboard DVR
it's basically a little black box that
suction cups to your windshield on the
front of it there's a small HD camera
that can record at 1080p 720p or as low
down as VGA on the back we've got an LCD
screen that you can use for framing your
shots and for looking at the video that
the dash cam records after-the-fact on
the side we've got a small port for the
included USB to 12-volt power cable that
you use to power this thing while you're
driving there is a battery pack in here
so you can use it without it being
plugged up if you don't want to drape
cables over your dashboard and on the
other side we've got our power button
and the slot for the included four
gigabyte micro sd card now this thing
can actually accept up to a 32 gigabyte
micro SD card if you want more space for
recordings what are you recording well
basically what this thing does is it
sticks on the front of your windshield
and it records a video of what's
happening out in front of your car it's
also recording audio of what's happening
in your car but you can turn that off if
you don't want it capturing all of your
singing and stuff when you're driving
along what it's doing is it's taking a
continuous loop of as much video as it
can save on its SD card and a G sensor
in this thing is actually looking out
for any sort of strong shocks or
vibrations if you hit something like a
pothole or another car the G sensor
detects that accident and it captures a
couple of seconds leading up to the
shock and a couple of seconds following
hopefully capturing the accident within
that footage the dash cam 20 also has a
built-in GPS receiver so it knows your
latitude and longitude and it can store
your speed the direction that you're
traveling and the date and time it
encodes that at the bottom of the video
now that video stored on the card and
the dot avi format that you can retrieve
either by removing the SD card later or
just plugging it into your computer if
you've actually been in an accident you
can remove the dash cam 20 from your
windshield and use it to snap
still photos of them any damage or the
scene that you can use to recall later
now the dash cam 20 is going to retail
for $249 there's also a dash cam tin
that slots in below it that loses the
GPS sensor and the ability to track your
speed direction latitude and longitude
that's going to be 2:19 this is probably
the one you're going to want to get it's
only thirty bucks more I'm Antoine
Goodwin and this has been a scene at
first look at the Garmin dash cam 20
