while camera makers for the most part
are concentrating on working with
smartphones and not against them Samsung
has joined the mobile lovefest more than
others by putting Android in what would
be an otherwise good but fairly ordinary
point-and-shoot camera with the Galaxy
camera and now it's follow-up the
cleverly named Galaxy camera - it really
isn't too different from the original
with a 21 X zoom lens 16 megapixel BSI
CMOS sensor and giant 4.8 inch HD
touchscreen there are a couple of design
changes for the better including a
larger battery pack and a pop-up flash
that can be tilted back for bouncing the
cameras photo and video quality and
shooting performance are very good for
what you're getting but if those are
your main concerns there are a lot of
options at and around its $450 price
this camera is really about Android 4.3
and the flexibility it brings to the
shooting and sharing experience don't
want to use the modes or filters and
effects Samsung includes no problem
you've got a whole world of Android apps
to tap into want to edit before sharing
on your choice of sights the big screen
and smooth performance make it easy with
its built-in Wi-Fi you could tether to
your smartphone to upload straight from
the camera or create a direct connection
between the two and send your photos
straight to your device the two also has
NFC so pairing with Android smartphones
is pretty painless and you can tap the
two together to quickly send a picture
to your phone you can check out the full
review on cnn.com but despite being a
modest update if having Android apps on
a camera is a no-brainer to you well
then this is for you
I'm Josh Goldman and that's a look at
the Samsung Galaxy camera 2</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
