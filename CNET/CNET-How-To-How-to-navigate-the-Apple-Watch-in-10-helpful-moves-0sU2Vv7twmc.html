you're considering getting one how do
you make it work there are a lot of
different buttons and features on this
may get a little confusing I'd be using
one for a while and here are my five
go-to gestures to survive on the Apple
watch with a few more at the end one
swipe down this brings you to
notifications just like on your phone
you can look at all the messages you
missed and click any one of them to find
out more to swipe up this brings you to
glances glances are little widgets that
operate like little mini apps on the
Apple watch you can use this like an app
dock click any one of them and you can
go to the full-sized app it's a great
shortcut you can set it up in settings
3.the click the digital crown which is
like that little scroll wheel on the
side also clicks and that's basically
your home button click on it to get out
of any app to go back to the grid of
apps or to go back to your watch face 4
click and hold for Siri the digital
crown if you click and hold it will
bring up Siri and will be ready to
listen for what you require you can use
all the Siri type of requests from your
phone and there are also the ability to
launch apps within the Apple watch which
can be a real time saver if you don't
know where that app is you can also just
raise your wrist and say hey Siri five
force touch this has a force sensitive
touch display this is on the new
MacBooks - on the trackpad if you press
and push in you can actually get to
submenus and customization features on
many apps it's not always consistent but
you can get to settings like shuffle on
the music app and more got those well
there are actually a few more that I
consider go twos too so I'll throw them
in one is clicking the bottom button yet
brings up your friend wheel so if you
want to call somebody send a message
it's essential for an easy way to reach
your friends take that same button and
double click it and you bring up Apple
pay that's how you pay for something in
a store just like your iPhone 6 or 6
plus if you take that same button and
click and hold it that's basically your
power button you're going to be able to
power off your watch or go into a power
reserve stay
which shuts down all functions except
for showing the watch face to get back
out of that you got to press and hold
that button again to reboot the digital
crown double-click if you double click
that digital crown it takes you back to
your last opened app just double click
and you can actually hop back and forth
between your watch face and the app and
finally you can always cover the watch
just put your palm over it if you're in
an app and you want to get back to the
watch face or if the phone's ringing
or if something's happening you want to
get out of put your palm over it hold
for a second or two you'll be able to
turn off all sound and get back to the
beginning when you tap follow a few of
those gestures and hopefully you'll
survive those are my go-to gesture tips
on the Apple watch for now I'm Scott
