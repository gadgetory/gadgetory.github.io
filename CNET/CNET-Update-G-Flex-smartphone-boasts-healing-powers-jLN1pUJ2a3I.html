superpowers I'm Bridget Carey and this
is your cnet update LG is sharing new
images and details of its curved
smartphone the g flex this 6 inch 720p
display has a slight bend in word from
top to bottom it also has high-end specs
with a two point 26 gigahertz quad-core
processor 2 gigs of ram and a battery
with extra juice to power at all and if
the curved screen wasn't enough LG's
press release said the G flex has quote
Wolverine Lake healing powers with a
back that can recover from daily wear
and tear scratches and nicks it sounds
like it has some sort of special coating
on the back but LG later removed the
x-men character reference from its press
release probably because it would get in
trouble with Marvel but I think if
Wolverine had a smartphone he'd go with
the Moto X because you know X man well
for those of you keeping score of the
curved phone market the arch on the G
flex is different from the bend in
samsung's galaxy round which has the
left and right sides curving inward but
the LG phone that's getting more buzz
this week is Google's latest pure
Android smartphone the Nexus 5 it may be
revealed in the next few days the
reliable gadget leaguer Twitter account
of efflux posted this photo of a white
model with the date November first which
could be a hint to the launch day this
model will likely be loaded with the new
version of android 4.4 nicknamed KitKat
people also get interested in the nexus
for its price last year's model was
three hundred and fifty dollars unlocked
samsung Smart Watch the Galaxy gear will
begin working with other Samsung phones
in the coming weeks the company
announced that the galaxy s4 s3 and the
note 2 can be paired with the gear
SmartWatch the gear costs three hundred
dollars and it only worked with the note
3 when it came out those with other
galaxy phones like the s4 active s4 mini
and the galaxy mega you'll need to wait
a few months for an update to be able to
use the gay
the portable game console called the
Nvidia shield can now play thousands of
android games the handheld system has a
downloadable update to support android
games that were designed for
