look at the Lenovo IdeaPad
y500 now this new version of the Y 500
is for Windows 8 it is also a little bit
of a gaming laptop it has in this
particular configuration not one but two
nvidia geforce 650m graphics cards which
means that they could pretty much play
any game out there and either the
highest resolution this is a 15 inch
1080p screen or the highest detail
settings some games both some years you
may have to dial either the resolution
or the detail settings down you've also
got a big 1 terabyte hard drive with
that 16 gigs solid-state cache and what
i think it's probably one of the coolest
things at least the first things you see
is this cool backlit keyboard it's sort
of black on black but with this really
rich red emanating from underneath the
keys you know it's different from every
other backlit keyboard at least it's a
little bit of a maybe a dorm-room chic
look but i liked it just because it
stands out from everybody else now with
all this good stuff going on there's
gotta be a downside and that is this is
one of the very few windows 8 laptops
that we've seen that does not have a
touchscreen see nothing's happening here
now I see a little bit of a trend here
pretty much any laptop that we have
reviewed since the Windows 8 came out it
has a discrete graphics card does not
have a touchscreen now there's no reason
why you can't put these two components
together but for some reason nobody has
yet the first guy to make a really great
gaming laptop for Windows 8 that also
has a touchscreen I'm gonna be right on
board with that not because you need the
touchscreen for gaming so much but the
rest of the time when you're just in
this Windows 8 UI it really pays to have
the touchscreen otherwise it's just
difficult to navigate especially with a
touchpad here that's just got a little
bit of a floaty feeling not quite as
tight as you'd want it to be one thing I
thought was very cool is that second
graphics card is in what Lenovo calls an
ultra Bay which means you can actually
pull it out and replace it with either a
second hard drive fan or a optical drive
like a DVD Drive or a blu-ray drive they
have to buy all these other things
separately and they're very proprietary
but the fact that you could swap stuff
in and out and maybe have an at home
version and just pull it out and put the
fan in for travel so it'll be lighter
and use less power and run cooler I
think it's kind of a cool option we used
to see it years ago not so much now my
final Kota about the y500 is this
configuration was originally pitched to
me as costing about $1,300
looking at lenovo's website as of today
they seem to have a lot of sales going
on tied into saint patrick's day even
though that already happened i saw a
very similar configuration to this for
869 dollars which is pretty amazing that
almost makes this a must consider laptop
even when you take out the touchscreen
if it had a touchscreen be hands down my
favorite laptop of 2013 so far as it is
it should definitely be in your strong
considered category if you're into a
mild to moderate to not quite super
heavy PC gaming I'm Dan Ackerman and
that is the Lenovo IdeaPad Y 500</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
