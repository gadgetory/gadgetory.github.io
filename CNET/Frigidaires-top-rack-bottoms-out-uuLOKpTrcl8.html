Frigidaire Gallery dishwasher is dumb
Frigidaire was definitely trying
something innovative with these tines
that fold out and remind me of spider
legs but for the life of me I can't
figure out what they were trying to do
we follow the recommended loading
pattern whenever we're testing a
dishwasher and doing that with these top
racks meant we had to scrape our glasses
past our bowls to make them fit the top
rack is really poorly arranged so this
dishwashers a unique one and then I
recommend you take that instruction
manual with that recommended loading
pattern and go ahead and just chuck it
out the window because if you can find a
good spot for your glasses and bowls
everything else about this dishwasher
it's pretty good especially for the
price so it's six hundred and fifty
dollars and for that price it has a lot
of cycles a lot of options though
there's some overkill here I don't need
to decide if I want my water to surge or
spray but that's fine
it's better to have too many features
than too little the stainless finish
looks good and resists smudge as well
and most importantly this Frigidaire
Gallery dishwasher cleans your dishes
well the only problem part surprised
surprised that top rack so if you want
to save some money on a dishwasher
I do recommend this six hundred and
fifty dollar Frigidaire Gallery it looks
good it has plenty of features and cycle
options and it cleans your dish as well
just make sure you scrape your dishes
before you toss them in there and space
them out a little bit on that top rack</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
