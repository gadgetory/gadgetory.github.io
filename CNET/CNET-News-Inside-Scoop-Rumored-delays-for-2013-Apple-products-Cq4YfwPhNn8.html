I've seen that scar tsuboi joined by
senior editor Josh Lowensohn and Josh
it's a new year so we know there's got
to be a new iPhone coming out the
question is when and a report just
surfaced today saying that might be a
little later in the year than expected
tell us why at least according to this
analyst sure so the big rumor is from
KGI securities it's from analysts it has
a pretty good track record of successful
rumors right so the big one today is
that there's been a delay possibly
putting this into the fall into the
summer and the reason is because Apple
is reportedly working in some sort of
fingerprint scanning technology that's
been kind of hard this would be
something that's in the home button and
maybe scans your finger and apparently
it's really hard to get it to work with
with the way they coat the paint sure
sure instead of typing into your your
code every time you want to get into
your phone sure I mean there's lots of
applications also Apple has something
called passbook which is kind of right
now it's used for like membership cards
but in theory it can be used for credit
cards or some other sort of payment
system so it makes sense why they would
need your fingerprint for it in the same
report the analysts also detailed a
couple of other apple products and why
they might be delayed talk to us about
the new cheaper version of the iphone
yeah this is a rumor that's been kind of
flowing around for a couple months now
even longer than that the idea is that
maybe they wouldn't use glass or metal
and wood instead use plastic which you
know these twos before but this would
theoretically sit behind their flagship
iPhone to be cheaper this is for places
like China or India where there's a lot
of potential buyers who want to pay less
for the phone interesting and then also
the report were details on an ipad mini
and the delays there yeah you know the
the iPad Mini is really missing a Retina
display this is something that you find
in all the rest of apple's portable
devices but it's really tough to get in
that small size we know panels have been
floating around since November but it's
kind of been delayed and that's what the
the new report said today is that it's
really hard to kind of get the
production level that they have with
these with the screen they're using now
for this next device and again all these
are just rumors just speculation
floating around out there yeah what are
some other products that are being
talked about as far as a release of 2013
sure the two big ones that were supposed
to come
was a television and they a radio
station the one that we know is very
close as a radio service this is a free
service that people are going to be able
to listen to it'll be ad supported
they'll have it on their devices we've
heard labels are on the the cusp of
making a deal with apple com possibly as
soon as next week so that announcement
might come in the coming months do you
think they'll wait till quarter three
quarter for I can see them waiting but
at the same time if they're getting this
already we can assume that they've had
the software ready they're just waiting
for the deals to get done before they
launch it and that's something that I
think they could do without like a new
ipod or new ipad but it certainly
wouldn't hurt as for the TV that was
supposed to come out in 2012 didn't
happen now it's 2013 i don't think
they're ready with that either there's
been a lot of rumors that they're still
kind of working with panel makers and
the panel makers have already kind of
got their order set aside for the rest
of the year yeah but there's just some
crazy stuff going on like reports of
using a ring to control it and it tablet
to its like none of that really jobs
well with what we know about how Apple
works they want simplicity and if it's
something that requires two different
devices that's just kind of crazy yeah
so take your time Apple figure it out
and come to us when you're ready totally
great thank you so much Josh Lowensohn
