pleasure can be frustrating but mobile
technology is easing one Travel whoa
instead of fumbling for a hotel keycard
you may soon just reach for your
smartphone this month 10 Starwood hotels
will allow guests to unlock their rooms
with a tap of their phone the keyless
feature should roll out at all W aloft
and Element hotels starting in 2015 to
use the feature guests need an iPhone or
Android device that's Bluetooth Low
Energy enabled that's how the phones
talk to the door locks and the free
Starwood Preferred Guest or s PG app SPG
members will start with a one-time
process though to register their device
with us from that point on when they
make a reservation at any W a loft or
element Hotel globally they'll receive
the option to use SPG keyless when they
check in a major convenience of this
technology is that you can bypass an
often time-consuming step checking in at
the front desk just open up the app and
head straight to your room you get push
notifications with your room number you
also get a notification saying what
preferences we were able to deliver so
you've been upgraded for example and
then you get a notification when you
check out as well to open the door guess
hold the phone up to the lock and wait
for the green light keyless entry could
eliminate the need for key cards
altogether yeah we really started by
looking at the entire guest experience
and how we can leverage SPG keyless to
enhance that so whether it is the
elevator locks in certain hotels the
locks on the gyms to ensure security
Starwood partnered with a smart lock
company the key is it will only work on
your phone not anybody else's phone so
it can't be taken and put on anything
else and if you lose your phone
the key is immediately rejected it's
taken away from the system so in terms
of security is that good ads if not
higher than the card they used to carry
around still if a phone is stolen and
not passcode enabled someone could learn
your room number but Starwood is
assuming guests will notice a missing
phone before a missing key
other hotels that have gone mobile
include San Francisco's personality
hotels group Hilton also plans to
introduce keyless entry and a mobile
feature that lets guests choose their
rooms now that's a travel perk in San
Francisco I'm Sumi das see Netcom for
