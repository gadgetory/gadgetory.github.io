brags about sales numbers are we in the
twilight zone I'm Bridget Carey and this
is your cnet update it's been a rough
few days for Apple bending iPhone drama
buggy operating system updates and a new
security flaw was discovered that could
potentially affect some mac computers
the company is mopping up the messes
first off there's a new update to iOS 8
to repair the glitchy update that it
released Wednesday iOS 8.0 point2 is now
available for download released one day
after a bungled update that disabled
cell reception on new iPhones it also
disabled the touch ID fingerprint
scanner Apple said about 40,000 devices
downloaded this bad software and
apologized for inconveniencing those
impacted the new update is supposed to
fix a variety of issues including bugs
with safari and health kit apps however
this update may not have fixed every bug
some users are posting online that they
still experience battery issues and
spotty Wi-Fi connectivity when it comes
to complaints about the bendable iPhone
6 plus Apple released a statement saying
any bend in the device is extremely rare
and only nine people officially reported
the problem to the company apple also
said it performed rigorous testing
throughout the entire development
process including three-point bending
twisting and sitting tests so yes Apple
does sit with iPhones to test how they
hold up just maybe they didn't test with
skinny jeans for long periods of time in
summary if you bend it take it to an
apple store and last but not least Apple
promises affixed to the bash bug also
known as shell shock a security flaw was
uncovered in programming code used by
many systems and apples Mac computers
were among them many vulnerable the bash
bug is dangerous because in theory it's
really easy for a hacker to take control
of your computer apple says users of its
OS 10 are safe by default from this flaw
but nonetheless Apple is also working to
provide a software update to patch the
problem Apple drama won't be an issue
for long with the los angeles clippers
basketball team or should
start calling them the clippies because
the new team owner steve ballmer former
head of microsoft is working on getting
the team to ditch their iPads and go all
windows can't blame the man for loyalty
right he told the LA Times that most of
the Clippers are on Windows but the
players and coaches still need to be
converted you know it's been a scary few
days when blackberry is having a better
week than Apple blackberry boasted that
it received more than 200,000 orders for
its new passport phone just a few days
after it was announced the square phone
is already sold out of its initial
supply on the blackberry website and
Amazon that's your tech news update
there's always more at cnet com from our
studios in New York I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
