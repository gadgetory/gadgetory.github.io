and today we're going to take a look at
the yamaha ysp 1400 this is a $400 sound
bar and it's the least expensive model
and Yamahas digital sound projector live
the promise is a true surround sound
experience from a sound bar well it
looks like a pretty typical sound bar
from the outside the design is actually
pretty unconventional there's just a
small speaker grille on the center and
it covers up an array of eight 1.13 inch
drivers and those drivers are used to
beam sound off of nearby walls and
furniture to create the surround sound
effect there are also two legs on the
sound bar and each has a three point two
five inch subwoofer that means there's
no separate wireless subwoofer which is
good for getting rid of an extra box but
it's not great for making deep bass the
included remote is a good one it has a
solid heft and important buttons like
volume and inputs are nicely separated
around back there's also an IR repeater
so if the sound bar blocks your TV's
remote sensor the Yamaha can still
repeat those signals out the back so you
can still control your TV also on the
back are the sound bars inputs you get
optical coaxial analog and mini jack
that's plenty if you connect all of your
devices directly to your TV then connect
its output to your sound bar but with
the YSP 1400 that doesn't work as well
as it usually does the issue is most TVs
actually dumb down incoming audio
signals to stereo which isn't good news
for a sound bar that specializes in
virtual surround basically if you want
the full surround effect you'll need to
connect all your devices directly to the
sound bar or use a workaround like an
HDMI switcher that includes an optical
audio output neither is really ideal
aside from the physical inputs there's
also built-in Bluetooth so you can
wirelessly stream audio from nearly any
smartphone or tablet
and there's also decoding for both Dolby
Digital and DTS which is needed for
listening to those surround sound tracks
as for sound quality the YSP 1400
doesn't quite create the true surround
effects that Yamahas more expensive ysp
sound bars are known for
now that's not surprising as a step-up
ysp 2200 has double the number of
drivers and the high-end ysp 4300 goes
all the way up to 22 drivers the YSP
1400 does sound considerably more
spacious than the standard 2.1 sound bar
like Sony's HD CT 260 but just don't
expect to hear sounds coming from behind
your head otherwise the YSP 1400 has a
crisp and clear sound with movies and
the unifying feature does a great job of
limiting dynamic spikes in volume so
it's great for listening late at night
on the other hand the lack of a separate
subwoofer means you're not going to get
real deep or powerful bass although it
still has a reasonably full range sound
so there's a lot to like about the YSP
1400 but the big hurdle is you need a
way to get it a true surround signal for
it to sound its best if you don't have a
lot of devices or you're okay with using
a workaround it's definitely worth
considering but the average buyer will
probably be better off with a simpler
solution I'm Matthew moscovia from CNET
