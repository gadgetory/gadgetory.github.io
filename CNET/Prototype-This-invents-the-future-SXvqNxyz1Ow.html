of a pyro pack ever heard of it well
that's because it doesn't exist not yet
at least
and that's just one example of what
you'll see on the Discovery Channel's
new TV series prototype this we build a
new invention on each show and
throughout the course of each hour or we
follow that process through the concept
through the design testing facets of it
and then the big final test which is
finding out if the prototype working on
from robots that can climb stairs to a
waterslide simulator no idea is too
outlandish or seen as impossible say
you're out with a bunch of friends at
the zoo and you go you know it would be
funny is if we had a giant you know
swing an arm thing that can throw
bananas and eventually you'll be driving
you know on a road trip somewhere big
right we talked about that giant arm
throws bananas what if we did this and
they literally kind of grow that way in
the 13 episodes each of the four hosts
brings a specific expertise
Terry is all about the animatronics and
fabrication of parts this is like
playing in a toy store for me it really
is to take something there's no block of
aluminum where a block of plastic and
cut it down to what I need it to be and
put wheels on it the motor and drive it
off into the Bay that's perfect Joe is
an electrical engineer and a hardware
hacker I've been doing that since I was
seven years old saws does robotics these
days if it doesn't have a computer
inside it then it's not really pushing
the envelope and Mike specializes in
mechanical engineering we really get
into the heart of technology so we go
talk to professors at different
universities and what the cutting edge
is that they're doing and then we
incorporate that into our own projects
that kind of access and expertise is
exactly the draw producers are hoping
will attract an audience okay this is
just a quick introduction see the reason
to watch the show is that you know you
have a bunch of guys they're really
smart they're thinking about the future
they're thinking about stuff that
you know has never been done before and
for a non-technical person I'm just
interested in seeing these guys go
through a process that makes them human
because they're being challenged and
then it's a fallible human process for a
techie person it's just like a dream
there's been this up surgeon gonna do it
yourself DIY it's the hobbyist you know
really coming the full glory and that's
really I think that people will appeal
to most people that want to see how you
actually do it and then they can do it
themselves don't expect to watch
prototype this like you're watching the
Home Shopping Network these gadgets and
devices are not going to be seen on
store shelves anytime soon but they are
here to spark your own creativity on
