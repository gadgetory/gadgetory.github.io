you know some pretty rough times but
everything's great now what's your
advice to them as they consider this
process see that that's funny on its
surface because I'm kind of like the
least the person you would want to ask
last how to make a smooth IPO but you
know it's seriously um it's it it's
actually a valuable process so you know
haven't gone through what I think most
people would characterize as an
extremely extremely turbulent first year
as a public company I can i can tell you
I actually don't think it's that bad you
know I was really heartened by the fact
that and I was really worried that you
know people would leave the company and
people would get really demoralized when
the stock price was down but people are
really focused on the mission and really
believe in the products that they're
working on and we haven't seen a lot of
that I actually think that it's made our
company a lot stronger because the
process of going leading up to going
public you have to know everything about
your company and kind of inside out have
everything instrumented and I always
thought we were a very data driven
company but I mean the work that ebers
men and crew did to make to get us ready
to be public really took this to the
next level and I'm we run our company a
lot better now so I mean in retrospect I
think I was too afraid of going public
and I i think you know I've been very
outspoken about staying private for as
long as possible I don't think it's that
necessary to do that and um you know you
just got to stay focused on doing doing
the right stuff and you know sometimes
it might take the market a little while
to catch up and see the results of what
you're doing I when I remember last year
when we were here I was kind of laying
out what we were planning on doing on
mobile and everyone thought that mobile
was this disastrous thing for facebook I
mean last year I'm second quarter we we
had basically no money on no revenue on
mobile and now I mean it's in our last
you know our last quarter a year later
rhythm or than forty percent of our
revenue is mobile and you know when
people think that you know there's
there's more competition on mobile
there's more great apps you know people
spend on on desktop one in seven minutes
with facebook
I've kind of all their time on the web
and on mobile it's more it's um it's
it's one in five you know according to
comscore notes around twenty percent in
the next biggest staff is Instagram so
you know we're we've focused on unkind
of doing what we think are the right
things and and we're growing we're
connecting more folks people are
engaging more sharing more content you
know all the stuff that we just come in
and get excited about every day so I
think you know as long as Twitter and I
mean this goes for all these private
companies that are thinking about when
they want to go private as long as they
kind of focus on what they're doing then
I think it's wonderful</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
