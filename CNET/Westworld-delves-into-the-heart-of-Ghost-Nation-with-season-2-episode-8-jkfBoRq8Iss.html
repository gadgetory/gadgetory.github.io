after after show I'm Patrick I'm Lin and
we are big fans of the show West world
and editors here at scene that
today we're gonna be talking about
season 2 episode 8 and if you're
anything like me and you hate spoilers
you should leave right now because we're
gonna spoil a lot of stuff on this
episode Patrick obviously hasn't watched
it yet I don't know what he's doing on
this show okay so you don't like
spoilers you're out by kicks Ouya is the
name of this episode and in Lakota means
remember which i think is so spot-on for
this episode it's great just to give
like a quick little recap this is
probably one of the most linear episodes
we've ever seen for plus I really want
to say yay to that yeah I always felt
like the most relaxed and the whole
thing like I wasn't just trying to
figure out the whole time what was going
on yeah and there's also I think allowed
more like the emotions to really hit you
subplot Barnardo's that triple bernard
from two timelines I know you have one
main character and you're following him
the whole time we then at the end of it
all kind of learn that akka cheetah akka
kita I mean that's what she we're like
but so okay is we're going to call him
know is we learn explaining his history
and how he has discovered the outside
world essentially how he woke up to Mays
I feel like the way he discover the
outside world was parallels Mays except
it was like more abridged and shortened
and especially the stuff where you know
he had to kill himself and realize I
think that's how he gets out to find a
loved one I was like oh this reminds me
of made when she was like multiple times
killing herself
definitely definitely another similarity
they're both rooted in love they are
both so strongly because of the love of
another host and we see that in our Chi
story he you know gets ripped from his
love he kind of sort of wakes up and
discovers
there's this alternate world and then
because of that Ford rewrites his
programming and makes him more like
mindless Killi and so he goes and gets
Killi and then starts to realize wait
wait wait something's off something's
different and she discovers or you know
still has the memory of the maze in his
mind so then he sees his wife at camp or
his past life wife Kohana and it really
all starts to come back to him he
remembers loving her he remembers being
with her he remembers all the times they
would talk and stay together and he
actually kidnaps her not the best way
that you know someone by the way if you
feel like someone is kind of familiar to
you don't sneak at night into a tent and
be like come with PS you know PS and
it's okay you know me it's fine like
don't do that it's like I didn't know
why he couldn't just kind of took her
aside in the morning time in a
non-threatening way and be like hey I
think you know we might have known each
other but they also like you see him
like washing literally washing his
character off washing off the
destination to kind of come back to him
but it was but it's like why not when
you're clean wasn't like right now hey I
showered yeah I'm good
hand her a note maybe a or B do you like
what your yeah but I thought that was it
was beautiful but also haunting he
kidnaps her he kind of brings her into
his I don't want to call it a reverie
because it actually is probably the
precursor to the reveries that Ford
gives everyone else it is it like a bug
then I don't think so I think that you
know we learn in this episode that he is
called alpha 2 which could like lend
credence to the idea that he is the
second host ever after Dolores you know
he was in the same model as Angelo we
see him pitching the company to William
and Logan in the earlier a much earlier
episode and I think that his awakening
is probably a true awakening you know he
has really discovered by virtue of
really not dying for someone the outside
world and these humans
these others that are around him ford
also said that he built him to be more
curious yeah but then I just don't see
like how that curiosity leads to
basically a whole upheaval of Ford's
code he's like oh I didn't read it be
that curious I'm doing everything but he
doesn't seem upset about it either
like Ford does not seem that angry when
he's like oh you weren't supposed to do
this
he seems really intrigued and he tells
him okay well next time you see the
Death Bringer kill me you'll know it's
time to gather your people and then we
see okay after our present day gala
finding Ford realizing what it means and
you know entering that next phase and
he's like I said again all describing
all this to Maeve through her daughter
which I didn't really realize until the
end and I still was a little bit
confused because there were some point
in time where I was like whose memories
are these because there was a lot of
Maeve and her daughter and in the last
episode showed that her daughter kind of
was her her mother's role was supplanted
by this other like Maeve 2.0 so I was
like who are we thinking through who are
we seeing through because shouldn't the
daughter have more memories of the other
mother
you might the new mom new me but
apparently these are not her memories
they're probably Maeve's memories we
were probably watching Maeve and okay
you know line up their timelines and say
hey here's my story and I wasn't there
to harm you I was there to like watch
you I was there a big misunderstanding
right I was there to like help you wake
up and that's exactly what is this was a
huge misunderstanding by virtue of him
kind of adopting that kilee persona and
it's interesting that Maeve you know
kind of how did she know to talk to him
through her daughter like did he know
that she could control them so he called
to her and she now also knows Lakota to
like this was a good recent development
she yeah she developed that in the last
couple episodes - yeah I think that goes
back to last episode when we saw me
being shot and grabbed by the troops
that we were wondering where allow all
the other people he had seen the
previous episode were and that imagine
that he's seeing this going on he's
grabbed the daughter to protect her all
the things that we don't know at the
time because we see his point of view
this whole episode but I also think that
might be a little bit why he wants to
get in contact with her
the whole episode is like providing
context to how the Lakota tribe has been
the whole time yeah I mean it's a Razzie
of this play by Tom Stoppard Rosencrantz
and Guildenstern are dead which kind of
has the gimmick of being Hamlet told
through the two guys we get killed in
Hamlet like midway through Grant it's
more of a comedy than that but I love
that it just gives instantly this
empathy to ghost nation and hockey and
his role and it does it in such a
beautiful way and we're seeing the same
themes and the same kind of mysteries we
see all throughout West world but this
done it's such a more poetic way I think
maybe because of that that's at least
for me it was a lot more emotional and
it was definitely I would have no
problem sighs definite my favorite
episode would you prefer that it
happened sooner do you think it's
necessary to be this late into West
world I mean we're almost 20 episodes in
at this point no it's a good question
because I've been thinking that too like
if I were to show someone who'd never
seen West world one episode it might be
this one I feel like you get a little
bit enough grant there's a lot of
spoiler stuff and that would be horrible
but just to show someone like hey not
seeing this show this would be the
episode because I think it just brings
you in so so simply but elegantly and
there's just a poetry I mean and it's a
love story not only between I think the
host like okay and Kohana but also
between Maeve and her daughter but also
between Ford and those hosts which
whether that's a god-like love or
whatever but then in real life we also
have Lea and Maeve which we see like me
even at leas doing the crappiest job
saving her he's like I thought he could
have done it one episode earlier and
he's like no please you know protect her
and he's like and they already flayed
her yes like oh you had a little blood
now you have more blood like you're
doing a really bad job yeah you're
terrible right now I mean whatever your
intentions are but he also seems like
his power is has been minimized in this
hierarchy that's back all he's been
doing is like sneaking into the lab and
being told to go away yeah I mean
striking - there's one scene when it's
shooting her from her right and you can
just see her jugular vein pulsing under
the flayed skin and muscle and I was
like wow that's super creepy and really
awesome yeah whoever's doing the makeup
on this one is like tremendous yeah and
it was it's very creepy but also think
it visually just shows you how like not
to say she's on life support he's not
really alive but she's blinking and
she's like responding and still really
like unnerving to see that yeah it's
like there's obviously she is just a few
moments away from having everything go
away but at the same time there that is
of interest to the Delos people because
what's the line they say like she's the
only one who has admin access right now
yeah that's pretty up yeah and
then at the end so as akka has given her
this whole his life story he kind of
tells her like don't worry we will take
care of your daughter I promise I'm
sorry we couldn't save you if you live
come back join us get with your daughter
and we don't I mean
die well good luck bye um also like this
talking a little bit about taking a
minor character if you can I try to
imagine another show I can't think of
one that's taking a minor character and
featured it featured him or her so
predominantly and also the actors a
MacLennan has always been that character
actor you see in lots of TV shows the
one for me that stuck out was season two
of Fargo he plays the amazing character
very badass character but also has some
equal moments where he gets more screen
time than you think a character like
that normally would but to give a whole
episode to an actor as talented as him
and to all the actors who play in Ghost
Nation I think is just not only cool but
like wow there's so much more to be
explored just in the characters you
already have in West world let alone
before we add in things like Shogun
world and all those other things yeah I
love it I don't even want like one
episode I want like all five more
episodes of you
like I feel it is kind of it is great
that they do you know devoted one
episode but I hope it's you know it's
not like a chief it's just like oh well
here's one we have one a Shogun world I
hope it gets more integrated as the
season the two episodes left or maybe
the next season two progresses just to
have more like equal wait because like
as yours we want to see more of these
characters and I feel like wine up is
some may not be enough cuz it's so good
and it's like so yeah and the scene in
the cold storage that was I think the
more and I was the most touching scene
between any to like I remember we were
sad between Dolores and the father but I
was such a salsa like well these are all
scripted lines it's not really you know
I wasn't really super feeling it was sad
but no but like Peter he responded like
even though they were scripted lines it
was like he knew her he was able to like
give back some of the emotion that she
was giving I think that's difference
between that watching two characters who
are playing host being programmed to
share that emotion which was powerful
but I'm with you the moment in cold
storage with the Nirvana cover like that
he doesn't realize that they basically
even though she's physically here have
made her completely disappeared yeah and
I feel like also like Dolores still has
like a lot of power and where she stands
and she still has a lot of things to do
but with the with him in cold storage
it's just there's such a sense of like
hopelessness because he can't do
anything he doesn't know where to bring
her back and what does this all mean and
like how he would just starting I mean
hope maybe he does like later on but
like there's just like oh there's
absolutely nothing he could do and when
they take her away to when she gets
carted away from the text it's like he
was like chasing after her and then you
think like where's he got to go he can't
just run and like there's this whole
other layer outside of where he lives
and and he's getting some sense of that
but he can't like quite grasp it he
doesn't have like as much control and
power and it's just really sad it's
really sad and then I think also
thinking like thematically to like as we
live in America that country very known
for how horribly they've treated Native
Americans and the tribes that were here
that we're seeing these images like a
Native American a full warrior
kept going on an escalator downstairs
was like this these tremendous images of
like this emptiness of Technology but
then like the soulfulness and
peacefulness that at least his character
and that his tribe has in this in this
episode how did I and we was really
effective for me because sadly a lot of
us don't think of things that way don't
think of our history that way and what
we had to destroy in order to have the
civilization we had so there's like did
that duality to I think but yeah I was
just like that moment and then the other
part too when he looks over to see the
Sun and brings back the braid for the
mom that was I'm not kind of bad though
because he's like oh I found your son
and she's like crying and then there
could be like still a substitute son
next to her and she's like well I
thought I was a son like I'm sorry I
don't have this braid I was she was
mostly awake yeah she was real but like
there was like a substitute son too and
she's like I found your son he's like I
thought I was her son - ex-wife - but I
like how they even don't even call them
substitutes there's like oh I see you
have a new ghost
it's like what what is crazy what I also
kind of like about them all kind of
waking up is that in the first season
Ford thought that the only way to be
awake is to Ford or in order for that
but it's the only way to be awake is to
suffer is to go through all these loops
and suffer each time because each time
you want to change your situation and
get out but then okay still had an
inkling of an outside world even when he
was living like a pretty peaceful wife
but rocky runs into Logan Logan that was
a great call back or come like yeah and
it's like oh he's crazy sunburnt Logan
yeah I'm like weirdest vacation I'm like
where are the texts getting in there
taking a little long to like wrangle him
in yeah I sort of kind of explained that
away my brain is like maybe they treat
him like William like men in black
William where it's like oh we're not
supposed to go for young William or for
Logan Delos like we just leave them but
he's right for the door it's like yeah
yeah here it's like at what point do
you're like wow the guy who owns this
Sun is naked and
when I give him like a bag like pick him
up with the white car but the the lines
that he says - okay with hey we're in
the wrong world and the door like those
are the ones that kind of popped up for
me and I feel like okay takes that up as
kind of describing that he's not being
the life he's living is not necessary
the one he's meant to live yeah well
like this is like a fake world and that
there's some real world out there but as
a viewer I was also kind of
unfortunately thinking like oh the rural
it's not so great either like if you
were to exit outside and being and
seeing like what we do and all that
stuff and Plus like humans Americans
have had a really garbage history about
how we treat Native Americans but this
island might be in China so this could
be different I don't know but I just saw
like oh you don't want to even be in the
real world we're garbage people but
that's what he they have the he keeps
referring to as the people below what
you think is neat cuz you think of like
old like mythology like Hades and the
world below like that these are like the
devils and the stuff running the world
and because yeah literally yeah
literally below which I thought that was
kind of smoothing creative as well yeah
it's good because colonizers are the
devil colonizers aren't the devil so
what does a Casey when he sees the door
what are we what do you guys think he
sees pipes a lot of construction where
he sees like a door underground and he
thinks it might be the door to where you
I but every better world
yeah but it could just be like at the
cafeteria of another other way I think
we can see the terraforming equipment in
the background in the foreground is
they'll pit whatever you want to call it
and I think this scene is actually maybe
the other side of when Williams shows
Dolores look at my kingdom like look at
all this stuff that's why I was I think
they're on the other side of that huge
pit near the terraforming equipment as
we see in
scene and he's over here being like oh
well this is obviously new things
interesting that it doesn't look like
nothing to him and more interesting that
you're like oh well there's the
equipment and maybe these are just two
sides of the same coin
yeah wait no yeah okay so the thing on
this season has been the valley beyond
is this the now beyond do you guys think
quite possibly he does not refer to it
like that until he's teaching Kohana
what it is and telling her you know I
was sure we would together find the
valley beyond here the last time I
promise but he's been out there though
before as we mentioned which i think is
very interesting I'm like why doesn't he
remember that if he remembers right
everything else
why doesn't he ran Dolores members some
of that stuff yep and Dolores we just
call it the Death Bringer I love that
nickname now I do like yeah what is it
like is it just because she has been so
like so tied to like Bernard Arnold and
Ford for so long that maybe that's
what's kept that he would have
recognized Logan he's like you're that
guy that we doesn't matter can challenge
on and then now you're naked this is
exactly what I thought life kind of
thinking yes life comes at you fast i
wow such an old me know I wondered the
exact same thing and it's that question
that actually led me to my question at
the very end which is might maybe the
new version of his Kohana because she
repeats the line that they used to
repeat to each other okay is that part
of the story because she had heard it I
was thinking something a little
different I was wondering as Maeve the
new like cradle is made the new Nana
said that this is that isn't that let me
let me explain like not a sense that
here's the other host backups but he's
the able to interface with them and this
is like a rebirth of like a 3.0 living
cradle like a living creature yeah not
in the actual server room that kind of
I think it's less oh no and more like
sure yeah and it's also kind of it gets
a little more matrix e with like oh we
are on this plane that we can't explain
I don't know there's one thing we should
really bring up real quickly is the
moment tree man in black Emily and ok
what do you guys think of that yeah I I
like him he's like take him like we're
we're gonna kill him anyway
really him don't want him to hurt her
like oh they wanted to torture him yeah
I'm gonna kill him not to hurt him
apparently everybody does but Emily does
the most Emily says she does the most
she won't probably it's her dad either
way um I think which leads me to am very
excited about next episode I just gave a
little bit here - you'll see a seal
award very famous actress playing Juliet
the mother of the mother / the wife yeah
I mean a blacks whites yes which I'm
very excited to see love her as an
actress I think it's going to be a very
intense family reunion to see how they
all interact with each other and how
that all goes we also get a flashback to
when tiny little Emily was meeting
Dolores for the first time which as we
all said like that kind of might have
sparked her interest and made her kind
of be like oh I like them more than
humans let's hang out please which is
also how she learned to speak the ghost
nation's language I think that Emily
knows more is more sees more than
anybody realizes I don't think she's the
answer but I do think that she holds
some of the cards we need to figure out
the main Westworld mystery speaking of
mysteries I have like one remaining
question from this episode which you
guys could maybe help me out is with the
maze that akka was drawing and I get it
cuz you know he was like haunted by and
he's like what does this mean and keeps
bothering him and he draws it everywhere
I still don't get why it's on the scalps
and like if so they I'm assuming now
they drew it on themselves cuz he's like
okay so it's always with you so you
always remember but
one it's not very practical because it's
not like they could still see it when
they get rebooted and then to like when
they get when they die and they scalp
themselves Aztec still has to come in
and repair them so wouldn't the tech be
like why did they keep drawing that like
let's throw this away and all the stuffs
like I still didn't really quite get it
and maybe it was just like just a hole
that's gonna remain a hole a pothole or
yeah but no I was kind of I was curious
if a little bit maybe not that in-depth
but it did call back to the first
episode when they have to scalp I'm not
sure exactly what coach nation remember
it is have to look again but they take
the scalp off and the maze is there but
they need to see them not even like it
is discarded yep and it's not Arnold
putting it there he goes yeah they don't
even care what it is so there's that as
well like when you shake that but I
think that's what it goes back to it
like yes they were scalping and putting
that in there but the text didn't know
what it was mm-hm
and they were like oh maybe someone just
coated this in or oh it's on the inside
who cares right so they couldn't really
see it but by virtue of imprinting it on
another ghost nation tribe member
perhaps that's what put it in their
minds so to speak it's like those like
early like like video game things were
like the guys signed the inside of like
the circuit board but you'll never see
University to take the Atari apart
unless you know what you're looking for
you won't recognize it but is there a is
that then it what's the usefulness to
ghost nation then if they can't see it
either as he says it's to spread the
word it's to basically create disciples
no or a better sounding where he creates
evangelist of this new way of thinking
of the maze and everything by spreading
that but maybe it's not just the
destination maybe it's also the people
they're scalping and they're putting it
on after these victim hosts
indoctrinating them indoctrinating them
it's quite a better word and i don't
know it's curious detail but I wonder
about that and I'm excited about next
episode for some of the the william
family drama
me too but I'm also like I really love
this episode I just really liked it way
to go HBO and West world
