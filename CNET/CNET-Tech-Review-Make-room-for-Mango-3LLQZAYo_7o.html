Windows Phone 7 gets a mango makeover
summer movie apps coming soon to a touch
screen near you blu-ray discs are almost
an afterthought for our top five players
and get down and dirty with Dropbox it's
all coming up right now
hi everyone I'm Hollywood and welcome to
the cnet tech review where we collect
our hottest videos of the week and tell
you what's good and what's bad in the
world of tech plus offer some unique
tech wisdom in the form of the bottom
line let's start with the good Microsoft
to Steve Jobs we'll see your 200 new
features in iOS 5 and raise you 500 new
features in Windows Phone mango boom in
fact there's so much going on with mango
that cell phone editors Bonnie cha and
Jessica dole court decided to split up
review duties on this one take a look at
their two-part first look back in
November microsoft launched its new
mobile operating system Windows Phone 7
and it's about to get a big ole update
hey everyone I'm Bonnie toss senior
editor at cnet com and I'm here to bring
you a first look at some of the new
features of Windows Phone mango which
will officially be called windows phone
7.5 when its release this fall the
update will bring more than 500 new
features but a lot of it focuses on
three key areas Communications absent
Internet so what are the new
communications features well first in
terms of messaging you can now link
multiple email accounts into a single
inbox it's easy to set up and I like
that Microsoft gives you the option to
pick and choose which accounts to link
because I like to keep my work email
separate from my personal email it's
also easier to keep track of messages
thanks to the new conversation view
email threads are now grouped together
and marked for quick identification in
your inbox so you no longer have to
scroll through every single message
trying to find a response in the People
Hub you can now create group contacts
once you've set up a group you can text
or email everyone at once and view the
latest updates and photos of just those
group members instead of having to sort
through your entire contacts feed
windows phone 7.5 also makes it easier
for you to post to your social networks
with an enhanced live tile currently the
me tile only lets you post to Facebook
and see what's new in your profile but
with the mango update you'll be able to
post a message check in two places see
notifications and set your chat status
and last but not least mango is going to
add support for Twitter and
linkedin accounts in the People Hub
unfortunately since we didn't have final
software this feature wasn't activated
on a review unit but we're told that it
will act the same way as Facebook does
so you see your friends tweets and
linkedin updates right in the what's new
section now I know none of these
features are new to other platforms but
what I like about Windows Phone is how
they integrate it at all a lot of the
time with competing os's to do the same
things like checking Facebook you have
to open a separate app but with Windows
Phone it's integrated with your contacts
the picture hub and other areas of the
phone relevant content shows up in
relevant places and you don't have to
think about it or do extra work it's a
smarter approach and I think it's where
Windows Phone really succeeds but the
challenge for Microsoft is to make
everyone else understand that like I
said earlier there's a lot more to the
windows phone mango update and this is
just the tip of the iceberg so be sure
to check out our full preview for more
I'm Bonnie Tom this has been your first
look at the communication features of
Windows Phone mango update hey everyone
I'm Jessica doll court with cnet what
I've got for you today is a look at some
of the new app features coming your way
in Windows Phone mango which will
otherwise be known as Windows Phone 7.5
Microsoft has spent a lot of time and
energy working on apps with this release
so they may or may not have the most
programs in their app store but I do
give Microsoft credit for trying to
integrate those apps in useful ways for
example when you search for a movie or a
product or a business and being you're
now going to see suggestions for
relevant apps that you can download and
also a list of apps that you already
have the same is going to go for apps
and the music and pictures hubs as well
you might not see every app in those
lists that you think you should that's
because the app publisher has to enable
apps to connect with the feature in
order for that to happen another app
that has some really neat tools is Bing
there's local Scout which is sort of
like Yelp for restaurants and businesses
nearby and there's music ID which is a
lot like Shazam music ID essentially
matches the sound of recorded music that
adheres to the zune music database and
it will of course help you buy those
songs as well then there's being vision
and this is probably one of the updates
most ambitious
apps it scans barcodes and also book and
magazine covers posters and DVD covers
to identify search results online it can
also attempt to scan and translate text
into numerous languages that was a
little less successful for me now I did
have some problems with being vision not
recognizing all the images that I sent
its way so hopefully Microsoft will be
able to improve upon the tool before the
final version is released okay now the
last new feature that I want to show you
is multitasking to easily switch from
one open app to another you just press
and hold the back arrow under the screen
you'll see the apps shrink into
thumbnail sizes and then you can swipe
around and see and then select the open
pages just remember that this is a
technical preview so Microsoft has more
time to refine some of its features
before the update officially comes out
this fall once again i'm jessica dull
court with cnet this is Windows Phone
mango and don't forget to check out our
hands-on review of the mango preview on
cnet com as Jessica mentioned they did
only have a technical preview of Windows
Phone 7.5 to work with so look for our
full reviews of the new OS and of course
new handsets when the final version is
released next up we've got the latest
editor's choice honoree in the gaming
desktop category the digital storm ode
level three combined sleek design
elements with blazing performance and
just one tiny little quirk
hi I'm rich brown senior editor for
cnet.com today we're going to take a
look at the editors choice winning
digital storm code level 3 so this is a
fixed configuration gaming desktop but
costs about 2,400 bucks and it's
actually one of the best systems we've
seen in this price range it has fast
gaming performance and overclocked intel
core i7 cpu and pretty much every
feature we expect to find for this price
one of the things we like most about the
system is its external design this white
and black case is pretty handsome and
it's actually convenient to use you'll
see the front panel here is nice and
clean it's got a blu ray/dvd combo drive
here up top now here on the top of the
case there's a couple ports you've got
four usb2 ports a USB 3 port firewire
inputs as well as a couple of analog
audio jacks and this dial here will let
you control the fan speed in case you
want to kind of dial down the noise as
you're using the system on the back of
the system you'll see one of our few
criticisms you'll notice this wire
coming out from the case and into the
USB 3 port here in the back that
actually connects this USB 3 port to the
USB 3 port at the top of the case so
well we're glad to see usb3 in the
system this kind of external wiring is
definitely an amateurish design decision
otherwise you get all the ports we like
to see in a system like this there's a
ton of usb2 ports in the back of the
system as well as 13 USB 3 slot there's
a ps2 old-school mouse and keyboard jack
you get eSATA as well as power D SATA
there's 7.1 analog audio as well as spit
if optical audio out up here now between
the two graphics cards here you also get
a lot of display output options you got
four DVI outs an HDMI output on each
card as well as a full-size DisplayPort
out on each card now for gaming purposes
the system probably isn't ideal if you
want to set up multiple high resolution
monitors but if you want to connect a
large TV or a couple lower res screens
the system is definitely up for the task
now we mentioned the case is easy to use
and by that mostly we mean it's easy to
get inside there's two lashes here in
the side panel they pull down the door
pops off just like that it's nice and
easy now inside the case it's actually
something we haven't seen before this
plastic plate installed on top of the
motherboard covers up all the circuitry
and the transistors you usually see
inside a case
and it definitely goes a long way
towards meeting up the overall
appearance here between the plate and
the wiring that's pretty much invisible
in the system digital storm has really
done a nice job inside the case
component-wise is pretty straightforward
stuff for a system in this twenty five
hundred dollar price range of here
you've got the liquid cooling Hardware
going down to an intel core i7 2600
Cassie PU is overclocked to 4.8
gigahertz making it super fast and that
is how digital storm cells the system
remembering you get eight gigs of ram
with this pc as well as two free slots
if you want to upgrade later you'll see
there's two nvidia gtx 570 graphics
cards and there's 21 x pci express slots
on the motherboard there a little bit
hard to see for the hard drives digital
storm gives you over 128 gigabytes
solid-state drive that has windows on it
and for general storage you get a one
terabyte drive down here now you can
also see from all the free drive base
here that there's plenty of room to
expand but that said there's no cabling
behind these slots so you have to do
that yourself so in our lab we found the
ODE level three was one of the fastest
if not the fastest gaming pcs in this
price category so between its speed its
features it's great looking case in its
aggressive price the system is an easy
Editors Choice winner so I'm rich brown
this is the digital storm ode level 3
that's one good-looking gaming rig but
seriously there wasn't any other way to
power that USB 3 port without that
little pig tail sticking out the back I
mean I guess you could always just
unplug it skip the port on top at least
that's what I would do Dropbox is
probably one of the most widely known
cloud storage services around but it's
oh so much more than just that Sharon
Vaknin has a few tips to help make you a
Dropbox master hey everyone I'm Sharon
Vaknin for cnet.com Dropbox is one of
the great cloud storage tools like
sugarsync or SkyDrive the lets you sync
files with any computer when you put a
file into your Dropbox you can access it
on any other computer or mobile phone
lots of people use it for project
management as a virtual thumb drive or
as a way to share files with friends but
today i have for new ways to use Dropbox
on my facebook page i asked you guys to
give me your best tips and i'm including
a couple of those two to get dropbox go
to dropbox com sign up for an account
and download the desktop client you'll
automatically get two gigs of storage
free and you'll start using it right
away to upload files to your Dropbox you
can upload it through the web client or
drag it into the dropbox folder on your
desktop but a very clever way to get
things in your folder is by emailing it
go to send to dropbox com where you'll
get a special email address you can use
to email attachments to your Dropbox so
if my friend sends me an email with his
new mix and I can't save it on my iPhone
because it doesn't do that I can just
forward it to my unique Dropbox email
address and it will automatically get
uploaded to my dropbox folder another
company got creative and built a tool
that lets you upload target links to
your Dropbox for instance if a
restaurant has a PDF of nutritional
facts on their website you can copy the
link paste it into URL droplet calm and
it'll be uploaded to your Dropbox so
it's nice you can find a link and upload
it that way or email attachments and
your files will be waiting for you on
another computer or phone whenever
you're ready
you can automate things even more with
this awesome trick no matter where you
are you can use Dropbox to remotely
start downloading torrents to show you
I'll use utorrent but the steps are
similar for other BitTorrent clients too
so what you have to do on a Mac is open
utorrent and go to preferences then head
over to downloads and check
automatically open torrent files found
in and browse to select your Dropbox
folder on Windows go to preferences then
directories check the box next to
automatically load torrents from and
select your Dropbox folder since torrent
files can be big set them to download
somewhere else on your hard drive just
remember that if you use this trick your
home computer needs to stay on and
running utorrent but now you can start
torrance no matter where you are for
whatever legal purposes you like of
course like I mentioned lots of people
use Dropbox as a virtual USB Drive and
since you really can't forget to take it
with you it's a convenient solution for
accessing your documents but lifehacker
points out that since it's not the
default Documents folder you might
forget to change the target folder to
your Dropbox when you're saving
documents so why not make Dropbox your
default Documents folder on windows 7 or
vista right click your Documents folder
select properties and then on the
location tab you can specify the new
file path click move and then select
your Dropbox folder on a Mac open up
terminal and type CD Dropbox then type
this command which will create a
Documents folder in your Dropbox that
automatically syncs with your desktop
and other computers and on my Facebook
page Jason Wang reminded me that Dropbox
will save all versions of your docs for
30 days just go to the Dropbox web
interface hover over a file and click
the arrow to view previous versions of
it and finally Javier left a message on
my page explaining that you can use
Dropbox as your own photostream with the
Android and iPhone apps you can upload
photos from your phone directly to your
Dropbox or take photos within the
application and view them anywhere and
you can even make a public photos folder
to share with friends and family by now
though you might be wondering if 2
gigabytes is enough for all these tricks
two gigs is good for most but if you
need more storage don't forget that drop
box gives you 250 megabytes for every
friend you refer but don't start making
fake email addresses and inviting
yourself Dropbox is a little smarter
than that if you have any more tips let
me know on my facebook page and visit
how to cnet com for more how to's first
seen it I'm Sharon Vaknin and i'll see
you on the interwebs see there are
perfectly legal files that can be easily
shared via torrents like linux distro
images and i'm sure there are other
things too while i try to think of some
more let's take a break but we've still
got a lot more tech review right after
this
welcome back to the cnet tech review our
weekly video digest of all things good
and bad we've seen here at cnet TV
continuing on in the good we are slowly
coming around to the idea that blu-ray
has one and it's time to get a blu-ray
DVD player but only because they have so
many streaming services built-in cool
easier to count down the top-5 blu-ray
players that you might never use to play
discs
little silver discs they've sort of had
their run cd/dvd even blu-ray feeling
the heat of streaming delivery and
digital download but that's it when you
want the best video quality in your home
TV room you've still got to pop in a
disk I'm Brian Cooley with the top five
blu-ray players according to cnet review
scores and all of them by the way do a
lot more than just great high-def number
five is the samsung BD d 6700 we love
it's huge array of streaming services it
has dual hdmi outputs you'd use that if
you want to run separate dedicated video
and audio feeds out of it to different
gear it's got a generous one gigabyte of
onboard memory for features like bd-live
and it can be controlled from a nap what
camp these days on the other hand it's
stubbornly pricing at around two hundred
and seventy bucks in a world filled with
175 dollar bluray x number four is the
sony bdp s 580 this guy has about the
best array of streaming services except
it's missing MLB com it has built-in
Wi-Fi as well it's fast which is really
important when you're hopping around all
the features and chapters of a data
heavy blu-ray disc there's also an
iphone and an android control app and
they're free unlike the samsung we just
talked about it doesn't do 2d to 3d
conversion but we think that's kind of a
joke anyway the biggest drawback on this
guy is Sony's custom interface for
getting to all the connected stuff it
could be the worst in the business
classic Sony but the rest is great
number three is the LG BD 670 it's kind
of the opposite of the Sony it has a
tremendous easy-to-use interface for all
the online services also built in Wi-Fi
but no onboard memory for accessing
bd-live online content but we seldom
find ourselves doing that anyway so who
cares same lack of silly 2d to 3d
conversion look basically this guy plays
the hits it does all the important stuff
well and leaves the gimmicks to the
other ones the number two best blu-ray
player right now is the panasonic DMP
BDT 210 built-in Wi-Fi again great
streaming services including MLB and a
price right there in that hundred and
eighty dollars sweet spot all great but
sealing the deal on this guy is that
it's the fastest blu-ray player we've
ever tested fast it loading and
navigating discs if you haven't tried a
blu-ray deck you don't realize how
important that is there's also a touch
free disc tray loading technology that's
a little bit much but overall this is
our favorite blu-ray disc player hold
that thought before I bring you to
number one what are you going to feed
your new blu-ray deck we just revised
our list of the top 40 blu-ray discs
these are great transfers the studio's
really sweat it over instead of just
shoveling but kinds of discs that make
you remember why you still have a big
old bookcase full of DVDs in your TV
room go check it out ok remember I said
a minute ago that the number two
panasonic BDT 210 was our favorite
blu-ray player so what's above that the
value King that's who the sony ps3 slim
that's our number one pick at just a few
bucks more than the number 5 samsung
deck you'll get a solid blu-ray player a
high-def game console living room web
browser AV streaming machine and all of
that wrapped up in an easy to use
interface that we like a lot now you
can't play ps2 games on this guy and
only bluetooth universal remotes work
with it which is weird but if you're
going to go to get the most for your
money this is the machine for you to
catch the latest cnet reviews of all the
blu-ray players go to cnet click on home
video they're all in there and for more
top 5s like this one go to top 5 cnet
com i'm brian cooley thanks for watching
yeah tell me what I'm waiting for in
addition to all the streaming services
and web integration and fast performance
maybe some cooler names really the BMP
and the BDT and the DB be I'm not going
to remember any of that standing in the
store ps3 slim though easy to remember
in addition to impossible naming
conventions let's see what else is wrong
with the world this week in the bed as
the tablet Wars rage on for every winner
like the ipad 2 or the galaxy tab there
has to be a loser and thanks to Donald
Bell we found another one hey i'm donna
bell and today we're taking a first look
at the velocity micro cruise t 301 this
is an Android tablet with a 7-inch
screen and a low low street price of a
hundred and sixty dollars it's running a
modified version of android 2.2 and like
a lot of the budget tablets we see
google's official apps for gmail maps
and marketplace and others aren't
included you get a decent email app
though and the web browser is also
pretty good you also notice that the
apps for kindle and facebook are
included right out of the box we were
also able to get amazon's android app
store working here but popular game
downloads like angry birds and fruit
ninja weren't compatible so don't get
your hopes up in terms of gaining in
terms of hardware I've definitely seen
worse in this price range it weighs
about a pound and the screen quality
isn't great but the build quality is
actually pretty resilient the only
Achilles heel here is that the plastic
on the back can be peeled off pretty
easily to you that might be a feature
but I would think twice before letting a
kid around this on the side here you'll
find a nice oversized volume switch the
top has a power button and full-size SD
card slot also a mini USB connection on
the bottom there's a pair of speakers a
headphone jack and connection for the
included power adapter on the whole is
an okay general purpose tablet for the
money if you're buying this is an
e-reader though you'll probably be
disappointed by the weight and the
screen quality if it's something you're
picking up for a kid your kids probably
going to be disappointed that they can't
play Angry Birds on this and I recommend
spending the extra fifty dollars on an
ipod touch so that's the cruise T 301
from velocity micro
for cnet.com I'm Donald Bell remember
there's a difference between inexpensive
and cheap though I suppose the cruise is
technically bolts let's go ahead and
wrap things up with this week's bottom
line summer is officially here and that
means the summer blockbuster movie
season is already in full swing and
thanks to the film tie-ins featured in
this week tap that app you can enjoy the
movie experience long after the house
lights come up welcome to tap that app

little more lighthearted check out the
zookeeper movie app it's free for the
iPhone and iPad and includes three
mini-games like grabbing bananas with

look forward to this summer and fans of
x-men first class get a free digital
magazine for the iPad showcasing how the
x-men have played an important part in
historical events including how John F
