CNET and I'm here taking a look at the
Sony SmartWatch 3 now this is a third
generation of Sony SmartWatch but this
one has a big difference it runs on
Android wear that's Google operating
system for watches and wearable devices
rather than Sony's own take on Android
now we've seen Android wear and other
devices like the LG G watch is also on
the Samsung live watch and it will be on
the motorola moto 360 the fact that it
uses the same operating system as these
other devices means it will be able to
use the same apps that are developed for
those watches has a 1.6 in screen width
of 320 by 320 pixel resolution which
should be more than enough to make sense
of everything that's going on it's also
completely waterproof meaning you don't
have to take it off when you're going
into the shower unlike the other Android
wear smartwatches we've seen the Sony
watch can actually remove the watch part
from the strap meaning you can simply
swap the colors the Sony has popped some
of his own Android wear software on
board as well including a Walkman app
and a camera app that lets you use it as
a remote shutter for your phone or even
some of Sony's Wi-Fi enabled cameras
Sony also reckons what you'll be able to
get about two days of battery life from
it which is a step up from the one day
but you'll get from the LG G watch
although we'll have to see how that
actually stacks up in our own testing
due to go on sale towards the end of the
year and Sony reckons it will be about
two hundred and twenty nine euros
although that will of course depend on
whereabouts you live I'm Andrew Hall the
C net and this is the Sony SmartWatch 3</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
