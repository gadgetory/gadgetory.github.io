what's the computer
I pad in a tree my ass oh alright what's
happening Brian Tong here and welcome to
the Apple buy you know the drill its
everything good and bad inside the world
of Apple the big news
Apple announced that the new iMac Pro
will be available on Thursday Friday the
14th and if you're a badass youtuber
like marques Brownlee or Jonathan
Morrison you got a first look before
anyone else now in their first
impressions they both test the new 10
core Intel Xeon based iMac Pro with the
Geekbench multi-core score of over 37
thousand four hundred which is 93%
faster than the latest 27-inch 5k iMac
Brownlee says only eight core and ten
core models will be available on the
14th with the 18 core I Mac Pro and a
new 14 core configuration available
sometime early next year
yeah it's a lot of power with a real
sleek design that's quiet but you're
obviously getting no upgrade ability
starting at four thousand nine hundred
and ninety nine dollars which is pretty
comparable to similarly specked out
systems on the PC side now I think I've
ranted enough about how the iMac pro is
the clearest example to me where the
leadership stop listening of what their
pro customers wanted and felt you know
what this is what people want we're
making an iMac Pro so we'll see how it
does as we wait for a rethought Mac Pro
that will be modular and upgradable in
the future something pros really want
like four years plus later all right you
know app will always have to surprise
with something new with the iMac Pro as
well and lo and behold they are blessing
us with our first ever Apple black USB
to lightning cable that's news to you
unless you go to this online store I
just heard about called Amazon which
just sold them forever with over 51,000
customer reviews now the other big story
of the week Apple acquired Shazam the
music and TV show recognition service
for around four hundred million dollars
according to TechCrunch it's their
biggest high-profile purchase since the
three billion dollar beats acquisition
in 2014 Shazam is already integrated
into Apple music and Siri already
identifies songs thanks to Sue's am
integration as far back as iOS 8 so
expect them to bring it even closer into
the Apple ecosystem but if you're using
Spotify or Android or other non
platforms what Apple pull the plug on
you hopefully not so maybe they'll bring
something new like an always-on display
that can identify songs wherever you are
and show them to you oh yeah just like
the pixel - now don't shoot the
messenger I'm just speaking the truth
Apple says we have exciting plans in
store and we look forward to combining
with Shazam now Apple has also released
another update this time it's iOS eleven
point two point one yeah it's another
one
this time it fixes the bug that allowed
unauthorized access to home connect
acessories like smart locks and if
you're a sprint customer on Iowa's 11.2
and weren't able to use Wi-Fi calling
recently that affected iPhones all the
way from the six and up to the eighth
plus Sprint recently released a carrier
update that appears to have solved that
problem all right Phil Schiller our
buddy Phil was recently interviewed by T
three the uk-based tech magazine and he
talked about the iPad pro as a tablet or
a Mac replacement what we've learned
truthfully is that it's both and that
depends on the user for some people
iPad pro is a replacement for their
computer the way you mostly hear about
this is people say I use a computer at
my desk or I use a notebook at my desk
but when I travel I travel just with my
iPad pro it is so great in that
situation and I agree it's my primary
device when I'm traveling but you can't
expect everyone to drop the chatter for
a computer and an iPad pro now in the
interview Schiller also referred to the
iPad pro as a computer on several
occasions Phil Phil come on
that goes completely against your latest
TV commercial what's a computer
and you know what that's a bad apple now
no word if Phil has used an iPad in a
tree I wouldn't recommend it Johnny I've
is back to retake direct control of the
Apple design team after taking on the
role of chief design officer and
overseen the construction of the massive
Apple Park during that time we've seen
some questionable things like the Apple
battery case which when flipped around
looks like the iPhone tends not like
look at that thing it's the same now
will that mean that notch will be gone
in the next iPhone design most likely
not CH and here's a fun story Google
released what was trending in 2017
with their most searched terms of the
year and in a surprise the iPhone 8 was
the second most searched term followed
by the iPhone X or 10 now my guess is
that the eight beat out the ten because
that's how people were referring to it
for most of the year and totally
unrelated to the iPhone the most
searched song was despots Ito dad Spa
Seto all right let's get to the winners
of our Mophie wireless charging base
giveaway I asked you all what fired me
up the most about Apple's latest TV ad
and it was you know a little tricky but
I'm sure you put it together right now
the worst part about that ad was iPad
Barbe using it in a tree come on like I
clapped it out almost all the YouTube
comments were completely wrong so
congrats go out to Apple byte nation's
email winners Silvia parks and on
Twitter

in touch and for all you that are losers
