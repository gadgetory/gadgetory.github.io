now and then now still I spend a lot of
time behind the wheel of our 2007
Chevrolet Aveo it was yellow and it was
crap but I kind of liked it in spite of
that so it's only fitting that they've
stuck me behind the wheel of this car
this week it's the 2013 Chevrolet Sonic
RS it's not the spiritual successor it's
the actual successor to the avail it's
sold under the Aveo badge in the world
market now if that yellow car was the
limit I guess this bright red one is the
tomato I'll call it let's get behind the
wheel and check it out the fondant comes
with a lot of small touches on the
outside that also make it look pretty
sporty out here in the back we've got
these tail lamps that kind of look like
aftermarket tail lamps from about 10
years ago kind of date it but I don't
mind it I've also had a lot of fun
watching people look around for the door
handles here they're actually integrated
into the window which kind of hide them
other touches that are specific to the
RS include these larger alloy wheels
that are actually a dark color which
kind of looked again cool and
aftermarket and around front we've got
fog lights and again headlights that
kind of have it a sort of aftermarket
headlamp feel now in the cabin we've got
a lot of neat little touches that sort
of speak to the RSS sporty message we've
got these RS sport seats with embossing
on the actual seat and a little bit of
embroidery on the back of those RS logos
and red trim everywhere that you look
and we've also got this motorcycle
inspired gauge package that's supposed
to look like the sort of gauge pod on a
sport motorcycle with a big digital
speedometer right there and a large
large tachometer on the other side one
of the other things the RS model also
comes with is yet another variant of
Chevy MyLink system this is the third
variant that we've seen in the 2013
model year vehicle you go into the
different menus you've got your audio
sources which includes am/fm Sirius XM
satellite radio you've also got USB for
audio and pictures it also says video
but I haven't gotten any codecs to play
on this particular model the end
interesting thing about this version of
my link is that it works very well with
apps on your smartphone you see we've
got Pandora we've also got bring Oh
which is actually a navigation app that
you can install on your Android or iOS
phone and when you connect an Android
phone via bluetooth you get all of that
connectivity so I can pop into Pandora
and it'll actually open the app on my
phone
sign in to my account and start playing
songs from the last custom Pandora
station that I've chosen and then I'll
actually also even have access to thumbs
up and thumbs down and then I can pop
into the menu here and view the rest of
my custom stations that I've already
preset we pop back into the smartphone
link and going to bring go and what it
does is it doesn't exactly mirror the
interface on the phone it gives you a
sort of custom car interface it'll allow
you to do things like search for
destinations enter addresses and get
those turn-by-turn navigation the
interesting thing about bring go is that
it's a $50 app that you install on your
phone and you get locally stored maps
and turn-by-turn navigation as opposed
to buying like an 800 or 1200 dollar
navigation option that's a very
interesting way to keep costs down on
this really inexpensive car and give the
owners the sort of tech that they want
underneath these Sonic's short hood
there's not a ton of space in the engine
bay but that's okay it's got a teeny
tiny little engine here this is the 1.4
liter turbocharged Ecotec engine and
it's got about 138 horsepower but the
base 1.8 liter also has 138 horsepower
what you're getting here actually is an
eco engine in performance guys you get
148 pound-feet of torque which is more
than the base engine so it's a little
bit more get up and go but this isn't
really a fast engine now when equipped
with the manual transmission the APA
tells us you only get about 34 miles per
gallon on the highway 27 miles per
gallon in the city and that evens out to
about 30 miles per gallon all around now
I've only got about 25 and change out of
this engine and that's because I didn't
actually realize that there wasn't any
power to be had and I've been revving
the crap out of it all week now we
called our 2007 Chevrolet Aveo the lemon
because well it was yellow and it was
crap the sonic isn't crap it's actually
a pretty good it's got an interesting
engine that turbocharged engine makes
just enough power but like I said
earlier don't fool yourself into
thinking that it's a high-performance
engine just because you've got a turbo
badge on there 138 horsepower is just
enough power for a vehicle of this size
and it's pretty high up in the power
band so you've got to actually rev the
crap out of it to get access to it what
I find weird is the gearing which is a
little bit odd particularly in
stop-and-go traffic or in a when tooling
around the city we often find myself in
a weird no-man's land between first and
second gear where first gear is just
maybe a little too many revs make it a
little too much noise a little too jerky
and second gears maybe just not enough
power to keep the vehicle moving and I
find myself constantly going back and
forth and back and forth between first
and second gear got to do a lot of
shifting in this car if you want to have
any amount of fun with it
now one thing that the sonic RS does
really well though is handle the
suspension is actually pretty well
sorted out for a cheap Chevy car it's
really good turn in the the sort of
initial like responsiveness of the
handling is pretty good there's not a
lot of feedback that you get through the
steering wheel but that's kind of par
for the course in this day of electronic
power steering not sure if this vehicle
is actually equipped with it or not but
I wouldn't be surprised I'm not feeling
a lot through the wheel but I am getting
a pretty good seat-of-the-pants field
through the suspension which is firm not
punishing I think 16 year old me would
love this car but 16 year old me didn't
really know better 16 year old me was
happy with a 1990 Toyota Camry and be as
giddy as a schoolgirl in this now Athena
chose the Chevrolet Aveo we're looking
for a tech car for our stereo installs
because it was the cheapest car in
America in 2007 when we bought it
now the sonic is no longer the cheapest
car that Chevy makes Barbie it's not
cheapest car on the market anymore but
it is still pretty cheap starts at 14 70
85 for the entry-level hatchback model
now our RS steps above that with a lot
of nice amenities and touches features
but it still only tipped the scales at
twenty thousand one hundred and eighty
five dollars and there are no options to
add on top of that unless you count the
bring go app for navigation that's only
about 50 or 60 bucks other than that
what you see is pretty much what you get
and as long as you're looking to look
sporty and maybe not drive too quick
what you get isn't that bad</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
