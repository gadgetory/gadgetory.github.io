has brought he's with Intel and this is
the Segway personal transport by the
company nine bots and it also is not
just this not just a personal you know
transportation device it's also a robot
and that's and that's where the Intel
magic comes in to right alright so if
you tell us a little bit about this yes
so you are all familiar with the
transporters we all love them
yeah you take them to the park and we
take it to the ride but what's neat
about this is addition of human-like
sensing and understanding with intel
realsense technology okay so I actually
brought a little goodie to show you here
the audience you are showing it for the
first time today premiering on special
intel realsense module that's specially
designed for robots and drones and with
this the robots and machines are able to
see the world in three dimensions
understand the world recognize humans
follow them and then navigate by itself
so it doesn't run into this when you're
not writing it this transforms into a
robot around the house and the robot
uses this technology to not run into
things because it can it can understand
a process quickly that there is a table
there a wall there and what else can do
besides just know that there's a wall in
front of it right so let me explain some
use motives on why you'd care sure why
you'd love such a device so besides
being transporter let's say you have
taken it to the park and you want to
take a little walk our robots have an is
blink and he's waking up morning yeah so
it's just transforming itself from being
a transporter into a personal robot so
when you are in a park and you want to
take a little walk the robot can
recognize you and follow you like your
dog does recognize me Bridget yes okay
and then you do not just follow anybody
else random and walk out but you'll
actually stay locked on you and follow
you like your dog does today so that's
in the park
imagine in the home yeah so as a
personal robot in the home it's able to
go and answer the door bells for you and
recognize who's there because you have
trained that robot to recognize your
friends
right your personal little robot it can
help you carry luggage have you weights
a lot of different things that you want
a personal robot to do you wanna answer
in your door can you expand on that
because to me that would you know freak
out my friends yeah imagine the future
where you are letting people in because
you know them because you recognize them
right so now if the robot can perform
the same function with very high
accuracy its able to recognize people
and you have given the permission to
come in I guess if you know you're
having a party and people are coming
over you'll understand by the door all
right it could be like your little
Jarvis I guess I would be okay with well
we all look familiar with a little bit
fit dogs in our homes or cats
yeah very soon I'm sure that we'll get
very familiar with having personal
robots in our homes as well all right so
it recognizes my body recognizes you
know all these people what about
somebody it doesn't recognize that the
Canadian robot has been designed to be
friendly all right but come and report
to you that hey there is somebody at the
door that I don't recognize right we
should check this guy out
okay how much of a I mean smart home
tech is a big deal at the show always
what what else does this kind of has it
fit into the whole puzzle of the smart
home tech I mean not only see just a
buddy you can ride but like will you
talk to other devices this is a very
good question you bring up in fact we
are very excited about this particular
platform because the Intel's
collaborated with Segway to make it an
open platform what that means the few
functions that I've explained are the
ones that you've already thought about
but because the developers can actually
build a lot of different things on it as
an open platform we envision that this
would become a hub of your home where it
can communicate with other smart devices
inside your home be a control function
for other smart devices not an connected
device when you say it's an open
platform there's there's you know
software software out there that lets
other developers sort of take and say
hey we see a viable application for our
product to interface with the relay
plans to first distribute a developer
platform yeah and the hands of software
developers who can build
use models beyond the few that in turn
segue I don't know collaborate to build
very by the time the product comes to
market we hope there will be many
compelling use models for it so in terms
of actual as a people as a person mover
what uh you know I know maybe you can't
speak exactly on behalf of segue but
from you know what we used to see with
segue putting out where has that sort of
technology improved so for that are
definitely referring to segue because
they are definitely the leaders in the
world of of transporter robots and
they're improving that technology as
well in terms of how easy it is to use
in fact you'll be surprised how easy it
is to use yeah we had complete strangers
who have come and never used
Segway robots try this out and very
comfortable but it's the new stuff that
we're adding the intelligence finally
it's able to recognize the world in 3d
recognized its users plus all the new
intelligent functions that are adding to
it which is making it a really a special
device right very cool so are we gonna
get more of a writing demo is that are
we able to get that it has a voice
interface bother we are challenged here
because of the lot of interference of or
less but we have shown a demonstration
of this in our CEOs keynote at CES where
you're able to voice interface with it
give it commands and it understands and
speaks back to you right obviously it
follows you when it's in the robot mode
yeah now right now it's robot mode but
if some wants to get on and ride it it
had to kind of go back to like we would
switch gears completely put a button so
it will go back to the transporter mode
and we in fact right before this segment
we had somebody riding it out do we have
Lee here so here we go
the transformation is great are we
slowly going down down so once it's gone
to the transporter mode now we can just
pretty quick transfer and it's like a
buddy that travels with you yeah
absolutely
I'm not it's got a bunch of LEDs sort of
constantly buzzing around is there
beyond just sort of looking cool is
there sort of functionality that
so that's the if we consider the sensor
and the processing technology to be
hardware
yeah and understanding to be software we
consider this to be the art how do you
make sure that the device comes across
friendly to you sure right the way
you'll notice that it has eyes right
blinking and looking cute and when
you're having a conversation with it it
will look cute and connect with you so
all of the lights that you see on this
and the display with face and eyes are
designed for it to be friendly and we
continue to learn more about what in
what humans feel personal and
personalised I'm sure continued improved
us very good some of them are obviously
indicators to tell you whether the
batteries and spray but then more it's
the personalization of space your CES it
also grows arms that can do my dishes
for us you know so like yeah so we can
we can actually in the in in tell CEOs
keynote I've shown that we can add arm
story and the robot said Wow what is my
arms awesome and just like in the
software applications we expect
innovations because this will be an open
platform we expect people to come up
with accessories right arm is just one
thing platform mentality as well think
of you have heavy crush on you and you
wanted to carry it for you people will
come up with platforms to be attached
great robot pet slave I know all about
that well thank you so much for coming
and I appreciate it and they give you
showing off your very cool Segway robot
