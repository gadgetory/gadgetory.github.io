government may be peeping through your
webcam I'm Bridget Carey and this is
your cnet update smartphone theft is a
growing problem and to counter this
crisis we're seeing companies invent new
methods of protection to deter thieves
like a phone that will self-destruct
aircraft manufacturer Boeing is making a
phone for the world of espionage it's
codename black and it will erase all
data and deactivate if anyone tries to
tamper with the phone or pry it open now
many details about this smartphone are
confidential because it's for government
agencies and companies involved with
defense and Homeland Security you gotta
wonder if blackberry is worried about
the competition because they were the
ones known for security and on the topic
of governments and privacy it turns out
that Britain's spy agency with the help
of the US government snapped photos from
the webcams of 1.8 million yahoo users
and most of those folks were not
suspected of any wrongdoing this is just
the latest report from The Guardian that
reveals details from the secret
documents leaked by Edward Snowden these
government agencies were collecting
photos from webcams of yahoo users and
they said it was for facial recognition
experiments as well as to monitor
existing suspects and discover new
targets of interest yahoo says they had
nothing to do with this and yahoo told
the Guardian that this is quote a whole
new level of violation of our users
privacy moving on to later news let's
talk about video games some online
gameplay features will disappear from
older Nintendo game systems the original
nintendo wii and the portable nintendo
DS and dsi will no longer have access to
multiplayer matchmaking and leaderboards
on May twentieth offline play will still
be available and online play will still
work for the newer Wii U and 3ds systems
and here's a new fitness gadget to keep
an eye on it's called move and it takes
fitness tracking a step further by
offering real time coaching feedback it
knows what you're doing such as boxing
or running and if you put the sensor on
your wrist it'll count your jabs put it
on your snake
it can measure things like your landing
impact if you attach it to golf clubs
well they could offer tips on how to
improve your swing and of course there
are achievements to share it sounds too
good to be true because it doesn't exist
yet it's asking for funding on its
website and it wants to release the
product this summer it would like to
sell the trackers for 120 dollars a
piece that's your tech news update you
