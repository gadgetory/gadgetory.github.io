appliances and right now we're taking a
first look at the Chamberlain Wi-Fi
garage door opener
we're in my garage where I installed two
of these units with the help of our
technical editor Steve Conway they have
one importer horsepower motors also a
backup battery to power the unit in case
the power goes out and you can get in
and out of your house without having to
use the manual release you would
essentially get this device if you
wanted to update your garage door opener
completely if your system is pretty
ancient like the ones I had you
definitely would get the benefit of
having smart connectivity as well as a
compact and a very silent drivetrain so
what do you get with all this smart home
smart phone connectivity basically what
you do is you just open the app you have
garage door openers that you can see you
can have a map to different locations I
have them connected to my home and I've
got a right and a left one you all you
have to do is just press the little icon
here for the garage door opener and the
garage and the doors will open and close
you also get alerts if any of these open
whenever you set you can have it send
you an alert like an email or app wide
notification for when they open and
close at any time you can also create
rules to basically have the app alerts
you either by sending you an email or a
general notification through the app to
your phone when the garage doors open or
closed either within a specific time
frame or at any time if you need to know
when that happens
so an added safety feature that's
included in the Chamberlin Wi-Fi garage
door opener is that when you actually
activate the app and close the garage
door from the app and that's remotely
it'll actually beep and flash a warning
light and close within 9 seconds just in
case there's anyone standing in the way
you'll also find two sockets for two
light bulbs you can put in leds or cfls
whatever you want to do they're
connected to motion sensors which will
activate the lights when they detect
motion which is very cool if you don't
want to have to run to the switch to
activate the lights you just activate as
soon as you get out of your car one of
the things I find a little bit tricky
about the mic you app is that it's
difficult to tell which devices are
linked to what location especially if
you want to add multiple devices to the
same location in my case I accidentally
deleted my home location and had to
reinstall the app with the devices that
I wanted to add all over again and even
have multiple times and that's something
that it is a pain thanks for watching

product as well as others at cnet.com
