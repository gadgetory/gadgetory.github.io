welcome to the Apple by for everything
good and bad inside the world of Apple
we have stories and of course the
winners of our logitech ipad keyboard
giveaway so let's get to the show and
according to reports from Japan sharp
one of apple's primary display partners
will begin manufacturing LCD panels for
the iphone 5s beginning in june it was
expected to start production in March
but we talked about the rumor delays
from the fingerprint sensor tech in
previous episodes now cnet is also
reporting that production of the display
for the retina iPad Mini should start in
june or july according to NPD
DisplaySearch analysts LG is believed to
be one of the major manufacturers for
the retina mini and it's reported that
samsung won't be involved in production
of the upcoming mini or the one after
that it's still expected to bring a 7.9
inch screen with four times the pixels
and double the resolution but both of
these production timetables fall in line
with Tim Cook's announcement that we
shouldn't expect any new hardware until
fall and for all of you who keep asking
if you should wait to get a mini the
answer is absolutely wait now I never
thought the current mini was even worth
it in the first place alright websites
and developers have been seen low-level
hits from iOS 7 devices over time but
last week a significant surge hits sites
like macrumors and more now the sites
haven't seen the same type of spikes
with mac OS 10 hello kitty yet but it
indicates iOS 7 is getting closer and
closer to prime time now mobile website
on swype was actually able to analyze
what iOS 7 beta testers were looking at
and the major topics that surfaced were
finding out what turntable to buy how to
take selfie videos with vine and kid
cudi's latest album indicud so the
average Apple beta tester basically
looks like this
alright let's check out some cool stuff
that's been revealed on the apple patent
side future iPhones could come with
invisible buttons and slider controls
that blend into the background the
granted apple patent reveals how input
devices and display systems may become
visible when illuminated from behind
through micro perforated holes that
aren't visible to the naked eye it shows
how the invisible button or slider could
be illuminated and then used and would
appear depending on the context of how
the phone is being used it also talks
about how the entire keyboard of a
macbook could be replaced with an array
of invisible buttons so there's some
pretty cool stuff there now another
granted patent for the Cupertino kids
describes an accessory that's basically
an advanced headphone splitter and
allows each headphone to have
independent volume control independent
remote control of content and a
microphone feature where users can talk
to each other and hear each other while
watching the same video together now I
would use that to fast forward through
the naughty parts on Game of Thrones
just can't handle it an apple has put up
a new contest on the app store offering
a ten-thousand-dollar gift card for the
person who downloads the 50 billion app
from the App Store I would just hold
onto that if you win maybe sometime you
know around the fall now apples also
giving five hundred dollar gift cards to
the next 50 people who download an app
after the 50 billion so you're telling
me there's a chance yeah and just a
charity buzz update from last week
coffee with Tim Cook has now hit six
hundred and five thousand dollars with
less than a week to go that's twelve
thousand and ten jack-in-the-box tacos
alright so let's announce our winners of
the logitech ultrathin keyboard cover
contest we asked you to send us what's
the one question you would ask tim cook
if you could have coffee with the cook
so congrats go out to David Shen on
email he'd ask would you ever make a red
iphone so brian Tong can call it pink
very funny David now manish suresh kumar
on twitter he would ask what do you
think about
I in changtung the guy who owes the
Apple bite manish that's not even my
middle name like who makes up someone's
middle name well you're still a winner
and Yuki asakura would ask does apple
have any plans to make cars if so would
it have windows wow that was really bad
like really bad Yuki alright that's
gonna do it email us at the apple byte
at cnet com or tweet me at brian Tong
and will include some of your deep or
not so deep questions in the next few
shows thanks for watching we'll catch

the Apple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
