episode of the 404 it is Friday
September 16th and we've got still no
Jeff Bakalar I am Russ rustic your hosts
for one more week and then Jeff comes
back and we will continue to share
hosting duties thankfully we don't need
Jeff today we don't we've got a much
better guest and his name is Dan
Ackerman welcome Dan hello Jeff hello
good to be here you're so used to I used
to see him here dan is the editor of C
that is that still accurate like I'm a
section title they made up for me dan is
a very fancy person had seen that he's
been here for I'm gonna say 11 and chain
11 and change and they're still only
about halfway up the seniority list
pretty amazing and has been a tech
staple for as long as I certainly can
remember and thankfully we've brought
them on here we've got a bunch of stuff
to talk about right off the top I do
want to mention Dan has written a book
very fancy called the tetris effect
which is about the history of tetris
which is very very cool real quick for
the people what is the deal with this
book what's what's the lowdown you know
it really tells you the story about how
in the 80s and the Soviet Union during
the Cold War a Russian scientist created
this little program called Tetris it was
like a math experiment form to kind of
figure out how to translate these ideas
into a primitive computer it went viral
in the Soviet Union back in the 80s
that's hard nobody's got a computer you
have to like physically make a copy of a
disk and walk it over to people and then
eventually it leaked out from behind the
Iron Curtain all these Western companies
saw it and said oh maybe we can make
some money selling this nobody bothered
to send the money back to the Russians
and they decided to they said wait a
minute Soviet Union was collapsing we
need hard currency who's stealing our
stuff we gonna put together an economic
hit squad to get the money back and it's
like an international spy story but it's
all real life that's amazing that's a
good tease we I'm gonna talk about a bit
later in the show but that's a really
awesome tease for people I love this
like true crime like true crime true
history stuff that heads like way more
drama than you ever possibly imagined
because most people I think just know
Tetris from playing the game so like
having that extra layer is super wicked
and I was
jealous when you told me the idea of the
book which was like a couple years ago I
was like yes that is an amazing idea for
a book I wish I had thought of that it's
like a real-life thriller yeah history
is just so interesting fantastic
I'm also really glad that we brought you
on because it's been a very crazy week
in technology one of the craziest that I
can remember cuz it's not just like one
event that happened it was like a few
different events sort of coincided I
feel like the biggest one I would have
said Apple is still obviously the the
iPhone 7 comes out today so that's
obviously still top of mind but the one
that's sort of spread beyond the normal
tech realm is the Samsung Galaxy Note 7
I thought you were going to say the
Pokemon go bracelets that went in
Saturday that's sure that was one of the
other ones that I was gonna bring up it
really is the biggest story we're really
we're running the gamut let's start with
Samsung I've been calling it explode
gate do you think that's an accurate
description maybe just burn up gate for
an up GAID
they do not technically explode although
I keep using the term explode also yeah
I saw a video or some stills there was a
story in Florida apparently a Jeep yes
set on fire because the guy had his
phone plugged into the charger and it
just totally went up I don't know how I
mean it must be a pretty significant
fire to light a car on fire I mean look
at these phones they're gigantic if you
look at your big iPhone or your big
Samsung phone inside they're essentially
all batteries yeah and these batteries
are actually very powerful and there's
usually a very thin membrane separating
the two cells of the battery and if
there's a fault there sure it can
generate a tremendous amount of energy
in a very short period of time yeah and
and that's sort of what we're seeing I
I'm trying to remember like from a scale
of a recall I've never seen anything
like this quite this large is this I
mean not on the phone and now for safety
reasons like this we've seen problems
like antenna gate on older iPhones and
small but nothing but nothing of this
scale and nothing so badly mishandled
initially by the company they've only
really sorted it out as of yesterday
when we're recording this when they
actually finally you know had an
official recall from the Consumer
Product Safety Commission which is the
government agency that actually handles
this yeah getting in my way stupid
government trying to take my burning
technology away from me
well samsung wanted to do sort of an
unofficial
shall recall they didn't say the word of
recall they said you should return the
phone use an R word but not the word
recall and they wanted to try to just
handle it themselves let's handle it
ourselves guys and you know with phones
of burning cars up it's not the right
way to go a buddy of mine I mentioned
this on Facebook and a buddy of mine was
like oh I have a note it's fine and I
was like it might not be until it's not
sure I don't think that's a risk you
want to take I guess their officer
they're offering you a new phone right
you can get a replacement you can get a
replacement you can get a refund the
problem is they're they don't have two
and a half million new right fixed note
sevens ready to go and if they rush the
original note 7 out how fast are they
rushing these replacement ones out right
exactly so so just so I can understand
when exactly did the note 7 launch do
you remember offhand it was like second
week of August I'm gonna say ok so it's
kind of interesting that like none of
this really came up in any other review
certainly there were no reviews that was
like hey guys this car on fire oh it was
fine I checked it out it's like great so
got some tongs they've asked for all
those review units back we'd had the
messenger they're like we'll come over
and pick it up very insistent on getting
them out of people's hands they show up
in like the yellow like nuclear suit
right right right they have a big oven
mitts on ready to get it I think there
was something like 92 reported incident
said Samsung was able to say this is
probably a legit incident sure out of
whatever 2 and a half million phones
that sound like a lots a huge number
then they do in a couple of weeks 92 out
of millions it's kind of a lot all
within the first couple of weeks there's
you just reported incidents that we can
say hey these are ones that have been
officially recorded yeah that's a pretty
big rate don't you for a catastrophic
failure like this do you think they need
to kill the note line at least the
branding of the note line because of
this I get it I I feel like they won't
do that they have enough invested in it
that people will sort of look past it's
crazy these days you can say or do
almost any crazy thing and it doesn't
seem to hurt your brand it seems like
you're going else right now I feel like
you can get away with a lot
the problem is these guys they're on
this annual upgrade cycle check no
apples doing the same thing and every
year they have to have
of a new product in their flagship at
around the same time of the year whether
they have a new design or new features
or new anything so they're clearly just
shoving these things out the door and
this is the case where it wasn't ready
right do we know exactly what went wrong
here
it seems like at least one of it because
they probably have multiple any computer
any device you buy they're usually
multiple suppliers for the different
components inside it seems to me the
best evidence is that one of the
component suppliers for the battery had
a big batch of bad batteries or we're in
the most basic sense the membrane
between the two cells of the battery was
weak and it let the chemicals Mayson
kaboom bad perfet yeah it's been a it's
been crazy for Samsung which again I
think their reputation has been very
good lately for phones like a lot of
people are switching over from Apple to
Galaxy phones stuff like that did the
only guys really innovating when it
comes to design even if that's just the
curved edge around the side of the
screens people were getting excited
about that and they would say to me I'm
not gonna get the new iPhone I'm gonna
get this note seven it looks cooler and
it did yeah which is why the timing for
this could not have possibly been worse
yeah well that you mention it so
obviously the iPhone 7 comes out today
you know we've talked about it a bit on
the show the headphone thing really
really bothers me like bothers me enough
that I'm using the iPhone 6 right now I
can't see myself upgrading because of
that alone yeah obviously the other
distinctive issues are this the 7 is not
like that noticeable and I'm pretty it's
it feels like a you know 6s s
essentially right so that's obviously a
big one but but headphones man yeah I
use them everyday it's kind of the
oldest of the longest-standing
connection jack that we have that
everybody still uses I got my six plus
yeah and there's certainly no reason you
can't extend the phone these days to
three years they're well-built enough
they're modern enough the the changes
you're up to you're so incremental you
could definitely get away with three
years although I feel like Apple and
maybe Android as well but certainly
Apple has a bit of a reputation of aging
their phones based on the OS so iOS 10
came out this week I haven't upgraded
yet because that's my concern it's
neither of I if I just keep upgrading
it'll it'll just slow what sort of
King phones immediately go don't get the
upgrade right away give it six hours the
first guy in line because you're gonna
break your phone yeah they say get the
dot upgrade the you know ten point one
or whatever but yeah I don't think I'm
going to all hold on for as long as I
can without upgrading to ten because
first of all nothing in ten again like
the seven seems to really be that
mandatory and secondly yeah I mean if
your phone is four years old then you're
running the latest OS it's not gonna run
it oh no no it was wherever you yeah and
it and the battery life will plummet and
it's just a bad idea unfortunately Apple
is crazy insistent on updating your OS
so a point where they give you that
message every single day there's no way
to stop I've looked online you can like
delete the OS but you cannot force the
phone to not download it if it's
connected to Wi-Fi it's a little bit
like the Windows 10 upgrade that people
didn't want to do exactly although
there's really no good reason not to
upgrade to Windows tariffs we have
Windows 8 yeah yeah that was a direct
improvement and with this obviously you
know Windows 10 is not bad I'm sorry iOS
10 is not bad so many tens floating
around here but for those again that
have older phones that do not want to
upgrade some option in the menu is to be
like okay I'm just don't mostly anymore
I'm good enough already that formed
stability yeah exactly very important so
yeah I mean generally you follow that
same mentality about the seven that it's
kind of just like they must be holding
something good in their hand for next
year which is gonna be the 10th
anniversary of the iPhone yeah so if
they're gonna have a big design change
push the needle forward somehow like
maybe no more home button just an
all-glass screen on the front it's like
a haptic thing or something yeah
something cool curved edges it's got to
be next year right now there's no extra
the 7 has no button as well right it's
just a flat surface with haptic sand
inside it it feels like the entire it's
almost like the the touchpad on the new
MacBook where there is there there is a
little bit of a multi-point depression
but it's not quite the same it's more
like a shift its right a little nudge
that feels like you're clicking but it
feels like the entire bottom half of the
phone is hinged yeah and clicks down I'm
sure you can get used to it very quickly
I found it very disconcerting well
that's weird
I'm sure you get used to it but yeah we
don't even need that just just make it a
touch button right presumably that helps
somewhat with the water resistance it's
gotta be water resistance those buttons
get worn out very easily you always see
them like it's sticky and stuff so to
get rid of that I guess that's a plus
yeah do we need it at all why can't we
just have the the phone screen over the
entire top surface exactly and just do
like a finger just around there to get
the home action going yeah that's the
impression I get everyone seems to be
thinking that 2017 is the year whether
it's you know celebrating the
anniversary or whether it's just Apple
knows that people feel like they've kind
of stagnated from the phone side that
it's time for a big upgrade that seems
like where it's going I'll tell you I
watched on Amazon Prime yesterday Hot
Tub Time Machine 2 and in the future it
was nonsense nonsense they have a phone
in the future where you just kind of
click on your ear and it projects out a
little hologram of who you're talking to
in front of you sure that seems like the
way to go do we really need the physical
device to hold up to our face and talk
into any more I don't know that sounds
like Google glass I'm gonna call this
the Hot Tub Time Machine 2 phone ok I
just wanna say hot tub time machine -
yeah you might be right
yeah Apple devices I'm an Apple guy what
can I say but it yeah I'm definitely
gonna be holding off for the for the
near term speaking of other more we're
gonna just march down the line generally
on this show as listeners know sometimes
we struggle on tech news sometimes tech
news isn't happening this week and all
we've got is like no problem this week
tangent but now we've got plenty this
week so this morning at about 7 o'clock
I left my comfortable borough of Queens
and headed into New York City to visit
the Nintendo World store to pick up this
and I realized we're on a podcast with
no video but I'm holding it the Pokemon
go Plus which if you've been playing
Pokemon go there might be some
percentage of people on listening
playing Pokemon go I know Dan son plays
Pokemon go and all his little friends
are all like five and six years old
they're obsessed they'd never heard of
Pokemon before and never seen the TV
show but now they know every
yeah they keep borrowing all their
parents phones running around yeah
you're gonna start getting offers like
email offers to buy that like
immediately I'm sure it seems
availability seems very low very low you
know it's hard to say cuz obviously so
it's an Intendant endo does not seem to
be in charge of the distribution
they're obviously working through the
Pokemon company and Niantic the makers
of the actual game so this is this weird
relationship they have there and so
we've been very much in the dark
regarding like whether we were gonna get
a media one or whatever it is or which
stores were getting them all the stores
seem to be in the dark so we just went
ahead and went to this they had them at
the Nintendo stage I have a lot at the
world store so I got there at around
9:00 when they open it they were open
they I guess they opened I think at 8
o'clock
Wow so we have one of our reporters
there at 8 and there was a significantly
large line probably about 50 to 100
people if it's longer than the iPhone 7
line at the Apple store cube that might
be right I think at this point those
have sort of died out but the so the
line was there she got one I got there
at 9:00 the line was maybe 15 people
deep at that point I was very close to
feel pretty big lines though so line but
by the time I got it
there was hardly anyone behind me and
they still had more or less okay if you
happen to be in New York City and you're
listening to this they may still have
them it seems like the Nintendo World
store would be the most likely spot
because otherwise I know pre-orders were
very very limited normal game stores get
very few of them now we're gonna clip
that cuz like a clip-on right well so
you have two options so it comes with
like a wristband Richmond that's how I
saw it originally yeah you can wear it
as a wristband it seems like they
realize just how awful the wristband
looked and they stopped using that for
promotional screens and stuff like that
it does come with a clip on it so
theoretically you could put it I'm
putting it in my lapel right now and
it's a belt little clip belt just like
your blackberry
you know I would say if you're
interested in not looking like a total
freak if you're above the age of say 30
you might want to just put it in a
pocket it's got a button on it and it
vibrates almost like a beeper and to do
things in the game all you have to do is
just probably poke a beeper so you will
feel it through your pocket and you can
just press the button and
collective okay stop person like that
it's actually as someone that has played
since launch I will fully admit it it's
actually pretty useful I used it for you
know you can keep your phone locked the
game doesn't have to be open which
ordinarily it does or sucks a lot of
battery life yeah yeah and it'll collect
like pokey stops as you walk by them you
could try to catch pokemon with it it
actually it's pretty useful but $40
useful that's sort of a decision you
have an Apple watch you'll be able to
get the the go version which gives you a
lot of that same functionality on the
watch you're just even dorkier you're
finally getting some mask you use you
have a Pokemon buddy yet to walk along
with you and collect candy with the
update my wife okay oh you mean the
actual bag in the game not a real-life
person yes I walk around with Bulbasaur
okay okay because I'm trying to get that
vs or unlocked
I believe me I I hear this yeah I know
Libby played your wife play but she
mostly plays for dinner for - who's our
son he face on me the other day hey do
you know what PO what Pikachu evolves
into I do I did actually I said I I know
that's right yes um I guess we had a
great FaceTime moment I think what is
fascinating is that these kids are
getting hooked into what I got hooked
into which was the first generation of
Pokemon you know all these kids in the
last six years have been like oh I got
X&amp;amp;Y or whatever the newest version was
and they know all these Pokemon but I
have no idea who they are there's like
weird ghost Pokemon and stuff like that
but he's 151 or in Grant you know you're
a little bit older than me I was I think
Pokemon the original came out when I was
like in like sixth grade or so so it was
like right in the sweet spot of it and
so I know them really so it is it's like
a cyclical it's not starting over again
a new generation it is obsessed we have
a I have a pokémon like encyclopedia
book at home we got a farms and olive
oil and get look through each one and I
have to read the names out yeah it's a
whole thing
well yeah that's Pokemon if you're not
playing it and chances are you probably
you're probably listening to this you
probably playing it's possible
and so you mentioned as before you
walked in or as you're walking in we
have one more tech centric story for us
and it's the Playstations slim which you
just got this morning yes that's right
did you arrived in a box did you take it
out of the box I have not taken it out
of the box yet one of our colleagues in
I think Singapore got one like yesterday
or the day before so he went in shot
some photos of the old version good noon
we went to the event here in New York
it's slimmer I'll give it that yeah does
what it says on the box doesn't actually
say some other body so it is the
hardware any different from the normal
PlayStation 4 right now I think it's
missing the optical audio out which is a
you know if they go on they take the
remember the ps4 used to have like a
compact flash card reader and eventually
they they took all that stuff out the
other big difference is it has software
support for HDR content yeah but I don't
think there's any HDR content yet that
will work on it right and obviously you
would need an HDR TV to take advantage
of that correct but a lot of new TVs are
just gonna come with HDR built in we're
gonna use it or not just like for years
most TVs were 3d TVs even if you never
use that function yeah I know they also
updated the controller a little bit
there's a little tweak we yeah it's
always a little flatter on the front and
you can see light through it yeah I
think it's a strip on the top rather
than those smaller not a major
improvement
I believe it's 250 is that I think it's
299 but I'll check it could be might be
250 I'm trying to remember whatever the
current price of the piece okay so
though I thought they dropped the price
but you're right it is 299 still and
then waiting the wings in November
PlayStation 4 Pro which they also talked
about in that event so you were at the
event yes what's the general consensus
about the white station for Pro is that
no one seems to know for sure who it's
for if you don't have a ps4 and you're
gonna get one your mind as well spend
the extra 100 bucks on it I guess or if
you have one you're kind of replace they
promise that it's sort of the picea
fication of consoles we have these
incremental upgrades but the same
platform yeah if you went from ps3 to
ps4 you took your whole library of games
and boxes and you threw right in the
trash yeah just like if you're updating
you know oh I want update my macbook
let's just throw it away and buy a new
one so so with this one there's a faster
graphics chip in there I think there's a
faster processor in there also the
graphics come
AMD so when you make a game now you
basically have to make two versions you
have to make the the pro version or the
regular version it's probably just
different textures and different
graphics features that turn off and on
like better shadows and lighting it
sounds like that but use the same game
code just like if you have a five
hundred dollar gaming PC or you have a
five thousand dollar gaming PC you get
the same game from Steam it'll just
render differently all right two of you
can crank up the resolution and you
could maybe get some better framerate do
4k go all do HDR but 4k is actually
getting pretty big right now the 4k is
kind of BS right they're not doing to
true 4k
you're not rooted and should render at
4k on the pro as I understand it it's an
upscaled from hey that's interesting
because if you think about it so so if
the PlayStation were Pro is $400 running
a game right now at 4k on a PC would not
run on a 400 or PC it's getting a lot
easier though I mean the graphics on PCs
have become so much more powerful 4k
gaming is it's not for everything right
now but it's actually a lot more
achievable and Nvidia and AMD of both
make great strides and last year of
making smaller versions of their chips
that are less expensive just like AMD is
like a two hundred dollar GPU that'll
run VR now yeah and that's two fairly
high resolution screens at 90 frames per
second simultaneously sure yeah it is a
little bit funny the whole 4k thing
because obviously you know we saw 3d
being like the big thing and then that
died you know I think 4k has more legs
to it and so far as it's a new
resolution and things are going that way
but I think most people maybe not in New
York City where TVs are very close to
the characters because of space concerns
but I think most people where they have
their couch in their TV visually cannot
see the difference there's a there's a
ratio of about I think it's 8 feet
filling 8 to 10 feet and you will just
not it looks like the same exact ISM we
said the same thing about blu-ray if you
had a good upscaling for you know 480
DVD player yeah it really couldn't tell
the difference between that and blu-ray
for 110 feet away it's true but the TVs
are coming with 4k screens built-in
which is good for other stuff if you
want to have like other apps and things
on there yeah I get it and they're
coming with HDR they're just gonna be
features that are there but your cable
signal is not gonna start coming in 4k
right time soon yeah
and you know I know Netflix does program
some of their shows in 4k and in HDR and
Amazon also but right now those are only
available through the TV based apps I
say they will eventually come to the
more PC and other device based apps soon
but we're not quite there yet okay and
that's what the ps4 regular slim one and
pro are waiting for these apps to
support HD are through through the apps
and obviously for game makers to make
games that support both the 4k upscaled
and the regular version and that's
assuming that your Comcast of the world
are actually letting you stream at that
sort of speed that's usually fine if you
go through the TV app I'm not blocking
you from that but if you just plug like
your if you have a laptop of the 4k
screen or I can't go to the Netflix
website and start screaming 4k or HDR or
anything like that yet yet the dream is
still alive you'll probably never
noticed you know it's like oh though
it's brighter and darker at the same
time you know what I think makes a much
bigger difference having an OLED screen
yeah love those I just tested the first
couple of laptops with OLED screen okay
one of which was a yoga from Lenovo a
40-inch and the other one was an alien
13 inch Alienware gaming laptop okay
with an OLED screen amazing so where are
you seeing that most in the blacks are
you seeing it it's like it's like you
have a junky old TV here and a super
fancy nice-looking TVs for you next to
it you just go wow it's a clarity thing
it's like right it's contrast the blacks
are the biggest the the tests you can do
is you look at the bezel around the
screen or in a black scene and if you
can't really see the difference between
the black part of the screen and the
black bezel right that's the OLED
difference right there okay but it's one
of those things you really do have to
see in person yeah are you paying a
significant premium for an 11 you know a
hundred fifty bucks maybe on one of
these laptops might be a little bit more
eventually we'll see more laptops with
them right now they're not really making
them in screen sizes bigger than like 13
or 14 inches I think just three you can
get right now the Alienware the lenovo
and samsung actually makes a tablet with
an AMOLED screen which is essentially
the same thing do you know what the
what's the Alienware called it's just
the Alienware 13 you know and it's it's
one option that has an OLED screen for I
think $1600
I was talking to a friend of mine
about gaming hardware PC Harvick and the
common occurrence of gaming PC hardware
being named the lamest possible name of
course it'll be like predator or extreme
3000 yeah and things look like tanks
they look like yeah they look like space
tanks and giant treads on them and the
marketing comments on there they're the
marketing quotes on their website for
dominate it's a game with our mega chill
cooling channel B's it's horrible I just
want like I guess make anywhere I'm glad
that they're naming it like kind of team
but it's still you've got like the
glowing alien eyes long I just want like
a gaming hardware machine that is just
like a plain box yeah and it plays video
games yeah who does that well Velocity
Micro does that well they make just
plain boxes that look pretty good Falcon
Northwest makes like little things like
a frank box they're just normal
nondescript looking things so I feel
like a frag box that is true you got a
good point there okay well I think
that's it for tech stuff right cuz I do
want to talk more about the book alright
you know for people that have not gone
through the process of writing their own
book and actually getting it published
but just baseline it like you came up
with the idea how did this sort of come
about how did it actually happen yeah we
were casting around for an interesting
sort of nonfiction story to tell there
okay shall we
so hey my agent did okay so you've got a
book agent yes okay and have you worked
with him for a while yeah so we worked
through a couple of ideas she and I and
she said you know what you should do a a
non nonfiction book that relates to your
experience and somehow I wanted to find
something that had some historical
context not to current events II sure
cuz I work in news I don't want to be
like current events and we kind of
workshopped a few ideas about
interesting things in history they had
some sort of tech connection and I
remembered this story for back when
Libya and I and a bunch of other people
you probably know did this show called
play value which was a web show about
video game history it was like MTV
talking heads like best whatever spouse
yeah one of the episodes was on the
history of Tetris I was like that's kind
of an interesting story so I did some
research what I realized was it's not
really a hit game history story that's
all in there it's really it
startup story except for instead of the
Silicon Valley startups we talked about
today it's a startup from you know Cold
War Soviet Union Russia right where a
guy improbably created this huge
technological hit that's probably the
most important technology to come out of
the Soviet Union since Sputnik sure I
was like wow that really got some
relevance and we have all this tension
with Russia now again and this is the
Cold War so lots of Western versus
Russia tension back then I'm like
there's another great parallel and it's
just a story about a bunch of
interesting characters guys like Alexey
Pajitnov the guy created ten trous Hank
Rogers who's the guy who sort of brought
it to the Gameboy and and like travelled
the world to make it work guys like
Howard Lincoln who was the famous
Nintendo lawyer who everyone has great
stories about menara Arakawa the guy who
started Nintendo of America and and made
Miyamoto you know the figure he is today
and basically got the NES into people's
hands in the US so I said this is a
great startup story about great
characters and that's why I knew it
really it would really work what was
Alexey doing like before like was he
made trying to make other games and this
just happened there was a computer
researcher at the Russian Academy of
Sciences and he was actually working on
this is like nineteen you know eighty
three eighty four some very high-end
stuff he was working on artificial
intelligence he was working on voice
recognition things that we don't have
mastered today and he was doing it on
these computers that were so primitive
they were like Soviet knockoffs of
American computers for like ten years
before that's like the 70 yeah and
that's like you know they had punch
cards and stuff you know so he figured
out how to recreate in his spare time
one of these little puzzle games people
used to play where you fit the blocks
into a box called pentominoes yeah on
his computer his his it was called the
electronica 60 and had no graphics you
couldn't even make blocky Tetris
graphics on it he had used to bracket
shapes
I was asking like ASCII art basically
sir the original Tetris is basically
ASCII art black and white and he said
hey check this out and his friends all
liked it then they even had someone some
programs that they had made they're like
maybe we could like sell these and then
like oh wait a minute we live in a
communist country and there's no owning
anything much less intellectual property
software rights also making this in a
spare time might not
we've approved of doing it work stuff
where computers when they found out when
the Russian government the Soviet
government found out that this was
something they could possibly sell
that's the first thing you did was say
thanks for alexei by the way communism
we own this all see you later right
exactly and they went and tried to get
some money for it did that was that so
that was before it became a worldwide
phenomenon was Russia knew hey we could
actually sell this some some some very
clever Western software publishers and
salespeople
ran across it one guy found it in
Hungary at a school there hungry was
behind the Iron Curtain but it was a
more open society you could go and do
trade there Rubik's Cube also came from
Hungary another another Iron Curtain a
game that kind of made spread people
would actually make a copy there's like
ten people in Moscow with computer back
in 1984 and they go oh here I made a
copy of this game for you check it out
like sneakernet it over to something you
have to walk it over and eventually
somebody sent a copy to this computer
school and hungry and a guy named Robert
Stein who is a Hungarian immigrant to
the UK you came back to find cheap
software to buy in Hungary and resell in
the West said oh this looks awesome
I wonder if I can license this and he's
like hey Russia know about this game and
nobody really get back to him it's like
I'm just gonna start selling right yeah
cuz who's gonna stop it and then he
sublicense it and there was sublicense
all around the world and there's a
Russian so he took over like full
licensing rights just cuz yeah he sent
some they used to call them telex it's a
very early form of fax for the Russians
saying hey let's do a deal and they were
like we could talk about this and he
took that as a as a thumbs-up to start
doing business it's like a dory I got
this taken care of I'll send you the
money back eventually and then before
you know it mirrorsoft which was a big
company at the time in spectrum holobyte
which was another big company at the
time did licenses for pc stuff and then
atari got into it and sega and all these
other companies bought sub licenses for
either pc or console or arcade versions
around the world or the washington's
didn't know any of this was going on you
eventually end up with a very
complicated situation where three three
different rupes of people are racing to
moscow at the same time to finally
actually get a real signed deal yeah for
this stuff and who would they even get
it from if effectively you know he
didn't own it they eventually figured
out that they needed some
would he look after these rights and try
to get the money right so the Russians
gave it to an obscure trade group named
elorg which is like the initial to have
four electro trans Morcha cars there's
something Russian but if you spelled all
that elorg it's like a James Bond doing
organization and they were very
mysterious partially because they didn't
know what they were doing the rest of
the time they were selling knock-off
soviet scientific calculators that
didn't work right which was the purpose
of a scientific calculator so our buddy
Hank Rogers who was the
japanese-american dutch publisher who
nintendo sent behind the iron curtain on
a secret mission to get the rights for
their top-secret project the gameboy
that nobody knew about yet he had to go
to moscow on a tourist visa and then
literally search moscow to try to find
these allure guys and get an audience
with him and he pulled it off he just
walks in the door and said hey i want to
talk to you guys about tetris after like
literally like hiring local fixers to
help him find the offices and stuff and
knowing that robert stein the guy from
Hungary and Kevin Maxwell the son of
Robert Mack so who's a big UK media
Baron like the Rupert Murdoch of his day
we're both coming to Moscow the same
week to try to sign the same deal and
he's like I don't even know what the
address is I gotta find these guys yeah
so so Nintendo essentially got the
rights and that's how the gameboy
phenomenon there there were a lot of
places where could have gone horribly
off the rails during those couple of
weeks of Moscow but eventually they said
okay you you can put this on this on
this new device called the Gameboy and
that's that killer app that perfect
marriage of hardware and software I mean
you can't think of any better pairing
than that super primitive Gameboy right
which was sort of Apple like in its in
its minimalism yeah they do could be
always a primitive when it came out you
could have made a much more advanced
handheld at the time the atari lynx came
out right around the same time and that
had a color screen a higher resolution
what nintendo did in their R&amp;amp;D lab was
they stripped it down to the bare
minimum monochromatic screen low
resolution just the two buttons and the
little d-pad and make it run on double-a
batteries and those were the the tenants
that made it successful what game is
gonna work like that
turns out tetris did right and very very
little and they sold like 43 million you
know
combo packages of Game Boy and Tetris it
was the Pokemon go it's time the
parallels are so interesting between
Pokemon go and Tetris because they're
both games that work internationally
without any real translation needed you
don't need to know anything about them
they don't really have a storyline
Pokemon go I guess has kind of a
storyline but you can just ignore all
that or but you learn them just by
picking up and playing right and anybody
can just pick up pokemons go and you'll
figure it out in a few minutes but they
don't come and tell you what it is you
just have to figure it out with Tetris
you just pick it up and you figure it
out what would the subreddit for Tetris
look like back in the day like blocks
let's see right see where a vert piece
that is why you cannot have
mathematically an infinite game of
Tetris mathematicians that
mathematicians have figured out there's
a chapter on the math Tetris in the
world that you they a game with modal
most likely end at around 69 thousand
pieces no matter what because you would
eventually statistically get enough Z
blocks in a row that you could never get
rid of them every top out of the game I
assume that they've had like it must be
a pretty easy it's actually pretty tough
because there are so many different
shapes and you could put all these
different variations in on how fast they
fall and whether you can do the little
cheat swivel move when people under
something so there's a there's a ton of
variations on it I assume I don't know
if you went into it in the book but I
assume that there's some sort of
tournament like right here or king of
colonies there is I just got an email
from the guy who runs the tensions World
Championship yesterday that's super
interesting too that there's less of
that in the book yeah it's really more
like this Cold War spy thriller thing
with some timeouts to talk about the
science all the different scientists who
have used Tetris and it's addictive
qualities and how much used to treat
PTSD and stuff sure but but there are
tournaments that go on today it's like
very king of Kong like yes yeah a lot of
personality a lot of character that
sounds awesome this is totally up my
alley as a book I'm sure some people
listening or like yes this is the book I
would totally read where can people get
it Amazon Barnes Noble anywhere you get
books there's even an audiobook version
there's hardcover after you know I went
into the shed offices in New York and
read
the audio book it's like taking a
seven-hour road trip with me I'll just
be in your ear was that tough to record
for that it was where I have so much
respect for people who do audiobooks out
it was incredibly physically taxing to
sit up straight and not move and project
your voice out for like we did like
three full days of recording I was
passed out at the end of the first day
it's rich it's really tough yeah well
done sir thank you thank you one of my
favorite things was getting people to
write a little blurb on the back of the
book you have the Arabs and I had my
kind of wish list the people I really
wanted to get and I got most of those
guys Ernest Cline who wrote ready player
wise yeah he said it's a page turning
block stacking globe-trotting thriller
history books I'm so happy that he wrote
me this nice blur yeah I got Steve
Wozniak that's my favorite quote he's a
huge fan yeah it turns out that he's
like a legendary Tetris fan so he did it
Doug rushkoff is another great author
who wrote me a blow-up so I'm super
happy that's awesome well again
congratulations very super awesome thank
you thank you and if you're gonna go to
New York comic-con yeah I'm gonna be
there on Thursday October 6 doing a
panel cool it's very crowded there it's
almost like they have to fit the people
in like Tetris blocks oh my God look at
that carryover well well thank you again
Dan that's gonna do it for us here at
the 404 I always forget how Jeff ends
the show but there's something about
high-tech and lowbrow probably somewhere
in there sounds about right
um we will be back next week Jeff will
be back from vacation so it'll be me and
him and maybe another special guest but
in the meantime thank you so much Dan
thank you for letting me come here and
plug my book respect my pleasure and
thank you so much at home for listening
we'll be back next week</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
