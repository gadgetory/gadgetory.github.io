standing next to the KitchenAid 5 speed
diamond blender this is a really nice
blender it retails for 149 dollars on
the company's website which you may
think is a lot of money to spend for a
blender and you would be correct so the
real question is why would you spend 150
dollars on a blender if you don't need
to there are a lot of nice features
about the KitchenAid that have kind of
brought me over onto its side such as
the 60 ounce pitcher which is really
generous and the interface is really
easy to use they don't overcomplicate
things with this blender it's easy to
figure out exactly what setting you need
to use depending on what you're putting
into the blender and we definitely put
it through its paces in our testing we
tested everything from ice crushing to
smoothies to making almond flour and
then turning that almond flour into
almond butter and I was really impressed
and honestly quite surprised that the
KitchenAid performed on par with some of
the more expensive blenders like the
Vitamix and the ninja and the Breville
this isn't an especially large blender
in terms of the width that it will take
up on your countertop but it is taller
and this has a lot to do with the shape
of the pitcher we were originally
skeptical about this shape because it's
kind of old-fashioned E and that's
Kitchen AIDS hallmark in a lot of ways
is old timing kind of appliances they
look like something your grandma used to
have but the way the shape of this
blender works is that it's very narrow
at the bottom which gives the blades
full coverage preventing things from
getting stuck now certainly because
there are squared corners you will get
some food particles that are wedged
under the blades and may not get blended
but it was far far less than I expected
so if 150 dollars for a blender doesn't
frighten you off as a sticker price the
KitchenAid would be a really great
choice and we were really happy with it
if you have Kitchen Aid mixers or a big
fan of KitchenAid products they don't
think you could go wrong adding this to
your line of appliances but if you're
looking for something more
budget-friendly the Hamilton Beach
smoothie smart is also a really
excellent choice for seen at with the
KitchenAid 5 speed diamond blender I'm
Katie
