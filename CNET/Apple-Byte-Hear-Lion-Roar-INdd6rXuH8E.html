the alpha x for all the good and bad
inside the world of apple the ipad 2 is
now on sale I can hear you all the way
from here squealing like little girls in
line I'm on a plane in you'll be getting
yours before I do but we have plenty of
news plus a detailed look at Mac OS 10
line for all of you and it's purdy now
for I've had to users and wrapping their
shiny new toy this is the thinnest
tablet we've seen what is it the fastest
Cena was able to run SunSpider
JavaScript benchmarks comparing the ipad
2 to an original ipad running iOS 4.3
and found the newest iPad runs only one
and a half times as fast and that many
of the speed improvements for the
original come with optimization from the
latest iOS now we know dual-core
processors will definitely be able to
handle tasks more efficiently there's
more to the products performance ingest
raw power but original ipad owners won't
have to feel like they're really left
too far behind now there's also new
evidence in iOS 4.3 that indicates the
next-gen iphone 5 will be using a dual
core processor and it will be the same
a5 processor used in the ipad 2 now I'm
glad someone else took the time to sort
through all this code but the evidence
was found in the kernel file for device
codenamed n 94 AP which is believed to
be the iphone 5 and they better bring
back those multitasking gestures that
were in the developers build because why
take them away that's a bad apple ah
alright but could this be what the
iphone 5 might look like a report from a
code talker as Chinese sources say Apple
will be moving back to an all-aluminum
instead of glass casing back because of
scratching and cracking issues that
we've talked about before now that the
ipad 2 is here you guys can expect to
see one of these new iphone 5 images
each week until june or july all right
enough about mobile devices so many of
you write me and say show me more about
the mac platform well you're gonna get
it with an inside peek of line with our
favorite
hey guys Bryant on here with cnet.com
and we're going to show you some of the
newest bells and whistles in the
developer version of Mac OS 10 line in
action which is expected to come out
sometime later this summer plus we're
going to also show you a lot of hidden
gems that you just haven't seen so let's
start off with a few of the sexy ones
first up is Launchpad which gives you
instant access to your apps iOS style
you can change through the launchpad
view by clicking on the icon on the dock
you can drag apps on top of each other
to create folders just like an iOS and
you can move apps around the way that
you want now there's also a lot more
multi-touch support in line so you can
pinch with four fingers to bring up the
launchpad display and then spread them
out to return to the desktop now this
can be very fun and also very time
consuming Mission Control is another new
feature that allows you to look at
everything that is running on your Mac
just swipe upwards with three or four
fingers you can see your desktop all
windows from your multiple apps group
together full screen apps and spaces is
basically like expose on steroids but is
definitely one of my favorite features
so far now we mentioned full screen apps
and there are a few built into Mac os10
lion-like mail the calendar app and
Safari you can swipe back to your
desktop or to other full screen apps
using three fingers but the full screen
experience is a nice option and if you
don't like it just drag your mouse to
the top right hand corner and click now
let's transition into some of the new
features in the finder Finder windows
are now rounded on every corner and you
can resize the window by clicking and
dragging on any of the four corners you
also have a much smarter search in the
finder we all know spotlight is very
good for finding files or words in a
file but if you know the type of file
you're looking for type in a file name
like aiff then you can select to isolate
the search by that specific kind of file
and then type in the name of the file
you want to find another edition is
viewing options in the finder now I can
still use the icon list view columns
view or cover flow of you but now I can
view my files based on their type so if
I select all of my files in the revamp
source list I have the option to view
them by kind and you'll see text image
and movie files separated or by size as
well now if you're in your applications
you can view by application category and
it breaks them down in the internet
productivity and many other
cheers also in the finder airdrop is a
new feature in line that makes it easy
to find computers on your local network
and drag and drop files over to them
you'll find this in the left-hand source
list column now dashboard is also become
its own space so if you swipe to the
right with all three fingers all your
widgets are there and you won't have a
confusing backdrop of your computer all
right let's jump into some specific apps
now we've shown you multi-touch gestures
already but Safari also gets a few new
lion tricks if you tap the trackpad with
two fingers you'll be able to zoom into
specific text you can also pinch to zoom
into an area of a web page and if you
swipe back left or right with two
fingers you'll see a new animation that
reveals the previous webpages that
you've looked at mail has also been
completely revamped with a cleaner look
and feel it now threads your email just
like on iOS devices Apple calls it
conversations and related emails show up
on a streamlined feed on the right hand
side you also can click on the number
displayed to show the entire list of
emails their dates and then directly
jump into that email in the conversation
now inside of an email data detectors
allow you to preview links without
leaving the app and you'll see new
animations throughout the OS like this
one when you reply to an email cool now
in the email preferences if new view
isn't really a cup of tea you have the
option to go back to the classic male
layout and another kind of fun feature
is the ability to show a context photo
in the message list touching I know and
let's show off one more feature called
versions when you're working on a
document go to the file menu to save as
version lion has the ability to autosave
changes to your files so from then on
you can click on the top right hand
corner of your document and it will
allow you to browse all the different
versions of the file in a time machine
like view then you can restore the file
if there's a previous version that you
wanted and voila it's like magic all
right I know that was a lot of I canning
information there are plenty of more
things we could show you but that's an
overview of some of the cool new
features we can expect to see in Mac OS
10 line coming out this summer back to
you tiger good oh you a lion alright
let's check out some more stories shall
we
a finally might be taking Apple TV a
little more seriously to get more
content partners on board Apple TVs

dolby digital 5.1 surround sound for
Netflix airplay support from third-party
apps and best of all it gives you access

amazing flying mythical creatures
conquered securities analysts say the
white iphone 4 yes that thing will be in
production this month and shipped by
April Apple has made changes to the fill
material to solve the lamination problem
and I'll believe it when I see it now on
to some quick bites safari five point O
4 was released by apple with some new
improvements and security patches but
tell that to French security researchers
at the Cannes SEC West Conference who
hacked a Mac in five seconds through
security flaws in that Safari everything
too bad egg ow now I movie in GarageBand
for the ipad are available now for 499 a
pop so you iPad users can get your
creative juices flowing probably
shouldn't say juices on the show unless
it's apple juice mm and a much needed
improvement comes to iOS 4.3 where users
will have to re-enter their itunes
password in order make in-app purchases
even if they just entered it in to
download the app now this will hopefully
prevent terrible things from happening
like you know an eight-year-old girl
racking up 14 hundred dollars in
purchases of Smurf berries for the Smurf
Village game that that's the same game
that my grown man younger brother plays
during his free time alright that's
