most entertaining shows starts with two
people in the ring with another wrestler
jump in every 90 seconds rustlers are
eliminated by being thrown over the top
rope by the end a total of thirty
contestants will abroad and the last man
standing gets a shot at a world
championship at WrestleMania the 2017
where a rumble ended with Randy Orton
scoring a surprising win against the big
name we also saw some fun moments like
that stare down between Goldberg and The
Undertaker was a fun show but how does
it stack up against rumbles past let's
take a look back at some of the more
memorable Royal Rumble moments in 2010
CM Punk was knee-deep in his
straightedge Savior character imagine an
imposter Jesus preaching the evils of
drugs and alcohol in underpants that was
CM Punk back in 2010 he made an impact
at that year's Rumble by tossing out
five competitors and giving a sermon in
between each elimination they can be
saved the next year punk would drop is
now legendary pipe bomb promo and become
one of the biggest names in wrestling I
am the best wrestler in the world
I've been the best ever since day one
the 2001 Rumble was one of the best ever
and came with the MVP the Big Red
Machine didn't win the match but he did
eliminate 11 men including the rock and
drew Carey he eliminated many of these
wrestlers using weapons like trash cans
guitars and in Kerry's case fear cain't
held the record for most eliminations in
a single rommel for 13 years this run
will also feature one particularly
special moment the iconic Stone Cold
Steve Austin winning his third and final
Royal Rumble in 1995 Shawn Michaels
changed the Royal Rumble not only did
Michaels win the match he wanted after
entering as the first contestant lasting
over 38 minutes without being eliminated
what helped him win Michael's became the
first wrestler to skin the cat during a
rumble match that strangely titled move
is when a wrestler is thrown out of the
ring but hangs on to the top rope to
save himself it's commonplace in every
Rumble now but 20 years ago what
Michaels it was something fresh and
innovative this was the first of two
back-to-back Royal Rumble wins for
Michaels after winning the match in 1996
he met Bret Hart in an hour-long classic
at WrestleMania 12 these are a few of
the many reasons Shawn Michaels is
considered the greatest of all time if
you don't think Shawn Michaels is the
greatest probably a risk leg i right the
stylin profilin sixteen time world
champion one of Flair's most flamboyant
wins came at the 1992 Royal Rumble a
year in which the WWE title was on the
line he showcased everything that makes
him great he wrestled for over an hour
and did his best to make everyone look
great when he was interviewed after the
match he gave one of the best promos of
the era was classic swear this is the
only title in the wrestling world that
makes you number one plus initial run in
the WWE was unfortunately brief but as
that night showed he squeezed a lot of
greatness into 18 months the Royal
Rumble is fun because of its
unpredictability even if you think you
know who's going to win you never really
know who's going to show up in october
two thousand seven John Cena towards the
left pack it's an injury that usually
takes athletes up to a year to recover
from so you can imagine the surprise of
the 20,000 fans at madison square garden
when seeing his music played and he
entered the match as a 30th participant
just months after picking up an injury
that should have taken a year to recover
from he didn't just rock up he went on
to eliminate Triple H and win the whole
it was the first of many occasions where
Cena showed off is freaky Wolverine like
healing abilities 2014 was a weird year
doe BW fans had gotten really fond of
Daniel Bryan he was an incredibly
talented wrestler and fans had made it
clear that they wanted him to be the
champion but the duggar w.e had other
ideas instead pushy a championship
rivalry between Randy Orton and
returning Batista many held out hope
that Brian would win 24 teams were a
rumble and get inserted into that
rivalry 29 entrants later and fans were
chanting his name in anticipation of him
being number 30 well it wasn't to be not
only was he not winning it wasn't even
in the match the result been showered
the ring with the chorus of boos it was
a united crowd voicing his collective
disappointment
stereo set the been reaction was so
intense that WWE was forced to make a
change Brian was then inserted into the
main event of Wrestlemania 30 which led
to one of the great WrestleMania moments
of all time did you watch this year's
Rumble any moments you like hated let us
