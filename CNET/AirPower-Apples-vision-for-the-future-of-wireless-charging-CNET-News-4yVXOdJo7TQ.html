built for a wireless world it is cheap
charging through the glass back and it
will work with the Qi charging devices
like the ones we mentioned earlier from
Mophie and Belkin they also work with
third-party cheap devices that are Qi
certified and there are a lot of great
devices they're going to start to come
to market particularly because of iPhone
eight knife owned 10 but we also think
we can make the wireless charging
experience even better so our team wants
to create something I think all of us
we're gonna want to use and it might
actually help move the entire industry
forward so we're gonna give you a sneak
peak of this idea right now I'm sure
many of you do this I do this have a lot
of Apple products I love them and use
them all day long I charge them at night
you plug in your cables you plug in your
chargers you take those cables and
charges with you on the road when you
travel we think we have an idea of how
to make this a better experience and
here it is it's a mat that you place
your iPhone 8 or iPhone 10 down and it
just starts to charge and there's a
beautiful new interface that doesn't
stop there you can place your Series 3
Apple watch down on it and it starts to
charge as well and you can place your
ear pods with the optional new wireless
charging case on it and it starts to
charge as well they all charge
the system has a great interface the
intelligently worked together and
communicate with each other to manage
the charging through one more efficient
charging system this is not possible
with current standards but our team
knows how to do this we call it air
power we hope people love it that
encourages others to create more
advanced solutions based on technology
like this we're going to be working with
the chief standards team to incorporate
these benefits into the future of the
standards to make wireless charging
better for everyone so look for the air
power charger next year</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
