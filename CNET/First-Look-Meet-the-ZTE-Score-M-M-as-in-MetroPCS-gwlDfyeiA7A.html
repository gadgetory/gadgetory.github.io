bringing you guys the ZTE score M by
metro pcs now you might have seen this
before on Cricket Wireless Network
except it was simply called the ZTE
score in addition to a few design
changes this version on metro pcs does
not come with move music a music
downloading portal that's exclusive to
cricket everything else however is about
the same it's still an entry-level
Android Gingerbread smartphone that has
a 3.5 inch touchscreen display and it's
powered by 600 megahertz processor some
hardware features include a 3.2
megapixel camera which unfortunately
does not come with an LED flash but
there is a shortcut camera button on the
side here for quick access aside from
your usual tasks managing apps the
device comes pre-loaded with lots of
extra apps like Rhapsody music Yahoo
Answers and a whole slew of apps
tailored to MetroPCS customers if you
consider these apps to be bloatware you
can fortunately uninstall many of them
the handset also comes with this
interesting textured backing that helps
it not slip around but it isn't the
prettiest thing the phone is available
now and will cost you $100 if you're
buying for MetroPCS is website again I'm
Lynn showing you guys the ZTE score M</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
