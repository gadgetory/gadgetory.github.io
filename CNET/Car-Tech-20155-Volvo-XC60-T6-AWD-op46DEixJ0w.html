find out what combination of design
power and tech seems to be working for
them as we drive a 2015 and a half xc60
t6 all-wheel drive and check the tip now
even before I get in the xc60 I'm
starting to like it because I think it
has a distinctive look those taillights
in the back are kind of like no other on
the market and of course the Volvo face
has been consistent for a while with
that big badge and bar that no one else
has anything quite like and in general I
think you approach this vehicle and you
see a kind of an austere restrained
sense of quality to it I'll give them
big kudos on design for those reasons
our xc60 t6 all-wheel drive starts off
about 43,000 the Platinum package is key
for an LCD instrument panel panoramic
roof keyless rear camera you've also got
your driver assist Technica dap t'v
cruise forward collision with braking
pedestrian and bike detection lane
departure even road sign reading to
display the proper speed limit oddly the
blind spot package is a la carte nine
hundred dollars more for blind spot
cross traffic alert and a deeper blind
spot tech they call lane merge aid now
not unlike that Volvo backhoe working
behind me this xc60 communicates kind of
a real burly solid substantial nough
stew it that's the volvo DNA in the
cabin if you haven't been in one lately
they don't go too overboard on buttons
this center console well here maybe the
only exception and lots of things are
big and chunky and actually easy to use
with gloves on and almost like a truck
now we have the full suite of
technologies in this one which includes
the census connect app system and also
as you can see here just about the full
suite of their driver assist technology
check out our Volvo v60 video we did
very recently it really goes in-depth on
all these as well as the nice interfaces
involved in that LCD instrument panel
now since this apps connect via either
nearby Wi-Fi your Bluetooth tethered
phone or the cars built-in 3G modem
that's free for six months and after
that they'll let you know the price is
still being figured out what does differ
of course in the xc60 versus the v 16
that i talked about is the internal body
space is a little more roomy because it
is an SUV and they've done a good job of
keeping these pillar
than these body sides from arcing in too
much for style and impinging the
airspace around your shoulder and heads
what feels as roomy as it looks from the
outside
and of course Volvo loves racks and
mounts and such they love your kayaks
and your bikes and whatever goes back
there and that weird sort of debtors
prison in the cargo bay not quite sure
what that is but I guess you could put
almost anything in there that you're
afraid is gonna get out bite you
now look at the hood of our xc60 very
similar powertrain to the one we saw in
the v60 and that's good news because I
like that one a lot this one to t6 that
means we have a three liter inline six
that is turbocharged and of course
intercooled in the common fashion today
interestingly this engine does not have
direct injection technology to get the
fuel into the cylinders which is been
the darling of the auto industry for two
or three model years now in terms of
power it gets by just mine without it
300 horsepower better than 25 pound feet
of torque all of that going out through
a one choice only 6-speed automatic also
kind of quaint by today's standards and
of course on our vehicle all-wheel drive
the lesser engine xc60 s get an 8-speed
automatic the big engines get fewer
costs zero to 60 is 6.9 seconds which is
pretty good for a forty three hundred
pound SUV on the heavy side as vehicles
go mpg is not great
17:24 and my hunch is dipping into this
lovely power and moving a brick this big
through the air you're gonna be closer
to 18 or so 19 day in Vail on the road
the power comes on rather muted ly and
drive but then the car just transforms
when you put it in sport mode even
without any further shift intrusion on
your Park ride quality is very good it's
firm enough to take advantage of the
engine's power but there are certainly
sporty-er vehicles in its class and our
test car had some very old-school wind
noise and whistling apparently around
the door or window seals maybe it was
the roof rack it might just be this unit
but make sure you listen for it when you
go on your highway test drive
in some the xc60 comes across more urban
modern and competent than truly sporting
its build style and engine all add up to
a strong powerful feeling if not the
most possible there is an our design
variant however with more power and
tighter underpinnings if you want
a little more high strong</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
