event and we're going to tell you all
about their Xbox news and a new product
called hollow lens whoo meanwhile a
robot is learning how to cook by only
watching YouTube videos that seems
dangerous and a super cool art
installation in Japan is both beautiful
and interactive you know what else is
beautiful and interactive we are not us
we definitely are tomorrow daily
greetings citizens of the Internet
welcome to tomorrow daily the best we
talk show of the known universe I'm your
host Ashley skeletron me as always kale
cough anonymous yeah whoo press
conference time where's the drop we're
gonna get a real job press conference
hype no seriously huge press conference
hype it was ok first of all not only
just huge press conference in like terms
of length it was two and a half hours
almost yeah and then there was a Q&amp;amp;A
afterwards by the way it was also
jam-packed with crazy stuff so let's not
waste any more time let's hit the
headlines we didn't see that one coming
I that was exciting I got I wanted to
just jump up and get out of confetti
cannon I can't wait to watch this back
and see like your face come into that
funny of an air horn I'm good okay so
let's get let's crack right into this
thing Jan skip a lot to get to the part
that excites us we are okay so here's
thing Microsoft had a press conference
today about Windows 10 and all the
integrations that go with it we are
going to skip most of the windows 10
part of that if you want to check out
any of that you can go over to cnet com
we've got tons and tons and tons and
tons all you know of coverage about
Windows 10 all you need to know is that
it's going to be like free next year
free for windows 7 windows 8 when is it
like anything beyond 107 you get a free
upgrade for a for a year they're gonna
do free upgrades which is awesome Rio
updated solitaire in mind sweetie
whatever yeah so moving on all right so
we're gonna focus on xbox and hollow
lens okay so xbox will jump into very
briefly I thought this was awesome
finally finally finally we're seeing
cross-platform gaming with Windows 10 so
they had this awesome demo where they
had a lady come out who was using the
xbox one and she was playing fable
legends and then Joe Belfiore I believe
or so I'm sorry Phil good old Phil was
playing uh he was playing i love this
basic about battletoads shirt is awesome
um he was wearing a battle toad shirt
you guys and it was really exciting uh
so he was playing as well on PC on
Windows 10 and then they were co-opted
playing together this is bad for him
nice firm cooperative play really
awesome and then
other big news about Xbox is you're
going to be able to stream your xbox one
games to any Windows 10 tablet or PC in
your house even if it's an xbox one
exclusive game so it doesn't have to be
available on Windows specifically you
can stream it just like you it so kind
of a play at steam box I think yeah but
they also had you could access your
steam catalog on Windows 10 like they
had a whole thing with Cortana don't
show me this show me this like any Xbox
app they have like a bunch of different
stuff is really cool that's great
finally I'm linking everything together
I'm finally getting some connectivity
between all of their devices and I think
this is at why people for Apple so as
well have even ochoco Android there's so
much connectivity between everything
that you have going on it just for me it
seems like this is what Windows users
and PC users have been kind of waiting
for saying well I don't want to upgrade
because why like why would I do this so
I like that they're giving gamers
especially xbox gamers in particular the
opportunity to sort of have this
cross-platform co-op is really cool it's
super good yeah um okay so now let's get
into the meat of it which is hollow lens
this is our this is what we're excited
to move or are we excited about it I
don't know that's very confused this
video is crazy okay so this is
Microsoft's official promo video of
hololens and they it's this pair of
goggles it has transparent glass on the
front so it allows for an augmented
reality experience you with Jem and the
Holograms playing right in front of you
know anything but of stuff a whole bunch
of stuff so how does this work there's
obviously something built into it so
that it can sense the world around you
very much so so the guy who kind of is
leading this project is alex kipman who
is the father of kinect oh okay so this
guy presented the demos it was very cool
this is a real world pop of experience
they're going to have and there are
transparent lenses spatial sound motion
sensors a cpu a GPU and an HP you a
holographic processor in it which it
understands gestures voice position and
mapping out objects based on where they
are like spatial location and Microsoft
is saying that this is going to be a
thing
that people are going to be able to use
they had a whole bunch of different uses
for this like there's minecraft they had
repairing things medical community yeah
one opponent actually focus on that
scene right there Netflix did you notice
the dog was hall it was a holograph ok
thanks for ruining all the things I was
gonna send I said you literally said I
said i want to sale here so basically
what was what was interesting about that
to me is that he didn't even need a
screen no he now could just project his
own screen he had a holographic dog
which means you can create companion i
finally get a lot of my general showing
the office you can do designs you can
play games you can you know create and
craft if your artistic yeah I here's my
question killin I am very oh yeah you're
you're skeptical on this I i yes a
little bits okay I think this is a cool
technology but is this the same as
connect so is this gonna be the same
thing where we saw a bunch of amazing
demos with Kinect and we've seen what it
can do and we've seen some amazing
things come out of connect from like
universities and robotics people and
they're using Kinect to do these
incredible gesture things they did the
cool stuff not that we're not doing
those things like where it's like oh
it's now not even mandatory with your
xbox one like me it's we've sort of kind
of pushed that to the side like I feel
like this might be the thing that is
mandatory bundled in with the next Xbox
and then everyone throws a fit and
they're like oh yeah okay no no we'll
just scuttle that too it's gonna be like
connect i think i think if they
incorporate that screen I think the
screen is gonna make make all the
difference it's got I gonna sit in my
room like before bed and not have to buy
a brand new TV and I just put that
sucker on and instead of looking at my
tablet i'm looking at a giant screen let
i can change the size of like that's
gonna be the make-or-break i mean
there's a lot of little like play games
and stuff like yeah that's like another
gonna be goof around your Wally moment
we're gonna have a screen right in front
of your face and you're in here yeah
making a cup I like I like it yeah yeah
I don't I don't want to do anything
anymore but let stop saying is like if
you can browse all that stuff just by
doing this I mean there might be a place
for this very very very soon they're
showing us all the possibility theory
the possibilities are incredibly it's a
beautiful video Mike I saw a lot of this
wish Lee is say exactly it's a lot of
potential I
just don't want to get overexcited and
then really disappointed when it comes
out is not we have broken with the we as
well when we saw the motion controls and
our great siglo de ended and we saw all
the possibilities of a lightsaber game
and went fishing and then nobody made
any games nobody made no games so it's
gonna depend on developers to make this
a thing like it has to be supported to
the point where it can be a ubiquitous
object an everyday thing that you're
using all the time otherwise forget it I
definitely think that a lot of different
apps are going to try and pick this up
and and run with it interesting whether
it be like what does it look like amazon
they are out but that's no who cares
about google very it's it was a it's
like a user interface like a HUD as yeah
it was like a little interactive
augmented reality situation it is
different i get that but i just i always
wonder how invested developers are gonna
get into something like this because
it's not proven yet yes yet i'm excited
i'm stoked i I'm definitely I'm like I'm
like this whoo I'm cautiously optimistic
yeah cautiously optimistic is absolutely
right and see I'm thinking small I'm
thinking what people are gonna use it
for immediately and what could be the
gas funny right out of the gate what do
you mentioned that that's our that's our
hashtag of the day is TD hololens what
are you gonna use hollow lens for what's
what is it what's the what's the game
changer what's the thing that it okay
really good so the game changer is
obviously gonna be uh what you how it
moves how everything moves forward right
what's what are you telling you the
thing that's gonna get people to use
this thing is being able to watch the
screen okay like imagine yeah you
imagine if I'm not necessarily like in
front of everything the glass wanted to
be so I'm in the kitchen or whatever
cooking cookies whatever and I have the
like the you know the right right right
there or whatever or are you're on a
plane where I'm playing video games
forum on a plane or in plenty video
games everything that the oculus wanted
to be without being completely
obstructive to your view right games
like I can even still play games there
won't be 3d but I can play them on a
surface and I can I can play and I has
the built-in cpu which is a godsend yeah
totally oculus does not add anything you
don't
havoc they don't need any other hardware
to use hololens so they're locking a lot
of the problems down yeah hypothetically
hypothetically so the again I think the
thing that would get people going is the
screens as boring as that sound but
that's the thing people I everybody
wants I really realize that all right
tell me about this robot know you don't
want to feel okay okay talking about
this forever I'm cake I've been talking
about this next article forever and this
is not a joke we finally video forever
and we're waiting for video this is a
robot that is learning how to cook by
watching YouTube videos it's watching
tons and tons of YouTube videos and
learning how to cook now basically what
this computer at the university of
maryland institute for advanced
computers studios I guess studies I
don't know I think I'm element they are
there they were showing this this robot
many YouTube videos so that it can learn
a variety of movements that would
challenge the robot that's why they
chose cooking is because there's so many
movements whether it be moving sorry
interlace a knife pouring water there's
a lot of movement so the way this works
is it here are the steps to get it to
actually do it it uses computer vision
okay to recognize it uses recognition
recognition system to recognize what's
going on then an a a process to analyze
all of that information ok then a
language parsing translator to hear what
is smoking on the YouTube video and then
of course it does all of it says okay I
get all those things and then here's the
action I need to do here we go I got it
I am pouring the baking soda baking soda
i got baking soda so their goal here oh
yeah what's up yeah what's the endgame I
always love to know what the goal is
there's a very middle of the article the
goal is to get it to work with humans to
be able to interact and as they said to
be able to like help out in the kitchen
with like recognizing seems like a
really big movement robot would fit in
my kitchen wall future we'll get you a
wali or saint-meran I got there so it's
been pretty accurate actually I've got
some stats for here for you okay hit me
with ninety-three percent on object
recognition so rolling pin I got it you
know and the 93% recall okay so brother
members remember that's a natural thing
remembers it also it's not and don't
forget to write this because it's not
programming it to know that specifically
it's it's teaching it to learn that it
is it there's a big difference yes uh so
a grasping recognition module precision
seventy-seven percent oh ok that's I'm
gonna get rude rude at a recall of
seventy-six percent so it's pretty close
to it so there's a twenty four percent
chance my pancakes would be ruined yeah
so so obviously there's some other
things obviously it's not there not just
like while the limitations are cooking
they wanted to do like hazardous work
and any number of things that humans
don't necessarily want to do yeah but
cleaning up like nuclear waste the
reason again and I guess I may not have
covered this you know right but the
reason they're doing it through youtube
videos instead of having it done through
just typing in because they don't want
to have to like type in right you don't
I just learn you know they want to learn
through humans and see how it's done in
a very fluid way yeah and let it learn
itself more or less so that's what
they're hoping to do and now you know
you accept its recipe will be humans yes
recipe will be BBQ yeah so I've been
really excited about that I know and I
finally saw the video for it and I was
like all kills gonna be so happy cuz you
can finally cover this story alright so
there you go so very last thing this is
a digital installation that is in Japan
which of course means it's a little
weird but it's also a really really
gorgeous and I like I have a flower
shirt on I feel like I'm I feel like I'm
dressed for the occasion for this video
so this comes from a collective called
team lab which is a bunch of architects
programmer cg animators other artistic
people who love technology so this
there's mirrors in here so it's not it
doesn't just keep going as far as you
can see Wow but the installation is
called flowers and people cannot be
controlled but live but live together
for eternity and so as people watchin
I'm sure I'm sure it is as people walk
through this installation obviously the
whole floor is a digital project it's
either a projection or and they walk
through and the floors react to visitor
movement and so the whole point of this
is like the life and death cycle
flowers like an other flora so if
someone walks on the flowers they kind
of wither away and die so you can see
they were kind of like floating away
there and and then as they walk away
they'll bloom again so it's it's slow
like though they're showing it off a
little bit slower but it really is
stunning and apparently they said it's
all about growth and decay and they have
this whole like creating the translation
was a little bit weird because the way
they described it sounded like why they
built this was really the the words did
not make sense together so I think
somebody had like kind of a weird
translation translation it's on display
right now at the National Museum of
emerging science and innovation in Tokyo
through march first so if you have a
plane ticket if you're going to be
headed out that way and before the first
of march you should definitely check
this out but yeah it's got a bunch of
mirrors and then even there are these uh
they're these columns that the that the
visitors can walk up to and they
actually have the same sort of flower
like projections and stuff on there too
so they can see themselves in these
mirrors other words like the projection
in there and so it's really cool um and
I just say you know again I we sometimes
I find these design things that are
really fascinating to me and super
interesting but um yeah just something
really pretty really pretty and
something really interesting and
something that I would go see if I ever
went to Japan which I problem I'm I
never will do you know that would be
people will be really upset if you did
that in Japan maybe like it system I
think everybody here everybody gets
upset with that all the time how much
really like when I hit that it like
there's a pain in my all right let's
have a party break let's hit the air
horn and party break we'll be back in
about 30 seconds or so we have a new wit
new segment my party for that hit the
air horns on new segment okay we're
gonna be back for the new segments don't
look away tomorrow daily
Oh
there we go we got one
welcome back to the show uh we have a
new segment this week love your segments
I do too we don't have a graphic for it
yet ah hopefully we will very very soon
I'll put in the request oh well the
audio people don't care yeah listen to
the audio five because my god you want
to make a little music sound for them so
this is Mod Squad ok do coupe duty to 10
ok perfect I'm gonna make sure they
actually incorporate that into the grass
so I didn't say anything while you're
doing it alright so Mod Squad we see a
lot of different cool modifications of
things online and also cool custom
builds of stuff so I I'm always
fascinated by this and I feel like it
really deserves its own segment just
because sometimes I'm not newsworthy
it's not like a oh wow like you know
this fish this Mario fish tank like it's
not newsworthy in that way but it's also
really cool and I feel like people
reserve we had the power glove if you
didn't see that episode get on it but
there was a guy that had a power glory
we made it so that he could do his stop
motion animation with the power glove
and that was the odd were they not Mod
Squad totally mod totally feature worthy
and we thought that you know we would
kind of have a segment where if we
wanted to call somebody out maybe if
something wasn't you know making the
news for any particular reason but we
just happen to see it we could we could
feature them so this I saw and thought
was so cool this is called the model g
one which family Cade is another name
for it that I've heard bandied about
this is by a guy named Dave Nunez he's
the creator of this little cabinet it's
a little device called the model g one
that's an adjustable 7-inch TFT screen
it has built-in speaker it has obviously
you can see the joystick in arcade
buttons he said it's Bauhaus design
inspired so he's very very cool like not
not hideous looking at all it's not it
looks super stylish and you can actually
in the back of that device stick your
old NES cartridges into it and play old
NES games oh wow yeah so he made this
really awesome thing into kind of a
little NES arcade cabinet which is
pretty awesome yeah that's pretty cool
it's not obnoxious like a lot of the
like
yeah it's not like a knockoff any up
like I just really like this because
it's super modern and clean but it's
also you know it's got that retro feel
to it it's really neat and so here's
that there is one catch though so the
one catches based on its architecture
its the internals of this it can't play
23 out of like the 800 plus games that
nintendo released for the idea those are
the only ones i wanted to play of course
well here are some of them um the more
notable ones that I caught in the list
where Battletoads Castlevania 3 gauntlet
paperboy pipe dream and incredible crash
dummies paperboy well the NES version
you were playing it on gameboy anyway k
let's all be honest oh don't you can
admit it it was a gameboy that's pretty
cool though yeah super awesome so it's
on his etsy store he's making them you
can you my running multiple ones okay
I'm on it see you could actually buy
this and the retail price is 199 on for
the NES model and if you want an Atari
2600 version which he also makes it is
249 and you can use old Atari cartridges
in there and I think the Atari one comes
pre-loaded with a party open source
Atari games if anyone wants to buy me
one for Valentine's Day Valentine's Day
is coming a que labelled entails nice
lady I just need anybody Oh anybody
wants yeah okay well that's that's
awkward delete Lee said I really should
delete not only thing it right now
everybody hates you now everyone's like
kill you are the worst speaking of
people thinking kills the worst it's
time for user feedback
no my favorite transition that was it
that might be my favorite transition of
all time so yesterday we asked you guys
use the feet of the hashtag TD aware and
tell us what video game character you
would want to watch play their own game
if they became self-aware AI this is I'm
so excited for you guys came up with
some some good ones on Soul I ansel
wrote to us and said I want the sims in
the sims 4 to play their game so they
can see how stupid they act so shy yep
