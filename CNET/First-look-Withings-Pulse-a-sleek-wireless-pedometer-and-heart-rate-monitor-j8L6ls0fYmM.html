I've been trying to get healthy it's not
that easy to do but thankfully there's a
lot of tech out there that is helpful
but it's a little bit arcane because you
probably heard about Fitbit and there's
other stuff like the jawbone up and why
things also has a lot of products too as
a landscape of helpful different types
of devices that all kind of function
similarly in their own ecosystem when it
comes to pedometers it's never been
easier to track the steps that you take
there are pedometer apps on your phone
and there are standalone pedometers like
the Fitbit or one that you wear on your
wrist or the new ything z' pulse now why
things has made Wireless health tech and
wired health tech for years now they
have a scale they have a blood pressure
monitor and they now are getting into a
very competitive little wearable pulse
pulse and pedometer space
I say pulse abit number I'll get that in
a moment because that's the neat little
trick that's in the pulse it's not just
a pedometer it also has a little heart
rate monitor right on the back that
allows you to read your pulse at any
time ything says that this is the
smallest one in any device and you got
to think it's something that's smaller
than iPod shuffle I haven't seen one in
anything this small it's helpful though
I don't really need to check my standing
or resting pulse rate that often it also
acts as a sleep monitor aid if you
attach it to your wrist with the
included strap and use built-in tracking
software to find out how your sleep was
that night now here's why I like using a
pen standalone pedometer the ything z'
pulse has a battery life that's about
two weeks now after a week and a half I
started getting a low battery warning on
this but it still holds 24 hours of
charge even when it seems like it's off
and it stores multiple days worth of
information so if you wait a few days
and then choose to sync it with your
phone all that data will be there and
because it's an interconnected series of
products that Whiting's has and also a
number of apps including RunKeeper and
and others you can choose to track your
health in a lot of different ways and
still find that you can use the pulse
with your system which is one of the
issues that it looks like they were
beginning
have with these pedometers that they all
kind of work with their own little
ecosystem of hardware you still have to
deal with the ything zap to wirelessly
sync this in fact you can't sync it via
cable in any other way so if you're a
mobile person this is the way to go if
you like a physical synced up connection
to a computer you might want to consider
something else but syncing via bluetooth
is very easy on the pulse you just press
this top button you hold for 3 seconds
and boom it begins to sync the data down
to your phone store it and also put it
online where you can access it from any
web browser it also tells you the
calories that a thinks you burn although
that's always relative the distance
you've walked and it measures your steps
taken against the marker that a lot of
people use of 10,000 steps a day which
is not everybody agrees with but it's
certainly a nice milestone to achieve a
bit of a game and I found myself
watching it and encouraging myself to
take more steps while wearing it now
wearing it is the thing it's a beautiful
design I mean this is like an Apple
level type design it's all sleek black
it's got an OLED display that only pops
up and is visible when you press the
button a little hard to see in direct
sunlight and it connects with microUSB
over here but if you want to wear it
you're stuck using a couple of options
that are included with the purchase
price but feel a little bit rinky-dink
there's this rubberized clip which works
well but I'd be worried about you know
wouldn't wear out over time you pop it
in and you put it on whatever and
there's also a Velcro armband that you
use for night for sleep tracking it
actually has a little spot on the side
where the pulse reader part will make
contact with your wrist when you're
sleeping but this doesn't really feel
ideal for working out at a gym I don't
think it would really mountain are you
meant to be wearing on your wrist
because of that pulse reader on the back
we don't want to get that too sweaty
this is really meant to be tucked in
your pocket or your bag and it's so
small you just might lose this thing so
I would prefer something like an even
better clip or wearable wrist device
that you could pop it into but those are
small quibbles other than that I really
like the Whiting's pulse now I'll admit
I have not used the Fitbit extensively
and so you know
you look at that landscape and I'm sure
people will have their their preferences
but the complete set of features that
the pulse has the ability to read your
pulse on it the price which is 99
dollars pretty competitive and the app
which is pretty outstanding add up to a
really nice addition to a increasingly
good health tech landscape for
pedometers so whatever you do just make
sure you get a pedometer in some way and
just start walking
I'm Scott Stein and that's a look at the
Whiting's pulse available now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
