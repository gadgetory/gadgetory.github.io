belkin and 900 children band router now
this look exactly like a UFO how do we
know because I've seen many of them and
fortunately this one is not a flying
object so having this kind of ship does
it really cut it for a router first of
all the base here is kind of too small
and too narrow and to light making the
router top o very easily especially when
they are cable coming from its back and
secondly this slick cover is actually a
really bad fingerprint magnet and
thirdly a router is about to be put
under the desk so there's no need for it
to look too good now the local side this
router has four gigabit lan port and 11
port on the front here the router has
one indicator light on top and the WPS
button the router is very easy to use on
the bottom is base unify all the default
configuration with this you can just
plug it in and you are set now if you
want to further customize setting you
can use web interface now the special
thing about this balcony outer is the
fact that it supports the three by three
standard on both bands that means expand
offer the 450 mega-tree per second for
the tour of 950 per seconds which
explains the n900 designation the router
come with suit used to be put to host
either printers or external hard drive
in my testing the router actually
performed really well when you use with
the 40 50 megabits per second clients
with other clients it will put it well
to it also offer great range on the 2.4
gigahertz ban on the five o'clock ban
the range could be better in my testing
the routers network storage features of
a pretty good performance even though
it's quite limited in terms of what it
can do with it for example you can turn
on or off the media streaming and that's
it the same goes for file sharing you
cannot restrict access to certain folder
and so on overall this is a good router
but not really great app to justify is
rather pricey cost at two hundred
dollars is about twenty or thirty
dollars
than its peers now for more information
check out the full review etsy.com once
again my name is domo and this has been
the first look as a UFO first look at
the belkin chill dual band and 100
router</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
