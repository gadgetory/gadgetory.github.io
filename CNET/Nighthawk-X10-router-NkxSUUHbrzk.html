router the very first a do two point
seven eighty or eighty four short router
for netgear which makes it very similar
to the Talon right here from tp-link now
both of them can deliver up to 4600
megabit per second Wi-Fi speed to an ad
client like this laptop I have here at
the same time they also work as a
regular eight oh two point grab an AC or
AC for short routers the thing is the ad
standard which works on the 60 gigahertz
frequency band has extremely short rains
and required live site to work so if I
take this laptop here at this room it's
not going to work to make sure that
works well you want to laptop to be
really close to the router I'm serious
now the X hat is clearly bigger than the
talent over here and that's because we
had a few more things to offer instead
of just for regular LAN port it has six
and you can actually come by two of them
into a super fast two gigabit per second
connection and if that's not fast enough
for you then also a 10 gigabit that will
port over here in case you have a high
end server with the same port type and
the antenna are lit up by the way they
can be turned off too and God so clearly
this is very high-end router so high
that most user including me cannot take
advantage of all of its high-end
features so for the most part it as good
as a regular AC router in my testing it
worked well but I couldn't test is AD
feature to the fullest because I have
this laptop here the only ad device but
I did see it connect to the router at
four pranksy gigabit per second that's
crazy and over here it has two USB 3.0
ports and I'm going plugging a purple
drive it has very fast storage speed via
a gigabit connection it has a sustained
copy speed of some 80 megabyte per
second and that means you can easily
share data or stream media locally and
speaking of media streaming the router
can also work as a
like server so you know this is a
powerful and exciting router it's just
that at 500 dollars to expensive and you
have to spend more for support equipment
before you can enjoy to the fullest so
it's set to say the only thing more
overkilling than having one of these is
having to and of course I'm speaking of
experience this is heavy and that's
because I'm don't know and this is I
mean these are the x10 Wi-Fi routers
from Netgear</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
