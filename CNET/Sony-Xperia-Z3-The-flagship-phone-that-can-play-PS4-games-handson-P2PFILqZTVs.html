taking a look at Sony's latest flagship
phone the 5.2 inch Xperia z3 now
physically it's easy to see the
resemblance between a z3 and its
predecessor they said - they both have
this metal frame around the edge and
it's got glass front and back now there
are a few physical differences to note
firstly of course it's got a much
slimmer bezel which makes a screen pop a
lot more and the body has been made a
little bit smaller so you've got metal
around the edge but these corners have
been made of nylon so if you do drop it
on the corner hopefully won't do quite
as much damage so the phone is
completely waterproof which does mean
some of its ports like the power slot
and the micro SD card slot have been
covered by flaps now phone has a 5.2
inch display but unlike LG with its g3
Sony hasn't gone for a 2k resolution
instead sticking with Full HD now Sony
reckons that we've a slightly lower
resolution and a more efficient panel
it's able to get up to two days of
battery life which is quite impressive
but of course we'll see how that really
stands up in our own tests the screen
does at least seem very very crisp and
it's extremely bright and bold as well
on the back of the phone you'll find a
twenty point seven megapixel camera
Estonia reckons this is incredibly good
in low light with high ISO levels and
also has optical image stabilization to
keep your shots nice and crisp even when
you're moving any texture that Sony has
included on the z3 range is the ability
to hook it up to your ps4 on the same
Wi-Fi network and essentially use your
phone as a second screen for your
PlayStation and does mean that you can
play actual ps4 titles using your phone
as a screen rather than your TV the
Xperia z3 isn't a big revolution over
the experience then - which is probably
not surprising given this empty was only
announced six months ago but it's slight
changes to the design and if sony has
been able to dramatically increase the
battery life means that the said three
should still be a great flagship phone
due to go and sell globally towards the
end of the year although sony hasn't yet
discussed how much it will cost
I'm Andrew hall - CNET and this is the
sony xperia z3</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
