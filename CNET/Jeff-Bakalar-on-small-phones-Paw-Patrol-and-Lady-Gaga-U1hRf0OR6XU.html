you ready do this yeah should put the
recording light on sure everybody shut
up or a contact should submit it last
week was fun you had fun
I did too thank you to the millions upon
millions of people who submitted
questions for me to answer for episode
two I thought I would bring things
inside to a place where I have a little
bit more control over my life and this
TRO room of course question time here we
go at its underscore lucky what do you
think eelain's intentions could be
arming people with flamethrowers just
trying to burn the whole thing down
quicker than it's already scheduled to
go watch it sing what phone are you
using this my friend is a pixel XL
greetings from Brazil why don't you like
beaches how much time do you have
they're boring they're hot there's sandy
they're completely inconvenient you will
never get the sand out of your crotch
iPhone se aside will we ever see the
return of the four inch form factor in
phones I don't think so
tech is a lot like fashion it has trends
but I think that trends over and I mean
have you seen a 4-inch iPhone lately it
looks like a tic-tac box I don't think
we're going back down that road the sand
is gonna be there for the entire trip
it's gonna get crunchy in your teeth
have you ever played a game that felt
like it was made just for you this is
going back a bunch of years beautiful
Joe it just felt like oh you want bullet
time here you go
you want great platforming biting action
here you go Jeff this game's made just
for you we're taking a gamble here for
one person but it's gonna work it's so
boring
how many times can you stare at the
goddamn ocean does the same thing over
and over what is the last idea /
technology that is genuinely excited you
to use honestly the Nintendo switch I
didn't know what to expect that thing
man was I impressed I loved it
if the ocean did something cool like if
it put on a show maybe I want to watch
it but it's boring and it's for people
who just can't find peace
in everyday life Christian tea I wonder
what Lady Gaga album he was talking
about now I want to know is it the Bain
Monster is that the name of the one with
the poker face and bad romance mark
Matthews
how many more caves can we possibly
squeeze into a TV who the hell knows at
this point I thought we were gonna stop
at eight but apparently we're not
there's got to be some point where like
the human eye can only see so many K's
but all I can tell you is that there
will never be enough content for that
amount of case who's my favorite paw
patrol pup um that's a great question
I've got bigger sort of concerns about
why the entire city relies on all their
necessary services to a bunch of animals
but regardless it's probably rocky he
just doesn't give up Chris am i a sucker
if I buy a home pod or any smart speaker
for that matter smart speakers are
starting to get on my nerves Chris I
can't lie to you that home pod is a lot
of money Chris how smart can it be it's
a buyer beware what are your thoughts on
fidgets spinners no one remembers them
anymore people that's over at ebb hands
proudest dad moment that is a really
sweet question I'm probably gonna cry
thinking about it but maybe maybe let's
do a sharp right turn and talk about one
of like the sweetest moments my son
imitates me a lot and I remember one day
we were out we were at some event and
he's just like looking at me and he goes
you okay dad and I'm just like oh man I
say that to you all the time he just
like patted me on the back he's like you
okay dad I was like yeah I'm okay man
are you okay it was super sweet maybe
you don't get it but it was it was
touching I stole this for you favorite
bands I know you're a fan of Mastodon an
alkaline trio but what else also what's
your favorite album of last year
favorite album of last year hands down
Mastodon emperor of sand I also really
dig this band called ghosts I like to
spend the Flatliners and probably my
all-time favorite band
nature's Vegas at Eduardo Paulo being
from the same neck of the woods as
Springsteen what are your feelings on
his music
any favorites favorite Springsteen song
is 10th Avenue freeze-out I'm not a
die-hard Springsteen fan I know I'm
breaking the hearts of all my mom with
County brethren but I'm more of a Billy
Joel guy that doesn't make me a bad
person I like his stuff but like after a
while he's just like we love him
there was a schoolyard in my hometown
there was a fireplace in our house I
like him but you know he's not like my
go-to Jersey guy that's Bon Jovi RC to
see one two three terrible song name oh
you mean this one
yeah it's called it's called toodle-pip
well there you have it another
successful round of QAS
in the books if you want your question
answered don't worry I'm gonna get to it
pop it down in the comment section below
hit me up on Twitter you can like you
