familiar with Google's Nexus phones this
is the only way to get the pure Android
experience you get all the updates as
soon as they come out and nobody's
allowed to put their own stamp on it the
other thing that's new about this phone
is it's the first time that LG has
manufactured a nexus phone previously
they've all been Samsung so this is kind
of a big change and I personally am
super excited to get in here this is our
review unit and it's a developer unit so
there might be a couple things in the
box that you don't get but I think
you'll get the idea let's bust it up
Nexus it's already been untaped I'm
sorry everyone okay it's not as law it's
a little more squared-off than some of
the Samsung one's not as long look at
the back it's got this kind of like
matrix thing going on glittery I like it
turn it on you have your LG branding now
these are considered the flagship
Android phones I have been carrying an
iphone 5 and a samsung galaxy s3 but i
think i'm about to switch over to this
guy because this is the way to go all
right now this phone is asking me for a
sim card so it's a good time to check
out what else is in the box nothing on
top here this guy out we have our Nexus
quick start guide now if you have any
experience buying a nexus phone through
google trust me this is about the only
tech support you're going to get so read
it carefully here's our power brick
again not the standard Samsung / Apple
square nice to see our little charging
cable which I think we're going to want
because our batteries going quickly and
then of course a little sim card poker I
don't know I bet that has a name but i'm
going to call it the sim card poker and
that is pretty much it let's check out
the specs obviously the nexus 4 is
running android 4.2 jelly bean it has a
1.5 gigahertz quad-core Snapdragon s4
pro processor plus 2 gigs of RAM on
board google says
should make it the fastest phone on the
market and I wouldn't be surprised it
has an eight megapixel camera on the
back and a 1.3 megapixel front facing
camera it also has a 2100 milliamp
battery that's not the biggest battery
on the market but it's a good size and
google says it should last 10 hours with
talking Android phones do just keep
getting bigger this one is no different
it has a 4.7 inch screen but the screen
is beautiful Full HD resolution at 1280
by 768 obviously the Nexus store has
Wi-Fi Bluetooth and NFC it also supports
wireless charging and Google is making a
new accessory called the charging orb so
that you can dock in charge that way
there's not much storage on this phone
it starts at eight gigs and you can only
go as high as 16 with no expandable
memory if you buy this phone unlocked
from google play assuming you can get
one the price is great two hundred
ninety nine dollars for the eight gig
model and 349 for 16 gigs it starts at
199 with a new contract at t-mobile now
the Nexus 4 is great hardware the screen
is beautiful I'm very impressed with the
look and feel of this phone but there
are some big trade-offs that have me a
little bit let down namely the lack of
LTE Google's not working with the
carrier's other than t-mobile so you're
kind of stuck on a slower network and
that's a huge bummer since you have to
live in the cloud because the phone only
goes up to 16 gigs the price is good and
like I said I love the hardware but I
think there are a few too many
trade-offs unless you are really
committed to the true Android experience</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
