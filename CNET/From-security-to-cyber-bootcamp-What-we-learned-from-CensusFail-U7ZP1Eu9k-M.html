supposed to press pause and take stock
of our lives as Australians on August 9
2016 after being live for just a few
hours the census website went down and
then stayed down for 43 hours it was
less of a press pause and more of a
eject the videotape and smash it
repeatedly against the wall situation
now the government has released two
reports on hashtag census fail and here
are five things we discovered from the
wreckage
turns out our government bureaucrats
just don't really get cybersecurity so
the PM's top adviser on cybersecurity
says they need to be put in cyber boot
camp he really said that turns out that
first ignoring the problem then taking
to Facebook to blame all those
Australians that were going online to
fill out their form was not actually a
good way to engage with the public the
ABS had a plan to deal with social media
complaints the cleverly called yet
ultimately useless social media crisis
escalation matrix but they decided that
only accounts with over 10,000 Twitter
followers were worthy have been taken
seriously so how did the ABS deal with
even the most high priority of
complainants they ignored them
completely so here's what actually
happened there was a DDoS attack but the
ABS and IBM hadn't done adequate testing
and couldn't really explain or account
for the strange network traffic worried
that your personal information was going
overseas they took the census site down
the ABS and IBM did ddos testing but for
a total of ten minutes after the site
was already online and finally turns out
that giving Australians very little
warning about plans to keep their name
and address for the first time and to
keep this information for four years and
they're not really keeping the public
informed about what went wrong turns out
census fail was one of the biggest fails
of 2016</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
