it's time for the three 5359 podcast on
cnet episode 116 with Alfred Aang and
Roger Cheng good morning morning have it
monday good morning happy mean girls day
that's right it's October third I don't
know how to celebrate that do we
celebrate that it would just watch mean
girls it's October third guys okay I've
never actually watched that movie that I
don't know what that makes me the 2000s
classic it's actually better than you
would think really alright it's tina fey
so it's funny it's true it's our
casablanca alpha oh alright well so
tomorrow is the big google event so
we'll be breaking down some of the big
details the biggest announcement
obviously is the pixel phone seems like
a lot of details of a hearty leek so
we'll talk about that I Facebook had a
busy morning talking about we'll talk
about messenger light strip down
messenger app for the emerging markets
as well as marketplace which is its take
on craigslist so yeah if you have any
questions as always leave them in the
comments section Brian will pick out the
best and you know try our best answer
alright let's get this podcast recorded
we'll be back in four minutes to answer
your comments and questions thanks for
joining us and here we go in three two
welcome to 359 where we talk about the
top tech news of the day only the crap
we want to throw in I'm Roger Cheng I'm
Alfred hang tomorrow is Google's big
event but looks like the details of the
pixel phone are already out an errant
posting from carphone warehouse revealed
a number of key features from super fast
processor fingerprint sensor better
cameras all the details you really want
Albert is this enough to get you excited
I'm already excited for I think it's the
comeback of the Nexus phone well now
that's called pixel well i mean i think
the super fast processor really is a big
leg up on it i'm not a fan of some of
the purported leaks where you know might
not have a microSD slot which you know I
never did but I know that that's a big
feature that a lot of Android users you
know look for sure yeah I look it's for
me it's am kind of curious to see how
this photo does how Google's going to
this is a break from Nexus Nexus while
popular with the hard core android crowd
has never been that that kind of mass
market fell you know it's not as popular
anywhere near as popular as the iphone
or samsung's galaxy as franchise so i
want to see how pics how Google kind of
presents pixel as this phone that
everybody wants to buy not just not just
the Nerds I think this processor will
help them do that but I the way to you
know yet mass audience for is usually a
camera yep and the leak didn't really
tell me that much about what the camera
funds will be like and I think that's
what they will need to jump onto that
stage yeah i mean i would imagine
they're going to spend a good amount of
time with the camera technology they did
last year with the 6p i'm hoping they
assume that you spend as much time if
not more talking about the pixel phone
so what is its twelve point three
megapixel and f 2 point 0 camera so yeah
it doesn't really tell us a lot mega
pixels are can be really deceptive so i
know we'll see it's a at least spec wise
it seems like it's a really interesting
phone so i will say i am happy that it's
finally you know moving the industry
standard and getting rid of the 16
gigabyte minimum yes on devices I agree
16 gigabytes is not enough and I'm glad
that they're you know moving along to
that I think that'll help them get a
wider audience as well oh yeah the sheer
amount of like high resolution photos
and videos for capturing 16 gigs it's
just yeah it's definitely not sufficient
so moving on facebook had a busy Monday
and it should introduce messenger light
a stripped-down messenger application
designed to run on old slow android
phones that you'd find any much of
markets as well as marketplace which is
its take on craigslist you excited are
you gonna be using marketplace i use
craigslist almost every day i usually
just go on the free tab to see if
there's anything i can pick up got it um
so I am excited for facebook marketplace
hopefully they have a free tab there
also yeah um but for me it's more so
about accountability with craigslist you
know somebody could set up a dummy email
and then scam you and then there's
nothing left they're not saying that you
can't do that with facebook but at least
it's a little bit more accountable there
yeah I'm looking forward to that feature
yeah it's I've never been a huge
craigslist fan but the fact that they're
going to be pushing this they're gonna
be putting it prominently in the
facebook app I think it's like that
prime real estate I'm sure folks are
correct clothes are gonna be a little
bit worried about that and it'll just
lastly a messenger light you know this
is an app this is an IM application for
the emerging markets it's interesting
too because facebook already owns
whatsapp which sort of popular in those
markets so it seems like the two might
cannibalize each other I think they're
more so just trying to capitalize on
Facebook audiences that aren't already
on whatsapp yeah i might even jump onto
messenger light on my own just because i
don't need all these like crazy features
on facebook messenger that they have of
all these stickers and you know just
that they use I kind of just want to
talk to my friends it's super light it
only takes about 10 megabytes so very
very stripped down so y know more about
these stories as well as our Google
preview check us out on cnet I'm Roger
chain I'm a farang thanks for listening
so just as a reminder tomorrow's Google
event is at it is at nine a.m. pacific
noon eastern and it is based in san
francisco yes will we have folks on the
ground there but we'll also be talking
about the the google event after the
fact we'll probably do our show a little
bit layer tomorrow yeah but yeah well
we're expecting we're expecting the
pixel phones two of them a pixel and
pixel XL which is we believe to be a
slightly larger phone probably a bit
more battery life but not a not a lot of
other huge differences maybe a tablet
maybe a pixel tablet a new chromecast
possibly just to keep up with sort of
the new generation of streaming devices
maybe a new router updates on Google
home I think we're going to get some
pricing and availability availability
information and we'll see I don't know
what other surprises google has but it
promises to be a pretty busy show so
yeah join us here on youtube sometime
later after the Google event tomorrow
and we'll be reeling and reacting the
same
you so join us here so on that note
let's spin into price points yeah so
those Nexus phones are traditionally
been pretty for all right three hundred
four hundred dollars 250 for the 16 gig
was a 250 was that the starting price is
that like the discounter price that's
how much I paid for in full was that
like brand-new though like just come out
it might it wasn't like right after it
came out I waited like a year after
that's why I think I think originally it
was closer to 300 I mean the way in a
very affordable phone what we're hearing
from this phone is it's not like a Nexus
device it's not a low in or an
affordable phone it's it's a super phone
it's supposed to compare with the iphone
which starts at 650 and galaxy s7 which
is around the same price so the XL or
the pixel XL I imagine will be closer to
seven fifty eight hundred dollars not
you know they're not the typical Nexus
phone I'm just wondering that's going to
get people yeah I think it depends on
how they decide to roll it out because
you know they've traditionally just sold
it through the google play store on its
own yea biden full I don't think
anyone's gonna do that if that's the
case it doesn't have that kind of know I
would suspect that Google would strike
carrier partnership deals which you know
that's not the hard core android fans
are not going to be they're not gonna be
happy with that just because of the
sheer amount of blood way that sometimes
shows up on these carrier phones but but
yeah the only way to get distribution
especially in markets like the u.s. is
to have the carrier seldom vast majority
of people still buy their phones through
carriers at carrier stores I mean it's
not like it's unprecedented I mean
they're Androids first phone with it
came out through t-mobile yes g1 yeah
yeah yeah I mean the first although to
be fair the first next phone the nexus
one was was sold directly through google
and was kind of a disaster because
customer service wise they couldn't
handle the amount of complaints returns
that they they were getting with that
phone what about let's talk size storage
store uh I look as we started to jig
mural and then 828 yeah gigabyte model
skipped over the 64 gig just like just
like Apple oh nothing yeah what about
other features like removable batteries
and we're doing questions about the cut
in the track well that's that can happen
I mean I think we're looking at the
rumors point to Abbott AG body I think
the upper half of it is is plastic or
glass I I would imagine it's going to be
closed off just like sort of the other
kind of super villains are out there
that's also just bad then the nexus 5
also didn't have a removable battery or
write these slots right so this won't
have micro SD either I doubt that's what
I've seen from the leaks sorry Sergio
yep I'm definitely interested in this
phone personally just as a long time
iphone user becoming disheartened by the
way the device has gone as a light yeah
yeah I would be interested to find out
if there's going to be a headphone jack
on that as an audiophile myself working
in the production realm so here's
fingers crossed everybody out there I
don't probably a few of you with me more
than a few more than a few yeah let's
see looking through the chat what else
do you think we're going to what about
wearables watches you know what they
just came out with an announcement that
entered where to point 0 which is also
have a lot of fixes to the original
software got delayed till next year so
and I actually I wrote a story a little
while ago just noting that some of the
bigwigs with Android wear motorola
Huawei um LG have all kind of pushed
back there watch plans till next year
and beyond software i think one of the
issues is getting LTE into a watch
without making it super huge or without
it sort of dying out in half a day you
know apple of samsung's kind of done it
with a DRS 3 is like massive and it's
and with my tiny arms it just doesn't
look that great so i imagine that some
of these guys are taken aback sort of
taking a break see what's what they
could actually figure out what they can
cram into a watch and as well as wait
for andrew watch or Android wear two
point oh i'm still filtering through the
chat here looks like it's kind of celsus
at this point I don't over even helping
anybody but yeah we're largely in the
same boat as you guys we are not sure
what's coming we are excited and
interested because this could be an
opportunity to see something kind of
radical yeah oddly what about water
resistance I'm talking about what you
think I don't think I it should be I I
would hope so i'm considering that you
know i do think that's an industry
standard at this point right at least if
you want to be in the top you know three
selling phones it is the talk of the
town i think if they overlooked that
it's a huge oversight yeah part of me
thinks that only these phones are
development 18 months in advance roughly
so i wouldn't be surprised if they don't
have if it if water was this isn't a
feature just because it's it wasn't a
huge priority when the phone started
with his development it's my guess
though size shape comfort wait what do
we think I mean you're looking at sort
of the the images there the I mean it
looks a lot like kind of shape that may
look scum like an iphone right has a I
mean HTC is the one building the phone
from what i understand that could be
more of a silent partner this time but
you know if anything if it looks kind of
like the HTC One you know it's not a
terrible phone it's actually a pretty
decent phone yes I can't if you yeah you
zoom in it looks a lot like an iPhone
sure does you think it's going to hold a
candle to the boasting that Apple's got
with their camera as a bleep I don't
think so not with one camera they've got
dual cameras on the seven plus camera
this choice as much yeah my grades I I
think they're going to talk about
they're definitely not devote a lot of
time to the camera technology and I'm
surely going to talk up how great it is
but it will be kind of hard it's hard to
see how it matches up with at least with
the seven plus is dual lens yeah I don't
I don't think it's going to be the
hardware that much that they're going to
be showing off at this event I think
it's going to be a lot about software
game which particular eight with you
know I I would argue that they've been
beating apple on for a while now so yeah
it's um pay well but is it will be i
sorry will do
ginez will there be an equivalent to
there is already android pay yeah you
know our our colleague Richard nieva
wrote a story this weekend his preview
piece was really looking at how even
though there's to be a slew of hardware
being announced it's really more of a
software game Google assistant is
something they introduced back at Google
i/o it showed up in a low the messaging
app it's going to be a google home we
suspect it'll also be in pixel and
they're going to use pixels sort of like
the main shojin horse to get you to
start using google assistant yeah that's
why I don't think it's a it's you know
more of a hey this is just our phone
event I think that's why they paired it
with you know there's going to be the
home updates it's going to be these
chromecast updates I think there's going
to be some kind of ecosystem that
they're you know putting out there at
this event that's going to be exciting
here's a question what are these things
on the back of the phone near the camera
I think they're referring to these this
this trio of dots next to the obvious
camera lens what what do we think I
suspect those are directional Mike's you
think so that'd be kind of cool I'd be
interested I mean I think a lot of those
have those now but they're I mean it's
it's a part of the design and the
aesthetic of the phone I you don't see
that largely and other it's not on mine
that's for a bike right here oh well
singular I don't just one though that's
three over there I don't know if that's
a mic or if it's a proximity sensors Oh
out the water haha Jackson water wish to
go swimming yeah yeah i don't i'm not
sure what those uh i'm assuming one of
them's gotta be a mic you're probably
right you are though or maybe just some
kind of like indicator LED or something
yeah yeah course why wouldn't they just
use a flash yeah why would they just use
a flash I don't know mm-hmm we as we
said we're in the largely in the same
boat as you guys were just kind of
interested in curious parties at this
point we'll all be we'll all be in the
same boat at noon tomorrow that's right
um want to call today yeah yeah 80 for
tomorrow yes we saw have a lot to prep
for but yeah guys come back here
tomorrow again our show probably run a
little bit later just so we can
accommodate the Google event and we'll
be able to talk
on it so yeah if you like anything you
