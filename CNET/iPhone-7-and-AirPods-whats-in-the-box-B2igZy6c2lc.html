what's inside the box when you
eventually get one well we have a review
and it's here and we've already unboxed
them we had to to set them up but if
you're curious what was in them we'll
give you the not quite fresh but basic
feel of what's inside every box every
year it's not a surprise you're gonna
get an iPhone and you're going to get a
charge cable now same thing here this is
the jet-black iPhone 7 already totally
smudged and a little bit scratched that
happens and then underneath here you've
got headphones but not the regular ones
these are Lightning connected and on the
back you've got the dongle don't lose
the dongle this comes in the box and
we'll convert lightning to regular
headphones then underneath that your
standard lightning cable and your
charger and some stickers now when you
get inside air pods which are coming in
late October pretty minimal packaging
inside little instruction thing then
you've got the air pods which by the way
look do look like dental floss they
seriously do so don't get those mixed up
with dental floss the air pods are
inside and to charge them up you've got
lightning cable right underneath pacted
that's what's in air pods in the iPhone
