talking about how the extra pixels of 4k
resolution are really difficult to
appreciate it normal screen sizes and
viewing distances but the living rooms
that will house Sony's VP lvw 350 ES 4k
projector are anything but normal at a
penny under 10 grand in the US this is
the least expensive 4k projector on the
market I'll get one thing out of the way
first its picture with any source as
you'd expect from display the cost this
much is spectacular
I tested it using 120 inch screen in a
completely dark room and observed
excellent color accuracy superb video
processing and plenty of contrast no
it's black levels aren't quite as deep
as JVC's competing projectors like the
dla X 700 R but otherwise I could find
very little wrong with this Sony's
picture the fun part for me was
comparing it to the JVC and a second
high in 1080p projector from Epson on
that huge screen and comparing 4k
content from Sony's video player the
highest quality 4k source available
today to 1080p blu-rays I was somewhat
surprised to see that even at that size
and seated 9 feet away it was still
tough to tell the difference with most
movies I watched including after earth
the amazing spider-man fury and most
surprising Lawrence of Arabia but in
some cases the extra pixels of 4k really
paid dividends in the form of
significantly more sharpness an
incredible lifelike detail on my screen
one was during the official 2014 FIFA
World Cup film where the game highlights
rented in 4k is 60 frames per second
looks simply more lifelike and realistic
than any sports video I've ever seen
another was a movie called no good deed
which visibly beat the blu-ray with its
details particularly in close-ups of
faces watching the 4k version was like
removing a thin veil over my eyes it's
early days yet for 4k content and I
expect the best examples that continue
to widen the gap with blu-ray as long as
you sit close enough to a large enough
screen in the meantime if you can afford
it the VP lvw 350 ES finally provides a
fork a difference worth seeing I'm David
