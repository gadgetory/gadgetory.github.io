I found three events today first up at
9:00 a.m. you have a meeting titled
packaging review it looks like you're
low on fuel so I suggest leaving 10
minutes early to make your 9:00 a.m.
meeting on time also you got an update
from Expedia confirming flights and a
hotel room right
that's the upcoming vacation I have so I
better let my boss know hey Cortana
asked time away to set my out of office
from Monday to Friday okay you're marked
as out of office for Monday to Friday
your auto-reply message is set and your
time off has been entered in the time
away system awesome developers can
create Cortana skills that work across
platforms like this example with the
invoke speaker where Cortana is working
directly with my works time off system
to fulfill my request hey Cortana do I
have any other reminders for today you
mentioned you would provide a list of
designers for review in today's meeting
right remind you when I get to the car
got it with the device graph I'm able to
push this notification to any of my
devices so I could push it to my xbox
but since I'm headed that way I've gone
ahead and set it to my car don't laugh
it gets great fuel economy so with the
help of Cortana I'm fueled up and ready
to make my meeting on time there's an
accident on 520 that will make you late
for your 9:00 a.m. meeting would you
like me to let the other attendees know
and connect you when it starts yes
please okay
I'll let you know guess I spoke too soon
hi Laura
just a reminder to provide a list of
designers for your packaging review
meeting
as LinkedIn to pull all the designers
from my network I found all the
designers in your network would you like
me to read out the top five or send you
a summary send a summary to my product
review channel okay
I added that to your team channel
because Cortana is aware of the device
I'm on she's able to provide me with
contextually appropriate responses so I
can say the best next step hi Laura
your meeting is about to start should I
connect you yes please hey folks I'm
running a little late but go ahead and
get started without me
no worries Laura we got your note
earlier so while Laura joins let me take
a second and show you guys around
Microsoft teams for those of you that
haven't seen it this is Microsoft teams
the new chat based collaborative
workspace in office 365 and we're in a
teams meeting so when I get back to my
desk and open up my laptop Cortana is
waiting there for me with an action item
from earlier in the day when I click on
the notification it takes me to outlook
where there's an email with my meeting
summary it has the attendee list the
video links the tabs use and the bot
interactions best of all here's my
action item I could go ahead and mark it
as complete right in the email but I
want to dig in a bit more developers
could add content to this actionable
email or create Outlook plugins like
this one from Microsoft stream when I
click on the plug in the stream service
gives me a transcription of the meeting
I can see key points when they were made
and who made them this way I can get the
context that I need to complete my
action item and of course the stream
service uses the publicly available
Microsoft Translation api's so I could
get this in the language of my choice so
what you see now show you today our
team's and Cortana to services
leveraging the intelligent edge and
Microsoft graph</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
