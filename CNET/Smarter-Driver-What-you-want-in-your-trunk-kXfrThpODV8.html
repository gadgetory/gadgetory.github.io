your trunk is kind of this place of last
resort in your car not unlike that place
in the ocean while the plastic gathers
and goes around in circles and never
comes out State Farm and KRC research
talk to a thousand ten us drivers and
found that sixty percent of them had a
lot of non-essential stuff in the boat
while only nine percent had the
essentials that includes jumper cables
road flares or reflectors a flashlight a
first-aid kit a little water a blanket
and of course a spare tire interestingly
SUV drivers were more likely to have the
basics the right stuff in their trunk
then sedan drivers by a fair percentage
more of a survivalist mentality I guess
now on top of that list of basics here
are a few things I like to carry in my
trunk you may like to as well first of
all one of these compact portable
jumpstarters this will jumpstart your
car seriously and when you're not using
it for that you've got USB ports to
charge your portables some pet food to
attract those strays out there that
might need rescue and gonna be pretty
skittish
this is also good for you in the next
recession an FRS radio you know Family
Radio Service but one that runs on
double-a is that you also keep in the
trunk most of these are rechargeable and
they're usually dead when you need them
this makes sure that doesn't happen and
here's what if you travel a lot this is
a solar battery tender you put this on
your dash around the other end into your
cigarette or 12-volt light or outlet and
trickle charges your battery you leave
your car at the airport for a week or
longer this might save you a dead call
to triple-a and one more thing that
isn't literally going your trunk but
underneath it is keep at least half a
tank of gas in your car at all times for
two reasons one your mobile during a
disaster or even if you're gonna shelter
in place it's a great source to siphon
gas for your generator at home
it pays to double check what's in your
trunk and make sure it's more than just
old clothes and garbage</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
