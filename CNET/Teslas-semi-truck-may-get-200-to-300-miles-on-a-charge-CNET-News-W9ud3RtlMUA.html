self-driving Electric semi-truck next
month and a new report reveals just how
long it may hold the charge Reuters
reports that this battery-powered big
rig would have a working range of 200 to
300 miles
that means these trucks are good for
regional deliveries but it won't be
doing long hauls between states
Tesla chief executive Elon Musk has
promised we'll see a prototype in
September teasing it back in April in a
tweet but he's also talked about the
concept since last summer
as for the self-driving part it wouldn't
be the first that honor belongs to
Freightliner which has been testing
self-driving semi trucks on public roads
in Nevada
since 2015 there's also a startup
company called change it's working on
electric delivery vans but Tesla's big
rig could have some extra pizzazz at
least when it comes to entertaining
drivers there are separate reports that
the company is working on its own music
streaming service for its electric cars
and for the first time we're seeing
screenshots that offer more proof the
blog electric found hitting code for
something called T Tunes in the cars
media app update I'm Bridget Carey and
for all the must know news Hennessey
