Samsung's new Smart TV suite for 2018
this is gonna appear on most of their
2018 televisions and it starts with
Bixby Bixby is Samsung's digital
assistant much like a Google assistant
or an Amazon Alexa it appears in their
phones primarily but now Samsung is
moving Bixby onto the television to use
it you're gonna talk into the remote
control like you would with any other
television that has voice based controls
beyond the ability to search for stuff
and find new content including songs
with Spotify
Bixby gives the ability to control
lights and other smart home apparatus
using the screen and the TV itself
actually functions a full smart home
control hub so Samsung has a new smart
home app that's gonna be a big screen
version and a small screen version for
your phone they're gonna sync up really
nicely you can use the app to actually
set up your television using the app is
gonna make it easy to connect to Wi-Fi
without having to type into the screen
and also easier to get logins and
password information when you're logging
into those apps for the first time but
of course smart things is mostly about
the smart home devices so the screen
will enable you to control any smart
things device in the house including
lights thermostat security cameras
things like that on the big screen using
it as a sort of control hub for the
entire house just like in previous years
Samsung allows you to share from your
phone to the TV but it does make it
easier this year again using the smart
things app Samsung also has a new
universal guide this year that makes it
easier to get to TV shows both from
Netflix and over the top services as
well as your cable TV and integrates it
all into one interface the guide also
recognizes shows that you want to watch
you suggest new ones based on your
viewing activity that's a quick look at
Samsung's new Smart TV features for its
2018 TVs here at CES</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
