Sumi das and joining me is senior writer
for cnet Josh Lowensohn Josh thanks for
being with us great to be here ok so
today's the day that a lot of people
have been waiting for in a September
18th and iOS 7 has just dropped it's
here it's here I came out you've got it
on your phone yes we do all of us are
installing it widely and reckless
abandon this is everybody is doing this
in the office I mean it's really not a
productive time right now but is it been
a smooth release this far you know it's
really too early to tell people are just
installing it you know there have been
some early reports when people can't
actually download it that's probably
more due to Apple servers and any sort
of installation Apple has actually one
of the easiest jobs doing this compared
to most hardware makers because they
only have a limited amount of devices to
kind of figure out before it goes out
okay with iOS 7 you can immediately
recognize the differences from iOS 6 any
previous versions there's more white
space it's cleaner fonts are different
there's no no that's Q morphic yeah
design quality that we saw before so how
would you describe it well the big main
new features how it looks they've added
some new things of course but it's
really a change in that old style and
like you said the scheme morphism where
things would maybe look like wood or you
know you pull out the compass and it
would actually look like a real couple
on ya for better for worse in some cases
it is a lot better and in some cases it
just doesn't work as well as your my
mom's gonna cope yeah there's there are
some very confusing things but for most
people when you open it up everything is
where it used to be everything still
works like it used to for the most part
and I think in a lot of ways they've
improved other things that used to be
kind of pain points things like
switching quick settings like Wi-Fi and
screen brightness those things are all
much easier to get to which is a good
sign so let's talk about the major
changes here what are the most
significant differences from the
previous iOS well the biggest one is a
new feature called control center and
this is basically just a quick toggle
the same thing that androids really had
for a long time that lets you just
quickly change a setting something like
turning your Wi-Fi on and off or
adjusting screen brightness those are
things you don't have to go sort of five
screens deep
used to really have to dig for it so now
it's much more much more present that's
one big one the second big new feature
is the Siri upgrade they've really
improved voices she's much more
efficient now as she's much more capable
I saw somebody using it and say it
brightened my screen and she actually
did what she was supposed to yeah it
definitely has more control over the
hardware you can adjust things like
screen brightness or turning bluetooth
off things like that but it's also more
of an app so if you look at something
like the movie now you can see the
trailer you can look at reviews you can
book showtimes all without leaving the
app it's pretty impressive same thing
goes for like web search results which
used to like kind of kick you out to
Safari so now it's a little bit less
disjointed also there's male and female
voices if you're into that and then
there's also iTunes radio yeah this is a
feature that you have to have itunes 7
but it's also rolling out to apple TV
and itunes and this is basically just
apples streaming music service right and
if you're familiar with something like
Pandora the idea is pretty similar you
just kind of have stations around
artists and you can listen to free with
ads or if you're a subscriber of itunes
match there's no ads okay um finally is
there anybody out there who should not
upgrade who should hold off on saying
yes to I was seven I think there's
always people my brother's one of them
he tends to use a lot of apps that are
very kind of maybe they don't get
upgraded or maybe they're very mission
critical for him and he found that they
didn't really work as well so I'm for
people like that if you really use your
phone all the time maybe just wait to
see if some of your apps that you're
using right now we're compatible before
you jump in so I actually do you have
one more question which devices is iOS 7
compatible with sure it works with the
iphone 4 or later with the ipad 2 or
later okay with the fifth-generation
iPad touch and there are some
differences in things you can run like
you'll need a newer Apple device if you
want to use this new airdrop file
sharing technology because that's that's
really just a hardware feature same
thing with this serie obviously it's not
gonna work on the ipad 2 or the iphone 4
okay all right so that's i was 7 for us
we are all gonna go play with it now
josh thanks so much my pleasure for
inside scoop I'm Sumi das thanks for
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
