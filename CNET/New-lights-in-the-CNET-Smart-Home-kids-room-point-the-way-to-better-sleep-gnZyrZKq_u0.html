you certainly can appreciate the value
of a good night's sleep but one of the
biggest disrupters to nighttime rest is
your child having to wake up and go to
the bathroom but can technology actually
help your child reach the bathroom
without having to interrupt you and your
night's rest we decided to add smarts to
the kids room at the cnet smart home to
find out
to help get your child to the bathroom
in the middle of the night the first
thing we needed to do was provide
adequate lighting specifically we remove
the standard ordinary bulbs out of the
light fixtures in the room and then we
replace them with smart bulbs that we
can control through the application to
get the lights to turn on when we wanted
them to we had to set up a trigger and
that trigger is a door sensor which is
mounted to the door and knows the state
of door if it's open or closed so when
the door opens in the middle of the
night the lights will turn on both
outside and inside the room for a night
light to help your child get out of the
bed and through the door without any
hassle we certainly did not want our
lights to come on when the door opens
anytime saying the day or in the
afternoon so we made sure to link all
the lights to operate like this only
when the smart home was in the night
mode we're not going to stop here with
the lights we're definitely planning to
add more features and capabilities to
the cnet's smart home kids room we want
to look into adding increased security
and better climate control that way
you'll have more ideas to add smarts to
your kids</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
