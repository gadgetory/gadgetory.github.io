PC that thinks in the living room
console this is the alienware alpha and
we first saw this earlier this year when
it was the ailing where steam machine
one of a whole batch of gaming pcs that
were going to run valves steamos and
come with a really unique steam
controller now that hosting platform has
been delayed until at least next year so
alienware took the small form-factor box
that they made that's very cool and they
decided to flip it now it's a Windows 8
machine that's going to ship with a
standard wireless Xbox 360 controller
thats still the PC standard and they're
going to include a 10-foot interface
kind of a custom interface that's going
to let you control the entire pc from
the gamepad you're not going to need a
keyboard and mouse they don't have that
interface ready to show yet but they do
have some games running on it component
wise is going to have an intel core i3
core i5 core i7 depending on what kind
of configuration you want and it's going
to have nvidia is a very power efficient
small maxwell graphics platform and that
lets you run you know games and pretty
good settings at 1080p which is what you
want bro hooking it up to your living
room pc and that's the idea here to get
a gaming pc that's it's easy to hook up
to your TV as a game console is and if
you start with the lower end specs it
starts at 549 even if you bump it all
the way up it's still going to be under
a thousand dollars under an akron at e3
2014 with the alienware alpha</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
