break down the biggest news across
movies TV shows and games this week Sony
announced the PS classic this is a funny
little PlayStation that has 20
pre-loaded ps1 games on it it'll set you
back 99 bucks and it drops in December
it joins the NES and Ness classics which
are also little versions of original
consoles many of us grew up with but if
you think this is an episode where I
sell you or don't on a PS classic think
again this is an episode about backwards
compatibility and why I think it's
fundamentally broken at least mostly now
before you get out your pitchforks and
torches come at me in the comments let's
talk about the pros and cons and some
possible solutions and then you can yell
at me all you want ok here are the pros
number one you have the ability to play
old games on new devices I love that
number two you get to introduce those
old games that you loved so much as a
kid to a new generation of gamers also
awesome and finally you're able to play
games you may have missed out on if you
didn't have the console or couldn't
afford it when you were younger with all
those good things though come some
not-so-great things which brings me to
my number one gripe about backwards
compatibility and playing old games on
new devices and that is you've got to
rebuy it every single time there's a new
generation of consoles you got to shell
out for the old games that you might
want to replay again oh so frustrating
on top of that a lot of people treat
these tiny cute little devices as a
gimmick and they might play it for a few
weekends and then get bored of it throw
it up on a shelf and then years later
re-gift it to a cousin who doesn't know
that it's not new now that might not be
you but you're an outlier I guarantee
you most people play it for a couple
hours and put it away part of that stems
from these compilations only having two
or three games you're actually going to
play all the way through which drops the
value of those devices or discs
significantly not to mention you have
all kinds of legal gray areas with
abandonware
licensing issues and all sorts of other
junk I mean I will probably never see
maniac mansion on anything like the NES
classic because of all of the legal
issues surrounding it
I think Disney still owns it because
they bought Lucasfilm and they owned
Lukis games and it's just a real mess
and I don't think it will ever be
untangled so you're always gonna be
disappointed at these compilations
because some of your favorites will be
missing and lastly some of these games
just plain don't hold up
have you actually played Super Mario
Kart on the senesce classic it's a
nightmare and don't even get me started
on the original PlayStation n64 era
where 3d cameras were awful look for me
I love these games I grew up playing
them they shaped me they changed me they
are part of who I am today I get it
sometimes I want to go back and relive
the nostalgia and remember what it was
like to be a kid again but I also have
no desire to breed chocobos for 20 hours
so that I can get knights of the round
and watch that summon animation one more
GD time I am interested in the Final
Fantasy 7 remake but who knows what's
happening there some of you might make
the argument that we like to go back and
relive things like books or movies and I
get that every time I see the fugitive
on television I stop and rewatch it I
love that movie I killed the VHS tape of
it when I was 10 but I also have a stack
of shame of lots of new games that I
haven't yet gotten through so to ask me
to go back and play games like Super
Mario RPG legend of the seven stars
that's a huge time commitment that I'm
wagering not a lot of gamers want to do
so what's the solution here I think I
have it most video game manufacturers
all three console ones as a matter of
fact have solutions here but I don't
think they go quite far enough
Sony Nintendo and Microsoft all now have
services that offer access to older
games for a monthly fee and that's great
they should absolutely do that I think a
Netflix like subscription model for
old-school games is absolutely the way
to go cost-wise Nintendo switch online
is less than 2 bucks a month
and unfortunately Xbox game paths and
PlayStation now are a little more
expensive at about 10 bucks a month ish
but I think there's a way for them to
fix that if they made their
subscriptions around say five dollars a
month but didn't give you access to
current gen games so PlayStation 3 and
prior
and Xbox 360 in Prior it feels like it
would be worth it both to customers who
want backwards-compatibility
but not necessarily need current gen
games on those consoles now there's also
a perfect storm in that we have these
huge libraries of old-school games and
we also carry around little pocket
computers console manufacturers give us
apps for our phones and tablets and then
sell us cute little Bluetooth
controllers for them
let us stream old-school games from our
phones and tablets to our televisions
even if we don't own a current gen
console that sucks that you have to buy
a current gen console to be able to
enjoy these old-school games and I can
bet dollars to donuts that there are a
lot of people out there who can't afford
to do that but would love to relive the
magic of all of the 8-bit and 16-bit
games that they played when they were
kids come on guys it's not that hard
all these classic devices are so cute
and adorable but they take up an HDMI
slot on my TV and they also can't add
more games unless you hack them which I
legally must say I don't recommend that
you do so stop hedging your bets
manufacturers get out there and make
backwards-compatibility the wonderful
thing that it's meant to be let it
recognize its full potential
okay so now you are allowed to go fight
me in the comments Sara 'ls you're gonna
fight me too
their kids a bit bite which Campobello a
man even when I killed and I thought I
killed actually that Nick here you got
are these massive fancy new games and
all these cool games and then you're
like now I'm going to play that really
crap mine that was playing five you
don't know all the things that's
happening rate lures or moneyness Ness
classics Ness classic PlayStation 1
classic Sega Megadrive CK Giga Drive so
you got whatever how many used in my
poster you've got I'm gonna go for a
Martelli be truthful look inside your
heart when is the last time you bought a
brand new console hook top tier brand
new sexy ass daily a name was like I'm
gonna play that's all crappy game never
you know it's through your nose to your
buyer you plug it and you play for five
minutes you're chucking the banner
you'll just like get on dust in your
garage you know I mean the wife with
your ones Marty's price
