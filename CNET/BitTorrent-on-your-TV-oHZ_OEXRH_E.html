tonight at pep calm at CES 2012 I'm
showing you BitTorrent on your hardware
devices it's kind of crazy but it's true
you can now get or soon you can get your
BitTorrent on devices like TVs set-top
boxes blu-ray players media players it's
really quite incredible as long as you
live in Europe or Asia these devices
won't be available in America any time
soon at least as far as we've been told
the kinds of devices that you can get
them on such as TVs allow you to stream
your BitTorrent content directly to the
TV but you can also use some of them as
torrent managers which is really
incredible for a very super large home
movie files photos even personal
documents you can share very easily back
and forth there's also a limited range
of free exclusive content such as TED
Talks Khan Academy independent movies
that filmmakers have made available for
free to to the public navigating
BitTorrent on your devices such as TVs
and blu-rays and set-top boxes and media
players is actually quite easy use a
standard remote control up-down
left-right use the okay button there are
three rows of channels presented you
have your personal channels you have
premium content which is all free
content that has been licensed from the
content owners and you've got an all
content where you can easily access your
most recent torrents the first OEM
hardware that will be available with
BitTorrent that has been BitTorrent
certified will be sometime in q1 so this
is gonna happen very quickly in 2012 for
C net at CES pep comm I am Seth
